00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
it really drives home this breaking of

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.069 
it really drives home this breaking of
the<00:00:39.600> bonds<00:00:40.350> between<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.579> mother<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.660> baby

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.660 

it's<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.530> would<00:00:46.649> Nate<00:00:46.829> Li<00:00:47.039> know<00:00:47.250> that

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
it's like you would Nate Li know that

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.810 
it's like you would Nate Li know that
this<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.629> not<00:00:48.899> right<00:00:49.340> otherwise<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.520> wouldn't

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
this is not right otherwise I wouldn't

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.209 
this is not right otherwise I wouldn't
feel<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.059> bad<00:00:51.210> about<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.780> wouldn't<00:00:52.199> feel<00:00:53.190> so

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
feel so bad about it I wouldn't feel so

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.580 
feel so bad about it I wouldn't feel so
sad

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.370 

I<00:00:57.180> can't<00:00:58.180> imagine<00:00:58.300> what<00:00:58.780> goes<00:00:58.930> through<00:00:58.990> their

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
I can't imagine what goes through their

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.340 
I can't imagine what goes through their
mind<00:00:59.820> you've<00:01:00.820> loved<00:01:01.240> this<00:01:01.510> animal<00:01:02.050> and<00:01:02.200> then

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
mind you've loved this animal and then

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.180 
mind you've loved this animal and then
you<00:01:02.530> sent<00:01:02.830> them<00:01:03.010> off<00:01:03.160> to<00:01:03.520> this<00:01:03.670> horrible<00:01:04.059> death

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
you sent them off to this horrible death

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.890 
you sent them off to this horrible death
it's<00:01:06.190> like<00:01:06.340> a<00:01:06.370> bit<00:01:06.670> of<00:01:06.700> her<00:01:06.940> soul<00:01:07.210> guys<00:01:07.540> every

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
it's like a bit of her soul guys every

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.320 
it's like a bit of her soul guys every
time<00:01:07.930> you<00:01:08.200> do<00:01:08.320> it<00:01:08.350> I<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.850> thought<00:01:10.270> that

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
time you do it I really thought that

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.920 
time you do it I really thought that
getting<00:01:10.810> a<00:01:10.900> badge<00:01:11.140> would<00:01:11.710> allow<00:01:12.400> me<00:01:12.670> to<00:01:12.700> do<00:01:13.240> so

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
getting a badge would allow me to do so

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.719 
getting a badge would allow me to do so
much<00:01:14.140> good<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:15.640> it's<00:01:16.600> very<00:01:16.869> hard<00:01:17.200> to<00:01:17.729> protect

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
much good but it's very hard to protect

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.310 
much good but it's very hard to protect
animals<00:01:19.090> that<00:01:19.570> people<00:01:20.020> view<00:01:20.470> as<00:01:20.910> commodities

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
animals that people view as commodities

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.070 
animals that people view as commodities

I<00:02:56.230> don't<00:02:57.230> think<00:02:57.290> it's<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.590> question<00:02:57.769> of<00:02:58.220> whether

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
I don't think it's a question of whether

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.119 
I don't think it's a question of whether
or<00:02:58.549> not<00:02:58.730> we're<00:02:59.239> greater<00:02:59.629> or<00:02:59.959> more<00:03:00.129> intelligent

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129
