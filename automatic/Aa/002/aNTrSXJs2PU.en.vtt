 ask questions and there are several 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.580
 categories of questions that can 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:11.020
 generally ask sellers races 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.349
 view technical issues technically 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:18.330
 questions this is what size 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:21.659
 where to put what distance

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:25.800
 just clarify what you need 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.840
 it doesn't sell you just for yourself 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.819
 determine what he needs and there are such 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:41.340
 the questions that are now sound again 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:43.080
 will be demonic questions have questions 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.620
 asking which client he starts himself 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.840
 sell yourself 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:51.719
 but then you need to ask them too competently and 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:54.800
 observe the measure so here is the question which 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:54.800
 works best
