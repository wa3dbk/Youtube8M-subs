00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.260 
chickens I use two large diced chicken
breasts<00:01:58.780> so<00:01:59.740> what<00:01:59.950> I'd<00:02:00.070> like<00:02:00.430> to<00:02:00.490> do<00:02:00.700> now<00:02:00.880> is<00:02:01.060> to

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
breasts so what I'd like to do now is to

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.359 
breasts so what I'd like to do now is to
turn<00:02:01.659> down<00:02:01.900> here<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.260> little<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:02.890> top<00:02:03.070> on<00:02:03.250> the

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
turn down here a little and top on the

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.060 
turn down here a little and top on the
lid<00:02:03.550> so<00:02:03.880> it<00:02:04.030> cooks<00:02:04.270> a<00:02:04.810> bit<00:02:05.140> more<00:02:05.290> slower<00:02:05.619> so<00:02:05.950> it

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
lid so it cooks a bit more slower so it

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.620 
lid so it cooks a bit more slower so it
doesn't<00:02:06.340> dry<00:02:06.520> out<00:02:06.550> so<00:02:06.940> quickly<00:02:07.210> because

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
doesn't dry out so quickly because

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.630 
doesn't dry out so quickly because
chicken<00:02:07.930> obviously<00:02:08.050> takes<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:08.800> is<00:02:09.160> so<00:02:09.399> quick

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
chicken obviously takes so is so quick

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.510 
chicken obviously takes so is so quick
to<00:02:09.789> cook<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:11.080> yeah<00:02:11.440> basically<00:02:11.680> just<00:02:12.220> pop<00:02:12.340> on

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
to cook so yeah basically just pop on

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.250 
to cook so yeah basically just pop on
the<00:02:12.640> lid<00:02:12.670> for<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:13.030> few<00:02:13.209> minutes<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:13.930> I've<00:02:14.080> taken

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
the lid for a few minutes so I've taken

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.900 
the lid for a few minutes so I've taken

off the lid as you can see the chicken

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.699 
off the lid as you can see the chicken
is<00:02:16.030> kind<00:02:16.270> of<00:02:16.360> getting<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.750> bit<00:02:16.900> more<00:02:17.080> cooked<00:02:17.380> I'm

coconut<00:02:47.650> milk<00:02:47.920> cream<00:02:48.610> coconut<00:02:48.880> would<00:02:49.239> be

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
coconut milk cream coconut would be

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.479 
coconut milk cream coconut would be
really<00:02:49.630> good<00:02:49.780> because<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:51.010> liquor<00:02:51.310> it's

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
really good because it liquor it's

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.890 
really good because it liquor it's
really<00:02:51.760> thick<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.239> it<00:02:52.330> comes<00:02:52.510> in<00:02:52.690> like<00:02:52.870> a

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
really thick and it comes in like a

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.940 
really thick and it comes in like a
smaller<00:02:53.459> tin<00:02:54.459> but<00:02:55.390> yeah<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:56.440> is<00:02:56.560> all<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.709> have

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
smaller tin but yeah this is all I have

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.800 
smaller tin but yeah this is all I have
coconut<00:02:57.340> milk<00:02:57.519> coconut<00:02:57.700> milk<00:02:58.030> is<00:02:58.120> fine<00:02:58.420> it's

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
coconut milk coconut milk is fine it's

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.690 
coconut milk coconut milk is fine it's
just<00:02:58.900> it's<00:02:59.530> less<00:02:59.709> wasteful<00:03:00.220> because<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.519> don't

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
just it's less wasteful because I don't

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.699 
just it's less wasteful because I don't
use<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:00.970> whole<00:03:01.000> can<00:03:01.480> I<00:03:01.780> basically<00:03:02.380> use

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
use the whole can I basically use

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.180 
use the whole can I basically use
probably<00:03:03.370> about<00:03:03.579> half<00:03:03.880> if<00:03:04.329> that<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:06.010> I'm<00:03:06.070> gonna

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
probably about half if that so I'm gonna

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.680 
probably about half if that so I'm gonna
add<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.549> in<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:07.030> then<00:03:07.150> I'm<00:03:07.239> gonna<00:03:07.420> give<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.630> a

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
add that in and then I'm gonna give it a

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.840 
add that in and then I'm gonna give it a
good<00:03:07.840> mix<00:03:08.079> again<00:03:09.070> I'm<00:03:09.220> gonna<00:03:09.370> pop<00:03:09.579> on<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.820> lid

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
and let it reduce down a bit so once

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.610 
and let it reduce down a bit so once
your<00:03:12.579> cone<00:03:12.790> has<00:03:13.000> reduced<00:03:13.390> down<00:03:13.660> after<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:14.350> good

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620
