00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello to all and we'll go 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.460
 today in this thirtieth match 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.670
 commented on a match that was 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.250
 really then I get access often 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.830
 you know it but this game is there 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.810
 really above all and we'll see 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.340
 how did we manage 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.720
 watch out because everything is happening 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.490
 during the first rounds and that's 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.189
 really horrible it was this contract because 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.050
 each game to play or not in a team 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.550
 who were green youth rather cool and 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.960
 against a team over use so a match 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.840
 over you pretty classic and we'll see 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.559
 immediately how this game has 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.010
 past attention it's going pretty fast 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.600
 the lead with my metalos by predicting 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.690
 its potting soil but I say cool 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.120
 I can mega evolved and kill him with 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.100
 so two butt elders 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.480
 so because I know I'm going beyond 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.570
 after the mecca evolution I tell myself too much 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.550
 although I have my steelworkers what is going to voi 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.500
 get rid of the terrarium against 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.920
 rock traps frankly with the mega 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.449
 evolution is downright super positive 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.500
 and I'm doing little trick and I 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.299
 miss my attack 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.830
 I do it again, because 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:14.820
 I'm faster than him and I miss 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:16.409
 my attack is here and so here is 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.939
 I missed two attacks it's not but 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.439
 it's good because you have to 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.420
 start the matches like that you 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.159
 see it's a good way to start 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.380
 so that's what I say to myself I'm 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.240
 say I'm going to place world and weather this 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.950
 because world liked terros is a 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.570
 pokemon anyway he's defensive 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.799
 it's one of the best Czech in the game 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.930
 tayrac are there that is 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.610
 does not understand much about the soul of 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.290
 rock and we do not take that much 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.079
 when we go except obviously canclaux this 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.579
 fight makes a critical hit 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.950
 actually that's the name of the show 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.720
 so suddenly and well a name of loved 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.450
 terros learned a lot of damage and there 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.950
 he balan me that cause then I 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.680
 thought that 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.189
 he went to do so cause where the soul 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.899
 of rock 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.009
 in any case I did earthquake because 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.149
 I want to get rid of this potting soil 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.649
 home man who has a body his belt 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.420
 force as you can see 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.560
 and suddenly it's extremely 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.479
 dangerous for the team and I say ok 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.400
 I do not have my rock traps 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.720
 all happily I can hold a blade 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.610
 rock quietly because he's 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.410
 intimidated and the second critical stroke 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.470
 abadie so life is really cool 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:24.930
 you here is basically my soul is to 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:29.130
 the bone and well put two miss is mounted 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.910
 rackers obviously has crisis in his 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.920
 phase so that's five rounds 4 4 times the 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.489
 axes of the blow there I have not much choice 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.160
 I have to put my soul back and it takes 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:45.299
 that I get to turn the traps of rocks 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.819
 if possible what there he just sent there 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.370
 not bad huh I'm defensive so I 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.079
 by definition the attacks 1 same 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:58.230
 if back hurts i want to answer the 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:59.970
 to hold another critical but we are 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.900
 good but it's good it's good 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.459
 well bravo bravo bravo bravo super aliou 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.540
 country 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.889
 short so suddenly and well now 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.350
 made another pokemon who died in 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.329
 my team on critt so I start 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.459
 to no longer have masses of options to 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.590
 1.6 to ioc which is completely manage 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.670
 normally by a voter and ben that's 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.690
 no problem now you're going to fuck 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:28.190
 file so that's it down there me what 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.600
 I do it I'm rowing like that 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.680
 it's in the process of licking but kind 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.290
 marc asselin files as they say I'm 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.099
 say if in any way whatever the 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.920
 seven of the cism I should be able to hold a 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.500
 little good with my motisma when suddenly 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.549
 it reveals the sting that is extremely 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.000
 threatening because ben that's it's the 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.940
 sting 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.860
 it is very bad and there he 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.900
 reveals that his 7.2 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.850
 mega shears ox and offensive so max 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.950
 speed because it exceeds it my 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.870
 motisma so that's good I could not 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.480
 really know it 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.650
 I have no choice but to replace the 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.740
 North East 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.440
 well I get all the shock so if 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.769
 I had the demos terros in good 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.560
 form as would have been the case if 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:21.269
 everything had gone well in the game 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.440
 it would be a little simpler because 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.280
 there I have to make switches 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.050
 in every way I have to leave 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.630
 to die pokemon in every way 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.810
 so that's the super so normally this 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.669
 trick should have been about 130 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.770
 points of life but there necessarily 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.120
 Well, he has three life points 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.580
 after the rock traps normally I 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.740
 would not have had the traps doha good this 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.000
 will we feel that I waited for 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.669
 comment on this match because this match 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.370
 made me so angry that I 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.840
 did not want to comment directly on 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.010
 hot like that because I knew that 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:56.070
 I was going to Benin and I feel I have 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.240
 sad reminiscences thankfully I 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.100
 do not miss my little ball that goes 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.510
 kill the cisa yacht but what does 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.120
 you want me to do at that point 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.150
 I am he has the pitfalls of rock I have not 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.040
 my rock traps 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.750
 he's just here finally he just has a 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.960
 paralyzed and everything is thankfully I the 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.310
 Exceeds that I thought not not not 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.900
 really exceed it and I flinch it 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.190
 hallelujah there is a justice in this 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.010
 good world in the absolute it's not going 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.840
 change a lot you'll see 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:28.320
 because even if they die 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:34.160
 he paralyzed my sweeper so me my 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:37.260
 my only chance was that it was 1,700 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:41.580
 For example, 100 kg clergue has invested 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.110
 pelota with finally here with thunder and 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.940
 all the way though it had been a 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.410
 tax that is mone with this is the version 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.660
 machination he would have exceeded at the base 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.750
 so anyway I was dead there 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.540
 I admit that it's a bit I try in 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.529
 done with or not to place me but you 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.929
 go see that the clever rabbit 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:00.219
 oh no no I think he did 

00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:02.499
 live and attack so here I kill the 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:04.029
 clever rabbit with fury of mention but 

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:05.769
 it remains to her that she waters so 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:09.249
 what do you do it against what 1 

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:10.839
 waters at this point I lost my 

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:14.319
 motisma he still has thirty points of 

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:18.399
 life it was long descent into hell 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:21.159
 so that's when I show you this 

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:24.969
 match for the following reason when you 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:27.999
 make access when you take a creep 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:31.359
 decisive think about field wrong think about 

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:33.729
 phil wave that saw him that at least 

00:06:31.359 --> 00:06:35.829
 as much as you and him it's live 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:39.339
 so you at least you can hide 

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:42.429
 your you can hide your your 

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:44.529
 suffering me it's front in front 

00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:46.419
 in front of hundreds of people that 

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:49.899
 happens that kind of thing it's 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:53.559
 extremely sad you know and yes and 

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:55.329
 so there he ends up with his said morey 

00:06:53.559 --> 00:07:00.399
 I had no choice no more no 

00:06:55.329 --> 00:07:04.779
 option and there I lost I lost 

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:06.939
 I caught the first six worst 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:08.399
 turn of my life I think a three shots 

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:12.729
 nice reviews 

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:14.769
 it was quite difficult but good life 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:17.349
 is beautiful it is not written 

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:20.049
 you know it well and then if the video 

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:22.419
 you liked it anyway and well you 

00:07:20.049 --> 00:07:24.789
 can commented ulrich and the video that 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:26.229
 always makes me happy and if you 

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:28.179
 want to see more of me 

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:29.439

00:07:28.179 --> 00:07:33.149
