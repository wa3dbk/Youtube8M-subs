00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
come across these sorts of crashes and

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.770 
come across these sorts of crashes and
stuff<00:02:57.769> at<00:02:57.950> least<00:02:58.160> yeah<00:02:58.940> as<00:02:59.359> fit<00:02:59.599> as<00:02:59.629> you

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
stuff at least yeah as fit as you

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.550 
stuff at least yeah as fit as you
possibly<00:03:00.140> can<00:03:00.379> to<00:03:00.590> try<00:03:00.799> and<00:03:00.829> prevent<00:03:01.579> injuries

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
possibly can to try and prevent injuries

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.229 
possibly can to try and prevent injuries
for<00:03:03.560> example<00:03:03.980> we<00:03:04.099> raced<00:03:04.310> in<00:03:04.519> Italy<00:03:04.849> and<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:05.090> was

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
for example we raced in Italy and it was

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.280 
for example we raced in Italy and it was
such<00:03:05.569> a<00:03:05.599> hard<00:03:05.959> pack<00:03:07.030> track<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.420> felt<00:03:09.019> like<00:03:09.170> it

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
such a hard pack track that felt like it

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.770 
such a hard pack track that felt like it
had<00:03:09.319> marbles<00:03:09.920> on<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.190> top<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.609> it<00:03:11.390> was<00:03:11.540> so

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
had marbles on the top and it was so

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.199 
had marbles on the top and it was so
difficult<00:03:12.109> to<00:03:12.500> ride<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:13.010> empty<00:03:13.549> it<00:03:13.790> really

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
difficult to ride and empty it really

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.539 
difficult to ride and empty it really
taught<00:03:14.660> me<00:03:14.720> through<00:03:15.079> it<00:03:15.200> I<00:03:15.290> I<00:03:15.530> wasn't<00:03:16.190> on<00:03:16.280> pace

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
taught me through it I I wasn't on pace

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.990 
taught me through it I I wasn't on pace
I<00:03:16.910> was<00:03:17.209> I<00:03:17.419> was<00:03:17.810> off<00:03:18.109> the<00:03:18.260> pace<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:18.889> I<00:03:19.370> was<00:03:19.910> able

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
I was I was off the pace and I was able

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.759 
I was I was off the pace and I was able
to<00:03:20.239> pull<00:03:20.419> myself<00:03:20.569> back<00:03:20.810> together<00:03:21.139> with<00:03:21.620> the

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
to pull myself back together with the

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.390 
to pull myself back together with the
help<00:03:21.980> of<00:03:22.099> him<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:23.109> come<00:03:24.109> out<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.620> claim<00:03:25.190> my

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
help of him and come out and claim my

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.150 
help of him and come out and claim my
seventh<00:03:25.790> in<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:25.940> last<00:03:26.419> Moto<00:03:26.690> which<00:03:27.079> that<00:03:27.919> was

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
seventh in the last Moto which that was

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.220 
seventh in the last Moto which that was
a<00:03:28.190> good<00:03:28.400> result<00:03:28.760> for<00:03:28.819> myself<00:03:29.299> just<00:03:29.750> because<00:03:29.930> I

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
a good result for myself just because I

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.710 
a good result for myself just because I
I<00:03:30.530> hadn't<00:03:31.310> written<00:03:31.819> a<00:03:31.940> surface<00:03:32.359> like<00:03:32.510> that

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
I hadn't written a surface like that

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.949 
I hadn't written a surface like that
before<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.530> it<00:03:34.280> was<00:03:34.310> truly<00:03:35.209> a<00:03:35.359> tough<00:03:35.660> day<00:03:35.900> for

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
before and it was truly a tough day for

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.960 
before and it was truly a tough day for
me<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:36.500> that's<00:03:37.459> something<00:03:37.790> that's

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
me so that's something that's

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.059 
me so that's something that's
disappointing<00:03:38.569> because<00:03:38.900> we<00:03:39.169> started<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:39.919> work

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
disappointing because we started to work

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.009 
disappointing because we started to work
so<00:03:40.370> well<00:03:40.609> together<00:03:40.819> and<00:03:41.299> everything<00:03:41.870> was

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
so well together and everything was

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.860 
so well together and everything was
starting<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:42.620> look<00:03:42.769> forward<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:43.870> for

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
starting to look forward and and for

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.750 
starting to look forward and and for
something<00:03:45.319> something<00:03:46.069> like<00:03:46.370> this<00:03:46.549> to<00:03:46.730> happen

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
something something like this to happen

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.190 
something something like this to happen
you<00:03:47.120> know<00:03:47.359> it's<00:03:47.620> so<00:03:48.620> disappointing<00:03:49.010> because

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
you know it's so disappointing because

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.370 
you know it's so disappointing because
you<00:03:51.200> know<00:03:51.380> you<00:03:51.859> push<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.340> envelope<00:03:52.609> at<00:03:53.380> races

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
you know you push the envelope at races

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.379 
you know you push the envelope at races
to<00:03:54.650> try<00:03:54.859> and<00:03:55.010> do<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.220> best<00:03:55.400> that<00:03:55.579> you<00:03:55.639> can<00:03:55.940> and

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
to try and do the best that you can and

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.140 
to try and do the best that you can and
you<00:03:56.480> might<00:03:57.319> take<00:03:57.620> those<00:03:57.859> split<00:03:58.310> second

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
you might take those split second

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.089 
you might take those split second
