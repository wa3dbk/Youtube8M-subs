zombies for you okay Paul equality
thrown<00:01:55.290> actually<00:01:56.119> easier<00:01:57.119> when<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:57.960> a

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
thrown actually easier when you have a

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.330 
thrown actually easier when you have a
thousand<00:01:58.350> points<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.649> go<00:01:58.799> ahead<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.219> grab

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
thousand points you go ahead and grab

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.690 
thousand points you go ahead and grab
the<00:01:59.430> pw2<00:02:00.119> if<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.360> want<00:02:01.310> right<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
then your claymores over here when you

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.250 
then your claymores over here when you
have<00:02:57.740> a<00:02:57.770> thousand<00:02:58.220> points<00:02:58.670> around<00:02:59.420> was<00:03:00.230> it

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
have a thousand points around was it

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.590 
have a thousand points around was it
around<00:03:00.530> six<00:03:00.920> when<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.220> crawlers<00:03:01.610> come<00:03:01.880> you

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
around six when the crawlers come you

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.900 
around six when the crawlers come you
will<00:03:02.780> have<00:03:02.930> like<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:03.830> trample<00:03:04.280> steam<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:04.790> then

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
will have like a trample steam and then

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.160 
will have like a trample steam and then
you<00:03:04.970> can<00:03:05.090> pick<00:03:05.210> up<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.450> claymores<00:03:05.840> over<00:03:05.990> there

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
you can pick up the claymores over there

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.810 
you can pick up the claymores over there
so<00:03:06.380> it's<00:03:06.500> really<00:03:06.770> easy<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.070> kill<00:03:07.370> instead<00:03:07.730> of

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
so it's really easy to kill instead of

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.300 
so it's really easy to kill instead of
just<00:03:07.970> like<00:03:08.120> with<00:03:08.600> your<00:03:08.750> knifes<00:03:08.990> at<00:03:09.620> around

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
just like with your knifes at around

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.920 
just like with your knifes at around
stakes<00:03:10.640> you<00:03:10.760> already<00:03:10.970> have<00:03:11.120> all<00:03:11.360> these<00:03:11.690> with

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
stakes you already have all these with

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.110 
stakes you already have all these with
you<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.380> then<00:03:12.709> you<00:03:12.800> even<00:03:12.950> have<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.220> PDW<00:03:13.790> so

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
you and then you even have the PDW so

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.760 
you and then you even have the PDW so
it's<00:03:14.360> really<00:03:14.600> really<00:03:14.780> helpful<00:03:15.020> so<00:03:15.440> I<00:03:15.620> think

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770
