00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.909
 on the right side he still finds a hole 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.379
 for a keycord and above find the 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:41.549
 volume buttons 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.309

 headset port and the on and off button on 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.120

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.600
 3.15 megapixel camera and below 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.949
 find another grid for the speaker 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.390
 who is behind it 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.000
 We make the phone calls as open 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.350
 through our nail it is the valve they 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.420
 you can remove the snips 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.920
 well the inside finds the battery here 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.860
 above we find the SIM card slot 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.900
 if we just remove the battery and then 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.710
 we find the micro sd behind the battery 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.510
 map slot we will see how the tipo 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.670
 works precisely for that will lure him 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.840
 we see the login screen here that we see 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.060
 can swipe to the left to the comrade 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.550
 start and really just lure it 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.040
 Well the device runs on Android 4 point 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.910
 0 well we see in the usual 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.790
 tabs 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.230
 we also see widgets that sony a lot 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.670
 his own songs with our supplies 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.290
 weather widget and maybe find here too 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.980
 another widget for quick settings 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.810
 can change 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.409
 well it all worked smoothly 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.720
 is then 800 mega processor in that 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.640
 realize it sometimes a bit heavier 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.440
 especially with somewhat heavier applications 100 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.560
 who has a bit more difficulty with that than 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.430
 open for the browser and we go to 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.320
 our website 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.450
 website because it also equals that 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.659
 keyboard reasonable year fairly small 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.159
 is of course because of the screen 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.360
 on the small side when they have since the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.070
 completeness compact 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.990
 so you have to watch them as well 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.180
 if you are a type then see the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.780
 website via wifi needs a moment to 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.280
 to load 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.019
 especially the pictures take a little longer 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.370
 but if you are loaded once seen 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.780
 well that it is all without problems 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.340
 works that can go through very easily 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.319
 scrolling we can also be very easy 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.459
 zoom in and also 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.109
 zoom out again that works without 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.670
 problems and above we also find 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.439
 different tabs so easy 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.810
 also open another tab 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.499
 then we go back what supplies sony 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.909
 all along 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.139
 now we see a number of applications as 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.209
 supplied as standard 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:34.109
 for example the xperia gallery 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.030
 Well here we are different 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.099
 synchronized albums 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.569
 we also see those from picasa albums 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.540
 be synchronized 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.069
 find who still needs email app that sees 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.129
 very clear and well-arranged 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.930
 open an e-mail for example 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.909
 we see this email from as you can 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.859
 of course remove by default and 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.669
 conditions or something similar is also possible 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.769
 multiple emails 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.969
 and then simply select it 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.620
 delete 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:00.329
 that works without problems have 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.840
 all the extensive options of a 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.879
 smartphone 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.340
 well what would of course also come with it 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:09.510
 a music sort of a coin player 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.590
 sky music on play ' are it 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.629
 do not turn down the volume 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.949
 according to you can just from the following number 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.299
 contains a number of songs as standard 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:17.129
 included 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.319
 we see that you can do it yourself 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.799
 manage the library 'you can also 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.479
 look up by album artist pull what 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.250
 we are actually used to player works 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:28.019
 simply intuitively easy a fine can 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.939
 actually make a playlist 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.229
 well just go back we go too 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:34.669
 let's see how 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:34.669
 Well a movie on it looks 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.349
 it is 320 screens at 480 resolution 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.329
 so the resolution yes is not super high 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.259
 his week also a small screen but we 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.519
 can always take a look at how one 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:47.150
 movie are out you can see the colors 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.150
 are displayed 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.090
 and what is striking is that the 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.220
 viewing angle is slightly worse than 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.299
 for example the larger models of 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.430
 sony 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.290
 see if we like and yes there look 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.590
 from more of the side look the anyway 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.790
 quickly gives color distortions 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.750
 but otherwise there Colored 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.750
 pretty good 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.470
 we now also take a look at the 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.750
 possibilities of the camera to beer 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.670
 camera application can be started 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.400
 make very simple photo here 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.950
 just press the photo button 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.480
 photos are made fairly quickly 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.600
 you can also continue on the screen 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.240
 choose focal point to tap and you can 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.919
 zoom through the volume buttons 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.510
 so through the of your group 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.970
 you do not zoom in digitally so optically 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.890
 so the image quality is going up 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.050
 backwards too docile here at the 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.930
 left can still modes without shoe 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.450
 Choose scenes and you can still find the 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.610
 adjust light values ​​if you click here 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.260
 additional options then you will also see the 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.150
 options that are more extensive 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.930
 that we find here and takes photos 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.840
 on 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.840
 yes 3.2 megapixels that is the camera 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.940
 the type does not have a flash 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.500
 for the camera 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.180
 and in addition, the 809 has 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.690
 single-core processor sometimes takes a while 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.690
 difficult 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.419
 it won't be a plus for everyone 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.370
 but the device is very compact and 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.660
 that is partly due to the small screen 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.520
 In addition, the memory can be expanded 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.380
 through the micro sd card slot 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.430
 and finally a device has one 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.430
 excellent value for money 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.750

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.120
