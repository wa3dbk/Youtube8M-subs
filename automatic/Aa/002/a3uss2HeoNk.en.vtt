00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.670
 take her to draw a penguin way 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.269
 cartoon 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.120
 so let's start with the horn that 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.910
 will have a particular shape that 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.990
 looked like a kind of araricau so I 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.279
 want to draw that right now 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.279
 so that's going to be this form 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.350
 that's just one thing when you 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.050
 arrive here you have anticipated you 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.120
 see why we left 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:52.190
 about 2 cm and continue drawing 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:54.900
 Normally that's it then we'll do 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.270
 interior contours 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.270
 so that will give that 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:12.070
 like this you're going the contour towards the 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:18.310
 down you will expand the space and you 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:23.380
 will continue especially that length of the 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:31.149
 body is here you're going to make a species 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:33.180
 of braces like this so when 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:37.030
 you did that we're going to do the beak 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:42.970
 many it's going to be around there you 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:50.140
 go do this little wave you 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:52.229
 do the same below and you 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.970
 go here to make a title is like that 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.390
 here 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:02.350
 then we'll do it but with a 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:08.610
 semicircle like these and we will do 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:14.590
 eyes so that will be two black circles 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:17.410
 in beak water like these and we're going 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:22.120
 to make the eyebrows just up that 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:25.680
 will be oriented like this then 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:32.019
 at the basin level we will come to do 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:36.220
 two arcs like these and we 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:39.040
 will continue with the browns from elsewhere 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:44.430
 when I told you to anticipate here 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.430
 it's to actually do the right arm 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:57.400
 like these and the other oriented towards 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:03:01.989
 europe like these see here and we 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:18.099
 will end with the paws on each 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:25.650
 side so here right and left we're going 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:30.689
 add a small relief like this here 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:34.420
 and to quote him as those see 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:37.859
 then you can add two 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:43.150
 little locks on the penguin's head 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:49.329
 and you can color the legs in 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:52.359
 yellow orange the bill in orange and the 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:54.879
 rest of the body in black that's for the 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:58.329
 legs it gives that for the beak and 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:00.489
 to finish in black so with the 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.440
 colors the output is a lot more 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.549
 pretty one 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.690
 so I urge you to 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:10.269
 coloring the penguin so the video 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.150
 coming to an end I hope she will 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.269
 will be pleased soon and especially good 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.269
 luck
