the<00:00:34.410> nutrients<00:00:34.950> are<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.640> organisms<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.390> so

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
the nutrients are the organisms and so

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.110 
the nutrients are the organisms and so

and you allow the system to kind of come
back<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.879> there<00:00:48.059> will<00:00:48.180> be<00:00:48.210> organisms<00:00:48.960> that

they do it differently obviously than a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.020 
they do it differently obviously than a
piece<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.750> metal<00:00:54.930> would<00:00:55.320> do<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:56.640> they<00:00:56.820> can

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
piece of metal would do it but they can

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.900 
piece of metal would do it but they can
be<00:00:57.180> very<00:00:57.329> effective<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.170> besides<00:00:59.010> loosening

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
be very effective and besides loosening

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.810 
be very effective and besides loosening
the<00:01:00.030> soil<00:01:00.239> or<00:01:00.600> making<00:01:00.930> burrows<00:01:01.399> they<00:01:02.399> do<00:01:02.460> some

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the soil or making burrows they do some

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.990 
the soil or making burrows they do some
of<00:01:02.850> these<00:01:03.059> other<00:01:03.120> things<00:01:03.570> like<00:01:03.979> convert

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
of these other things like convert

of these other things like convert
nutrients<00:01:06.000> ok<00:01:06.299> recycle<00:01:07.170> nutrients<00:01:08.150> have

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
nutrients ok recycle nutrients have

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.380 
nutrients ok recycle nutrients have
pathways<00:01:10.140> where<00:01:10.770> where<00:01:11.280> roots<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.880> grow<00:01:12.119> and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
pathways where where roots can grow and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.870 
pathways where where roots can grow and
then<00:01:12.479> those<00:01:12.659> pathways<00:01:12.960> stay<00:01:13.890> there<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.760> know

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
then those pathways stay there you know

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.820 
then those pathways stay there you know
if<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.840> think<00:01:15.990> about<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.259> tillage<00:01:16.680> implement

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
if you think about a tillage implement

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.270 
if you think about a tillage implement
any<00:01:17.340> root<00:01:18.299> Channel<00:01:18.840> from<00:01:19.020> last<00:01:19.290> year<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
any root Channel from last year in the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.030 
any root Channel from last year in the
topsoil<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.509> be<00:01:21.689> totally<00:01:22.530> broken<00:01:22.770> up

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
topsoil is going to be totally broken up

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.280 
topsoil is going to be totally broken up
by<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> tillage<00:01:23.880> implement<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.420> next<00:01:24.689> year<00:01:24.960> if

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
by a tillage implement the next year if

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.070 
by a tillage implement the next year if
you<00:01:25.380> have<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> nightcrawler<00:01:26.130> channel<00:01:26.670> or<00:01:27.450> even

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
you have a nightcrawler channel or even

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.359 
you have a nightcrawler channel or even
if<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> red<00:01:28.560> worm<00:01:28.740> Shanta<00:01:29.159> that's

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
if you have a red worm Shanta that's

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.789 
if you have a red worm Shanta that's
that's<00:01:29.970> part<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.780> red<00:01:30.930> worm<00:01:31.079> channel<00:01:31.380> it's

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
that's part of the red worm channel it's

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.280 
that's part of the red worm channel it's
it's<00:01:32.189> there<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.210> then<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.540> roots<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:34.049> follow

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
it's there and then the roots can follow

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.440 
it's there and then the roots can follow
that<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:35.909> channel

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that and so so you can have channel

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.840 
that and so so you can have channel
built<00:01:36.689> upon<00:01:37.259> channel<00:01:37.799> built<00:01:38.009> upon<00:01:38.340> channel

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
built upon channel built upon channel

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.789 
built upon channel built upon channel
and<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.630> nightcrawler<00:01:40.049> channel<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.710> know

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
and the nightcrawler channel you know

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.039 
and the nightcrawler channel you know
maybe<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.100> root<00:01:41.579> maybe<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.299> corn<00:01:42.540> root<00:01:42.720> maybe<00:01:42.930> a

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
maybe a root maybe a corn root maybe a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.569 
maybe a root maybe a corn root maybe a
cover<00:01:43.259> crop<00:01:43.439> root<00:01:43.710> will<00:01:43.890> go<00:01:44.040> down<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.490> and

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
cover crop root will go down that and

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.520 
cover crop root will go down that and
the<00:01:44.790> next<00:01:44.939> year<00:01:45.240> another<00:01:45.450> Nightcrawler<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
the next year another Nightcrawler and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.550 
the next year another Nightcrawler and
so<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.189> builds<00:01:47.399> upon<00:01:47.610> itself

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
so on so it builds upon itself

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.160 
so on so it builds upon itself
will<00:01:50.160> you<00:01:50.310> explain<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.850> us<00:01:51.120> why<00:01:51.510> organic

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
will you explain to us why organic

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.920 
will you explain to us why organic
method<00:01:52.590> new<00:01:52.710> club<00:01:52.950> process<00:01:53.370> pasta<00:01:54.180> because<00:01:54.630> of

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
method new club process pasta because of

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.440 
method new club process pasta because of
tillage<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.560> tillage<00:01:56.520> operation<00:01:57.150> does<00:01:57.420> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
tillage a tillage operation does a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.870 
tillage a tillage operation does a
couple<00:01:57.720> things<00:01:57.840> number<00:01:58.170> one<00:01:58.470> is<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:59.190> opens<00:01:59.640> up

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
couple things number one is it opens up

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.660 
couple things number one is it opens up
aggregates<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:01.020> were<00:02:01.530> otherwise<00:02:01.979> protected

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
aggregates that were otherwise protected

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.410 
aggregates that were otherwise protected
so<00:02:03.360> you're<00:02:03.630> opening<00:02:04.110> up<00:02:04.260> more<00:02:05.190> surfaces<00:02:06.030> for

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
that's protected and the bacteria that

so<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.430> tillage<00:02:35.760> actually<00:02:36.180> favours<00:02:36.810> then<00:02:37.050> say

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
so the tillage actually favours then say

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.470 
so the tillage actually favours then say
bacteria<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.489> would<00:02:38.730> live<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.300> that

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
bacteria that would live in that

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.630 
bacteria that would live in that
environment<00:02:39.840> yes<00:02:40.380> maybe<00:02:40.650> what<00:02:40.980> causes<00:02:41.340> the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
environment yes maybe what causes the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.820 
environment yes maybe what causes the
flesh<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.180> carbon<00:02:42.660> dioxide<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:43.350> nitrates

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
flesh of carbon dioxide and nitrates

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.199 
flesh of carbon dioxide and nitrates
into<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.250> soil<00:02:44.489> as<00:02:44.670> well<00:02:44.850> I<00:02:44.880> guess

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
into the soil as well I guess

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.300 
into the soil as well I guess
oh<00:02:45.390> yes<00:02:45.690> yes<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.170> flush<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.590> carbon<00:02:46.860> dioxide

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
oh yes yes the flush of carbon dioxide

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.420 
oh yes yes the flush of carbon dioxide
is<00:02:47.459> is<00:02:47.670> very<00:02:48.209> much<00:02:48.330> related<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.430> tillage

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
is is very much related to the tillage

00:02:50.430 --> 00:03:02.910 
is is very much related to the tillage
operation<00:02:51.000> right

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.290 

you

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300
