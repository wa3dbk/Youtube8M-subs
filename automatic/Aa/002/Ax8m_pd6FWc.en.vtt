00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
the remastered versions or the retros

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.320 
the remastered versions or the retros
aren't<00:00:11.519> supposed<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.820> be<00:00:11.910> coming<00:00:12.179> out<00:00:12.300> next

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.560 
aren't supposed to be coming out next
year<00:00:12.950> I'll<00:00:13.950> get<00:00:14.250> them<00:00:14.400> just<00:00:14.820> because<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.389> love

year I'll get them just because I love

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.420 
year I'll get them just because I love
the<00:00:15.719> shoe<00:00:15.900> but<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.379> think<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.740> one<00:00:17.250> thing<00:00:17.369> that

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
the shoe but I think that one thing that

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.240 
the shoe but I think that one thing that
slipped<00:00:17.880> with<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.660> retros<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.140> quality<00:00:19.619> as<00:00:19.830> is

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
slipped with the retros is quality as is

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.630 
slipped with the retros is quality as is
tremendously<00:00:20.910> slipped<00:00:22.039> like<00:00:23.039> I'm<00:00:23.279> seeing

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
tremendously slipped like I'm seeing

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.150 
tremendously slipped like I'm seeing
made<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.269> cracking<00:00:24.840> like<00:00:25.230> after<00:00:25.710> three<00:00:25.859> wares

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
made so cracking like after three wares

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.269 
made so cracking like after three wares
and<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:27.300> think<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:28.289> know<00:00:28.439> because<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
and I think that you know because the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.830 
and I think that you know because the
companies<00:00:29.670> have<00:00:29.820> realized<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.449> these<00:00:30.630> are

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
companies have realized that these are

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.080 
companies have realized that these are
no<00:00:30.929> longer<00:00:31.170> performing<00:00:31.710> shoes<00:00:31.920> they<00:00:32.730> cut<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
no longer performing shoes they cut a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.340 
no longer performing shoes they cut a
little<00:00:33.300> bit<00:00:33.420> corners<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.020> that's<00:00:34.230> why

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
little bit corners and that's why

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.250 
little bit corners and that's why
there's<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:34.680> much<00:00:34.800> work<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.370> these

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
there's so much work for these

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.690 
there's so much work for these
customizers<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.620> these<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.579> know<00:00:38.670> people

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
customizers and these you know people

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.910 
customizers and these you know people
that<00:00:39.030> repaint<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.500> know<00:00:40.620> cause<00:00:40.800> it's

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
that repaint and you know cause it's

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.049 
that repaint and you know cause it's
like<00:00:41.070> when<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.280> was<00:00:41.340> growin<00:00:41.610> ever<00:00:41.760> had<00:00:41.940> to

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
like when I was growin ever had to

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.270 
like when I was growin ever had to
repaint<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.540> shoe<00:00:42.719> she<00:00:43.170> was<00:00:43.320> busted<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.010> was<00:00:44.100> but

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
repaint a shoe she was busted it was but

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.400 
repaint a shoe she was busted it was but
but<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.670> never<00:00:44.969> seen<00:00:45.270> midsole<00:00:45.780> cracking<00:00:46.260> like

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
but I never seen midsole cracking like

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.830 
but I never seen midsole cracking like
it<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.739> right<00:00:46.980> now<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:47.879> midsole<00:00:48.270> cracking<00:00:48.719> is

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
it is right now like midsole cracking is

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.970 
it is right now like midsole cracking is
crazy<00:00:49.379> right<00:00:49.739> now

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
crazy right now

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.889 
crazy right now
and<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.550> think<00:00:50.760> they<00:00:50.850> they<00:00:50.879> dumbed<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.840> I

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
and I think they they dumbed it and I

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.290 
and I think they they dumbed it and I
told<00:00:52.020> my<00:00:52.170> aunt<00:00:52.260> brand-new<00:00:52.649> shoes<00:00:52.949> not<00:00:53.820> retro

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
told my aunt brand-new shoes not retro

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.610 
told my aunt brand-new shoes not retro
and<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.539> when<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.750> get<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.320> get<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
and so when you get you get the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.740 
and so when you get you get the
brand-new<00:00:56.370> retro<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.180> came<00:00:57.329> out<00:00:57.360> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
brand-new retro that just came out and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.240 
brand-new retro that just came out and
you<00:00:57.780> wear<00:00:58.289> them<00:00:58.410> tough<00:00:58.649> for<00:00:58.829> like<00:00:58.949> three<00:00:59.219> or

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
you wear them tough for like three or

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.950 
you wear them tough for like three or
four<00:00:59.340> times<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.969> you'll<00:01:00.390> see<00:01:00.539> some<00:01:00.719> cracking

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
four times and you'll see some cracking

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.399 
four times and you'll see some cracking
in<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.230> midsole<00:01:01.760> so<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.149> think<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:04.110> with

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
in the midsole so I think that with with

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.890 
in the midsole so I think that with with
with<00:01:04.739> them<00:01:04.920> knowing<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.939> kids<00:01:06.390> ain't<00:01:06.570> really

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
with them knowing that kids ain't really

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.330 
with them knowing that kids ain't really
playing<00:01:07.229> basketball<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.890> these<00:01:08.010> shoes<00:01:08.159> like

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
playing basketball in these shoes like

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.039 
playing basketball in these shoes like
they<00:01:08.520> were<00:01:08.970> meant<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.479> back<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.869> day

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
they were meant to be back in the day

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.440 
they were meant to be back in the day
they<00:01:10.590> kind<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.040> dumbing<00:01:11.850> down<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.240> some

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
they kind of like dumbing down on some

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.810 
they kind of like dumbing down on some
of<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> quality<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:14.040> see<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.430> they<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.700> see

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
of the quality you see that they you see

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.420 
of the quality you see that they you see
them<00:01:14.970> catch<00:01:15.650> should<00:01:16.650> take<00:01:16.860> shortcuts<00:01:17.130> in

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
them catch should take shortcuts in

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.090 
them catch should take shortcuts in
fabrication<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.990> upper<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.799> know<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
fabrication of the upper you know the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.530 
fabrication of the upper you know the
pebble<00:01:20.430> leather<00:01:20.549> don't<00:01:20.850> exist<00:01:21.180> them<00:01:21.360> while

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
pebble leather don't exist them while

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.179 
pebble leather don't exist them while
you<00:01:22.049> put<00:01:22.259> together<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.650> put<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.159> put
