that this cream in the drugstore is a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.260 
that this cream in the drugstore is a
little<00:01:28.380> bit<00:01:28.500> expensive<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.369> my<00:01:29.640> mom<00:01:29.880> has<00:01:29.909> also

bronzer it's very similar to I think

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.970 
bronzer it's very similar to I think
Laguna<00:01:58.160> it's<00:01:58.490> just<00:01:58.790> a<00:01:58.940> nice<00:01:59.480> matte<00:02:00.050> bronzer<00:02:00.380> no

Laguna it's just a nice matte bronzer no
shimmer<00:02:01.280> or<00:02:01.400> anything<00:02:01.940> so<00:02:02.120> it's<00:02:02.150> perfect<00:02:02.630> for

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
shimmer or anything so it's perfect for

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.420 
shimmer or anything so it's perfect for
contouring<00:02:03.320> and<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:03.680> think<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.010> looks<00:02:04.190> really

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
contouring and you think it looks really

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.820 
contouring and you think it looks really
good<00:02:04.670> on<00:02:04.880> all<00:02:04.940> skin<00:02:05.450> tones<00:02:05.690> it's<00:02:06.380> also<00:02:06.530> really

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
good on all skin tones it's also really

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.260 
good on all skin tones it's also really
pigmented<00:02:07.280> so<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.640> little<00:02:07.850> bit<00:02:07.970> goes<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.149> long

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
pigmented so a little bit goes a long

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
the past few weeks this is supposed to

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.960 
the past few weeks this is supposed to
be<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:27.020> moisturizing<00:02:27.650> exfoliating<00:02:28.489> scrub<00:02:28.790> and

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
be a moisturizing exfoliating scrub and

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.420 
be a moisturizing exfoliating scrub and
has<00:02:29.120> vitamin<00:02:29.300> b5<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.320> e<00:02:30.680> in<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:30.920> it's<00:02:31.190> supposed

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
has vitamin b5 and e in it it's supposed

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.820 
has vitamin b5 and e in it it's supposed
to<00:02:31.489> help<00:02:31.670> restore<00:02:31.940> soften<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:32.989> smoother<00:02:33.560> skin

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
to help restore soften and smoother skin

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.920 
to help restore soften and smoother skin
so<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.310> exfoliant<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.270> is<00:02:35.390> actually<00:02:35.570> rice

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
so the exfoliant and it is actually rice

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.479 
so the exfoliant and it is actually rice
granules<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.620> do<00:02:36.680> think<00:02:37.070> it<00:02:37.160> works<00:02:37.310> for

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
granules I do think it works for

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.890 
granules I do think it works for
sensitive<00:02:37.850> skin<00:02:37.910> because<00:02:38.390> it's<00:02:38.540> not<00:02:38.720> too

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
sensitive skin because it's not too

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.020 
sensitive skin because it's not too
harsh<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.560> noticed<00:02:40.070> a<00:02:40.280> difference<00:02:40.459> after<00:02:40.940> the

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030

this is the color endless blue and I

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.400 
this is the color endless blue and I
think<00:03:22.400> this<00:03:22.519> was<00:03:22.700> only<00:03:22.850> like<00:03:23.150> 2<00:03:23.510> 99<00:03:23.989> compared

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410

Essie<00:03:27.230> nail<00:03:27.260> polish<00:03:27.830> so<00:03:27.860> I<00:03:28.340> think<00:03:28.549> this<00:03:28.730> is<00:03:28.790> a

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
Essie nail polish so I think this is a

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.860 
don't even know if this qualifies as
indigo<00:04:06.400> but<00:04:06.670> it's<00:04:06.819> the<00:04:06.939> closest<00:04:07.389> thing<00:04:07.389> that<00:04:07.629> I

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
indigo but it's the closest thing that I

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.550 
indigo but it's the closest thing that I
have<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.680> indigo<00:04:09.519> so<00:04:10.000> this<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:11.079> a<00:04:11.530> little

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
have to indigo so this is a little

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.740 
have to indigo so this is a little
romper<00:04:12.370> that<00:04:12.549> I<00:04:12.579> have<00:04:12.819> from<00:04:13.239> urban<00:04:13.659> outfitters

romper that I have from urban outfitters
and<00:04:14.079> I<00:04:14.349> think<00:04:14.590> this<00:04:14.739> is<00:04:14.919> indigo<00:04:15.340> it's<00:04:15.489> kind<00:04:15.639> of

like<00:04:15.819> a<00:04:15.879> bluish<00:04:16.509> purplish<00:04:17.440> kind<00:04:17.799> of<00:04:17.919> color<00:04:18.190> and

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
like a bluish purplish kind of color and

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.729 
like a bluish purplish kind of color and
I<00:04:19.180> just<00:04:19.359> thought<00:04:19.419> this<00:04:19.630> was<00:04:19.840> really<00:04:20.139> cute<00:04:20.530> and

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
I just thought this was really cute and

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.230 
I just thought this was really cute and
I<00:04:20.829> haven't<00:04:21.160> had<00:04:21.220> a<00:04:21.280> chance<00:04:21.400> to<00:04:21.729> wear<00:04:22.030> it<00:04:22.150> yet

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
I haven't had a chance to wear it yet

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.460 
but they really like chiffon kind of
material<00:04:25.030> and<00:04:25.240> there's<00:04:25.539> like<00:04:25.720> this<00:04:26.050> really

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
material and there's like this really

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.070

cool<00:04:26.800> cutout<00:04:27.639> in<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:27.970> bag<00:04:28.270> but<00:04:28.720> I<00:04:28.870> just
