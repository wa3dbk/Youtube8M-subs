what<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.369> see<00:00:26.580> here<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.240> smoke<00:00:27.830> dots<00:00:28.830> here

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
what you see here is the smoke dots here

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.780 
what you see here is the smoke dots here
is<00:00:29.340> actually<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.279> nice<00:00:32.460> thing<00:00:32.489> is

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
is actually this and the nice thing is

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.950 
is actually this and the nice thing is
because<00:00:33.120> it's<00:00:33.420> working<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.899> acoustic<00:00:34.440> waves

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
because it's working on acoustic waves

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.750 
because it's working on acoustic waves
water<00:00:38.059> lotion<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.210> your<00:00:39.440> fingers<00:00:40.440> anything<00:00:41.100> it

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
water lotion on your fingers anything it

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.819 
water lotion on your fingers anything it
will<00:00:42.000> not<00:00:42.360> work<00:00:42.899> it's<00:00:43.200> actually<00:00:43.680> really

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
will not work it's actually really

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.799 
will not work it's actually really
better<00:00:44.219> if<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:45.059> see<00:00:45.239> things<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.570> don't

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
better if you can see things you don't

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.520 
better if you can see things you don't
actually<00:00:46.110> mention<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.430> manager

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
actually mention to the manager

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.459 
actually mention to the manager
how<00:00:49.860> long<00:00:50.070> does<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.340> process<00:00:51.469> it's

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
how long does that process it's

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.369 
how long does that process it's
immediately<00:00:52.920> receiver<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> minute<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.379> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
immediately receiver a minute that I the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.200 
immediately receiver a minute that I the
moment<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.829> put<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.190> here<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.820> will<00:00:56.969> show

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
moment that I put it here you will show

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.760 
moment that I put it here you will show
the<00:00:57.770> beer<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.079> tell<00:01:01.260> us<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.500> little<00:01:01.530> bit

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the beer so can you tell us a little bit

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.009 
the beer so can you tell us a little bit
of<00:01:01.949> how<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.460> being<00:01:02.640> stored<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.600> storing

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
of how it's being stored is it storing

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.950 
of how it's being stored is it storing
it<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> fingerprint<00:01:04.920> or<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.240> bits

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
it as a fingerprint or is it just bits

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.800 
it as a fingerprint or is it just bits
and<00:01:07.080> pieces<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.890> code<00:01:08.159> how<00:01:09.030> does<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.330> work

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
and pieces the code how does that work

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.500 
and pieces the code how does that work
so<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.159> obstruction<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:12.000> change<00:01:12.420> it

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
so the the obstruction and we change it

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.990 
so the the obstruction and we change it
to<00:01:12.689> Samos<00:01:12.930> binary<00:01:13.530> information<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.850> is

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
to Samos binary information and this is

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.760 
to Samos binary information and this is
stored<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.390> our<00:01:15.479> secure<00:01:15.900> MSM<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.619> know

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
stored in our secure MSM we know

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.929 
stored in our secure MSM we know
security<00:01:17.280> technology<00:01:17.909> where

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
security technology where

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:22.080 
security technology where
so<00:01:19.530> from<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.649> operating<00:01:21.009> system<00:01:21.159> it's<00:01:21.969> a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
so from the operating system it's a

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.450 
so from the operating system it's a
hardware<00:01:22.450> based<00:01:22.689> solution<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:23.920> is<00:01:24.189> running

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
hardware based solution that is running

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.489 
hardware based solution that is running
on<00:01:24.670> our<00:01:24.700> Snapdragon<00:01:25.450> chip<00:01:25.659> and<00:01:26.170> it<00:01:26.289> never

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:26.499 
on our Snapdragon chip and it never

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:28.139 
on our Snapdragon chip and it never
leaves<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.069> device<00:01:27.310> so<00:01:27.549> even<00:01:27.880> when<00:01:28.030> you

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
leaves the device so even when you

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.880 
leaves the device so even when you
attend<00:01:28.509> it<00:01:28.750> yourself<00:01:29.170> into<00:01:29.619> an<00:01:29.740> online

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
attend it yourself into an online

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.819 
attend it yourself into an online
services<00:01:30.609> the<00:01:31.329> image<00:01:31.990> your<00:01:32.259> biometric

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
services the image your biometric

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.590 
services the image your biometric
information<00:01:32.920> does<00:01:33.819> not<00:01:34.119> leave<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:35.229> device<00:01:36.600> so

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
information does not leave the device so

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.380 
information does not leave the device so
this<00:01:37.929> leads<00:01:38.259> us<00:01:38.409> to<00:01:38.439> another<00:01:39.090> level<00:01:40.090> so<00:01:40.329> you

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
this leads us to another level so you

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.230 
this leads us to another level so you
can<00:01:40.450> see<00:01:40.780> here<00:01:41.140> how<00:01:41.829> we<00:01:41.859> integrated<00:01:42.819> with<00:01:42.849> the

can see here how we integrated with the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.679 
can see here how we integrated with the

and<00:02:20.980> then<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.430> just<00:02:21.849> had<00:02:22.680> my<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:24.550> as<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:25.000> seems

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
and then I just had my and as it seems

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:38.740 
and then I just had my and as it seems
bad<00:02:25.599> over<00:02:26.140> here

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.580 

very<00:02:39.750> important<00:02:40.200> was<00:02:40.320> very<00:02:40.860> trying

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.680 

I<00:02:44.620> don't<00:02:45.280> have<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.489> slide<00:02:45.760> right<00:02:45.790> just<00:02:46.360> put<00:02:46.569> it

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
I don't have to slide right just put it

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.110 
I don't have to slide right just put it
on<00:02:46.780> just<00:02:47.140> all<00:02:47.800> right<00:02:47.920> any<00:02:48.160> part<00:02:48.489> of<00:02:48.580> my<00:02:48.700> finger
