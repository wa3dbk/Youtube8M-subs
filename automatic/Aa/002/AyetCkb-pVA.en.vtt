exactly sure how much we're not exactly
sure<00:01:34.530> how<00:01:34.950> effective<00:01:35.159> he'll<00:01:35.729> be<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.450> reports

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
sure how effective he'll be the reports

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.030 
sure how effective he'll be the reports
that<00:01:36.990> i've<00:01:37.079> been<00:01:37.200> reading<00:01:37.380> are<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> packers

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
that i've been reading are the packers

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.130 
that i've been reading are the packers
have<00:01:38.100> been<00:01:38.280> pretty<00:01:38.460> spirited<00:01:38.939> up<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.540> practice

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
have been pretty spirited up in practice

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.050 
have been pretty spirited up in practice
coming<00:01:40.380> off<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.710> loss<00:01:40.920> i<00:01:41.220> think<00:01:41.729> I'd<00:01:41.850> maybe

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
coming off the loss i think I'd maybe

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.880 
coming off the loss i think I'd maybe
lead<00:01:42.420> towards<00:01:42.780> green<00:01:42.990> bay<00:01:43.140> plus<00:01:43.470> two<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.860> a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
lead towards green bay plus two and a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.770 
lead towards green bay plus two and a
half<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.430> i<00:01:44.759> think<00:01:45.090> i'd<00:01:45.180> lean<00:01:45.360> towards<00:01:45.659> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
half and i think i'd lean towards the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.440 
half and i think i'd lean towards the
under<00:01:46.110> 41<00:01:46.950> but<00:01:47.250> you're<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> expert<00:01:48.119> here<00:01:48.210> Jody

what's<00:01:48.899> your<00:01:49.020> take<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.200> these<00:01:49.350> lines<00:01:49.560> no<00:01:50.399> we

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
what's your take on these lines no we

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.429 
what's your take on these lines no we
definitely<00:01:50.700> agree<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.930> under<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.290> looks

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
definitely agree on the under it looks

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.260 
definitely agree on the under it looks
like<00:01:52.590> Darren<00:01:52.890> Rogers<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.520> going<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.909> play<00:01:54.090> as

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
like Darren Rogers is going to play as

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.300 
like Darren Rogers is going to play as
well<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.750> wouldn't<00:01:55.110> expect<00:01:55.200> him<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:56.159> play

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
well but I wouldn't expect him to play

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.399 
well but I wouldn't expect him to play
very<00:01:56.670> long<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.030> had<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.240> realize<00:01:57.540> st.<00:01:57.960> Louis

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
very long you had to realize st. Louis

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.980 
very long you had to realize st. Louis
their<00:01:58.710> defensive<00:01:59.369> line<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.820> tremendous<00:02:00.540> there

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
their defensive line is tremendous there

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.780 
their defensive line is tremendous there
are<00:02:01.140> some<00:02:01.350> question<00:02:01.829> marks<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:02.280> Green<00:02:02.549> Bay's

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
are some question marks on Green Bay's

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.030 
are some question marks on Green Bay's
offensive<00:02:03.390> line<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:03.930> other<00:02:04.439> than<00:02:04.680> them<00:02:04.890> you

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
offensive line so other than them you

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.950 
offensive line so other than them you
know<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.369> Aaron<00:02:05.700> Rodgers<00:02:06.060> get<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> teeny<00:02:06.630> bit

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
know have Aaron Rodgers get a teeny bit

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.229 
know have Aaron Rodgers get a teeny bit
of<00:02:07.020> work<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.710> as<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.489> said<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.789> don't<00:02:08.910> want

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
of work and as I said you don't want

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.360 
of work and as I said you don't want
your<00:02:09.750> key<00:02:10.110> players<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.709> go<00:02:10.890> into<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.220> regular

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
your key players to go into the regular

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.910 
your key players to go into the regular
season<00:02:11.700> without<00:02:11.910> any<00:02:12.330> work<00:02:12.569> at<00:02:12.750> all

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
season without any work at all

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.949 
season without any work at all
so<00:02:13.099> I<00:02:13.130> think<00:02:13.220> Rogers<00:02:13.760> might<00:02:13.970> play<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.209> series<00:02:14.780> or

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
so I think Rogers might play a series or

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.480 
so I think Rogers might play a series or
two<00:02:15.140> but<00:02:15.349> i<00:02:15.410> wouldn't<00:02:15.709> expect<00:02:15.770> all<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.280> much

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
two but i wouldn't expect all that much

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.820 
two but i wouldn't expect all that much
and<00:02:16.790> keep<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.300> mind<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.750> packers<00:02:18.020> we

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
and keep in mind that the packers we

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.710 
and keep in mind that the packers we
think<00:02:19.069> of<00:02:19.130> them<00:02:19.280> as<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.430> spectacular<00:02:20.180> offense

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
think of them as a spectacular offense

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.530 
think of them as a spectacular offense
they<00:02:21.200> don't<00:02:21.440> really<00:02:21.830> have<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.459> ton<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:22.940> weapons

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
they don't really have a ton of weapons

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.839 
they don't really have a ton of weapons
like<00:02:23.840> they<00:02:24.050> used<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.590> mean<00:02:24.800> Randall<00:02:25.280> Cobb<00:02:25.520> is

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
like they used to I mean Randall Cobb is

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.750 
like they used to I mean Randall Cobb is
tremendous<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:26.989> Eddie<00:02:27.230> Lacy<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.860> course<00:02:28.190> but

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
tremendous and Eddie Lacy of course but

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.600 
tremendous and Eddie Lacy of course but
they're<00:02:29.569> just<00:02:29.870> not<00:02:30.140> that<00:02:30.170> deep<00:02:30.800> with<00:02:31.100> weapons

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
they're just not that deep with weapons

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.270 
they're just not that deep with weapons
in<00:02:32.090> addition<00:02:32.690> st.<00:02:32.959> Louis<00:02:33.319> is<00:02:33.440> going<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:33.890> much

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
in addition st. Louis is going to a much

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.180 
in addition st. Louis is going to a much
more<00:02:34.580> ball<00:02:35.000> control<00:02:35.540> offense<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.440> what's<00:02:37.010> our

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
more ball control offense and what's our

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.860 
more ball control offense and what's our
golden<00:02:37.520> rule<00:02:37.700> Peter<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:38.090> said<00:02:38.300> almost<00:02:38.480> all<00:02:38.750> the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
golden rule Peter I said almost all the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.300 
golden rule Peter I said almost all the
time<00:02:39.080> when<00:02:39.230> you're<00:02:39.290> handicapping<00:02:39.769> totals

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
time when you're handicapping totals

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.880 
time when you're handicapping totals
it's<00:02:40.489> a<00:02:40.580> lot<00:02:40.760> more<00:02:40.790> about<00:02:41.269> pace<00:02:41.930> than<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:42.769> is

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
it's a lot more about pace than it is

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.740 
it's a lot more about pace than it is
offensive<00:02:43.310> or<00:02:43.580> defensive<00:02:43.610> confidence<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.690> I

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
offensive or defensive confidence and I

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.680 
offensive or defensive confidence and I
look<00:02:44.989> for<00:02:45.230> that<00:02:45.440> st.<00:02:45.739> Louis<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:47.000> be<00:02:47.180> both<00:02:47.480> a

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
look for that st. Louis to be both a

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.570 
look for that st. Louis to be both a
run-oriented<00:02:48.500> team<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.310> defensive

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
run-oriented team and a defensive

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.090 
run-oriented team and a defensive
oriented<00:02:50.239> team<00:02:50.540> they're<00:02:51.230> going<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.799> do<00:02:51.950> it

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
oriented team they're going to do it

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.430 
oriented team they're going to do it
here<00:02:52.489> they're<00:02:52.910> going<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.360> establish<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.260> run

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
here they're going to establish the run

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.130 
here they're going to establish the run
as<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.459> said<00:02:55.760> on<00:02:56.060> one<00:02:56.269> of<00:02:56.390> our<00:02:56.480> other<00:02:56.630> videos<00:02:57.110> in

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
as I said on one of our other videos in

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.259 
as I said on one of our other videos in
the<00:02:57.530> preseason<00:02:57.950> I<00:02:58.250> don't<00:02:58.489> look<00:02:58.730> for<00:02:58.940> coaches

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
the preseason I don't look for coaches

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.360 
the preseason I don't look for coaches
to<00:02:59.299> try<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.660> exploit<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.230> new<00:03:00.769> rules<00:03:01.040> where

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
to try to exploit the new rules where

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.880 
to try to exploit the new rules where
they're<00:03:01.519> going<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.760> call<00:03:01.910> a<00:03:02.180> lot<00:03:02.690> more<00:03:02.959> of<00:03:03.290> the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
they're going to call a lot more of the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.220 
they're going to call a lot more of the
pass<00:03:04.370> interference<00:03:04.640> with<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.120> ball<00:03:05.299> in<00:03:06.170> the

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
pass interference with the ball in the

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.190 
pass interference with the ball in the
air<00:03:06.380> before<00:03:06.739> five<00:03:07.130> yards<00:03:07.580> etc<00:03:07.700> so<00:03:08.630> I<00:03:08.660> think<00:03:08.780> st.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
air before five yards etc so I think st.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.449 
air before five yards etc so I think st.
Louis<00:03:09.440> is<00:03:09.560> going<00:03:09.739> to<00:03:09.799> run<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.069> ball<00:03:10.190> a<00:03:10.250> lot

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280

you at all no not really I really I
don't<00:03:37.310> think<00:03:37.579> that<00:03:37.910> there<00:03:38.180> was<00:03:38.269> necessarily

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
don't think that there was necessarily

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.900 
don't think that there was necessarily
anything<00:03:39.140> to<00:03:39.470> jump<00:03:39.890> out<00:03:40.130> about<00:03:40.459> that<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.880> be

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
anything to jump out about that to be

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.759 
anything to jump out about that to be
honest<00:03:41.269> with<00:03:41.420> you<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:41.570> was<00:03:41.720> not<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:42.200> premium

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
honest with you it was not a premium

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.680 
honest with you it was not a premium
play<00:03:42.980> but<00:03:43.459> I've<00:03:43.549> always<00:03:43.730> said<00:03:44.030> that<00:03:44.090> losers

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
play but I've always said that losers

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.170 
play but I've always said that losers
where<00:03:45.410> squares<00:03:46.220> will<00:03:46.549> say<00:03:46.760> that<00:03:46.940> it's<00:03:47.090> an

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
where squares will say that it's an

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.750 
where squares will say that it's an
aberration<00:03:47.450> Johnny<00:03:48.170> bag<00:03:48.980> of<00:03:49.190> doughnuts<00:03:49.579> will

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
aberration Johnny bag of doughnuts will

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.550 
aberration Johnny bag of doughnuts will
but<00:03:50.329> reality<00:03:50.660> it's<00:03:51.049> a<00:03:51.140> learning<00:03:51.350> experience

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
but reality it's a learning experience

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.289 
but reality it's a learning experience
but<00:03:52.250> now<00:03:52.370> I<00:03:52.400> don't<00:03:52.640> think<00:03:52.820> there<00:03:52.910> was<00:03:52.970> anything

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
but now I don't think there was anything

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.210 
but now I don't think there was anything
that<00:03:53.450> really<00:03:53.690> jumped<00:03:54.140> out<00:03:54.260> at<00:03:54.320> me<00:03:54.470> is<00:03:54.620> an

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
that really jumped out at me is an

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.800 
that really jumped out at me is an
obvious<00:03:55.459> mistake<00:03:56.060> made<00:03:56.359> in<00:03:56.390> that<00:03:56.630> and

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
obvious mistake made in that and

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.870 
obvious mistake made in that and
especially<00:03:56.870> here<00:03:57.680> they<00:03:58.100> said<00:03:58.310> both<00:03:58.519> teams

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
especially here they said both teams

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.430 
especially here they said both teams
will<00:03:59.209> probably<00:03:59.690> be<00:03:59.810> pretty<00:03:59.959> conservative

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
will probably be pretty conservative

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.470 
will probably be pretty conservative
with<00:04:00.920> her<00:04:01.160> franchise<00:04:01.910> quarterbacks<00:04:02.359> well

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
with her franchise quarterbacks well

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.400 
with her franchise quarterbacks well
they're<00:04:02.600> not<00:04:02.630> Bradford's<00:04:03.079> actually<00:04:03.380> a

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
they're not Bradford's actually a

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.599 
they're not Bradford's actually a
franchise<00:04:03.859> quarterback<00:04:03.890> that's<00:04:04.430> another

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
franchise quarterback that's another

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.479 
franchise quarterback that's another
story<00:04:04.760> altogether<00:04:05.030> and<00:04:05.750> I<00:04:06.380> do<00:04:06.620> really<00:04:07.130> think

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
story altogether and I do really think

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:08.800 
story altogether and I do really think
that<00:04:07.640> st.<00:04:07.850> Louis<00:04:08.060> is<00:04:08.180> going<00:04:08.359> to<00:04:08.420> eat<00:04:08.569> up<00:04:08.600> the

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
that st. Louis is going to eat up the

that st. Louis is going to eat up the

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
clock and man they are so deep on the

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.059 
clock and man they are so deep on the
defensive<00:04:11.630> line<00:04:11.690> and<00:04:12.170> especially<00:04:12.500> with<00:04:12.829> green

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
defensive line and especially with green

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.520 
defensive line and especially with green
bay<00:04:13.280> so<00:04:13.910> so<00:04:14.150> on<00:04:14.269> the<00:04:14.359> offensive<00:04:14.900> line<00:04:14.930> no<00:04:15.260> need
