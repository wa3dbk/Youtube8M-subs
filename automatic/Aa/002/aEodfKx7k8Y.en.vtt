00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
this pawn on d5 and I think this was a

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.640 
this pawn on d5 and I think this was a
good<00:02:33.670> practical<00:02:34.239> decision<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:35.230> didn't<00:02:35.500> see

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
any force when he didn't see any force

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.199 
any force when he didn't see any force
way<00:02:37.569> to<00:02:37.629> check<00:02:38.409> my<00:02:38.560> whites<00:02:38.769> King<00:02:39.069> but<00:02:39.940> now<00:02:40.030> this

way to check my whites King but now this

Bishop<00:02:46.870> on<00:02:47.019> d5<00:02:47.440> i<00:02:47.470> think<00:02:47.890> is<00:02:48.099> stronger<00:02:48.579> than

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
Bishop on d5 i think is stronger than

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.300 
Bishop on d5 i think is stronger than
whites<00:02:48.970> bishop<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:50.379> reason<00:02:50.680> for<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:50.920> is

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
whites bishop and the reason for that is

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.879 
whites bishop and the reason for that is
it's<00:02:51.819> got<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.150> defender<00:02:52.780> on<00:02:52.930> e6<00:02:53.379> so<00:02:53.680> this

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
it's got a defender on e6 so this

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:57.119 
it's got a defender on e6 so this
outpost<00:02:54.310> on<00:02:54.519> d5<00:02:54.909> is<00:02:55.180> pretty<00:02:55.450> much<00:02:56.129> unbreakable

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
outpost on d5 is pretty much unbreakable

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.569 
outpost on d5 is pretty much unbreakable
and<00:02:57.310> untouchable<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:59.590> these<00:03:00.190> kinds<00:03:00.549> of

advantage now if I could just trade off

advantage now if I could just trade off
all<00:03:11.319> the<00:03:11.470> rooks<00:03:11.680> then<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.099> position<00:03:12.459> would

all the rooks then the position would

all the rooks then the position would
more<00:03:13.840> likely<00:03:13.870> than<00:03:14.290> not<00:03:14.349> be<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.069> draw<00:03:15.370> because

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
more likely than not be a draw because

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.400 
more likely than not be a draw because
black<00:03:15.940> just<00:03:16.239> wouldn't<00:03:16.810> be<00:03:16.930> able<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.139> win

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
black just wouldn't be able to win

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.960 
black just wouldn't be able to win
because<00:03:17.709> of<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:17.980> opposite<00:03:18.370> color<00:03:18.549> bishops

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970

more<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:50.680> more<00:03:50.739> place<00:03:51.220> so<00:03:51.519> if<00:03:51.579> our<00:03:51.699> black<00:03:51.970> has

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
more and more place so if our black has

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.960 
more and more place so if our black has
one<00:03:52.329> extra<00:03:52.660> pond<00:03:52.870> but<00:03:53.280> it's<00:03:54.280> not<00:03:54.519> so<00:03:54.730> relevant

one extra pond but it's not so relevant

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
because these pawns on g 7 h-7 are hard

00:03:58.329 --> 00:03:59.819 
because these pawns on g 7 h-7 are hard
to<00:03:58.449> push<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:58.989> it'll<00:03:59.109> be<00:03:59.230> really<00:03:59.440> hard<00:03:59.769> to

create<00:04:00.099> a<00:04:00.190> passed<00:04:00.459> pawn<00:04:00.609> it<00:04:00.879> just<00:04:01.060> takes<00:04:01.239> a<00:04:01.359> lot

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
create a passed pawn it just takes a lot

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.170 
create a passed pawn it just takes a lot
of<00:04:01.540> moves<00:04:02.280> what<00:04:03.280> black<00:04:03.459> is<00:04:03.669> likely<00:04:03.970> going<00:04:04.000> to

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
of moves what black is likely going to

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.819 
of moves what black is likely going to
do<00:04:04.299> is<00:04:04.419> just<00:04:04.449> try<00:04:04.659> to<00:04:04.780> activate<00:04:05.079> it<00:04:05.349> look<00:04:05.620> and

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
do is just try to activate it look and

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.430 
do is just try to activate it look and
try<00:04:05.980> to<00:04:06.069> get<00:04:06.280> counter<00:04:06.639> play<00:04:06.849> against<00:04:07.090> White's

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
try to get counter play against White's

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.750 
try to get counter play against White's
placement<00:04:08.440> of<00:04:08.470> their<00:04:08.680> pawns<00:04:08.949> because<00:04:09.340> olive

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
placement of their pawns because olive

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.030 
placement of their pawns because olive
whites<00:04:09.970> pawns<00:04:10.299> are<00:04:10.540> separated<00:04:11.169> and<00:04:11.319> quite

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
whites pawns are separated and quite

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.219 
whites pawns are separated and quite
weak<00:04:12.310> so<00:04:12.519> it'll<00:04:12.639> be<00:04:12.760> hard<00:04:12.970> for<00:04:13.030> y2<00:04:13.359> to<00:04:14.049> hold

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:14.229 
weak so it'll be hard for y2 to hold

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:16.349 
weak so it'll be hard for y2 to hold
them<00:04:14.409> especially<00:04:15.099> since<00:04:15.579> blacks<00:04:15.819> Bishop<00:04:16.239> is

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
and you know why it was forced to make

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.360 
and you know why it was forced to make
this<00:05:02.690> very<00:05:02.900> pass<00:05:03.229> some<00:05:03.470> of<00:05:03.590> Bishops<00:05:03.950> you<00:05:04.160> want

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
this very pass some of Bishops you want

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
to defend the a3 pawn now after rook g2

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.070 
to defend the a3 pawn now after rook g2
as<00:05:07.790> we<00:05:07.940> can<00:05:08.090> see<00:05:08.270> why<00:05:08.419> it's<00:05:08.540> business<00:05:08.870> just

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
as we can see why it's business just

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.379 
as we can see why it's business just
falling<00:05:09.380> apart<00:05:09.500> it's<00:05:10.460> very<00:05:10.639> hard<00:05:10.970> to<00:05:11.030> defend

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
falling apart it's very hard to defend

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.610 
falling apart it's very hard to defend
this<00:05:11.570> pawn<00:05:11.870> and<00:05:13.720> block<00:05:14.720> is<00:05:14.930> pretty<00:05:15.139> much<00:05:15.380> just

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
this pawn and block is pretty much just

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.950 
this pawn and block is pretty much just
winning<00:05:15.950> the<00:05:16.100> game<00:05:16.310> here<00:05:16.580> so<00:05:17.450> Ronan<00:05:17.660> play

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
winning the game here so Ronan play

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.560 
winning the game here so Ronan play
Bishop<00:05:18.169> f4<00:05:18.740> if<00:05:19.039> you<00:05:19.490> try<00:05:19.700> to<00:05:19.729> move<00:05:20.000> like<00:05:20.330> Rick

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
Bishop f4 if you try to move like Rick

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.960 
Bishop f4 if you try to move like Rick
d3<00:05:21.080> I<00:05:21.110> think<00:05:21.500> the<00:05:21.979> simplest<00:05:22.310> way<00:05:22.550> to<00:05:22.580> win<00:05:22.820> would

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
d3 I think the simplest way to win would

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.600 
d3 I think the simplest way to win would
just<00:05:23.180> be<00:05:23.330> virtually<00:05:23.690> one<00:05:23.870> check<00:05:24.169> King<00:05:24.800> d2<00:05:25.250> and

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
just be virtually one check King d2 and

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.900 
just be virtually one check King d2 and
rook<00:05:26.479> d1<00:05:26.780> check<00:05:27.080> and<00:05:27.410> why<00:05:28.039> it<00:05:28.100> loses<00:05:28.760> the

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
rook d1 check and why it loses the

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.610 
rook d1 check and why it loses the
bishop<00:05:31.479> so<00:05:32.479> instead<00:05:32.870> of<00:05:32.930> running<00:05:33.289> play<00:05:33.440> Bishop

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
bishop so instead of running play Bishop

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.820 
bishop so instead of running play Bishop
f4<00:05:34.190> and<00:05:34.490> now<00:05:34.850> Rick<00:05:35.090> g1<00:05:35.450> check<00:05:35.750> king<00:05:36.229> d<00:05:36.380> 2<00:05:36.590> and

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
f4 and now Rick g1 check king d 2 and

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.250 
f4 and now Rick g1 check king d 2 and
rook<00:05:37.610> a1<00:05:38.030> and<00:05:38.270> white<00:05:38.600> has<00:05:38.810> no<00:05:39.020> way<00:05:39.229> of
