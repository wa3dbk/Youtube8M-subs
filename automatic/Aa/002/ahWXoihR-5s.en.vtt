00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.420
 very good afternoon fanatics of the 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:06.099
 technology my name is andrÃ©s for 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.510
 florence in the mess I bring the super 

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:10.200
 protection that I bought for me 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.759
 playstation 4 then well let's go to it 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.589
 well the first thing we find is a 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.510
 protection rather for the controls 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.099
 although we have the joysticks but 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.710
 we have a problem that with the use 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.449
 continuous they wear out and they break and they 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.400
 They leave them at the edges thing to me 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.650
 I did not like it, which is why I searched 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.109
 in amazon and found therefore these that 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.939
 they call in toms sticks that basically their 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.980
 function is to protect the joysticks that 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.600
 it's a plastic that goes over and that 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.610
 not only protects them but gives us 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.770
 better grip and better precision put 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.540
 that raises them then good we see that 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.310
 the small package of various colors 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.170
 we have here they seem like gummies 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.610
 they look sweet then good 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.110
 basically as I only have two 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.150
 controls I will choose the ones that most 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.040
 like and I'm going to put them we see that 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.840
 has like that little dot that makes 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.360
 grip better we see that you have a 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.670
 slit in the middle of the tom stick that 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.230
 will help us to support the 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.090
 time to put our thumbs on them 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.590
 so good for installation is 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.719
 something very simple we simply have 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.880
 to grab it and turn it around as if 

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:10.060
 we wish we can take it out 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.560
 leave it upside down once you 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.049
 we have like that we simply have to 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.909
 stick it to the joystick and drop it and 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.860
 basically going to grab on the edges and 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.140
 we have to push a little accommodate and 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.210
 basically, it would be ready 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.950
 that is the first tom stick like we have 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.140
 to do that for the other lever what 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.880
 same for all the ready with that 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.710
 basically, we could already find 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.960
 protected our joystick so that 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.939
 with use they are no longer scratched or damaged 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.770
 so good they are super good and 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.149
 we do the same with my other control that 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.789
 It is the white color and I have decided 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.920
 put the white joysticks and what I 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.390
 I would recommend is to buy these toms ticks 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.950
 from the beginning so that we are not 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.140
 scratch and we are forced to 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.939
 buy them well the next thing we're going 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.119
 to find is the 2 proust that comes 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.560
 being a dust protector that is going 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.750
 to put on the sides and on the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.179
 entries of what is being, then, the 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.860
 usb if the cables already basically your 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.560
 function will be to protect those of the 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.479
 dust entry then they are like 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.520
 some sponges that go between a grid 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.470
 that fit perfectly into the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.269
 side fans we found 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.190
 that if in fact you have your play on 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.930
 and put your hand you will feel exit from 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.849
 air and on the other you will find 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.769
 the air intake stuff that then goes to 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.170
 work perfectly and we see if 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.180
 they come only in a super basic package 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.590
 I also remind you that all this 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.450
 I 'm going to leave them in the 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.459
 description of amazon I bought them by 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.930
 amazon in case someone is interested in 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.670
 acquire it yes the first thing that 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.889
 we find are the protectors of the 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.260
 usb is that we can basically insert 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:37.450
 then inside the entries we see that 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.790
 we have to accommodate as little as 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.799
 and so that they enter well but once 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.569
 let's have the trick then basically just 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.489
 we push it and we will have the usb 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.290
 we see there with the light how they reach 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.700
 see and the same will be with input 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.310
 auxiliary where would be the 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.750
 playstation camera and at the entrance of 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.519
 ethernet in case we have 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.620
 connected by wifi as our 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.689
 playstation and good we go with the light 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.299
 also how well they are and what remains 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:03.340
 super well at par for them to protect themselves 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.500
 the dust entries the next thing that 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.010
 we find are the teleras of two 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.109
 prof 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.000
 which basically they are being as a 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.010
 sponges passing perfectly 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.500
 air and that at the same time also 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.060
 happens the dust stays all in the 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.190
 grids that we can later extract 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.139
 clean and replace in the grid 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.740
 so good the only problem that 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.260
 I found 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.290
 of those from the middle parts does not come 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.240
 well fixed what it is being then the 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.040
 edges and we can fix that with a 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.620
 piece of black tape simply because 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.110
 we paste it and put some pressure 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.850
 so that it closes again well this is 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.680
 due to the construction of the plastic and 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.720
 which is a bit watery and like no 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.640
 achieves fixing well of the parts 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.440
 central but leave more we are not going to 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.570
 find any other problem in this 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.460
 product thing that after simply 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.350
 we have to push on the sides of the 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.380
 playstation according to the indications 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.600
 instructional and once we indicate 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.130
 that is inside the playstation 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.100
 these grids we see that almost does not 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.660
 they will notice they are going to be super light no 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.820
 they will change for the construction of 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.610
 playstation and we see that they barely reach 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.170
 to notice by putting a little light and this 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.180
 it's super good to protect it from 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.430
 the entrance of the powder so that it does not 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.960
 put our circuits then good 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.910
 The last thing we find is a 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.500
 fan in this case soil against 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.970
 the color black and we see that the box is 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.549
 a little damaged but they are the problem 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.560
 basically this fan I liked because 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.510
 the options that it offers us and because 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.130
 it's also usb that goes directly to 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.010
 playstation is not needed with him 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.020
 to light with some converter or anything and 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.510
 well it was basically why this 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.700
 fan I liked the only one but that 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.980
 should be and in the design regarding the 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.320
 I did not find the color white 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.330
 that my playstation is white and the 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.670
 fan is black but still so I 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.410
 liked because once I put it on I saw 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.020
 that does not look bad in fact it looks pretty 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.460
 well it combines quite well and we see that 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.650
 the best thing is that it is compatible with 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.840
 two own that protect from dust in the 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.850
 sides then was the basically what 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.430
 that I liked about this fan has a 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.440
 Pretty simple design that seems part 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.840
 of playstation 4 if we had color 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.060
 black we would see that it would look even better and 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.790
 it grabs well enough to not 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.500
 crumble or out of position is where and 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.720
 we are here we see in a better shot 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.700
 how it fits well in 2 prof 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.620
 and also the good thing is that we have modes 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.390
 so that our play station works 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.310
 better the turbo version is so that 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.930
 when we caught the button to the 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.760
 Fans work faster 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.200
 off of on we have several 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.120
 options with this fan that we 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.710
 they do configure it very well then 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.870
 basically the protection that I have 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.430
 decided to buy my playstation 4 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.230
 i also bought 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.760
 three-year warranty when 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.710
 buy in the store but it's been a 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.050
 issue aside then good is still 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.850
 basically everything about this video so 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.770
