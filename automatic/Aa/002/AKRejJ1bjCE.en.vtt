could<00:01:58.610> be<00:01:58.700> so<00:01:58.880> consistently<00:01:59.450> accurate<00:02:05.170> I

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
could be so consistently accurate I

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.169 
could be so consistently accurate I
think<00:02:06.650> he's<00:02:07.100> got<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.460> point<00:02:07.700> his<00:02:07.880> career

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
where you know every throw is very

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.070 
where you know every throw is very
important<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.030> him<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:11.300> he<00:02:11.420> feels<00:02:11.690> like<00:02:11.810> he

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
important to him and he feels like he
