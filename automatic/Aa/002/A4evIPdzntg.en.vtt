00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.340
 Hi, people have long wanted to 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:13.620
 get a tester of notebook matrices that is 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:19.320
 checks check matrices business book 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.449
 and slept on the same you on aliexpress there 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.260
 there will be some price 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.859
 bites he sat himself do not fuck 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.170
 It was 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:34.430
 I like one thought from difficult 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.550
 I was lying around the TV was lying now 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:42.149
 he was already a little girl 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.730
 That my client gave such a matrix there 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.170
 dock 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:53.129
 it all came up with him while it stands 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.120
 Notebook matrix took this one 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.609
 a board that is a thermo glue button 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:05.549
 planted hard enough on it 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.890
 svetodiodik which indication but shlyu 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.790
 secured 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:15.330
 which matrix goes so as not to 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.780
 not reliable and some wiring 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.759
 thin so that everything does not hang out 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:27.180
 me here and so it all glue poured on 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:31.610
 bottom and plastic gasket made 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.610
 so that you where to lay on the creation hit 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:42.330
 so we got a device 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:47.560
 famous minus this hell this glue 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:51.130
 I can tell you know I think 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.880
 what's important they don't often have to 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.880
 check 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:13.450
 now his usual scotch 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:13.450
 glue after all so fix 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:24.490
 Well, here's the power supply from it 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.490
 usually plug in 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:43.870
 here it shows we can even 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.870
 output that from the antenna 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:53.180
 to check on 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:57.010
 chromaticity excel and look at this 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.010
 matrix broken laptop hewlett-packard 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:05.020
 you can also take the entrance here we check 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:09.860
 its high resolution is 720p 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:14.959
 this idea came out of the TV trick I 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:17.030
 I think useful to the farm so if 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:23.170
 who has such a gimp can 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:26.209
 adapt and for such business 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:30.200
 the only problem is the loop 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:34.580
 I stuck it again, tore off the scotch 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.040
 you will be surprised to someone else 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.989
 also on the right to put the Malawi Freaky 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:46.040
 with warming up the backlight gets key 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:51.140
 that somehow it happened to me idleness 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:54.910
 I talk to the device, I ask everyone until 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.910
 new meetings subscribe to the channel
