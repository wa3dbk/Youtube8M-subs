00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
nexus one we'll have to see if that's

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.690 
nexus one we'll have to see if that's
always<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.619> case<00:01:55.829> when<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.100> load<00:01:56.250> other<00:01:56.490> web

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
always the case when we load other web

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.459 
always the case when we load other web
pages<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.509> course<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.840> nexus<00:01:58.140> one<00:01:58.320> does

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
pages and of course the nexus one does

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.219 
pages and of course the nexus one does
not<00:01:58.619> have<00:01:58.680> multitouch<00:01:59.430> but<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> hd2<00:02:00.719> does<00:02:00.990> so

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
not have multitouch but the hd2 does so

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.139 
not have multitouch but the hd2 does so
we<00:02:01.350> can<00:02:01.469> zoom<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:01.950> way<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.610> nexus<00:02:03.000> one

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
we can zoom in that way on the nexus one

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.300 
we can zoom in that way on the nexus one
you<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.450> double<00:02:03.719> tap<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.960> zoom<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.619> let's

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
you have to double tap to zoom in let's

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.920 
you have to double tap to zoom in let's
take<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> look<00:02:05.729> at<00:02:05.820> how<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.030> nexus<00:02:06.479> one<00:02:06.659> does

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
take a look at how the nexus one does

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.869 
take a look at how the nexus one does
with<00:02:07.140> resizing<00:02:07.829> columns<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.640> I'm<00:02:08.700> going<00:02:08.849> to

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
with resizing columns so I'm going to

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.699 
with resizing columns so I'm going to
try<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.060> bring<00:02:09.330> up<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.599> little<00:02:09.750> zoom<00:02:10.140> here<00:02:10.560> and

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
try to bring up the little zoom here and

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.890 
try to bring up the little zoom here and
zoom<00:02:11.580> all<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.849> way<00:02:11.940> out<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.599> will<00:02:12.720> do

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
zoom all the way out and I will do

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.059 
zoom all the way out and I will do
likewise<00:02:13.319> on<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.709> hd2<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.459> let's<00:02:15.060> zoom<00:02:15.510> into

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
likewise on the hd2 and let's zoom into

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.530 
likewise on the hd2 and let's zoom into
this<00:02:17.069> column<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.519> text<00:02:17.730> here<00:02:17.939> so<00:02:18.299> I'm<00:02:18.360> going<00:02:18.480> to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
this column of text here so I'm going to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.020 
this column of text here so I'm going to
double<00:02:18.750> tap<00:02:19.220> okay<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.310> wraps<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:20.670> nicely<00:02:20.849> and

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
double tap okay it wraps it nicely and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.539 
double tap okay it wraps it nicely and
double<00:02:21.689> tap<00:02:21.840> over<00:02:22.049> here<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.409> little<00:02:23.129> bit<00:02:23.310> slower

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
double tap over here a little bit slower

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.699 
double tap over here a little bit slower
let's<00:02:23.790> double<00:02:24.030> tap<00:02:24.180> again<00:02:24.299> and<00:02:24.629> it<00:02:25.200> zoomed<00:02:25.500> out

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
let's double tap again and it zoomed out

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.220 
let's double tap again and it zoomed out
not<00:02:26.010> quite<00:02:26.370> not<00:02:26.909> quite<00:02:26.970> correct<00:02:27.569> there<00:02:28.049> and

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
not quite not quite correct there and

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.720 
not quite not quite correct there and
we'll<00:02:28.799> have<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.040> try<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:29.280> with<00:02:29.549> other

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
we'll have to try this with other

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.619 
we'll have to try this with other
websites<00:02:30.209> too<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.599> see<00:02:30.780> if<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:31.230> works<00:02:32.629> let's

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
websites too to see if it works let's

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:34.910 
websites too to see if it works let's
zoom<00:02:33.810> all<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:33.989> way<00:02:34.079> out<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.379> check<00:02:34.590> screen

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
zoom all the way out and check screen

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.250 
zoom all the way out and check screen
rotation<00:02:35.310> speed<00:02:35.849> that's<00:02:36.420> always<00:02:36.780> important

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
rotation speed that's always important

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.660 
rotation speed that's always important
both<00:02:37.409> of<00:02:37.530> these<00:02:37.620> devices<00:02:37.859> obviously<00:02:38.459> have<00:02:38.579> an

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
both of these devices obviously have an

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.429 
both of these devices obviously have an
accelerometer<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.900> we're<00:02:40.019> going<00:02:40.079> to<00:02:40.200> try<00:02:40.349> to

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
accelerometer so we're going to try to

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:44.199 
accelerometer so we're going to try to
do<00:02:40.709> this<00:02:40.829> at<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.040> same<00:02:41.250> time<00:02:41.519> one<00:02:42.299> two<00:02:42.510> three

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
do this at the same time one two three

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.360 
do this at the same time one two three
so<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.329> hd2<00:02:45.780> was<00:02:45.959> slower<00:02:46.230> there<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:47.069> let's<00:02:47.220> do

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
so the hd2 was slower there and let's do

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.800 
so the hd2 was slower there and let's do
it<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.609> other<00:02:47.639> way<00:02:47.819> both<00:02:48.269> of<00:02:48.420> these<00:02:48.480> screens

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
it the other way both of these screens

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.920 
it the other way both of these screens
are<00:02:48.959> very<00:02:49.170> very<00:02:49.379> nice<00:02:49.530> by<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.769> way<00:02:49.859> and<00:02:50.099> the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
are very very nice by the way and the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.750 
are very very nice by the way and the
nexus<00:02:51.930> one<00:02:52.170> was<00:02:52.920> definitely<00:02:53.340> faster<00:02:53.519> though

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
nexus one was definitely faster though

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.250 
nexus one was definitely faster though
perhaps<00:02:53.909> I<00:02:54.120> didn't<00:02:54.329> turn<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.750> screen<00:02:55.019> enough

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
perhaps I didn't turn the screen enough

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.649 
perhaps I didn't turn the screen enough
on<00:02:55.409> the<00:02:55.769> hd2<00:02:56.000> let's<00:02:57.000> go<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.209> another<00:02:57.299> site

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
on the hd2 let's go to another site

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:04.250 
on the hd2 let's go to another site
let's<00:02:57.870> go<00:02:58.049> to<00:02:58.129> TechnoBuffalo<00:02:59.129> calm<00:02:59.549> now<00:03:03.260> all

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
let's go to TechnoBuffalo calm now all

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.780 
let's go to TechnoBuffalo calm now all
right<00:03:04.439> and<00:03:04.650> on<00:03:04.859> three<00:03:05.189> one<00:03:05.670> two<00:03:06.000> three<00:03:10.790> here

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
right and on three one two three here

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.920 
right and on three one two three here
they<00:03:11.879> go<00:03:12.620> nexus<00:03:13.620> one<00:03:13.799> is<00:03:13.920> off<00:03:14.069> to<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.310> fast<00:03:14.609> start

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
they go nexus one is off to a fast start

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.900 
they go nexus one is off to a fast start
hd2<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:15.959> not<00:03:16.139> too<00:03:16.319> far<00:03:16.500> behind<00:03:16.590> nexus<00:03:17.280> one<00:03:17.459> beat

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
hd2 is not too far behind nexus one beat

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:26.180 
hd2 is not too far behind nexus one beat
vhd<00:03:18.540> too<00:03:24.109> okay<00:03:25.109> so<00:03:25.169> that<00:03:25.440> time<00:03:25.650> was<00:03:25.769> about<00:03:25.949> five

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
vhd too okay so that time was about five

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.069 
vhd too okay so that time was about five
seconds<00:03:26.609> faster<00:03:27.000> not<00:03:27.180> as<00:03:27.389> slow<00:03:27.720> as<00:03:27.750> the

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
seconds faster not as slow as the

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.860 
wait for the hd2 to finish okay an hd2
finished<00:06:15.040> about<00:06:15.280> four<00:06:15.580> seconds<00:06:15.970> behind<00:06:16.150> so

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
finished about four seconds behind so

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.360 
finished about four seconds behind so
we've<00:06:17.020> got<00:06:17.200> both<00:06:17.350> devices<00:06:17.740> although<00:06:18.130> this

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
we've got both devices although this

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.880 
we've got both devices although this
starts<00:06:18.820> with<00:06:18.910> this<00:06:19.300> this<00:06:20.200> area<00:06:20.590> kind<00:06:20.830> of

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
starts with this this area kind of

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.830 
starts with this this area kind of
expanded<00:06:21.340> which<00:06:21.490> is<00:06:21.610> kind<00:06:21.790> of<00:06:21.850> strange<00:06:22.060> we<00:06:22.690> can

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
expanded which is kind of strange we can

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.330 
expanded which is kind of strange we can
flick<00:06:23.080> through<00:06:23.260> both<00:06:23.530> of<00:06:23.710> them<00:06:23.830> let's<00:06:24.070> see<00:06:24.220> how

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
flick through both of them let's see how

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.360 
flick through both of them let's see how
fast<00:06:24.610> they<00:06:24.850> scroll<00:06:25.120> down<00:06:25.380> pretty<00:06:26.380> smooth<00:06:26.680> both

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
fast they scroll down pretty smooth both

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.560 
fast they scroll down pretty smooth both
of<00:06:27.490> them<00:06:27.550> are<00:06:27.670> smooth<00:06:27.940> it<00:06:28.090> looks<00:06:28.240> like<00:06:28.390> the

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570 
of them are smooth it looks like the

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.540 
of them are smooth it looks like the
nexus<00:06:29.020> one<00:06:29.170> is<00:06:29.290> a<00:06:29.320> little<00:06:29.620> bit<00:06:29.770> more<00:06:30.340> movement

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
nexus one is a little bit more movement

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.880 
nexus one is a little bit more movement
when<00:06:30.940> you<00:06:31.060> flick<00:06:31.330> rather<00:06:31.630> than<00:06:31.840> the<00:06:32.020> hd2<00:06:32.590> and

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:32.890 
when you flick rather than the hd2 and

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.310 
when you flick rather than the hd2 and
that<00:06:33.370> may<00:06:33.760> be<00:06:33.820> good<00:06:34.240> or<00:06:34.420> bad<00:06:34.600> for<00:06:34.630> you<00:06:35.110> and

get<00:06:37.420> to<00:06:37.630> the<00:06:37.810> same<00:06:38.110> area<00:06:38.820> so<00:06:39.820> that<00:06:39.850> we<00:06:40.150> can<00:06:40.360> see

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
get to the same area so that we can see

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:49.050 
get to the same area so that we can see
the<00:06:40.870> same<00:06:41.080> place<00:06:47.460> okay<00:06:48.460> here<00:06:48.640> we<00:06:48.730> are<00:06:48.760> and

they're both very capable but it

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.790 
they're both very capable but it
definitely<00:07:43.210> looks<00:07:43.510> like<00:07:43.660> the<00:07:43.750> nexus<00:07:44.080> one<00:07:44.290> has

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 
definitely looks like the nexus one has

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.120 
definitely looks like the nexus one has
the<00:07:45.130> superior<00:07:45.460> web<00:07:45.820> experience<00:07:46.950> compared<00:07:47.950> to

the superior web experience compared to

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:53.100 
the superior web experience compared to
the<00:07:48.250> hd2<00:07:49.740> that's<00:07:50.740> it<00:07:50.860> for<00:07:51.010> now
