00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
yet you know I think the team at all

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.940 
yet you know I think the team at all
gallon<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.450> getting<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.930> grips<00:02:25.590> with<00:02:25.770> this

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
gallon and getting to grips with this

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.190 
gallon and getting to grips with this
new<00:02:26.520> system<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.060> 352<00:02:27.450> lot<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.900> managers

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
new system of the 352 lot of managers

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.250 
new system of the 352 lot of managers
decided<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.770> play<00:02:28.980> with<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.340> man<00:02:30.020> were<00:02:31.020> played

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
decided to play with and man were played

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.080 
decided to play with and man were played
good<00:02:31.440> football<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:31.860> lost<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.430> lost<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.670> key<00:02:32.940> in

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
good football I lost it lost the key in

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.210 
good football I lost it lost the key in
them<00:02:33.240> were<00:02:33.870> creating<00:02:34.260> chances<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.890> obviously

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
them were creating chances and obviously

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.090 
them were creating chances and obviously
with<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:36.230> more<00:02:37.230> games<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.590> play<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.920> field

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
with the more games you play the field

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.830 
with the more games you play the field
will<00:02:38.250> get<00:02:38.460> a<00:02:38.490> sharp<00:02:38.820> or<00:02:39.000> again<00:02:39.210> and<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.630> goals

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
will get a sharp or again and the goals

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.330 
will get a sharp or again and the goals
will<00:02:39.960> come<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.680> looks<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.920> me<00:02:41.010> like<00:02:41.100> you're

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
will come it looks to me like you're

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.760 
will come it looks to me like you're
dominating<00:02:41.520> possession<00:02:42.150> more<00:02:42.990> as<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.440> result

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
dominating possession more as a result

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.990 
dominating possession more as a result
of<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.920> change<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.430> true<00:02:44.670> yeah

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
of the change is that true yeah

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.310 
of the change is that true yeah
definitely<00:02:45.240> I<00:02:45.510> think<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.780> extra<00:02:45.960> man<00:02:46.200> in

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
definitely I think the extra man in

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.320 
definitely I think the extra man in
midfield<00:02:46.440> gives<00:02:46.920> more<00:02:47.640> control<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.180> game

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
midfield gives more control of the game

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.750 
midfield gives more control of the game
and<00:02:48.570> even<00:02:49.380> against<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.160> championship<00:02:50.610> team

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
and even against the championship team

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.670 
and even against the championship team
in<00:02:50.790> Birmingham<00:02:51.240> obviously<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.350> goals<00:02:52.530> we

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
in Birmingham obviously the goals we

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.320 
in Birmingham obviously the goals we
conceded<00:02:52.710> were<00:02:53.220> sloppy<00:02:53.400> but<00:02:53.730> in<00:02:53.910> terms<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.240> the

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
conceded were sloppy but in terms of the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.140 
conceded were sloppy but in terms of the
game<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.630> felt<00:02:54.900> we<00:02:55.020> I<00:02:55.910> complete<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.000> better

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
game I felt we I complete the better

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.470 
game I felt we I complete the better
team<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.490> now<00:02:59.490> it's<00:02:59.610> been<00:02:59.760> good<00:03:00.000> that's<00:03:00.360> in

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
team so and now it's been good that's in

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.550 
team so and now it's been good that's in
the<00:03:00.570> past<00:03:00.750> now<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:00.990> all<00:03:01.140> we<00:03:01.230> can<00:03:01.350> do<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.470> just

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
the past now and all we can do is just

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.320
