00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
the old natural route rather than the

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.839

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
know I don't know whether that puts you

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.340 
know I don't know whether that puts you
off<00:03:46.540> or<00:03:46.840> not<00:03:47.079> you<00:03:47.859> know<00:03:47.980> it<00:03:48.489> did<00:03:48.760> say<00:03:49.150> that<00:03:49.750> you

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
off or not you know it did say that you

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.080 
off or not you know it did say that you
know<00:03:50.380> when<00:03:50.650> it<00:03:50.799> when<00:03:51.310> it's<00:03:51.430> initially<00:03:51.910> applied

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
know when it when it's initially applied

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.870 
know when it when it's initially applied
there's<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:52.569> fairly<00:03:52.900> strong<00:03:53.109> smell<00:03:53.650> but<00:03:54.310> it

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
there's a fairly strong smell but it

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.270 
there's a fairly strong smell but it
only<00:03:55.000> lasts<00:03:55.540> for<00:03:55.599> a<00:03:56.230> couple<00:03:56.290> of<00:03:56.650> minutes<00:03:56.799> so<00:03:57.099> I

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
only lasts for a couple of minutes so I

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.550 
only lasts for a couple of minutes so I
guess<00:03:57.639> you<00:03:57.940> know<00:03:58.060> depends<00:03:58.540> on<00:03:58.660> on<00:03:59.230> your<00:03:59.410> sort

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
guess you know depends on on your sort

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.390 
guess you know depends on on your sort
of<00:03:59.650> tolerance<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.250> that<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:02.980> other<00:04:03.069> thing

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
of tolerance to that the the other thing

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.220 
of tolerance to that the the other thing

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
expect you would expect to get results

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.120 
expect you would expect to get results
within<00:04:11.230> 10<00:04:11.709> days<00:04:12.359> but<00:04:13.359> most<00:04:13.690> of<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.019> people

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
within 10 days but most of the people

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
you know reporting good results were

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.649 
you know reporting good results were
saying<00:04:19.650> that<00:04:19.859> it<00:04:19.979> took<00:04:20.280> more<00:04:20.789> like<00:04:21.150> three

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
saying that it took more like three

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.589

weeks or three or even four weeks before

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.439 
weeks or three or even four weeks before
they<00:04:24.750> saw<00:04:25.050> results<00:04:25.789> or<00:04:26.789> that<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.180> sort<00:04:27.360> of

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
they saw results or that the sort of

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.420 
they saw results or that the sort of
results<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:27.990> we<00:04:28.259> were<00:04:28.379> being<00:04:28.590> reported<00:04:29.159> so

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
results that we were being reported so

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.629 
results that we were being reported so
maybe<00:04:29.819> you<00:04:30.629> know<00:04:30.780> some<00:04:31.500> of<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.740> you<00:04:32.280> know<00:04:32.340> some

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
maybe you know some of the you know some

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.189 
maybe you know some of the you know some
of<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.789> things<00:04:32.969> they<00:04:33.120> say<00:04:33.330> on<00:04:33.479> the<00:04:33.509> websites<00:04:34.050> a

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
of the things they say on the websites a

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.770 
of the things they say on the websites a
little<00:04:34.469> bit<00:04:34.560> exaggerated<00:04:35.159> but<00:04:35.909> I<00:04:36.300> guess<00:04:36.750> you

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
little bit exaggerated but I guess you

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.740 
little bit exaggerated but I guess you
know<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.229> good<00:04:37.740> thing<00:04:38.009> is<00:04:38.039> that<00:04:38.219> at<00:04:39.090> least<00:04:39.270> you

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
know the good thing is that at least you

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.149 
know the good thing is that at least you
know<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:39.960> people<00:04:40.409> were<00:04:40.500> reporting<00:04:40.919> that<00:04:41.009> they

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:41.159 
know the people were reporting that they

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.719 
know the people were reporting that they
did<00:04:41.610> get<00:04:41.819> the<00:04:42.000> results<00:04:42.620> just<00:04:43.620> by<00:04:43.860> by

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
did get the results just by by

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.059 
did get the results just by by
persevering<00:04:45.539> if<00:04:45.689> you<00:04:45.900> like<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.919> other

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
persevering if you like the other

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.670 
persevering if you like the other
negative<00:04:47.520> is<00:04:47.789> that<00:04:48.300> is<00:04:49.050> that<00:04:49.110> people<00:04:49.590> were

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
negative is that is that people were

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.080 
negative is that is that people were
saying<00:04:49.889> it's<00:04:50.099> a<00:04:50.189> bit<00:04:50.310> on<00:04:50.400> the<00:04:50.490> expensive<00:04:50.699> side

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
saying it's a bit on the expensive side

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.800 
saying it's a bit on the expensive side
and<00:04:52.490> you<00:04:53.490> know<00:04:53.610> I've<00:04:54.229> found<00:04:55.229> a<00:04:56.240> website<00:04:57.240> here

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
and you know I've found a website here

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.080 
and you know I've found a website here
where<00:04:58.740> you<00:04:58.830> can<00:04:58.979> actually<00:04:59.159> get<00:04:59.370> a<00:04:59.430> free<00:04:59.729> trial

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
where you can actually get a free trial

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.360 
where you can actually get a free trial
so<00:05:00.389> you<00:05:00.449> know<00:05:00.750> maybe<00:05:00.960> that<00:05:01.199> helps<00:05:01.529> to<00:05:01.680> mitigate

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
so you know maybe that helps to mitigate

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.700 
so you know maybe that helps to mitigate
some<00:05:02.879> of<00:05:02.909> that<00:05:03.210> and<00:05:03.479> I<00:05:03.930> guess<00:05:04.169> you<00:05:04.409> know<00:05:04.529> they

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
some of that and I guess you know they

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.100 
some of that and I guess you know they
may<00:05:04.919> be<00:05:05.099> realistic<00:05:05.490> you<00:05:05.909> also<00:05:06.509> got<00:05:06.629> to<00:05:06.659> compare

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
may be realistic you also got to compare

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.010 
may be realistic you also got to compare
the<00:05:07.259> options<00:05:07.680> you<00:05:07.800> you<00:05:08.250> know<00:05:08.370> compare<00:05:09.020> going

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
the options you you know compare going

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.619 
the options you you know compare going
down<00:05:10.229> the<00:05:10.439> route<00:05:10.620> of<00:05:11.000> injections<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.330> and

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:12.629 
down the route of injections and and

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:15.920 
down the route of injections and and
that<00:05:12.779> and<00:05:12.990> I'm<00:05:13.590> sure<00:05:13.889> that<00:05:14.330> you<00:05:15.330> know<00:05:15.419> it<00:05:15.599> still

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
that and I'm sure that you know it still

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.529 
that and I'm sure that you know it still
