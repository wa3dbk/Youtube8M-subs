can pull off the important part is that

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.219 
can pull off the important part is that
a<00:01:36.350> mid<00:01:36.680> mid<00:01:37.100> combat<00:01:37.550> you<00:01:37.910> react<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.690> what<00:01:39.200> you

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
a mid mid combat you react to what you

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.230 
a mid mid combat you react to what you
have<00:01:39.410> on<00:01:39.440> cooldown<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:40.369> use<00:01:40.700> your<00:01:40.850> abilities

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
have on cooldown and use your abilities

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.859 
have on cooldown and use your abilities
accordingly

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
accordingly

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.670 
accordingly
for<00:01:42.560> example<00:01:42.979> this<00:01:43.640> if<00:01:44.479> I<00:01:44.630> had<00:01:44.810> Phoenix<00:01:45.500> and

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
for example this if I had Phoenix and

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.930 
for example this if I had Phoenix and
fire<00:01:45.860> grab<00:01:46.100> on<00:01:46.520> cooldown<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:47.380> whoops<00:01:48.380> I

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
fire grab on cooldown I whoops I

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.790 
fire grab on cooldown I whoops I
wouldn't<00:01:49.940> be<00:01:50.000> able<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.420> lightning<00:01:51.290> flash<00:01:51.530> and

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
wouldn't be able to lightning flash and

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.460 
wouldn't be able to lightning flash and
use<00:01:52.220> either<00:01:52.430> of<00:01:52.550> these<00:01:52.729> onto<00:01:53.330> this<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:54.229> finish

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
use either of these onto this to finish

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.840 
use either of these onto this to finish
them<00:01:54.590> off<00:01:54.650> so<00:01:54.920> I<00:01:54.950> have<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:55.310> use<00:01:55.430> ring<00:01:55.580> a<00:01:55.670> fire

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
them off so I have to use ring a fire

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.570 
them off so I have to use ring a fire
ring<00:01:56.600> a<00:01:56.660> fire<00:01:56.810> has<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.020> really<00:01:57.530> short<00:01:57.710> cast<00:01:58.399> time

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
ring a fire has a really short cast time

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.100 
ring a fire has a really short cast time
so<00:01:58.729> you<00:01:58.790> have<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:58.970> be<00:01:59.060> really<00:01:59.690> quick<00:01:59.899> with<00:02:00.080> it

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
so you have to be really quick with it

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.910 
so you have to be really quick with it
like<00:02:00.710> that

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
like that

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.090 
like that
but<00:02:01.820> that's<00:02:02.450> that's<00:02:03.050> what<00:02:03.229> you<00:02:03.320> should<00:02:03.470> do<00:02:03.619> to

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
but that's that's what you should do to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.400 
but that's that's what you should do to
finish<00:02:04.250> off<00:02:04.520> something<00:02:05.479> that's<00:02:06.020> like<00:02:06.200> low

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
finish off something that's like low

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.540 
finish off something that's like low
unhealthy<00:02:06.800> no<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:07.040> you<00:02:07.100> have<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:07.280> finish<00:02:07.399> it

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
unhealthy no and you have to finish it

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.859 
unhealthy no and you have to finish it
off<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:07.850> you<00:02:07.940> don't<00:02:07.970> have<00:02:08.240> Phoenix<00:02:08.630> or<00:02:08.720> fire

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
off and you don't have Phoenix or fire

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.930 
off and you don't have Phoenix or fire
grab<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:09.380> you<00:02:10.100> have<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.429> use<00:02:10.550> ring<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.789> fire

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
grab so you have to use ring a fire

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.420 
grab so you have to use ring a fire
lightning<00:02:11.270> flash<00:02:11.450> that's<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.960> kind<00:02:12.110> of<00:02:12.170> stuff

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
lightning flash that's the kind of stuff

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.130 
lightning flash that's the kind of stuff
you<00:02:13.430> should<00:02:13.460> be<00:02:13.730> doing<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.860> say<00:02:16.280> like
