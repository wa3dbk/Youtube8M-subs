00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
to be fair in that time I could have

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.660 
to be fair in that time I could have
gone<00:04:00.670> off<00:04:00.820> and<00:04:00.850> done<00:04:01.150> some<00:04:01.860> fire<00:04:02.860> making<00:04:03.400> or

then I could have made 50k in maybe two

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.940 
then I could have made 50k in maybe two

though<00:06:34.510> so<00:06:34.780> don't<00:06:34.840> know<00:06:34.990> how<00:06:35.140> much<00:06:35.229> I've<00:06:35.440> been

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
though so don't know how much I've been

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:44.360 
though so don't know how much I've been
making<00:06:35.979> 5<00:06:36.820> 13<00:06:37.419> k

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:50.060 

let's<00:06:45.370> say<00:06:45.460> 5<00:06:45.700> 1<00:06:45.880> 307<00:06:46.630> 1<00:06:46.750> 30<00:06:47.260> anyway<00:06:48.190> and<00:06:48.430> then

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 
let's say 5 1 307 1 30 anyway and then

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.710 
let's say 5 1 307 1 30 anyway and then
7005<00:06:52.410> so<00:06:53.410> that<00:06:53.530> means<00:06:53.740> infinity<00:06:54.490> boots<00:06:54.730> a<00:06:55.000> 13<00:06:55.420> k

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
7005 so that means infinity boots a 13 k

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.260 
7005 so that means infinity boots a 13 k
