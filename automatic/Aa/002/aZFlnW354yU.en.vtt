00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello welcome to this new video 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.740
 today it's about beat the tim four 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.740
 games 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.600
 sophia today's games at 14 jazz beat 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.280
 the readers maybe already known 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.710
 is about me making a few records 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.030
 give a few times and you have to 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.950
 beat them 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.449
 Everyone's keen these times too 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.140
 hit the comes in such a big one 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.300
 free 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.699
 and then there is a game or 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.650
 Any necessary value of up to 25 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.750
 You can choose this euro 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.890
 Either I buy it and send it 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.320
 you then you get a fan 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.120
 card so also an autograph card or 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.040
 you buy something from me about me 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.699
 then over Steam Amazon whatever 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.260
 main thing is somehow necessary yes me 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.850
 First, the four games before the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.650
 it is now before I take a closer look 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.510
 describe how to share and how that works 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.940
 It's all going to happen, and that's what it's all about 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.590
 once at mario kart eight course 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.580
 this game will probably more often 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.900
 happen because that's easy 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.260
 predestined for that is about the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.909
 route was ios departure this track where 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.110
 it just goes down the great way 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.880
 on the track is that you just not 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.860
 in the circle but that drives practically the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.260
 distributed three rounds on this route 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.570
 are I blind now here once mine 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.890
 time I have so far you have her 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.420
 can with these records but now 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.500
 already bear in mind that I will guarantee 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.480
 even better 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.130
 i'm a little bit at mario kart 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.480
 I have become better anyway 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.070
 pretty sure that me at mario kart 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.330
 will beat quite a lot again 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.920
 but as I said that is now only 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.410
 The first time I have the last days 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.670
 played a bit but I will 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.670
 keep repeating these times 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.490
 update so then we have great 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.960
 smash brothers for the wii u and that 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.190
 So we have these three minutes 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.660
 You'll have to complete the sketch in three minutes 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.180
 as much as possible of these serious ones 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.950
 opponents outside was raushauen 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.070
 Here, too, I now blind mine 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.330
 current record 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.489
 And this is guaranteed 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.619
 somehow have to be improved 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.450
 we are the legend of zelda wind waker me 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.519
 It does not matter if you 're the hd-remake 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.840
 used or the original and indeed goes 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:20.550
 sink it around the ships 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.950
 in the wallet in the yes mine 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.110
 court of frankly quite 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.610
 well, i 'm actually good with 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.250
 Eleven hits made that means you 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.080
 in fact only two 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.090
 have hits and / or if you like me 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.350
 you want to beat then you have to 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.760
 In fact, then you are only allowed one 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.590
 I have only one hit 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.970
 curious if people do that if 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.950
 maybe even people can handle it 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.050
 sinking a ship with every hit 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.500
 anyway I was really lucky and 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.470
 help already from it number I must be 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.510
 then we have cord 2 and that is it 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.420
 in the section, see you again 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.600
 Of course, the whole thing was played on time 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.430
 This is called 3 July this section 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.670
 I've played here too blind 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.310
 I now my current time even a 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.840
 and yes these are my four records 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.760
 which I have so far as we said 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.260
 do that in this video 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.080
 description of this video 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.670
 there are always my current records 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.580
 there are now if this video 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.140
 then the records were uploaded 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.660
 which now for you too 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.730
 have superimposed in the course of the next 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.170
 Months I'll keep those records 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.550
 improve and then always stand in 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.090
 this video interview description 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.230
 my current records are the same 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.670
 but in this video 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.040
 as soon as the first consignments arrive 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.720
 also the best times of 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.730
 those who participated 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.019
 I do not want that with a bit 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.900
 emphasize that there is not only the 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.030
 main price of 25 euro but the four 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.650
 so the best ones in each case 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.299
 the best goods were from the game 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.440
 sent me a chalkboard chocolate 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.630
 with an autograph card 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.310
 as a little recognition and you will 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.989
 course in the solution video of shock 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.760
 Of course, they will become the tim as well 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.989
 announced as the big coffers 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.680

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.579
 easy 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.959
 You have to beat this time first 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.880
 if they beat time then 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.829
 Do you make a picture of it but please 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.030
 picture in which you have the last time 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.060

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.820
 by somehow your name with 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.919
 a schnitzel with in the picture holds 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.540
 that means I do not want a screenshot 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.850
 have called you by your pc 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.740

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.720
 Only then or I can stop you 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.070
 Make sure this picture too 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.390
 really taken by yourself 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.290
 but has always been great 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.720
 just a little thing worked out 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.250
 I only take pictures to the one name 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.260

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.240

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.830
 once the game has to be 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.000

 the name of you is not unbelievable 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:58.610
 important now but much more important 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.810
 that in that the title of the picture there 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.910

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.830

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.570
 times had 50 or 60 pictures and the 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.640
 Searching every time was incredible 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.770
 a lot of work and I would like to ask me 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.350

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.070
 work that is ten seconds for you 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.410

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.630

 to be bloated that means you can go up to 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.480
 get into the lostopf four times with it 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.640

 will sometimes post on facebook as 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.840
 you can not hold it but mostly 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.460
 I will only in this video 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.750
 description of my current times 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.160

 was beaten there you are again 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.460
 out of the lostopf then you have to first 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.530
 beat me again and that's how it goes 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.510
 and forth and said alike 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.010

 Video Bescheidung land and he gets 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.410
 then from me in the end is yes that was 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.020
 it already 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.070
 I am looking forward to many great times 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.590
 I am a bit scared again 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.480
 that they will totally destroy me 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.980
 I'm actually at least wind 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.110

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.720
 nobody beats and smash brothers 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.460

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.930
 time should not be so 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.370
 take a coin so do not think now 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.450
