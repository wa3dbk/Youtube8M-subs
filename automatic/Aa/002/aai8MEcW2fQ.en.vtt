00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
take the negative terminal sorry about

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:34.920 
take the negative terminal sorry about
that<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.410> bit<00:02:26.709> clumsy<00:02:26.950> but<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.640> guess<00:02:33.630> all<00:02:34.630> right

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
that a bit clumsy but I guess all right

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.130 
that a bit clumsy but I guess all right
I'm<00:02:35.800> gonna<00:02:35.980> plug<00:02:36.250> in<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.630> positive<00:02:37.630> first<00:02:37.840> the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
I'm gonna plug in the positive first the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.860 
I'm gonna plug in the positive first the
red<00:02:38.320> cable<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.280> was<00:02:39.610> closer<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.570> the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
red cable and that was closer to the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.740 
red cable and that was closer to the
terminal<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.380> don't<00:02:41.560> want<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:42.480> siding<00:02:43.480> all

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
terminal I don't want the siding all

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.740 
terminal I don't want the siding all
down<00:02:44.010> I'm<00:02:45.010> going<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.280> dig<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:46.590> black<00:02:47.590> cable

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
down I'm going to dig the black cable

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.010 
down I'm going to dig the black cable
negative<00:02:52.470> then<00:02:53.470> cap<00:02:53.890> it<00:02:53.920> in<00:02:54.220> there<00:02:54.959> all<00:02:55.959> right

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
negative then cap it in there all right

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.870 
negative then cap it in there all right
so<00:02:56.200> now<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.530> got<00:02:56.860> everything<00:02:57.220> clamped<00:02:57.790> together

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
so now I got everything clamped together

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.190 
so now I got everything clamped together
negative<00:03:00.880> to<00:03:01.030> negative<00:03:01.060> positive<00:03:01.720> to

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
negative to negative positive to

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.900 
negative to negative positive to
positive<00:03:02.230> just<00:03:03.010> making<00:03:03.340> sure

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910
