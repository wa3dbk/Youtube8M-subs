00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
so I finally decided to put a video

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.300 
so I finally decided to put a video
together<00:00:28.210> because<00:00:28.900> a<00:00:29.109> lot<00:00:29.380> of<00:00:29.410> girls<00:00:29.650> ask<00:00:30.039> me

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
together because a lot of girls ask me

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.670 
together because a lot of girls ask me
and<00:00:30.580> it's<00:00:31.240> hard<00:00:31.419> to<00:00:31.599> explain<00:00:31.960> and<00:00:32.320> it's<00:00:32.470> hard

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
and it's hard to explain and it's hard

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.740 
and it's hard to explain and it's hard
to<00:00:32.800> just<00:00:33.010> you<00:00:33.460> know<00:00:33.489> show<00:00:34.000> people<00:00:34.030> just<00:00:34.570> based

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
on my pictures so I figured it would be

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.439 
on my pictures so I figured it would be
easier<00:00:36.760> to<00:00:37.420> just<00:00:37.900> do<00:00:38.260> a<00:00:38.290> video<00:00:38.610> um<00:00:39.610> I<00:00:39.699> can't<00:00:40.239> say

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
now I would let it dry for like a few

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.260 
now I would let it dry for like a few
seconds<00:06:19.010> I<00:06:19.130> wouldn't<00:06:19.400> just<00:06:19.640> peel<00:06:20.000> it<00:06:20.150> off

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
seconds I wouldn't just peel it off

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.320 
seconds I wouldn't just peel it off
right<00:06:20.450> away<00:06:21.370> but<00:06:22.370> once<00:06:22.880> you've<00:06:23.030> done<00:06:23.150> all<00:06:23.300> of

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
right away but once you've done all of

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.540 
right away but once you've done all of
this<00:06:23.660> as<00:06:23.930> you<00:06:24.590> can<00:06:24.740> see<00:06:24.920> right<00:06:25.070> now<00:06:25.220> it<00:06:25.370> looks

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
this as you can see right now it looks

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.010 
this as you can see right now it looks
kind<00:06:25.760> of<00:06:25.790> funny<00:06:26.030> especially<00:06:26.570> where<00:06:26.690> the<00:06:26.810> tape

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
kind of funny especially where the tape

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.630 
kind of funny especially where the tape
is<00:06:27.200> because<00:06:27.440> there's<00:06:27.590> obviously<00:06:27.710> some<00:06:28.280> excess

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:28.640 
is because there's obviously some excess

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:43.469 
is because there's obviously some excess
down<00:06:28.880> here<00:06:29.410> but<00:06:30.410> once<00:06:30.620> you<00:06:30.800> rip<00:06:31.010> off<00:06:31.130> this<00:06:31.400> tape

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:43.479 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:45.119
