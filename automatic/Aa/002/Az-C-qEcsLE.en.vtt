okay so I'll try to show you how to open

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.410 
okay so I'll try to show you how to open
this<00:00:05.190> thing<00:00:05.250> up<00:00:05.700> because<00:00:06.330> it<00:00:06.629> seems<00:00:07.049> at<00:00:07.379> first

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420 
this thing up because it seems at first

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.480 
this thing up because it seems at first
that<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:10.050> don't<00:00:10.320> have<00:00:10.980> any<00:00:11.400> way<00:00:11.660> for<00:00:13.490> opening

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
that you don't have any way for opening

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.269 
that you don't have any way for opening
it<00:00:15.260> the<00:00:16.260> secret<00:00:16.740> lies<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.789> gap<00:00:18.029> here<00:00:18.510> I

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
it the secret lies in a gap here I

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.400 
it the secret lies in a gap here I
assume<00:00:20.279> all<00:00:22.760> at<00:00:23.760> first<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.300> understand<00:00:24.779> this

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
assume all at first I understand this

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:34.790 
assume all at first I understand this
are<00:00:25.890> called<00:00:27.410> Jacob's<00:00:31.189> mandrels<00:00:33.620> but<00:00:34.620> yeah

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
are called Jacob's mandrels but yeah

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.030 
are called Jacob's mandrels but yeah
anyway<00:00:35.280> I'm<00:00:35.610> not<00:00:35.670> sure<00:00:36.210> but<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.079> guess<00:00:37.680> they<00:00:38.010> are

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
anyway I'm not sure but I guess they are

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.190 
anyway I'm not sure but I guess they are
all<00:00:38.460> made<00:00:38.879> like<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:40.309> you<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.550> find<00:00:42.200> this

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
all made like this you have to find this

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.740 
all made like this you have to find this
gap<00:00:43.620> here<00:00:46.760> depending<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.149> design<00:00:48.570> you

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
gap here depending on the design you

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.689 
gap here depending on the design you
have<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.219> somewhere<00:00:50.640> else<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.600> I

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
have it can be somewhere else but it I

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.590 
have it can be somewhere else but it I
always<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:54.030> here<00:00:55.489> try<00:00:56.489> doing<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:57.000> with<00:00:57.059> one

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
always be here try doing this with one

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
always be here try doing this with one
hand<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:59.180> very<00:01:00.180> awesome

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:47.350 

Hey<00:01:34.200> Chism's<00:01:36.870> so

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.420 

mr.<00:01:48.360> bean<00:01:48.630> let's<00:01:48.870> see<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:51.540> basically<00:01:52.369> this<00:01:53.369> is

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
mr. bean let's see and basically this is

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.719 
mr. bean let's see and basically this is
it<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.210> ring<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:55.320> will<00:01:55.830> assume<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.520> has

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
it the ring you will assume it has

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.080 
it the ring you will assume it has
broken<00:01:58.460> but<00:01:59.460> it's<00:02:00.119> not<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:00.990> intentionally

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
broken but it's not it's intentionally

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.460 
broken but it's not it's intentionally
split<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.270> half<00:02:04.910> because<00:02:05.910> if<00:02:06.060> they<00:02:06.270> if<00:02:06.570> they

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
split in half because if they if they

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.479 
split in half because if they if they
cut<00:02:07.800> it<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.990> impossible<00:02:09.990> to<00:02:10.200> put<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.310> ring

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
cut it it's impossible to put the ring

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.110 
cut it it's impossible to put the ring
back<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:13.400> what<00:02:14.400> they<00:02:14.580> do<00:02:14.640> they<00:02:15.270> pre-drill

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
back in so what they do they pre-drill

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.199 
back in so what they do they pre-drill
the<00:02:18.120> ring<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.989> tap<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.590> once<00:02:19.910> with<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:20.940> hammer

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
the ring the tap it once with a hammer

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.440 
the ring the tap it once with a hammer
and<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.930> breaks<00:02:22.400> when<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.430> put<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.820> back<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.239> it

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
and it breaks when you put it back in it

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:32.930 
and it breaks when you put it back in it
will<00:02:24.810> be<00:02:24.840> perfect<00:02:26.630> so

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.190 

this<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:34.220> now<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:36.210> just<00:02:36.570> come<00:02:36.870> out<00:02:37.080> I<00:02:39.200> don't

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
this is it now the just come out I don't

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.510 
this is it now the just come out I don't
know<00:02:40.680> what<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.580> tell<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:42.030> next<00:02:42.270> but<00:02:43.160> just<00:02:44.160> be

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
know what to tell you next but just be

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.730 
know what to tell you next but just be
careful<00:02:45.440> with<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.850> jaws<00:02:48.320> if<00:02:49.320> you<00:02:50.250> mess<00:02:50.550> them

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
careful with the jaws if you mess them

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.020 
careful with the jaws if you mess them
too<00:02:52.740> much<00:02:53.040> they<00:02:53.700> won't<00:02:54.680> come<00:02:55.680> back<00:02:55.710> in<00:02:56.160> like

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
too much they won't come back in like

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.990 
too much they won't come back in like
they<00:02:57.540> should<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.170> put<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.070> right<00:02:59.310> jaw<00:02:59.640> in<00:02:59.880> the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
they should so put the right jaw in the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.690 
they should so put the right jaw in the
right<00:03:00.240> hole<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:01.070> don't<00:03:02.070> forget<00:03:02.430> which<00:03:02.670> is

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
right hole and don't forget which is

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.060 
right hole and don't forget which is
which<00:03:04.370> if<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.730> need<00:03:05.970> cut<00:03:06.690> them<00:03:06.990> or<00:03:07.410> something

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
which if you need cut them or something

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.680 
which if you need cut them or something
just<00:03:08.400> on<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.910> back<00:03:09.120> make<00:03:09.690> marks<00:03:10.200> or<00:03:10.440> something

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
just on the back make marks or something

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.130 
just on the back make marks or something
remember<00:03:12.690> how<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.930> put<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.410> back<00:03:13.590> in<00:03:13.830> as<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.700> was

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
remember how to put it back in as it was

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.140 
remember how to put it back in as it was
because<00:03:16.140> on<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.560> smaller<00:03:16.860> one<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.520> took<00:03:17.970> me

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
because on the smaller one it took me

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.950 
because on the smaller one it took me
like<00:03:19.430> quarter<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.550> an<00:03:20.700> hour<00:03:20.850> just<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.690> figure

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
like quarter of an hour just to figure

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.050 
like quarter of an hour just to figure
out<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.380> 15<00:03:22.800> minutes<00:03:23.100> just<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.670> figure<00:03:23.910> out

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
out the 15 minutes just to figure out

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.320 
out the 15 minutes just to figure out
how<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.390> jaws<00:03:24.840> come<00:03:25.380> in<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.770> I<00:03:26.580> think<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:27.000> still

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
how the jaws come in and I think I still

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.350 
how the jaws come in and I think I still
don't<00:03:27.600> get<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.990> right<00:03:29.990> yeah<00:03:30.990> thanks

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
don't get it right yeah thanks

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.290 
don't get it right yeah thanks
I'll<00:03:33.360> now<00:03:33.690> clean<00:03:33.990> it<00:03:34.140> with<00:03:34.640> some<00:03:35.640> penetrant

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
I'll now clean it with some penetrant

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.580 
I'll now clean it with some penetrant
oil<00:03:36.650> some<00:03:37.650> sorts<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.870> grease<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.050> out<00:03:40.200> with

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
oil some sorts and grease it out with

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.670 
oil some sorts and grease it out with
lithium<00:03:41.160> grease<00:03:41.510> maybe<00:03:42.510> probably<00:03:43.080> put<00:03:43.560> it

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
lithium grease maybe probably put it

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.730 
lithium grease maybe probably put it
back<00:03:43.860> in<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.160> lane<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.400> clean<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:46.560> base

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
back in the lane and clean the the base

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.920 
back in the lane and clean the the base
thoroughly<00:03:48.050> but<00:03:49.050> yeah<00:03:49.200> this<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.770> it
