deathwing<00:04:28.810> right<00:04:28.990> now<00:04:29.139> I<00:04:29.169> think<00:04:29.380> we<00:04:29.800> just

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
deathwing right now I think we just

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.200 
deathwing right now I think we just

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
crushed this guy completely yeah so it

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.550 
crushed this guy completely yeah so it
does<00:04:34.360> look<00:04:34.510> like<00:04:34.570> his<00:04:34.870> hand<00:04:35.020> was<00:04:35.199> filled<00:04:35.470> with

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
does look like his hand was filled with

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.490 
does look like his hand was filled with
five<00:04:35.919> drops<00:04:36.220> in<00:04:36.400> six<00:04:36.639> drops<00:04:37.139> which<00:04:38.139> once<00:04:38.380> again

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
five drops in six drops which once again

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.500 
five drops in six drops which once again
is<00:04:38.650> why<00:04:38.919> you<00:04:38.979> always<00:04:39.340> want<00:04:39.550> to<00:04:39.639> to<00:04:40.210> curve<00:04:40.449> your

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
is why you always want to to curve your

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.810 
is why you always want to to curve your
deck<00:04:40.810> in<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.050> arena<00:04:41.260> earlier<00:04:42.070> towards<00:04:42.520> two

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
deck in the arena earlier towards two

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.490 
deck in the arena earlier towards two
through<00:04:43.060> four<00:04:43.300> drops<00:04:43.630> you<00:04:44.080> always<00:04:44.320> want<00:04:44.440> to

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
through four drops you always want to

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.529 
through four drops you always want to
prioritize<00:04:44.680> those<00:04:45.190> initially<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.180> get<00:04:46.360> your

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
prioritize those initially and get your

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.340 
prioritize those initially and get your
solid<00:04:46.870> creature<00:04:47.169> base<00:04:47.320> established

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
solid creature base established

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.770 
solid creature base established
so<00:04:50.280> we<00:04:50.340> have<00:04:50.460> nine<00:04:50.670> ten<00:04:51.000> eleven<00:04:51.360> damage<00:04:51.660> the

so we have nine ten eleven damage the

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.980 
so we have nine ten eleven damage the
table<00:04:52.910> another<00:04:53.910> join<00:04:54.270> shield<00:04:54.540> that's<00:04:54.810> why

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
table another join shield that's why

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.990 
table another join shield that's why

the 54 and an earth socket we can trade
here<00:05:14.160> and<00:05:14.310> then<00:05:14.490> we<00:05:14.550> can<00:05:14.580> ignore<00:05:14.850> the<00:05:15.060> rest<00:05:15.710> we

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
here and then we can ignore the rest we

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.020 
here and then we can ignore the rest we
could<00:05:16.860> just<00:05:16.980> earth<00:05:17.100> shock<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:17.610> kill<00:05:17.790> the

with<00:05:23.220> fire<00:05:23.430> elemental<00:05:23.940> I<00:05:24.560> think<00:05:25.560> that's

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
with fire elemental I think that's

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.400

better<00:05:25.890> we're<00:05:26.190> gonna<00:05:26.310> do<00:05:26.430> that<00:05:26.550> instead<00:05:27.410> yeah

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
better we're gonna do that instead yeah

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.840 
better we're gonna do that instead yeah
it's<00:05:28.560> much<00:05:28.710> easier<00:05:28.740> totally<00:05:29.370> wipes<00:05:29.520> the<00:05:29.640> board

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850
