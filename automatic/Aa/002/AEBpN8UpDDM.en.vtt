00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.130
 ask you to like my 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.130

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.070
 october month of my birthday 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.099
 several month parties of various works and 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.849
 half of several tests yes were 30 days 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.890
 corridos 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.109
 which I had little time to watch 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.489
 animes mangás reply to comments 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.530
 to make videos 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.149
 proof of this is the fact that I have only 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.940
 have managed to finish watching the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.160
 blood or downstairs yesterday as it is 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.350
 we are already aware of which episode of the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.690
 new season and had not even 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.610
 finished watching it at last 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.610
 I'm sorry for not getting 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.350
 keep up with the usual pace and taking advantage of 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.210
 the election period you would like to 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.850
 say the following in November 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.070
 I promise I'll make a video for each 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.280
 weekend, just like I always did 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.699
 this year and eight months of channel in 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.500
 amboim 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.600
 Now let's get to what is the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.640
 theme of the video last week the author of 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.369
 one of the winning works of the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.439
 brazil wars added a comment to the video 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.360
 where I did a compiler analysis to 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.670
 Who does not remember is fabíola was my one 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.860
 favorite shot of the five had not 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.080
 actually improve but it was not 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.900
 good and stand out is for creativity 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.580
 influence of the script while reading 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.770
 the impression that it was a chapter of the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.470
 middle of a classic wrestling mall 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.850
 quite original with a whole 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.799
 mythology behind 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.930
 the fact is that no comment it 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.630
 recommended taking a look at a new 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.770
 shock of its authorship the call of game 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.750
 of India 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.759
 so I decided to make a video 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.979
 analyzing this work even to divulge 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.740
 work and continue to give a strong 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.630
 production of national manga then let's 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.369
 kill 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.070
 so I read the title the game the fringe 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.450
 I soon realized the author's trademark 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.729
 the fact that a party is between 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.680
 brackets is interesting and if you continue 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.479
 being worked on will be a very 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.619
 strong to recognize his works 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.110
 easily 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.569
 I just think that the game of although it has a 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.910
 meaning consistent with the work does 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.220
 almost unconsciously 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.980
 direct association 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.720
 game of thrones I even think I even arrived 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.310
 to think at the outset that it could be a 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.110
 parody that there would be some 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.570
 references to the series within a 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.460
 shopping but that's not what happened 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.950
 just a tip for the next works 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.110
 try to be careful with the title to 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.930
 do not make associations as soon as you move 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.240
 wrong with expectations about art 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.370
 the dark and somber tone of the 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.830
 which conveys very well the 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.210
 atmosphere of a shot I feel that the drawing 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.970
 is much better than the one presented 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.340
 in the ball refap and the author even made some 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.420
 sequential experiments that have 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.950
 very good 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.380
 the business of starting the video game screen 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.300
 for example it was excellent was a 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.140
 kind of invitation to the reader to enter 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.450
 in the game 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.250
 calling and holding your attention 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.800
 monster that appears early on did 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.870
 a direct reference the curupira icon 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.570
 of Brazilian folklore to value our 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.220
 culture, even if with subtlety it is something 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.890
 if you take off your hat too 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.020
 soon after three pages to 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.260
 many may be considered worthless 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.150
 but I particularly find it very fucking 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.070
 the first with the panoramic view of the 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.959
 scenario is approaching until 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.660
 the scene with the dialogues between the 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.820
 characters itself is a technique I saw 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.890
 for the first time in a man and 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.790
 I hope it will become a trend of 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.860
 manga on the plot she spins on 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.390
 around the channel's main protagonist 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.790
 apparently he wants to get into a 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.130
 differentiated faculty to which the 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.620
 is to bring alive 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.140
 creature that is destroying the forest 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.630
 each team has eight people and will only be 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.900
 approved if you complete the test with 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.549
 least four live members and are 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.250
 individuals with specialties well 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.900
 scientists such as 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.080
 doctor or shooter 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.080
 the athlete the mma fighter the fighter 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.840
 muay thai paper narchi etc 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.320
 plays chess then in thesis holds the position 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.840
 of strategist 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.730
 the group has a magic sickle capable of 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.250
 absorb some characteristics of a 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.799
 this makes the 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.320
 ability of the protagonist to be 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.030
 diversifying its character 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.400
 strategic the final sentence of the year short 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.990
 cured what in my opinion was the 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.780
 best experience I've had with 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.330
 national gas have not read much but 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.280
 I'm curious and curious about 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.060
 continue to read this world of 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.340
 finally the phrase is as follows: 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.190
 All my life I thought it was always 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.169
 the king who would always be up but now 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.919
 I understand that I was always the same 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.560
 place 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.479
 now I understand that I can be a pawn that 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.960
 can move on to become 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.830
 any piece you want 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.330
