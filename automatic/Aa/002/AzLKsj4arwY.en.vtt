00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.580 
in recent times smartphones have been
looking<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.540> lot<00:00:09.780> better<00:00:10.080> than<00:00:10.170> they<00:00:10.410> did<00:00:10.469> in

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
looking a lot better than they did in

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.259 
looking a lot better than they did in
the<00:00:10.710> past<00:00:10.950> but<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.550> price<00:00:11.790> hasn't<00:00:12.000> gone<00:00:12.210> down

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
the past but the price hasn't gone down

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.419 
the past but the price hasn't gone down
they're<00:00:13.019> still<00:00:13.230> expensive<00:00:13.740> as<00:00:13.860> hell<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.309> if

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
they're still expensive as hell so if

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.799 
they're still expensive as hell so if
you<00:00:14.549> don't<00:00:14.790> want<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.059> devaluate<00:00:15.660> your

you don't want to devaluate your
smartphone<00:00:16.199> all<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.470> much<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.920> keep<00:00:17.220> it

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.670 
smartphone all that much and keep it
looking<00:00:17.490> good<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.060> better<00:00:18.449> use<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.690> case<00:00:19.080> now<00:00:19.650> I

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
looking good you better use a case now I

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.200 
looking good you better use a case now I
don't<00:00:19.800> like<00:00:20.070> cases<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.550> think<00:00:20.580> they<00:00:20.820> take<00:00:21.029> away

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
don't like cases I think they take away

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.090 
don't like cases I think they take away
from<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.510> ergonomics<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.230> phone<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.680> it

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
from the ergonomics of a phone and it

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.439 
from the ergonomics of a phone and it
looked<00:00:23.250> pretty<00:00:23.430> bad<00:00:23.609> most<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.090> time<00:00:24.300> but

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
looked pretty bad most of the time but

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.640 
looked pretty bad most of the time but
if<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.689> don't<00:00:24.900> want<00:00:25.050> your<00:00:25.140> smartphone<00:00:25.529> to
