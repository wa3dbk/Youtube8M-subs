path<00:00:31.080> over<00:00:31.349> driven<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.309> moving<00:00:32.669> forward<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
path over driven it moving forward the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.090 
path over driven it moving forward the
board<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.809> quicker<00:00:34.020> than<00:00:34.140> me<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:34.950> better

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
board is quicker than me so it's better

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.100 
board is quicker than me so it's better
to<00:00:35.250> pass<00:00:35.550> them<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.000> work<00:00:36.329> with<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> world<00:00:39.110> this

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
to pass them to work with the world this

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.310 
to pass them to work with the world this

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
is like nesting places yeah for behind

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.119 
is like nesting places yeah for behind
three<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> middle<00:00:44.960> here<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.469> perfect

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
three in the middle here is with perfect

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.639 
three in the middle here is with perfect
and<00:00:47.340> then<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.600> movement<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.410> players

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
is it good is it okay is this a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.880 
is it good is it okay is this a
realistic<00:00:54.539> set<00:00:54.899> up<00:00:55.020> for<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:55.559> example

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
realistic set up for that for example

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.540 
realistic set up for that for example
corner<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.579> he<00:00:57.360> has<00:00:57.539> two<00:00:57.840> players<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.500> cover<00:00:58.710> is

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
corner is he has two players to cover is

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.979 
corner is he has two players to cover is
between<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.170> when<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> ball<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.180> it

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
between so when is the ball here and it

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.780 
between so when is the ball here and it
will<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> chance<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.369> cover<00:01:05.549> two

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
will have a chance to to cover two

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.340 
will have a chance to to cover two
players<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.150> he<00:01:06.390> needs<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.659> be<00:01:06.780> between<00:01:06.960> so

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
players so he needs to be between so

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.750 
players so he needs to be between so

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
there a particular path we look for or

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.920 
there a particular path we look for or
do<00:01:28.330> you<00:01:28.420> give<00:01:29.140> it<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:30.070> playmaker<00:01:30.460> or<00:01:30.940> our

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
size to play forward so if I can pass

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.520 
size to play forward so if I can pass
water<00:01:35.440> to<00:01:36.280> my<00:01:36.430> gmail<00:01:37.240> so<00:01:37.660> it's<00:01:37.840> good<00:01:38.020> but<00:01:38.260> if

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
water to my gmail so it's good but if

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.610

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
so what formation did you choose here my

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.580 
so what formation did you choose here my
team<00:01:45.430> is<00:01:45.520> four<00:01:45.790> four<00:01:46.000> two<00:01:46.210> against<00:01:47.140> moving<00:01:47.350> is

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
team is four four two against moving is

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.390 
team is four four two against moving is
four<00:01:48.040> five<00:01:48.310> one<00:01:48.610> so<00:01:49.360> in<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.810> fence<00:01:50.050> feels

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
four five one so in the fence feels

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.430 
four five one so in the fence feels
mostly<00:01:51.400> I<00:01:51.700> think<00:01:51.940> but<00:01:52.120> not<00:01:52.390> that<00:01:52.750> happy<00:01:53.170> that<00:01:53.320> I

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
mostly I think but not that happy that I

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.520 
mostly I think but not that happy that I
have<00:01:53.590> big<00:01:54.040> advantage
