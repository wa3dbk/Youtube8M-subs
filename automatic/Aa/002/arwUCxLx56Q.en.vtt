about the vector from modern warfare 2
was<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.670> fact<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.120> actually<00:03:24.330> shot<00:03:24.720> at

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
was the fact that it actually shot at

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.490 
was the fact that it actually shot at
1111<00:03:26.730> rounds<00:03:27.090> per<00:03:27.300> minute<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.960> highest<00:03:28.320> of

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
1111 rounds per minute the highest of

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.490 
1111 rounds per minute the highest of
any<00:03:28.650> SMG<00:03:29.280> in<00:03:29.490> modern<00:03:29.910> warfare<00:03:29.940> 2<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.780> on<00:03:31.290> top

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
any SMG in modern warfare 2 and on top

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.260 
any SMG in modern warfare 2 and on top
of<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.650> even<00:03:32.550> though<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.790> did<00:03:32.970> have<00:03:33.150> this

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
of that even though it did have this

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.449 
of that even though it did have this
incredibly<00:03:33.780> insane<00:03:34.260> high<00:03:34.500> rate<00:03:34.800> of<00:03:34.830> fire<00:03:35.190> it

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
incredibly insane high rate of fire it

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.790 
incredibly insane high rate of fire it
had<00:03:35.820> very<00:03:36.150> low<00:03:36.360> recoil<00:03:36.630> which<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.470> one<00:03:37.620> of<00:03:37.650> the

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
had very low recoil which is one of the

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.470 
had very low recoil which is one of the
things<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.250> lot<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.459> people<00:03:38.640> enjoyed<00:03:39.180> from
