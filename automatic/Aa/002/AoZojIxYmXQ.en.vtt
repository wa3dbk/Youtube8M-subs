00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 good time of the day dear lovers 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.460
 chess playing brothers 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:13.410
 brazilian again 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.799
 Scandinavian beginning rival immediately 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.220
 gone 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:27.240
 for winters ago I don't know 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:33.329
 wrong i'm developing shock long 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.570
 side and now I'm starting to think that 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.570
 do 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:54.270
 fasten the gut here in addition and not 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:56.670
 I want a pawn worth at least here 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.910
 Trouble starts starting at me 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.760
 if i manage to defend myself effectively 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.930
 then he can do nothing for it 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:15.100
 I'm just a pawn and 2 ma forward and here 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:19.830
 just block so now can 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.830
 tormented turn to attack him 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:40.450
 I am walking the queen to the center right here 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:42.130
 pawn flies but he decided to take the knight 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.030
 open course vertical 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:50.200
 yes open better vertical and I want a queen 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.000
 our 4 put here he can problems 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.020
 arise on the open you were looking for 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.690
 and if he took a pawn here, I would 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.179
 sacrificed quality just he would 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.039
 lost some time maybe not 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.270
 I know of course incorrectly overlaid something 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:15.880
 quality in that position 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:19.560
 but for some reason, hurried places to lie so 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.560
 immediately threatening to checkmate 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:30.409
 and the only protection though no 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:34.999
 owning and those can be elodea on 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:39.620
 knives go king and he wants 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:46.010
 hide behind a pawn that I let you 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:52.370
 I am trying to get up here with the threat of the United States here 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:59.079
 checkmate difficult situation he decided 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.079
 decided to protect against defending 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:06.939
 I'll take it nicely here 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:11.239
 and wanted to attack his queen 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:15.560
 but the version can come here but nothing 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:18.799
 dreadful he has a noisy position 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.310
 although you can hurry to drive 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:29.209
 offers she comes here in one such 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:31.819
 queen him and he goes to the exchange he goes to 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.909
 exchange but in my opinion it is mate because 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:45.769
 check here and checkmate he closed 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:52.579
 indent the ship itself is looking at 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:57.019
 the party here seems to be the main idea 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.979
 what if for example a rival attacks you 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.129
 pawns 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:04.180
 do not rush to defend against this 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:07.639
 attacks well there block them somehow 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.560
 well and stop it so and then you 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.840
 it will be time to attack him and how 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.969
 the rule is club players they can 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.680
 attack no naming defend it here 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:19.989
 one of the rollers can w tuba 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:26.120
 listen to Smirnova 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:28.159
 lecture Smirnov and if you protect yourself by 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.889
 then it will be difficult for the opponent to defend 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:33.169
 since they donâ€™t know how to defend myself 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.880
 here is just blocked to attack here 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.310
 of course there were some ideas without 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.190
 the victims 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:42.720
 This words but my so same bear 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:47.850
 here of course the queen had to go on 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:50.250
 e3 probably but here he was in no hurry 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.800
 became here the quality stood out although it may 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.910
 being my black panic was dangerous too 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:00.000
 maybe he was afraid of him and when he opens 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:04.140
 am vertical is already bad for black 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.910
 it is already difficult here and the senk is coming down to h5 then 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:12.530
 I also take just here so I did not 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.970
 insure because he came in here but 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.320
 then it was possible to put the queen in check 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:24.150
 he would have come to f6 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:26.430
 but there I did not see mats that's why I 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.350
 I decided to threaten with a foul language 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:34.050
 but the idea is that the whole one just takes it 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:38.640
 pawn is tied she stands here i'm just 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:40.950
 took and did not exchange queens because 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.800
 he closed the field for the king to run away 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.220
 I decided to put the motor so much for 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.220
 Attention
