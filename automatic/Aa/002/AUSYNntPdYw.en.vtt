00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.130
 very good morning welcome to smart 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.380
 spain once again today we have with 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.360
 us new products for the table and 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.639
 also new brand this is about 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.039
 blusens the Galicians that have 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.539
 borrowed this terminal to analyze it and 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.070
 first of all, I want to give you the 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.039
 thanks for the trust placed in the 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.259
 blog and the possibility to try this 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.359
 smart fit of 20 gigabytes that we have 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.089
 sent from blu sens let's start 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.529
 already with the analysis with this unboxing and 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.970
 as we always do then we are going to 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.829
 start with the packaging and see a 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.390
 little that we have outside the 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.580
 fringed guitar let's remove the 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.170
 protective plastic as I always say 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.510
 Well, I do not know that I'm going to find 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.880
 because I just received it practically 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.460
 at home and let's see how I say the 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.050
 packaged we do not have around here by the 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.030
 front as a frontal image of 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.440
 product and some features 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.530
 main as the theme the ips screen 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.110
 and above all what most presume to be 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.059
 very light and very finite around here in a 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.790
 tourist more than about 25 gigabytes of 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.340
 cloud storage and the title of 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.189
 the phone itself 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.119
 let's go to the side here an image about 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:18.340
 some games that incorporates blu sens and the 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.979
 Android theme in this case comes 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.020
 still with 4.3 I do not know if we'll have 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.119
 Upgrade to kitkat now available 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.409
 here at the bottom some 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.659
 features rules that then 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.549
 we will go deeper into this 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.310
 side that comes in the package that 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:37.149
 side we'll see the social media theme of 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.250
 blu sens and above more little things about 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:43.119
 the phone then brand it one more time 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.159
 motogp theme of good patronage 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.259
 little more not in the back as 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.390
 usually more information more 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.310
 clearly about characteristics that 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.459
 now let's go deeper 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.560
 to see how you see first they indicate that 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:58.509
 subject of the frontal color that is black but 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.429
 the back is white and as for 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:04.270
 characteristics then we have that 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:07.420
 4.7 inch panel or gs screen 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.560
 no ips this is a forgiveness yes it is ips 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.900
 but it 's a bit better was achieved with 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.580
 the 11-s eliminate one of the layers of that 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.410
 I composed the screen 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.030
 that screen is full hd 1280 x 720 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.650
 we have dual sim once again in a 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.110
 Spanish phone 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.600
 I do not see connectivity 4g we see 3g but 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.670
 well here the option is double sim yes 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.140
 which is very valuable we have a 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.410
 quad cores 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.110
 snapdragon I'm going to rne a gigabyte 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.510
 20 gigs of internal storage that 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.270
 it is very very remarkable there are not many 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.030
 phones with this one with these with these 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.770
 internal capabilities 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.960
 we have the android 4.3 that we have already 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.140
 commented on jelly bean rear camera 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.600
 3-megapixel front 2 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.650
 wi-fi connectivity we have hands-free 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.290
 gps lithium battery poland of 1780 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.780
 milliamps maybe like that in cold it seems 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.980
 of the most of the most 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.659
 questionable or maybe just a tad fair that 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.780
 capacity but we'll see how it 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:15.709
 behaves and little more micro usb port 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.420
 card reader speaker sensors 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.790
 25 keys that we said of storage 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.920
 in the cloud and if I think we have a 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.709
 case flip case inside of these that 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.989
 They have a cover and a screen protector 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.780
 have included and warn us of those 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.090
 updates or verdier for the 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.709
 operating system and especially here 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.400
 let's get closer to make it good 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.349
 clear that weight of only 100 grams let's go 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.140
 open the package once again we see a 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.690
 pretty simple package we raise the 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.659
 tapita by the cloud we do not see any 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.930
 drawing or anything and we find 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:54.019
 the phone already directly here what 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.480
 typical appeal plastic sleeve for 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.040
 avoid scratching good let's leave it 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.859
 out there as always to analyze it the 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.670
 truth is that yes it is very very light 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:05.950
 seem like masters it seems to be nothing 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.640
 let's get up to see what else 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.640
 we have here 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.190
 we have here under this box the 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.270
 package I forgot to say the cardboard 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.209
 the truth is that it is quite resistant 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.090
 nothing nothing excessive but the truth that 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.250
 more than enough we do not have here in 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.220
 first place as accessory because this 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.260
 cover that we said of the flip keys and already 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:32.180
 we'll see how it adapts 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:36.100
 we have here the wall adapter 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:39.380
 we have some headphones that are also 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:43.130
 they are have integrated handsfree 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:47.330
 sonic is normal and current that 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:50.270
 we make here usb usb cable the 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:54.289
 battery that we drop the battery that 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.600
 now we will put and then it is a little subject 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.960
 of documents varied documentation of 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:04.220
 advertising by blu sens and 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.710
 some manuals a quick guide and something 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.900
 more than advertising reality is very well 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.880
 let's leave the accessories on one side 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:15.199
 and let's go to what we really 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:18.410
 what is the mobile and we are going to 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:20.120
 put the battery to see those 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.000
 first sensations let's see where 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.650
 we raise here we have let's see if 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.680
 we have a hard time lifting in this 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:31.169
 occasion is quite easy to lift 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.600
 the housing and I'm actually seeing that 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:37.790
 we have already included let's go like this the 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:41.300
 we focus well on a microsd 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.130
 a microsd that the truth is that it's a 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.410
 great joy that comes to us this I do not 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.930
 I was waiting and without a doubt to see him 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.840
 installed even it is very very well 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.240
 here we have before closing this the 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:58.169
 two adapters to stop at simpson without 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:01.320
 normal so I see both if so is 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:03.150
 they are not micro sim and yes sorry sorry yes 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.490
 which are micro sim both two I was not 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.110
 fixing but yes they are that much 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.539
 better since practically all now 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.020
 we already use the micro sim and the phones 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:16.200
 in general they all come with this format 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.480
 let's install through the housing 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.780
 to which the housing enters very very easy 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:25.020
 it does not make noises or do anything, I hope 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.130
 that does not trigger easily and the 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.060
 truth is that the feeling is very good 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:31.590
 we are not going to stress the subject of 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.230
 the thickness the truth is that it is really 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:38.010
 very fine thin the truth is that recently 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:39.830
 We saw the ngs that had left us 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.840
 and the truth is that it is very similar 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.270
 lightness is lighter even the truth 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.190
 is that it weighs nothing and in the hand the 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.160
 truth is that it seems like a toy 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:53.010
 I do not know the truth is that the sensations 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:56.400
 It is very good in the hand, not as I say it is 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.840
 very very light and does not do anything to us 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.540
 uncomfortable the truth is that the size 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.940
 they also facilitate it these 47 inches 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:06.060
 which for me is a very very size 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:08.160
 interesting and very comfortable to handle and 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.840
 that undoubtedly because they help this 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.520
 phone in addition to being light by the 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.160
 materials for the effort he has put 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.260
 blu sens no doubt have a 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.889
 very good acceptance of first not of 

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.919
 first hand 

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:22.680
 well a little more than adding this in 

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:24.990
 steam boxing 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.900
 let's leave here go start 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.220
 to try this great phone which 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.440
 I really want to see how it is 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.419
 behaves in your day to day and especially 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.580
 that drum theme that I still 

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:38.190
 there are some doubts about whether it will resist 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:41.160
 well the whole day of using a little bit 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:43.620
 especially when we put cane a 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.360
 little more than to thank blue 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.600
 feel the trust you have placed in the 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.160
 blog to be able to lend me this terminal and 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.470
 to all of us for continuing to see these 

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.340
 books and reading the blog thank you very much 

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.340
 everyone and until next time
