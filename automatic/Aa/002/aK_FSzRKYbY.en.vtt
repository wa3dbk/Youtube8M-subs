00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
moving coil gauges we don't actually

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.879 
moving coil gauges we don't actually
send<00:00:09.480> any<00:00:09.660> moving<00:00:09.870> core<00:00:10.110> gauges<00:00:10.469> but<00:00:10.620> we<00:00:10.740> do

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
send any moving core gauges but we do

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.629 
send any moving core gauges but we do
sell<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.460> sender<00:00:11.790> units<00:00:12.090> for<00:00:12.270> them<00:00:12.530> now<00:00:13.639> these

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
sell the sender units for them now these

sell the sender units for them now these
gauges<00:00:14.849> were<00:00:15.179> fitted<00:00:15.510> up<00:00:15.809> until<00:00:16.470> about<00:00:16.770> the

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:16.950 
gauges were fitted up until about the

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.760 
gauges were fitted up until about the
early<00:00:17.849> nineteen<00:00:18.420> sixties<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.080> do<00:00:19.410> get<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> bit

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
early nineteen sixties you do get a bit

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.320 
early nineteen sixties you do get a bit
of<00:00:19.860> an<00:00:19.950> overlap<00:00:20.310> certainly<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:20.880> some<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
of an overlap certainly in some of the

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.090 
of an overlap certainly in some of the
bigger<00:00:21.480> cars<00:00:22.230> analysis<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.859> things<00:00:22.920> like

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
bigger cars analysis and things like

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.620 
bigger cars analysis and things like
that<00:00:23.160> might<00:00:23.460> have<00:00:23.609> run<00:00:23.760> moving<00:00:24.060> core<00:00:24.210> gauges

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
that might have run moving core gauges

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.880 
that might have run moving core gauges
into<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> mid<00:00:25.770> sixties<00:00:26.869> if<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.560> have<00:00:28.710> one<00:00:28.859> of

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
into the mid sixties if you have one of

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.759 
into the mid sixties if you have one of
these<00:00:29.039> gauges<00:00:29.810> there<00:00:30.810> they're<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.320> type<00:00:31.500> that

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
these gauges there they're the type that

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.500 
these gauges there they're the type that
that<00:00:32.250> when<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.460> turn<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.820> petrol<00:00:33.150> on<00:00:33.210> they

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
that when you turn the petrol on they

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.509 
that when you turn the petrol on they
move<00:00:33.750> instantly<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.530> gauge<00:00:34.890> flickers<00:00:35.309> about

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519 
move instantly the gauge flickers about

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:38.240 
move instantly the gauge flickers about
and<00:00:35.820> as<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.390> petrol<00:00:37.230> sloshes<00:00:37.649> about<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
and as that petrol sloshes about in the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.880 
and as that petrol sloshes about in the
in<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.940> tank<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.660> gauge<00:00:39.870> moves<00:00:40.350> around

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
in the tank the gauge moves around

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.319 
in the tank the gauge moves around
there's<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.309> because<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.760> an<00:00:41.850> instant

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
there's the because it's an instant

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.260 
there's the because it's an instant
reading<00:00:42.690> they're<00:00:43.440> not<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> slow<00:00:44.040> movement<00:00:44.910> like

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
reading they're not a slow movement like

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.290 
reading they're not a slow movement like
you<00:00:45.360> get<00:00:45.540> with<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.050> modern<00:00:46.290> gauge<00:00:47.300> it's

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
you get with a with a modern gauge it's

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.750 
you get with a with a modern gauge it's
really<00:00:48.629> critical<00:00:49.079> before<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.590> buy<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.160> new

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
really critical before you buy a new

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.540 
really critical before you buy a new
sender<00:00:51.270> unit<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:51.960> these<00:00:52.079> gauges<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:53.340> you

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
sender unit for these gauges that you

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.520 
sender unit for these gauges that you
check<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.390> gauge<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:55.110> fully

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
check that the gauge is fully

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.160 
check that the gauge is fully
functioning<00:00:56.100> perfectly<00:00:56.510> if<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> gauge<00:00:57.899> is

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
functioning perfectly if the gauge is

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.819 
functioning perfectly if the gauge is
broken<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.879> you<00:00:59.879> don't<00:01:00.180> know<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.930> but<00:01:01.260> but

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
broken and you don't know that but but

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.619 
broken and you don't know that but but
you<00:01:01.920> think<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.399> sender<00:01:02.670> yunus<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.480> buy

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
you think it's the sender yunus you buy

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.540 
you think it's the sender yunus you buy
a<00:01:03.660> new<00:01:03.899> sender<00:01:04.259> unit<00:01:04.410> you'll<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.160> burn<00:01:05.339> it

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
a new sender unit you'll just burn it

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.160 
a new sender unit you'll just burn it
out<00:01:05.640> straight<00:01:05.970> away<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.479> they'll<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.899> they'll

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
out straight away and they'll be they'll

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.700 
out straight away and they'll be they'll
be<00:01:07.259> gone

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
be gone

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.719 
be gone
they'll<00:01:07.860> have<00:01:08.009> been<00:01:08.130> nothing<00:01:08.430> wrong<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
they'll have been nothing wrong with the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.910 
they'll have been nothing wrong with the
sender<00:01:09.000> unit<00:01:09.200> but<00:01:10.200> because<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> gauge<00:01:10.710> is

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
sender unit but because the gauge is

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.130 
sender unit but because the gauge is
broken<00:01:10.950> you'll<00:01:11.850> break<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.330> new<00:01:12.510> sender<00:01:12.869> unit

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
broken you'll break the new sender unit

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.320 
broken you'll break the new sender unit
so<00:01:13.710> very<00:01:13.890> important<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:15.080> download<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.280> PDF

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
so very important you download this PDF

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.090 
so very important you download this PDF
from<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> website<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.680> will<00:01:19.860> tell<00:01:20.009> you

from the website that will tell you

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.190 
from the website that will tell you
exactly<00:01:20.310> what<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.880> do<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.240> check<00:01:21.840> out<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
exactly what to do to check out the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.560 
exactly what to do to check out the
gauge<00:01:22.400> and<00:01:23.400> then<00:01:23.759> when<00:01:24.119> you've<00:01:24.210> found<00:01:24.450> that

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
gauge and then when you've found that

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.350 
gauge and then when you've found that
the<00:01:24.689> gauges<00:01:24.990> working<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:25.590> simply<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> case<00:01:26.070> of

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
the gauges working it's simply a case of

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.300 
the gauges working it's simply a case of
we<00:01:27.360> do<00:01:27.479> two<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.840> them<00:01:28.020> they<00:01:28.619> both<00:01:28.830> have<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
we do two of them they both have the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.910 
we do two of them they both have the
