00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
up Pearson finally uses it but it's

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.360 
up Pearson finally uses it but it's
incomplete<00:03:42.080> defense<00:03:42.650> it's<00:03:42.920> when<00:03:43.100> he<00:03:43.220> was

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
incomplete defense it's when he was
