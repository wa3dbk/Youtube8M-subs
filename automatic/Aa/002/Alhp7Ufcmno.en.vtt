six seven eight nine ten Jack queen king

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.440

that's<00:02:03.630> three<00:02:04.170> one<00:02:04.950> more<00:02:05.570> ace<00:02:06.570> two<00:02:07.290> three<00:02:07.340> four

five six seven eight nine ten jack

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.820 
five six seven eight nine ten jack
thinking<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.600> think<00:02:15.600> this<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.020> strong<00:02:16.440> effect

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
thinking I think this is a strong effect

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.680 
thinking I think this is a strong effect
because<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.660> shuffles<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:19.230> cards<00:02:19.940> it<00:02:20.940> uses<00:02:21.540> a

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
because it shuffles the cards it uses a

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.699 
because it shuffles the cards it uses a
mathematical<00:02:22.070> formula<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.310> do<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.270> trick

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
mathematical formula to do this trick

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:34.360 
mathematical formula to do this trick
show<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:30.500> dad<00:02:31.500> because<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:31.920> have<00:02:32.040> another<00:02:32.280> deck

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
show you dad because I have another deck

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:42.800 
show you dad because I have another deck
the<00:02:35.370> same<00:02:35.580> thing<00:02:36.170> he's<00:02:37.170> sticking<00:02:41.269> hey<00:02:42.269> Sookie

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
the same thing he's sticking hey Sookie

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:52.000 
the same thing he's sticking hey Sookie
so<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.769> then<00:02:44.160> uh<00:02:44.190> King<00:02:45.000> ace<00:02:48.650> okay<00:02:50.120> sure<00:02:51.120> you

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
so and then uh King ace okay sure you

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.190 
so and then uh King ace okay sure you
okay<00:02:53.010> like<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:54.000> said<00:02:54.209> I'm<00:02:54.510> gonna<00:02:54.600> shuffle<00:02:54.870> these

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
okay like I said I'm gonna shuffle these

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.020 
okay like I said I'm gonna shuffle these
piles<00:02:55.970> this<00:02:56.970> uses<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.450> Gilberts<00:02:58.260> simple<00:02:59.030> but

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
piles this uses the Gilberts simple but

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.990 
piles this uses the Gilberts simple but
this<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.690> mathematical<00:03:01.170> principle<00:03:02.070> it's<00:03:02.760> my

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
this is a mathematical principle it's my

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.280 
this is a mathematical principle it's my
violin<00:03:03.450> because<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:05.280> shuffle<00:03:05.790> cards<00:03:06.290> and

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
violin because of you shuffle cards and

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:16.460 
violin because of you shuffle cards and
you<00:03:08.989> it's<00:03:09.989> amazing<00:03:10.890> how<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.489> works<00:03:14.180> so<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.470> think

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
you it's amazing how it works so I think

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.770 
you it's amazing how it works so I think
it's<00:03:16.709> pretty<00:03:16.799> cool<00:03:17.040> trick<00:03:17.220> try<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:17.790> I'll<00:03:18.660> see

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
it's pretty cool trick try it I'll see

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.440 
it's pretty cool trick try it I'll see
you<00:03:18.840> guys<00:03:18.930> in<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.170> next<00:03:19.260> video
