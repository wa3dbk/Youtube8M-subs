seeing I'm not sure what that may be
over<00:04:07.650> there<00:04:07.829> there's<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.370> large<00:04:08.700> tank<00:04:09.170> over

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
over there there's a large tank over

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.539 
over there there's a large tank over
there<00:04:10.290> may<00:04:10.560> have<00:04:10.620> been<00:04:10.769> a<00:04:10.799> you<00:04:11.220> know<00:04:11.310> an

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
there may have been a you know an

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.009 
there may have been a you know an
apartment<00:04:12.090> complex<00:04:12.209> or<00:04:12.660> something<00:04:12.750> like<00:04:12.959> that

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
apartment complex or something like that

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.379 
apartment complex or something like that
it<00:04:13.230> could<00:04:13.380> be<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.560> propane<00:04:14.069> tank<00:04:14.310> or<00:04:14.819> some<00:04:15.150> sort

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
it could be a propane tank or some sort

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.960 
it could be a propane tank or some sort
of<00:04:15.450> maybe<00:04:16.410> an<00:04:16.739> oil<00:04:16.950> tank<00:04:17.190> something<00:04:17.609> like<00:04:17.729> that

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
of maybe an oil tank something like that

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.890 
of maybe an oil tank something like that
but<00:04:18.840> this<00:04:19.410> is<00:04:19.739> unlike<00:04:20.729> anything<00:04:21.510> you'll<00:04:21.780> ever

happening<00:04:24.620> you<00:04:25.620> know<00:04:25.710> roughly<00:04:25.979> three<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.400> a

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
happening you know roughly three and a

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
almost four hours ago there are hardly

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.330 
almost four hours ago there are hardly
any<00:04:30.690> trees<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.500> remain<00:04:31.800> what<00:04:31.950> you're<00:04:32.100> looking

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
any trees to remain what you're looking

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.500 
any trees to remain what you're looking
at<00:04:32.460> and<00:04:32.639> on<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.910> right<00:04:33.090> side<00:04:33.270> of<00:04:33.330> your<00:04:33.360> screen

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
at and on the right side of your screen

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.330 
at and on the right side of your screen
here<00:04:33.810> would<00:04:33.930> be<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.260> south<00:04:34.889> edge<00:04:35.130> of<00:04:35.250> the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
here would be the south edge of the

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.150 
here would be the south edge of the
tornado<00:04:35.729> and<00:04:36.060> then<00:04:36.419> it<00:04:36.539> went<00:04:36.690> on<00:04:36.840> to<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:37.950> north

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
tornado and then it went on to the north

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.830 
tornado and then it went on to the north
there<00:04:38.490> I<00:04:38.520> would<00:04:38.880> you<00:04:39.000> know<00:04:39.120> at<00:04:39.270> this<00:04:39.450> point<00:04:39.750> I'd

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
there I would you know at this point I'd

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.719 
there I would you know at this point I'd
estimate<00:04:40.020> that<00:04:40.470> brunt<00:04:40.830> of<00:04:40.979> the<00:04:41.100> damage<00:04:41.130> is

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
estimate that brunt of the damage is

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.310 
estimate that brunt of the damage is
roughly<00:04:42.030> about<00:04:42.180> a<00:04:42.330> quarter<00:04:42.750> of<00:04:42.810> a<00:04:42.870> mile<00:04:43.050> wide

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
roughly about a quarter of a mile wide

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.890 
roughly about a quarter of a mile wide
or<00:04:44.280> so<00:04:44.550> I'm<00:04:44.729> just<00:04:44.910> eyeballing<00:04:45.360> that<00:04:45.510> at<00:04:45.780> this

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
or so I'm just eyeballing that at this

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.500 
or so I'm just eyeballing that at this
point<00:04:46.580> but<00:04:47.580> this<00:04:47.940> is<00:04:48.860> again<00:04:49.880> fresh<00:04:50.880> images<00:04:51.300> for

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
point but this is again fresh images for

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.600 
point but this is again fresh images for
you<00:04:51.660> this<00:04:52.139> evening<00:04:52.320> folks<00:04:52.680> and<00:04:52.950> this<00:04:53.070> is<00:04:53.310> if

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
there's something that you may never see

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.950 
there's something that you may never see
again<00:04:55.800> in<00:04:56.099> your<00:04:56.190> lifetime<00:04:56.450> homes<00:04:57.450> like<00:04:57.690> this
