00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 welcome to tripolis tv 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.580
 Today I want to show how to get one 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.810
 sony xperia the digitizer change 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.160
 by the way, in a video description 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.480
 you will find links to spare parts and 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.889
 tools not also associations 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:19.949
 just read through it so let that go 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:21.570
 freeze and get started right away 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.010
 Let's start first 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.400
 we remove that sony from backcover 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.400
 and battery 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.370
 Next we take a top 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:46.660
 screwdriver and solve a total of eight 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:48.100
 Screw the back then 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.080
 Carefully solve all the clips 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.520
 back respect not too much violence 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.030
 otherwise you can use the clips 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.030
 to damage 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.140
 now just remove the back 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.430
 and on the side lay then we solve 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.080
 the only clip what the mainboard 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.060
 then fasten the board 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.730
 Carefully turn around and separate the three flex 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.440
 cable connections below pay attention to it 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.440
 Do not raise the board too abruptly 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.700
 then we remove the yellow one 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.200
 Protective film then solve the clip of 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.590
 digitizer flex cable and disconnect the 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.940
 connection afterwards we remove the 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:47.840
 earpiece and the rubber holder of the 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:49.100
 camera next we accept 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.720
 ordinary hair dryer put him on the 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.729
 highest level and heat up the glass 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.010
 about 80 degrees so for the best of 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.670
 can solve glue 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.020
 then take a sharp point 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.950
 object and try the glass 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.510
 completely remove 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.130
 pay attention that they firstly 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.510
 not with the pointed tool too deep 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.979
 penetrate and secondly avoids 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.850
 contact with the display so no 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.850
 Grease stains arise 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.400
 so now we take the new digitizer 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.900
 then remove all the protective films 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.579
 the flex cable through the slot and 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.689
 press the glass firmly so that one 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.849
 good connection is created 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.409
 i use the old glue here because 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.450
 he still received well is important 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.860
 but to pay attention that you later that 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.840
 glass once again heated with the hair dryer 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.250
 so that it really sticks either 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.750
 you can also use new glue 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.049
 just as you both want to work 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.519
 Super 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.230
 then you can do that again 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.159
 Assemble first we connect 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.120
 again the digitizer flex cable 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:00.260
 then we bring the earpiece and 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.790
 turn the rubber holder back on 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.299
 Next we connect the board 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.709
 again with the three flex cable stays 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.180
 Being patient can be a bit tricky 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.450
 be there the flex cable back to 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.450
 connect 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.329
 Now the board again on the clip 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.329
 fix 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.970
 then we bring the back 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.970
 again and screw it again 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.170
 And last but not least we bring the battery and 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.670
 backcover again and check if 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.440
 we did everything right if so 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.349
 should your sony xperia m again 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.550

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.440

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.060
