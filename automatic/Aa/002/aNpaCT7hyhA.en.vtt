Haynes manual I've been following it to
the<00:00:25.140> tee<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:27.560> set<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:30.050> crankshaft

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
the tee I set the crankshaft

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.910 
the tee I set the crankshaft
to<00:00:32.730> zero<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> timing<00:00:33.840> chain<00:00:34.140> cover<00:00:34.170> marker

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
to zero on the timing chain cover marker

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.790 
to zero on the timing chain cover marker
you<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.250> see<00:00:37.190> here<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:39.350> don't<00:00:40.350> know<00:00:40.410> if<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.620> can

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
you can see here I don't know if you can

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:50.090 
you can see here I don't know if you can
see<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:43.789> focus<00:00:45.320> it's<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.440> little<00:00:46.620> dark<00:00:49.100> but

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
see that focus it's a little dark but

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.689 
see that focus it's a little dark but
that<00:00:50.820> keyway<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.329> lining<00:00:51.899> straight<00:00:52.230> up<00:00:52.699> tooth

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
that keyway is lining straight up tooth

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.810 
that keyway is lining straight up tooth
on<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> dowel<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> crankshaft<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.489> at<00:00:57.210> TDC

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
on the dowel so the crankshaft is at TDC

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:06.020 
on the dowel so the crankshaft is at TDC
now<00:01:01.730> when<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> put<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> chain<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.350> marker<00:01:05.030> on

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
now when I put the chain the marker on

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.550 
now when I put the chain the marker on
the<00:01:06.299> dowel<00:01:06.540> on<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.140> crankshaft<00:01:09.439> put<00:01:10.439> it

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the dowel on the crankshaft put it

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.539 
the dowel on the crankshaft put it
through<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.070> guide<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:12.560> up<00:01:13.560> over<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
through the guide here up over the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.469 
through the guide here up over the
camshaft<00:01:15.119> sprocket<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.229> put<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:17.479> second

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
camshaft sprocket but I put the second

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.230 
camshaft sprocket but I put the second
mark<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> chain<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.970> mark<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
mark on the chain on the mark on the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.179 
mark on the chain on the mark on the
camshaft<00:01:21.479> as<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.650> see<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:24.659> chain<00:01:25.189> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
camshaft as you can see the chain the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.740 
camshaft as you can see the chain the
third<00:01:26.520> mark<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> chain<00:01:27.950> doesn't<00:01:28.950> want<00:01:29.130> to

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
third mark on the chain doesn't want to

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.109 
third mark on the chain doesn't want to
stretch<00:01:30.750> over<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:33.860> that<00:01:34.860> last<00:01:35.250> tooth<00:01:35.759> here

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.020 
stretch over to the that last tooth here
where<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:36.600> supposed<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.229> doesn't<00:01:37.680> wanna

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
unless of course I rotate it clockwise

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.569 
unless of course I rotate it clockwise
with<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.290> wrench<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:44.579> as<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:45.030> see<00:01:45.270> here

with a wrench but as you can see here

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.490 
with a wrench but as you can see here
get<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.610> little<00:01:47.700> closer<00:01:49.399> I've<00:01:50.399> got<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:52.350> could

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
see the hole there and it's lined up

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
see the hole there and it's lined up
with<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.600> mark<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.990> made<00:01:59.119> this<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.329> uh<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.750> is

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
with the mark I made this is uh this is

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.840 
with the mark I made this is uh this is
a<00:02:00.930> new<00:02:01.140> camshaft<00:02:01.409> sprocket<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.340> lot<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.700> is

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
a new camshaft sprocket a lot this is

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.270 
a new camshaft sprocket a lot this is
the<00:02:02.939> same<00:02:03.210> exact<00:02:03.600> as<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> old<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.280> didn't

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
the same exact as the old one didn't

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.429 
the same exact as the old one didn't
come<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.640> marks<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.600> made<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> mark<00:02:07.170> where

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
come with marks so I made a mark where

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.460 
come with marks so I made a mark where
the<00:02:07.469> tooth<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.979> now<00:02:08.520> these<00:02:08.640> are<00:02:08.849> lined<00:02:09.090> up

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
the tooth is now these are lined up

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.650 
the tooth is now these are lined up
there<00:02:10.470> even<00:02:10.709> with<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.160> timing<00:02:11.550> chain<00:02:11.580> cover

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
there even with the timing chain cover

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.030 
there even with the timing chain cover
but<00:02:13.260> my<00:02:13.710> problem<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.190> like<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.460> said<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:16.040> this

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
but my problem is like I said this this

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.790 
but my problem is like I said this this
marker<00:02:17.690> doesn't<00:02:18.690> want<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.900> stretch<00:02:20.450> over<00:02:21.450> to

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
marker doesn't want to stretch over to

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.960 
marker doesn't want to stretch over to
the<00:02:22.800> tooth<00:02:23.100> where<00:02:23.340> it's<00:02:23.490> supposed<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.820> be

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
the tooth where it's supposed to be

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.790 
the tooth where it's supposed to be
sitting<00:02:24.300> on<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:24.570> tooth<00:02:24.810> right<00:02:25.080> here<00:02:25.110> just<00:02:25.560> I

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
sitting on this tooth right here just I

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.080 
sitting on this tooth right here just I
can't<00:02:26.280> get<00:02:26.460> it<00:02:26.640> unless<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:28.730> rotate<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.790> and

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
can't get it unless I I rotate it and

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.240 
can't get it unless I I rotate it and
then<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.360> throws<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.810> timing<00:02:31.200> off<00:02:31.320> here<00:02:31.650> so

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
then that throws the timing off here so

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.760 
then that throws the timing off here so
I<00:02:32.790> don't<00:02:33.720> know<00:02:33.810> I'm<00:02:34.080> not<00:02:34.170> sure<00:02:34.470> if<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.680> did

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
I don't know I'm not sure if I did

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:41.560 
I don't know I'm not sure if I did
something<00:02:35.220> wrong<00:02:35.430> or<00:02:36.300> what's<00:02:37.110> going<00:02:37.380> on<00:02:37.620> but

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570
