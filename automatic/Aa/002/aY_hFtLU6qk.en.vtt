00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 musculoskeletal system anatomy muscles 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.009
 of the thigh 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 in this video we will analyze the various 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.000
 groups of thigh muscles that like 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.550
 you can see them looking like a 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.690
 together quite complex in reality 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.940
 dividing them according to theirs 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.590
 their main features 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.420
 quite simple description 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.820
 let's start with the group 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.369
 superficial anterior is in fact 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.800
 of muscles and are located in front of the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.519
 thigh and who are immediately below 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.590
 of the skin 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.500
 it is the tensor of the lata band 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.200
 and of the sartorius muscle the tensor of the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.420
 fascia lata and a rudimentary muscle that 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.270
 originates from the anterior iliac spine 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.160
 higher and moves down with a 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.200
 small muscle belly that immediately 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.960
 becomes a vast poses that goes to 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.300
 fit on with the side of the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.820
 tibia on his face just outside 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.620
 this muscle melts his pole and rosie 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.250
 with the fascia lata covering the muscles 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.320
 of the thigh 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.480
 its action will be of simple tension 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.000
 of this band santoro instead a 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.190
 most interesting muscle its origin 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.559
 it is always at the level of the heli spine 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.680
 I sing his superior while he is 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.840
 directs down is on average passing 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.500
 then on the medial side of the leg 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.119
 until it reaches the face 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.369
 medial tibia level one 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.710
 very important structure the tendon a 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.100
 goose leg a triangular structure 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.350
 with front base and posterior apex 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.290
 which is also shared with the muscles 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.329
 the muscle is weak and semi-tendinous 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.950
 sartorio given the direction of his 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.409
 fibers its origin its insertion 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.560
 it will help in making a move 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.020
 very particular ie flexing the leg 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.570
 on the thigh and thigh on the pelvis e 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.340
 rotate the thigh outwards 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.140
 in this way a position is obtained 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.600
 typical of the crossing of the legs 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.140
 which was used by tailors in theirs 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.700
 craft 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.369
 for this reason this muscle comes 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.899
 said sartorius then exists a group of 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.880
 constituted front muscles 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.920
 practically of the components of the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.899
 quadriceps quadriceps femoris 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.180
 femoral as you can see in 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.850
 this image from a muscle rather 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.399
 large is formed by four heads like 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.619
 the name says the first is the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.560
 so-called femoral rectum that originates 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.780
 from the thorns the lower song 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.120
 fit on the pan behind the rectum 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.760
 of the femur we find three other heads the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.770
 first the vast lateral original of 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.540
 below the great trochantere eva 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.760
 also fit on the pan the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.950
 your intermediate originating at the line 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.540
 interpro chater front for 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.050
 make yourself fit on the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.110
 cooking pan 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.480
 finally the vast media originates from 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.760
 medial lip of the rough line yes 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.610
 leads down and fits like i 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.410
 others on the pan for which it rolls 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.430
 represents the common insertion of 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.709
 this muscle 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.630
 actually the four tendons of these 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.030
 leaders remain separated until this 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.700
 point but at the level of the patella yes 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.560
 unite in a single fibrous structure 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.510
 that wraps the kneecap in the retina furnaces 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.610
 coli described in the articulation of the 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.130
 knee and goes to fit on 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.160
 Tibial tuberosity that is found immediately 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.640
 in front of the tibia below the 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.590
 kennels 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.170
 the action of this muscle and vital 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.110
 since it extends the leg and flexes the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.660
 thigh on the trunk there is then a group more 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.510
 complex that of the medial muscles that 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.209
 made up of different muscular garments from 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.829
 different length but with an origin 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.470
 similar to that at arm level 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.510
 public the pectineus muscle originates 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.030
 from the crest combs to the level of the pubis 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.069
 to go and insert in the third 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.040
 upper part of the rough line of the femur 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.739
 with its action it adds flexes and rotates 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.859
 sideways the thigh the short lead 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.500
 and a muscle that originates from the tubercle 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:46.290
 public and triangular in shape opens 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.150
 fan-shaped and inserted at the border between 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.859
 the upper third the middle third of the 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.359
 rough line of the femur 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.910
 its action will be that of adduction 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.790
 of the thigh in addition to its rotation 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.489
 external the long lead as the 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.380
 name itself goes lower 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.389
 always originates from the public tubercle e 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.410
 fits into the middle third of the line 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.600
 rough of the femur 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.030
 its action will be similar but with one 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.100
 force majeure more in depth e 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.430
 placed another adductor muscle 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:17.669
 great or at doctor magnus this muscle 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.289
 it has a slightly different origin as it is 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.180
 can observe that it is born at the level of 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.460
 public risk arm his 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.650
 listing as the name implies is 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.750
 wide and takes almost the entire line 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.720
 sour 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.150
 plus its backside that 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.430
 originates from the ischical arm can 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.000
 fit on the medial p of the 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.400
 femur 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.190
 his overall action will be 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.010
 that of adduction of the thigh in addition to 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.050
 mediate the last external rotation 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.810
 of the medial muscles and the gracilis muscle 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.790
 which also originates at the level of 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.340
 branca ischio publishes and moves into 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.510
 low to go and insert with the 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.430
 goose leg tendon 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.740
 in the same insertion point of the 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.780
 sartorius, however, given his departure 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.990
 medial its action will be simple 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.300
 adduction in part of internal rotation 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.610
 the last group is the muscle group 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.320
 back of the leg one of the most 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.750
 characteristic of these muscles of 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.790
 certainly the hamstring that originates 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.380
 as the name implies with two items the 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.780
 long-term origin of the tuberosity 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.790
 ischia tick to the short one from the middle 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.560
 lower than the rough lines of the femur 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.020
 the two bellies unite in one 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.360
 tendon that fits over the head 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.910
 of the fibula with its action to this 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.450
 muscle flexes the leg and extends the 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:34.930
 thigh in addition to screaming using the 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.610
 the semitendinosus muscle is extended 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.080
 originates from the ischia tuberosity tica 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.050
 owes its name to the fact that 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.540
 roughly in the middle of his journey 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.580
 along the leg it turns into a thin one 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.070
 tendon which then goes to the level 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.680
 of the goose leg tendon shared with the 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.890
 frail and with the sartorius his action 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.200
 will be that of extension of the thigh and 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.000
 flexion of the leg but saw his 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.580
 insertion point will also be capable of 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.540
 mediate an internal rotation of the limb 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.630
 lower 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.860
 finally there is the semimembranosus muscle 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.080
 oregina also from tuberosity 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.120
 ischia and owes its name to the fact 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.919
 which in its second half is converted 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.620
 in a vast 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.450
 onerous that then finds insertion 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.250
 on the back face of the condyle 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.140
 medial of the tibia 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.669
 its action is superimposable on that 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.919
 of the semitendinosus muscle 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:27.320
 this video was shot with anatomy 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:31.030
