00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.730
 I am the georgios and you stay with me 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.389
 in this video I'm going to teach you 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.309
 make this plan and see the art with me 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.309
 come with me, I show you how to perform 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.090
 and the materials needed for this 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.790
 craft are cardboard a pencil a brush 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.860
 acrylic paints fabric white 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.930
 scissors a rubber to erase a 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.550
 rule or a squad and a machine to 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.559
 sew well then let's take then 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.170
 a cardboard on this surface of 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.210
 cardboard we will form the design of a 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.370
 flap and for this case I'm going to form 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.470
 only the outline so with help 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.360
 of a clear pencil let's start but 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.489
 so that the lines are straight 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.530
 I will also help with the rule or the 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.869
 squad well well done this let's 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.940
 start making an outline for 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:04.100
 this can help from an image to 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.049
 follow it or guide or clear you can 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.240
 even print an image for later 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.400
 outline on your cardboard in this case 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.470
 I will do it in a calculated way 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.470
 but good everything will depend on you 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.060
 and good having the template marked 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.800
 so now we're going to cut it out and 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.960
 once the template has been cut 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.730
 will be this way well we already have the 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.830
 made template we already have what it takes 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.780
 to mark the outline so good now 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.160
 it will be necessary to mark it then but 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.260
 this occasion on the web 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.150
 we're going to need two obviously so 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.070
 I recommend that you do it once 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.480
 double and the lime that over it to have 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.480
 well and two parts 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.200
 well now it will be necessary to perform the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.120
 sewing machine sewing'll 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.370
 sew around the clear outline seeing you 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.380
 for this line that we have marked in this 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.300
 purple case so once things 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.550
 all the outline taking into account that 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.680
 you must leave this part without sewing 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.840
 top or this bottom part that you 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.460
 you want to leave that space 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.920
 It will just serve us to give you the 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.320
 return to leave the right outside the 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.920
 seams inside and good for me 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.300
 then also fill in the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.300
 body of the flap and see 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.200
 and we turn it around and well the 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.480
 next step now will be fill it with 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.490
 sponge with cotton with what you have to 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.590
 the hand so that it is tight 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.480
 well chubby and we can now if 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.030
 paint and once you have it well 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.650
 sponge stuffed tight as 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.810
 then now it will be necessary to close 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.450
 this opening that we stayed here for 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.000
 let it determined the 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.660
 details of the face and body of the flap 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.760
 and bolt 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.800
 in this way we will get to give 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.230
 the details with the painting later 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.510
 and now we are going to start painting 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.990
 for this work we will use paintings 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.990
 acrylic 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.650
 no no 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.260
 yes 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.120
 Y 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.209
 ah 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.250
 yes 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.189
 and good the final result then it will be 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.659
 something like this I hope that I have 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:06.549
