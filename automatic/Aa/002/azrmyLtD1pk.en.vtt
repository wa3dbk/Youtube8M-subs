when we're doing the canter figure eight
we're<00:00:44.190> going<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.370> do<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> simple<00:00:44.760> change<00:00:45.120> of

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
we're going to do a simple change of

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.869 
we're going to do a simple change of
lead<00:00:45.510> not<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> flying<00:00:46.260> change<00:00:46.590> as<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:47.700> more

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
lead not a flying change as you get more

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.639 
lead not a flying change as you get more
advanced<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.539> change<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.170> up<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.500> do

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
advanced you can change it up and do

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.510 
advanced you can change it up and do
flying<00:00:49.980> lead<00:00:50.430> changes<00:00:50.910> for<00:00:51.660> your<00:00:51.780> transition

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
flying lead changes for your transition

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.770 
flying lead changes for your transition
and<00:00:53.520> when<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> sitting<00:00:54.390> chart<00:00:54.629> after

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
and when you do the sitting chart after

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.020 
and when you do the sitting chart after
the<00:00:55.020> canter<00:00:55.440> that's<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.489> little<00:00:56.640> bit<00:00:56.850> more

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
the canter that's a little bit more

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.250 
the canter that's a little bit more
advanced<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.780> have<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.960> bring<00:00:58.050> them

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
advanced because you have to bring them

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.630 
advanced because you have to bring them
back<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.469> collect<00:00:58.949> them<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.250> slow<00:00:59.489> them<00:00:59.609> down

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
back and collect them and slow them down

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.779 
back and collect them and slow them down
into<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.180> nice<00:01:00.449> position<00:01:01.219> pretty<00:01:02.219> quickly

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
into a nice position pretty quickly

into a nice position pretty quickly
alright<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.899> figure<00:01:04.320> eight<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.769> be

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
alright so figure eight it's going to be

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.399 
alright so figure eight it's going to be
in<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.010> shape<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:06.119> letter<00:01:06.360> eight<00:01:06.659> we

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
in the shape of the letter eight we

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.530 
in the shape of the letter eight we
always<00:01:07.740> come<00:01:08.010> straight<00:01:08.400> up<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.700> middle<00:01:08.850> just

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
always come straight up the middle just

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.149 
always come straight up the middle just
where<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.869> horse<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.320> standing<00:01:10.530> now<00:01:10.860> that's
