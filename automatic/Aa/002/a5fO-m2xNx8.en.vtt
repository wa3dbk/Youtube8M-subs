00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.040
 Hi I decided to make a ram tea and I'm going 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.529
 to show you is very simple and the 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.029
 ingredients and the way I have it 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:24.910
 in the fridge today I'm going to use an egg 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.230
 carrot pod and I'm going to use this seasoning 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.149
 here to make art aham 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.980
 the market has several flavors but is what 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:34.690
 I like the most in here comes three 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.360
 what 's the use of that? 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.309
 only one and the run is clear that my 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.899
 pan 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.980
 Now I'll show you how it is that 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.350
 I do 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.160
 in it I will refog the washing with the 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.410
 carrot 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.760
 I'll put a little butter and 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.120
 a strand of olive oil 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.399
 in the sequence I add the egg and then 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.390
 the amount of rice will depend on the 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.390
 How much do you want? 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:04.649
 A little here on the plate is like this. 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.869
 I like to do as I have rice 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.450
 left over do not have much idea and I do not want 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.090
 play outside then already to enjoy 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.519
 I like to make Shaham's a good dish. 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.560
 simple but is very tasty 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:20.750
 I hope you have enjoyed it until 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.750
