00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.670 

my<00:02:01.850> thought<00:02:02.150> said<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:02.750> you<00:02:02.869> because<00:02:03.260> you<00:02:03.650> just

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
my thought said to you because you just

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.109 
my thought said to you because you just
don't<00:02:04.100> see<00:02:04.549> them<00:02:04.760> so<00:02:06.310> this<00:02:07.310> is<00:02:07.549> proof<00:02:07.850> they

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
don't see them so this is proof they

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.140 
don't see them so this is proof they
really<00:02:08.450> were<00:02:08.630> produced
