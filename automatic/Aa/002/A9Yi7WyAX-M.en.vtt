like seven generations or now we have to
care<00:06:53.870> about<00:06:53.900> that<00:06:54.349> we're<00:06:55.250> going<00:06:55.430> to<00:06:55.520> happen

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
care about that we're going to happen

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.719 
care about that we're going to happen
we're<00:06:56.630> going<00:06:56.780> to<00:06:56.930> have<00:06:57.080> to<00:06:57.259> maybe<00:06:57.470> even<00:06:58.220> think

00:06:58.719 --> 00:06:58.729 
we're going to have to maybe even think

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:02.379 
we're going to have to maybe even think
about<00:06:58.909> what<00:06:59.509> do<00:06:59.690> I<00:06:59.750> want<00:07:00.490> as<00:07:01.490> opposed<00:07:02.060> to<00:07:02.360> what

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:02.389 
about what do I want as opposed to what

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:05.620 
about what do I want as opposed to what
do<00:07:02.690> I<00:07:02.750> need<00:07:03.070> we<00:07:04.070> have<00:07:04.310> to<00:07:04.430> recalibrate<00:07:05.090> in<00:07:05.509> our

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:05.630 
do I need we have to recalibrate in our

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.870 
do I need we have to recalibrate in our
mind<00:07:05.900> what<00:07:06.440> a<00:07:06.470> needs<00:07:06.830> and<00:07:07.250> what<00:07:07.340> it<00:07:07.490> wants

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:07.880 
mind what a needs and what it wants

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.939 
mind what a needs and what it wants
those<00:07:08.360> are<00:07:08.539> things<00:07:08.659> that<00:07:08.810> we<00:07:08.990> have<00:07:09.199> to<00:07:09.259> do<00:07:09.530> but

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:09.949 
those are things that we have to do but

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:11.620 
those are things that we have to do but
that's<00:07:10.159> the<00:07:10.370> embodiment<00:07:11.000> of<00:07:11.120> our<00:07:11.419> own

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.630 
that's the embodiment of our own

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.260 
that's the embodiment of our own
transformation<00:07:12.110> at<00:07:13.009> the<00:07:13.310> embodiment<00:07:13.940> of<00:07:14.030> our

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.270 
transformation at the embodiment of our

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.330 
transformation at the embodiment of our
own<00:07:14.479> evolution<00:07:14.719> this<00:07:15.590> is<00:07:15.800> what<00:07:15.979> this<00:07:16.159> is<00:07:16.250> about

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:16.340 
own evolution this is what this is about

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.969 
own evolution this is what this is about
all<00:07:16.969> these<00:07:17.389> are<00:07:17.599> right<00:07:17.750> now<00:07:17.930> what<00:07:18.650> it's<00:07:18.800> going

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:18.979 
all these are right now what it's going

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:21.219 
all these are right now what it's going
to<00:07:19.070> look<00:07:19.130> like<00:07:19.250> we<00:07:19.580> don't<00:07:19.699> know<00:07:19.909> I<00:07:20.180> don't<00:07:21.139> have

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:21.229 
to look like we don't know I don't have

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:22.779 
to look like we don't know I don't have
a<00:07:21.289> crystal<00:07:21.560> ball<00:07:21.740> none<00:07:22.099> of<00:07:22.130> us<00:07:22.280> I'm<00:07:22.520> you<00:07:22.669> have<00:07:22.759> a

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:22.789 
a crystal ball none of us I'm you have a

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:25.420 
a crystal ball none of us I'm you have a
crystal<00:07:23.210> ball<00:07:23.240> but<00:07:23.810> we<00:07:24.020> work<00:07:24.229> at<00:07:24.409> something<00:07:24.830> we

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.430 
crystal ball but we work at something we

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.850 
crystal ball but we work at something we
know<00:07:25.639> give<00:07:26.360> it<00:07:26.479> our<00:07:26.599> strengths<00:07:27.020> and<00:07:27.050> based<00:07:27.680> in
