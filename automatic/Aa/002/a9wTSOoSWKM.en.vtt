00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
help us take a look as Robert Craig

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.169 
help us take a look as Robert Craig
designer<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.260> Craig<00:00:10.590> Kat<00:00:10.950> yes<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.670> Robert

designer of the Craig Kat yes and Robert

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.940 
designer of the Craig Kat yes and Robert
this<00:00:12.360> just<00:00:12.690> looks<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.230> feels<00:00:13.500> different<00:00:13.920> from

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
this just looks and feels different from

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.369 
this just looks and feels different from
other<00:00:14.190> boats<00:00:14.490> well<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.660> difference<00:00:16.170> too

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
other boats well it is difference too

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.660 
other boats well it is difference too
and<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.619> reason<00:00:16.650> why<00:00:16.949> we<00:00:17.070> design<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.520> so

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
and the reason why we design it so

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.670 
and the reason why we design it so
differently<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.270> because<00:00:18.570> we<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:19.260> wanted<00:00:19.560> to

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
differently is because we we wanted to

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.340 
differently is because we we wanted to
both<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.039> have<00:00:20.310> be<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> small<00:00:21.600> boat<00:00:21.840> but<00:00:22.109> have

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
both to have be a small boat but have

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.170 
both to have be a small boat but have
big<00:00:22.650> boat<00:00:22.859> characteristic<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.760> does<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.090> other

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
big boat characteristic it does in other

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
words have the stability of a large boat

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.439 
words have the stability of a large boat
right<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.340> comfort<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.849> large<00:00:27.029> boat<00:00:27.300> and

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
right the comfort of a large boat and

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.179 
right the comfort of a large boat and
have<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> side-by-side<00:00:27.840> seating<00:00:28.410> yeah<00:00:28.949> and

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
have a side-by-side seating yeah and

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.830 
have a side-by-side seating yeah and
first<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.519> all<00:00:29.550> we<00:00:29.670> notice<00:00:29.820> how<00:00:30.029> easy<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.630> to

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
first of all we notice how easy it is to

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.359 
first of all we notice how easy it is to
get<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.170> water<00:00:31.320> that's<00:00:31.710> exactly<00:00:32.160> right

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
get in the water that's exactly right

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.430 
get in the water that's exactly right
and<00:00:32.700> if<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.940> notice<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> pontoons<00:00:33.809> are<00:00:34.110> wider

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
and if you notice the pontoons are wider

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.780 
and if you notice the pontoons are wider
than<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.800> distance<00:00:35.010> between<00:00:35.190> them<00:00:35.520> right

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
than the distance between them right

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.160 
than the distance between them right
this<00:00:35.940> gives<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.239> boat<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> lot<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.780> lift<00:00:36.960> it's

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
this gives the boat a lot of lift it's

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.630 
this gives the boat a lot of lift it's
great<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.860> rough<00:00:38.129> water

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
great in rough water

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.860 
great in rough water
yeah<00:00:38.790> that's<00:00:39.000> gain<00:00:39.180> take<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.480> out<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:39.780> it's

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
yeah that's gain take it out but it's

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.299 
yeah that's gain take it out but it's
nice<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.140> have<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.379> capability<00:00:40.530> here<00:00:41.100> let's

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
nice to have that capability here let's

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.350 
nice to have that capability here let's
step<00:00:41.520> inside<00:00:41.670> there<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.059> show<00:00:42.149> them<00:00:42.210> how

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
step inside there and show them how

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.240 
step inside there and show them how
