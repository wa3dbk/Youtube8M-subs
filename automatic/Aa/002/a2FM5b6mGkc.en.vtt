00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.080
 you 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.080
 Yes 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.340
 that we have lost sight of these 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.869
 last time since ps2 actually 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.910
 but shinobi sar is basically one of 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.710
 biggest sega licenses in all 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.199
 case in the 80s then in the 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.269
 90s on megadrive and that's sega a 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.030
 finally decided to make a new 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.530
 version of this game that has been entrusted to 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.839
 Western people welcome Tony James 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.610
 but despite all that tonita managed to 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.780
 synthesize what makes the 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.780
 shinobi power on 3ds 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.280
 must be aware shinobi is 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.930
 first and foremost a trip for the players to 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.030
 the old one ie that's when 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.469
 even a game that basically really hard 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.329
 is really thought for the challenge 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.070
 ie at the bottom of the screen 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.710
 cancers of the 3ds you always go 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.780
 have a score that appears a score 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.490
 which is expressed in tens of millions in 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.680
 meaning where the least action you have 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.240
 realized is going to be gratified with points is 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.530
 however we will be cut off 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.700
 if you play badly it means that it 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.700
 really reward the players who have 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.320
 perseverance and intelligence of 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.149
 continue to pursue their adventure 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.649
 for example a guard system that is 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.479
 very push that is to say that instead 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.070
 to have a guard that protects from everything 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.929
 will have to step on the stack at the right time 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.909
 otherwise you'll see you're cut off 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.280
 and your multiplier also reduce 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.990
 so who is it going to have to really 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.100
 master the levels learn them by 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.090
 heart and it's not obvious because 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.920
 everything has been thought 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.000
 yet even to put you full 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.920
 of pitfalls as and when 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.500
 example here you go see seals 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.759
 really pixel to realize you're going 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.869
 always have a ninja waiting for you 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.030
 in the corner to swing a shuriken 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.080
 the enemies are also relatively well 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.789
 thought ie they all have 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.740
 skates attac relatively varied so 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.330
 it's really a permanent challenge 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.920
 but despite everything they still did 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.239
 some small concessions for the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.330
 game remains difficult but accessible 

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:00.330
 as well 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.110
 after the old shinobi fans 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.060
 especially sega also find you 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.740
 a lot of small damage scattered around 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.770
 as the game is already playing 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.260
 first stage you are a horse ride 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.390
 in the image of shinobi iii then you will 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.070
 find you on a plane so 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.060
 afterburner you'll have to make some 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.330
 dangerous jumps eliminate all 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.740
 enemies 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.870
 it's hot enough but it's well thought out 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.630
 you also have all the bonus courses say 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.040
 that must have a lot of dementia 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.209
 hidden in the sets and if you 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.320
 the help blog you want to be entitled 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.030
 bonus internships at the end of the internship at 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.110
 the old one where you have the ninjas lining up 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.450
 in front of you you have to launch from this 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.190
 weekend to light them so you have 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.600
 really always full of lots of 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.160
 little references like that to the old 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.780
 shinobi for example by a boss that a 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.670
 helicopter as the map in the 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.090
 version master system the gossip navas 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.860
 obviously id so the big boss of a 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.940
 previous hobby no really they have 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.170
 managed to take back all the elements in 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.030
 makes the mythology china to the cities 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.930
 for condensed and really offer 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.930
 to the fans what they expect 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.950
 the only little flaw that I find knew 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.470
 nomi is still its relative 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.790
 we will say that aesthetic level is 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.069
 not yet that they wanted to make a 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.830
 biased a bit more western-style 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.750
 a little less cartoon the manga we go 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.250
 say and it is felt particularly in the 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.110
 various intermediate sequences 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.030
 but despite everything when it's at stake 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.680
 not super nice that is to say that the 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.830
 environments are sometimes pretty square 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.200
 must polygons on the screen and then 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.489
 same overall it's not pretty in 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.660
 terms of in terms of pallets 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.970
 graphics has a lot of environments 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.200
 a little dark so it's a little bit 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.549
 of gasoline this point of view despite everything we 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.380
 feel that they wanted to exploit the 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.360
 3d you have a lot of sequences that 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.720
 exploit it goes especially the phases to 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.700
 horse phases when you're in 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.730
 skateboard on the ocean where you use the 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.420
 gyro function to direct you 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.650
 here are some small things 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.690
 even though they do that the 3d is 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.010
 well operated beating especially in the 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.360
 passage way the teeth of the sea or 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.390
 of a shark that comes to bump without 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.040
 stop on the on the metal tube 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.720
 when you are progressing at the level of the 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.049
 3d this movie well exploited every internship at 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.519
 100 its small 3d feature but it's still 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.670
 a game a little bit d often without a plan 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.670
 graphic 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.400
 I was really surprised by the 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.140
 3d system because it succeeds in 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.159
 synthesize a gameplay 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.870
 really old school 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.280
 I'm listening to you that could have been improved 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.650
 but still well present with 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.660
 especially a fine use of 3d 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.040
 is really a permanent challenge 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.680
 that is, for those who love 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.790
 scoring scores and that's the 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.240
 challenge seville really 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.910
 answering 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.139
 knowing that in addition you can record 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.130
 its progression at the end of the level for 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.570
 really revisited review the action to head 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.100
 rested to see the passages where you 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.150
 can you improve you also have 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.550
 challenge that can be exchanged at 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.729
 streetpass level will find on 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.780
 bonus challenge levels that you go for 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.539
 interact with other players 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.580
 so really terms of content and in 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.710
 terms of damage 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.949
 shinobi 3ds is really really about 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.949
 mag tour 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.020
 he
