 We continue to talk about small towns 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.850
 Russia today we will go to Moscow Region 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.710
 re-re-light in the middle of the last century 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.750
 built it as a test site 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.790
 without which there would be no space 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.870
 achievements of the Soviet Union and here in 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.759
 twenty first century 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.949
 the city has opened a platform for 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.619
 reaching sports tamara shornikova 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.109
 tell more details re-light says 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.670
 young just 14 years ago it was 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.939
 village new building 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.859
 he appeared in 1948 when here 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.830
 started building a test center 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.719
 missile technology learn about first flights 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.480
 and the beginning of a new star era in history 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.520
 countries can be in the city museum true 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.070
 find it is not just hidden inside 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.610
 residential neighborhood for inconspicuous 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.129
 fence the first exhibits immediately behind him 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.980
 the nose compartment of the ship is buran engines 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.840
 first rockets the museum building itself the former 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.000
 suburban residence of the king 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.590
 the building was built specifically for 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.149
 Sergey is better than Korolev 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.350
 in 1950 despite the almost secret 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.870
 museum opening hours 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.140
 in six years 15000 have been here 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.820
 a man from 24 countries Michael tails 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.760
 tells tourists about the past and 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.020
 present space power 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.820
 Be sure to record a conversation 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.860
 queens with gagarin before the first 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.110
 flight is an attempt to explain 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.930
 visitors are almost lost by the country 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.700
 feeling we didn't even realize that 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.790
 is a rocket as it flies 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.799
 but we had tremendous pride in 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:36.630
 the fact that we are the first we are ahead of the Americans 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:39.990
 we were ahead of everyone in the newspapers typing 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.439
 message to each 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.549
 Well, the region is the region of our country that in 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.680
 such a time I lived in Bashkiria 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.890
 will fly this satellite and all 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.079
 went out from young to old looked at 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.149
 this star as king choose 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.549
 the site for the test center exactly 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.409
 unknown according to one of the version noticed 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.360
 suitable terrain during one of 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.310
 flight street built one by one 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.710
 one of the first appeared Soviet 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.470
 a big building went around one 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.290
 Institute not Himmah passed here 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.440
 first tests in the Soviet Union 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.440
 spacecraft 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.440
 to the largest in Russia test 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.420
 booth tested first 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.450
 intercontinental ballistic missile 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.450
 r-7 of the queen 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.070
 preparation for the rocket test 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:40.110
 hangar section 12 is expected 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:42.880
 according to the schedule January 1, 2015 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.120
 preparing for each trial takes 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.100
 about a year all for the sake of 200 seconds exactly 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.590
 so much the final stage of verification 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.590
 engine operation all conditions as in 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.430
 real run time 200 seconds of this 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.680
 they fly by 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.620
 before then something fast for someone for 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.840
 test lead this this this 200 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.510
 seconds probably I think so half a year 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.160
 time in the years of perestroika 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.260
 funding curtailed fire tests 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.200
 the company was not fifteen years old 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.280
 a team of 7,000 people declined more 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.430
 than half 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:20.080
 the average age of workers here is even 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:22.900
 we are in the department is probably about 55-60 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.470
 years one of the reasons why young people are not 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.150
 This is the proximity of Moscow, Moscow, of course 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.820
 with their salaries level we do not 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.180
 such as in Moscow, in principle, little one 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.670
 from my let's go here here 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.280
 Vladimir Mitrofanov came to his 61 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.920
 on the contrary half a century passed in seconds 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.070
 more recently, the tests were similar to 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.070
 living reality from science fiction 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:51.190
 to experience the moon rover needed here 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.750
 in the chamber to create a simulator of the lunar soil 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.510
 and so on this imitator moon 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.330
 the primer needed to install the moon rover 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:03.280
 create the conditions that allowed him 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:06.950
 first you on the go go through the moon 10 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.350
 kilometers 700 meters in artificial 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.480
 outer space is truly a vacuum 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.800
 temperature minus one hundred ninety three 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.200
 degrees centigrade 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.600
 New tests are taking place here today. 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.390
 now task number one is to make your 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.760
 contribution to the exploration of distant planets 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.400
 experts try to circumvent rivals in 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.930
 space race athletes hone 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.090
 craftsmanship wet modern 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.370
 sports complex in the city built in 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.590
 hockey players train here last year 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.630
 and football players and basketball players here 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:43.370
 skiers come from all over Moscow 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.919
 Moscow area such routes but God forbid 2 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.070
 and in our area such from time people 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.960
 enjoy a lot of reviews on the Internet 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.550
 serious athletes come in this 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.560
 year in the city are going to build 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.750
 covered ice trails 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.090
 biathlon center possible through 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.340
 a few years you can see a new star 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.810
 will not only be in outer space but also 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.340
 very close in the native courtyard of overexposure 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.130
 by the way one of the youngest cities 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.080
 Russia received its status in 2000 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.100
 before it was a village with a straightforward 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.140
 by name 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.850
 the new building by the way it will appear it could 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.220
 any other part of the suburbs even for 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.660
 its outside commission chose a place under 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.610
 special test site 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.100
 criteria not less than 100 kilometers from 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.750
 capital wooded area with ravines and 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.090
 river channels to dump 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.430
 waste substances in the end the choice fell 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.479
 on Sergiev Posad then he called 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.479
 fence district
