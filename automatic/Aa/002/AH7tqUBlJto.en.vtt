around the equipment until it's holding

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.920 
around the equipment until it's holding
the<00:00:39.120> product<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:40.110> safe<00:00:40.790> position<00:00:41.840> for<00:00:42.840> you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
to use so that fellow will do let's say

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.660 
to use so that fellow will do let's say
this<00:00:45.329> up<00:00:45.600> now<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.469> can<00:00:46.680> get<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> idea<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.489> why

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
this up now you can get the idea of why

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.850 
this up now you can get the idea of why
it's<00:00:47.820> called<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.149> spider<00:00:48.510> podium<00:00:49.050> because<00:00:49.230> it's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
it's called a spider podium because it's

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.540

got eight legs like a spider here so

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.040 
got eight legs like a spider here so
you've<00:00:53.670> got<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.969> main<00:00:54.180> sort<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.480> body<00:00:54.719> into

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
which all the legs connect and then

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.500 
which all the legs connect and then
you've<00:00:56.910> got<00:00:57.140> four<00:00:58.399> manipulative<00:00:59.399> legs<00:01:00.120> on

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
you've got four manipulative legs on

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.990 
you've got four manipulative legs on
either<00:01:00.960> side<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.800> bend<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.609> twist

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
own I mean this isn't the best example

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.499 
own I mean this isn't the best example
of<00:01:37.530> what<00:01:37.650> I've<00:01:37.770> done<00:01:37.799> here<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.299> see

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
of what I've done here but you can see

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.109 
of what I've done here but you can see
us<00:01:39.600> with<00:01:39.810> grip<00:01:40.110> around<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.950> like<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.790> stood

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
us with grip around it like so and stood

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.530 
us with grip around it like so and stood
up<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:43.079> portrait<00:01:43.409> mode<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.189> might<00:01:45.090> decide

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
up in the portrait mode I might decide

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.630 
up in the portrait mode I might decide
that<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.740> want<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.549> use<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:49.560> attach<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.610> a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
that I want to use this to attach to a

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.600 
that I want to use this to attach to a
headrest<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:52.409> car<00:01:52.680> or<00:01:52.920> something<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.549> I

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
headrest in the car or something so I

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.569 
headrest in the car or something so I
could<00:01:54.259> do<00:01:55.259> something<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.219> then

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
could do something like this and then

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.249 
could do something like this and then
I've<00:01:56.670> got<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.939> legs<00:01:57.180> at<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.479> top<00:01:57.780> here<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.200> I

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
I've got the legs at the top here that I

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.410 
I've got the legs at the top here that I
can<00:01:58.320> tie<00:01:58.770> around<00:01:59.390> the<00:02:01.430> headrest<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.640> secure

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
can tie around the headrest and secure

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.280 
can tie around the headrest and secure
it<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.990> landscape<00:02:04.549> orientation<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:06.600> you've

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
it in a landscape orientation so you've

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.199 
it in a landscape orientation so you've
got<00:02:07.320> lots<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.829> flexibility<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.670> terms<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:09.030> what

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
got lots of flexibility in terms of what

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.460 
got lots of flexibility in terms of what
you<00:02:09.330> can<00:02:09.509> do<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:09.929> going<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.259> take<00:02:10.440> a

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
you can do is just going to take a

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.330 
you can do is just going to take a
couple<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.979> minutes

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
couple of minutes
