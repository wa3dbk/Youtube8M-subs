00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.050
 tournament information but first what 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.750
 first of all let's see what 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.300
 people have entered the tournament look like 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.990

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.330

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:39.560
 if it is well tired ant 2 in the 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.690
 tomorrow it's fine canyon but if these are 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.340
 the people who are seeing that they have 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.220
 entered the tournament are not the only 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.660
 still after this video 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.730
 obviously more people do not know 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.649
 worry and good 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.649
 what can I say to the tournament 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.150
 as I said from I said to all 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.140
 those people who are watching the tournament 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.190
 it will be 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.070
 as 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.100
 as you have asked me for one another 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.710
 they have asked me for it but not the majority 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.870
 is asking for it to be mail and just 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.200
 secure 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:20.420
 and well I'm going to put these options to 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.640
 the people who will perceive it will 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.520
 participate in the tournament on the 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.590
 protection to win are going to be 50 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:32.070
 teams here is going to be this 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.950
 these are the e-mail options 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.130
 kinsler and they look 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.350
 to see them and if they want a change 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.340
 can you tell me these are the weapon 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.549
 main will be to line up 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.710
 the secondary weapon you do not go to any and 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:53.409
 this also goes down now the diver 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:56.960
 quick because he wants to teach you what 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.820
 burning to burn to play in the 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.520
 tournament 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.040
 and if this is the most basic thing if you 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.120
 they want a change in these aspects 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.660
 these weapons these 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.230
 these options in general of the game 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.930
 of the tournament 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.260
 can not say down here they can not 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.480
 tell 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.290
 today it is visible because you can change 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:24.280
 this because I do not know how to play very well with 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.800
 with this phase because if they can not be 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.930
 just the comments I'll see with a lot 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.079
 I can change it 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.799
 but I will also ask a question for 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:37.329
 all of you in me that mark who 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:42.099
 latin tournament 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:43.390
 I will ask you a question of whether I am going to 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.519
 say hey 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.829
 hear I can change this is 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:51.790
 saying a guy that if I could change 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:54.000
 that's the same and if everyone responds that they do not 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.530
 I'm going to respond to Saturday and then everything 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.670
 all the team all those who are 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.080
 participating they want they do not like the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.320
 idea that to change this 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:10.580
 well I will do this does the tournament is 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:13.700

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:23.000

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:27.040
 mlg well here in are acronyms in English that 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.420

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.689
 people can play this pro yes this 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.510
 is the map I hope you like nothing if 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:42.909
 you can still change the map everything to me 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.459
 they can say in the comments all the 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:47.459
 but here we are playing the mushroom 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:56.099
 I'm just killing me killing me I just 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.720

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.340
 they like that idea everything can be changed 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.400

 the other weapon that is that the rifle 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.819

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.819
 the smartphone 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:24.669

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.580
 powers that you can system make 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:30.460
