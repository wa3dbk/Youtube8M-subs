00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.270
 hello good other guys today I'm going to 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.640
 teach how to put our music 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.780
 preferred in minecraft we will do 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.579
 with sony others or with any any 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.480
 program with which you can change to 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:20.720
 format or hehe what I think we have 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.050
 what to do is go to 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.490
 run 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.760
 we put oil roaming data point 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.130
 Minecraft 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.410
 and we are going to resurface 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.200
 here is a folder called music 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.800
 music 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.800
 and here are two parts with him we have to 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:47.649
 create is 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.649
 well first we open and sonny themes 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:58.020
 and we play the music you want 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.020
 I'm going to take one that I have around here 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.550
 we put here we have to do 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.620
 good 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.820
 and we come to render as 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:21.130
 and put well together and what 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.130
 we call with 4 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.240
 they die 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.440
 We perform 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.210
 and we hope that he will surrender 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:45.510
 once it has been rendered 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.510
 we take where they project 4 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.590
 we cut 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.180
 the other one is the music folder 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.409
 we leave with colom 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.210
 and it is already 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.100
 then you can delete are 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.610
 so that it lasts but then they become 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.870
 to create 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.450
 it will be better and good now it would have 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.540
 complain when you arrive a while in 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.770
 minecraft and what this elite visit 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.770
 it starts to sound typical 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.680
 the typical 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:30.700
 atypical music is therefore we think this 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.700
 as this 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.430
 this shit is not the same 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.140
 this music also dictates music 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:49.080
 quiet of minecraft but I'm going to 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.080
 erase so you try that on this 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.960
 We are in this little house and I will not wait 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.220
 until it sounds 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.220
 to be able to teach 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:11.550
 well this a while and has not won anything 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.160
 sorry but 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.720
 I'll already have that on the video 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.720
 home table when a bored 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:27.170

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.950

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.090

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.120

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:48.430

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.780
