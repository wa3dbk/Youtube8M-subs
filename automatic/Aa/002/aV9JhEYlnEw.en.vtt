00:00:01.125 --> 00:00:03.098
 And now we will talk about ... 

00:00:03.486 --> 00:00:04.837
 Sorry, you talk. 

00:00:11.072 --> 00:00:16.868
 Now let's talk about José Mourinho. In general, do you think he will leave after the season? 

00:00:16.868 --> 00:00:20.087
 Dude, I hope, Mourinho is a shame for football. 

00:00:21.437 --> 00:00:27.538
 You're right. We'll see if it finally goes away, we'll be able to focus on what really interests us, how ... 

00:00:28.055 --> 00:00:31.874
 Yes, as Mou will leave, we will be able to talk about ... 

00:00:31.874 --> 00:00:33.149
 What have we talked about so far? 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.464
 About the quarrel between Mou and Cristiano. 

00:00:36.464 --> 00:00:39.408
 And about the bad relationship between Mou and Casillasem. 

00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:43.691
 And that Mou does not bet on conferences after matches. 

00:00:44.938 --> 00:00:50.302
 We can not let him go away! There is only one solution ... 

00:00:50.302 --> 00:00:54.802
 Barça players must stop winning. I'm sorry! 

00:00:55.608 --> 00:00:59.315
 Hurry up, because Socios of Madrid have already answered in the poll whether Mou is to stay or not. 

00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:00.244
 Lece !!! 

00:01:07.724 --> 00:01:10.441
 This year there will be elections and I have to win them. 

00:01:11.172 --> 00:01:16.523
 That's why I need to know the opinion of socios. I want to organize a telephone survey, and you will help me with this. 

00:01:16.523 --> 00:01:22.125
 Why me? I am an objective journalist. My only patron is to love the truth. 

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:28.566
 I do not address Roncero a journalist, but to Roncero a madridista. 

00:01:29.493 --> 00:01:32.916
 Can you deny a favor to the President of Madrid Rrrreal? 

00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:39.570
 How? How can I be here to serve the greatest club in the history of football! 

00:01:40.714 --> 00:01:41.870
 What should I ask you, President? 

00:01:41.873 --> 00:01:44.790
 Ask them if they want me to release Mourinho. 

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:51.340
 I can answer that. It can not be that a club like Real Madrid loses one thousand points to Barça! 

00:01:51.848 --> 00:01:53.990
 But if we win the Champions League ... 

00:01:53.992 --> 00:01:57.310
 La Décima! Then Mou for the rest of my life! 

00:01:57.306 --> 00:02:00.460
 But we can not lose the league in the first round! 

00:02:04.877 --> 00:02:12.980
 Of course! If we win Décima, Mou, you will become the Super Special One! Hala Madrid! Hala Madrid! 

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:16.460
 I will start it, no? 

00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:22.570
 Release him? Sure, let it fall and that's it! 

00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:27.820
 Sure, Mou will be renewing the contract and everyone will be happy and that's it! 

00:02:58.302 --> 00:03:01.290
 Tell me, what are the results? 

00:03:01.293 --> 00:03:02.660
 Results? 

00:03:02.658 --> 00:03:05.040
 Yes. How many wants me to release him? 

00:03:05.044 --> 00:03:06.550
 Did I write it? 

00:03:07.502 --> 00:03:11.880
 I am not saving data only from making them up! 

00:03:12.867 --> 00:03:14.670
 But most want him to leave. 

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:16.720
 Yes, and then whom will I contract? 

00:03:16.716 --> 00:03:24.270
 President, do not need polls and teterete to get the opinion of the fans of this most holy club. 

00:03:24.628 --> 00:03:26.570
 Hire Vicente del Bosque! 

00:03:26.845 --> 00:03:33.010
 Vicente del Bosque? I fired him! Over my dead body! 

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:34.900
 The choice was only in June. 

00:03:34.903 --> 00:03:38.460
 If I employ him, I will definitely win the election. 

00:03:38.455 --> 00:03:40.140
 But Del Bosque is old too. 

00:03:40.135 --> 00:03:42.290
 Truth! I do not want him for nothing! 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.310
 But now they called him the best trainer in the world! 

00:03:46.306 --> 00:03:52.530
 Only the best come to Madrid! Viva del Bosque! Hala Madrid! Hala Madrid!
