00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.170
 we are going to concentrate on the 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.080
 inner corner of the eye creating a vee 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.940

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.810
 using the steamroller again 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.340
 light little eyelash down the eye and 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.990

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.240
 lakers light years line in mamey color 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.510

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.740
 that everyone knows let's clean in the 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.540
 shadow so that at a very right angle 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.160
 under the eyelashes 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.770
 Now let's delineate with a delineator 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.290
 liquid on the chestnuts I'm 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.300
 using web and white mega lime in tone 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.040
 black and let's make the tail 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.600
 guiding us with what we clean 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.600
 the shadows with the little angel that creates 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.700
 for the eyeliner simply 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.319
 We extend a tail and then the 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.150
 we merge inward with the text the 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.150
 eyeliner like making a rehash 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.150
 let's go now with false eyelashes for 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.250
 that is bigger this step is not 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:45.610
 necessary but yes that happens a lot 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:47.410
 cutest and elaborate now we enter 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.160
 It is very important not to mix the 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.050
 small natural and ribs 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.970
 we go with the skin of this base leading 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.470
 that was liquid base and we're going to 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.989
 put on the points after the face 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.180
 as I always do on the cheekbones 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.430
 jaw the forehead and the center of the 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.050
 nose 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.210
 let's mark the contours with this 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.460
 council of l colors corrector that is 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.410
 about two we put the things that my skin and 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.600
 I'm going to put some lines and you're under 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.380
 of the cheekbones and then I will blur 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.380
 more up 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.629
 I do the same thing under the tip of the 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.840
 nose turned upside down to tune 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.840
 the 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.160
 Now I'm going with loose powders 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.540
 Translucent already does everything I did 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.909
 there to eliminate any drop of brightness 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.769
 let's go now with my favorite part the 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.500
 eyebrows and my favorite product to get 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.959
 to non-spatially drink liquids for me to 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.090
 eyebrows and let's start delineating with 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.239
 a very tiny angular brochita do 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.849
 like straight lines under the eyebrow and 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.129
 over the eyebrow remains we are going now with 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.439
 the same angle delineated above and 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:05.359
 below and then we just fill 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.359
 any space and blur 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.450
 the final touch for the eyebrows 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.880
 is to illuminate from below the 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.620
 arch and on and around the eyebrows 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.519
 with concealer so there is much more 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.379
 perfect angles 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.389
 come now with this product in 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:25.729
 super fun of eye candy is a 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.710
 Frost in fragrance with liquid what 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.879
 we do to use it is to wet the brochita 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.729
 which is like that of a liquid eyeliner 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:33.889
 with the clean glue and then one day 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.050
 in the box it was going to work simply 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.669
 like a liquid eyeliner is super 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.740
 well lasts a lot of time and the 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:43.250
 boxes for bright and safe for 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.530
 eyes what I did here is create a 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.389
 swirl in the middle of the eye down 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.840
 and then lining under the eyeliner 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.610
 black liquid now for the blush like 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.229
 the eyes are in warm colors the 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.240
 blush should also be a warm color 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.610
 You could use the fall color cosmetics 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.440
 cabos is a super breaking bad 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.360
 Now let's take a look, this is 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:08.180
 a very clean tab to allow it to 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:10.729
 flame light dominial let's stop the 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.259
 lips with this pencil and lakers and after 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.020
 let's fill in inside with 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:17.659
 ricardito estanquillos is the name of the 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.610
 lipstick and let's put it in the center 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:22.000
 so that it is much more chubby 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.000
 lips 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.190
