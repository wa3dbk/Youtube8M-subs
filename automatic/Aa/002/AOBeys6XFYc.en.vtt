last week or whatever and it is

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.640 
last week or whatever and it is
dangerous<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.199> be<00:01:01.590> careful<00:01:02.270> but<00:01:03.270> anyway<00:01:03.780> I'll

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
dangerous so be careful but anyway I'll

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.100 
dangerous so be careful but anyway I'll
be<00:01:04.830> showing<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> basics<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.840> what<00:01:07.020> I'm

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
be showing you the basics so what I'm

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.500 
be showing you the basics so what I'm
holding<00:01:07.260> right<00:01:07.409> now<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.220> safe<00:01:08.460> handle<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
holding right now is the safe handle the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.609 
holding right now is the safe handle the
reason<00:01:09.750> why<00:01:09.840> they<00:01:09.960> call<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.229> safe<00:01:10.409> house

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
reason why they call it a safe house

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.440 
reason why they call it a safe house
because<00:01:11.100> if<00:01:11.340> when<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.729> blade<00:01:11.909> comes<00:01:12.090> down<00:01:12.270> it

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
because if when the blade comes down it

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.940 
because if when the blade comes down it
doesn't<00:01:12.600> cut<00:01:12.810> your<00:01:12.930> finger<00:01:13.170> see<00:01:14.119> like<00:01:15.740> it<00:01:16.740> does

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
doesn't cut your finger see like it does

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.649 
doesn't cut your finger see like it does
pinch<00:01:17.280> sometimes<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.939> do<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.150> hard<00:01:18.360> but

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
pinch sometimes if you do it hard but

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.440 
pinch sometimes if you do it hard but

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
right here is the buy handle because the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.590 
right here is the buy handle because the
sharp<00:01:23.310> side<00:01:23.729> or<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.240> blade<00:01:24.590> see

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.460 
right one and then step two you want to
bring<00:02:01.789> it<00:02:01.880> back<00:02:02.060> to<00:02:02.990> where<00:02:03.110> it<00:02:03.200> hits<00:02:03.350> your

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
bring it back to where it hits your

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:12.610 
bring it back to where it hits your
knuckle<00:02:04.569> right<00:02:05.830> so<00:02:07.720> one<00:02:08.920> two<00:02:10.600> you<00:02:11.600> get<00:02:12.319> used<00:02:12.500> to

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
knuckle right so one two you get used to

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.850 
knuckle right so one two you get used to
it<00:02:12.769> it<00:02:12.890> doesn't<00:02:13.040> hurt<00:02:13.280> as<00:02:13.370> bad<00:02:13.630> but<00:02:14.630> yeah<00:02:15.290> it's

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
it it doesn't hurt as bad but yeah it's

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.920 
it it doesn't hurt as bad but yeah it's
like<00:02:16.300> one<00:02:17.300> two<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.640> then<00:02:19.640> step<00:02:19.970> three<00:02:20.300> is<00:02:20.540> you

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
like one two and then step three is you

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.240 
like one two and then step three is you
flicking<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:21.590> this<00:02:21.769> way

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
flicking it this way

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.130 
flicking it this way
so<00:02:23.380> three<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:24.620> catch<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:25.390> then<00:02:26.390> that's

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
so three you catch it and then that's

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.420 
so three you catch it and then that's
how<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.290> open<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:27.650> like<00:02:28.720> three<00:02:29.720> steps<00:02:29.870> one<00:02:30.430> all
