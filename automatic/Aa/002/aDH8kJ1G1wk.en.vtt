00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.720 

we<00:00:45.000> launched<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.510> spider<00:00:46.199> Geneva<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.860> 2010

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
we launched the spider Geneva in 2010

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.270 
we launched the spider Geneva in 2010
then<00:00:48.449> we<00:00:48.600> starts<00:00:49.199> to<00:00:49.290> work<00:00:49.470> on<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.800> on<00:00:50.040> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
then we starts to work on this on the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.819 
then we starts to work on this on the
coop<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.699> in<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.660> meantime<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.260> decision<00:00:52.680> had

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
coop a in the meantime the decision had

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.040 
coop a in the meantime the decision had
been<00:00:52.860> made<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.219> go<00:00:54.120> ahead<00:00:54.360> with<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.570> spider<00:00:54.870> as

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
been made to go ahead with the spider as

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.640 
been made to go ahead with the spider as
a<00:00:55.140> production<00:00:55.469> car<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:57.079> what<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.260> entails

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
a production car and what that entails

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.850 
a production car and what that entails
is<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.339> basically<00:00:59.730> have<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.149> redesign

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
is that we basically have to redesign

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.649 
is that we basically have to redesign
everything<00:01:01.860> it<00:01:02.430> will<00:01:02.579> look<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.329> spider

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
everything it will look like the spider

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:04.820 
everything it will look like the spider
from<00:01:04.199> Geneva

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
from Geneva

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.620 
from Geneva
just<00:01:05.159> like<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.489> Carrera<00:01:05.790> GT<00:01:06.149> looked<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
just like the Carrera GT looked like the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.240 
just like the Carrera GT looked like the
show<00:01:06.810> car<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.259> it<00:01:07.350> wasn't<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.800> have<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.070> design

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
show car but it wasn't we have to design

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.710 
show car but it wasn't we have to design
everything<00:01:08.940> from<00:01:09.090> scratch

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
everything from scratch

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.740 
everything from scratch
it<00:01:10.020> all<00:01:10.259> has<00:01:10.440> to<00:01:10.470> work<00:01:10.800> and<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.850> case<00:01:12.119> we

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
it all has to work and in this case we

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.469 
it all has to work and in this case we
developed<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.229> spider<00:01:13.560> further<00:01:13.979> taking<00:01:14.820> clues

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
developed a spider further taking clues

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.900 
developed a spider further taking clues
from<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:17.490> GT<00:01:17.820> ones<00:01:18.649> Carrera<00:01:19.649> GT<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.399> then<00:01:20.789> of

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
from the GT ones Carrera GT and then of

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.590 
from the GT ones Carrera GT and then of
course<00:01:21.149> the<00:01:21.360> 911<00:01:22.020> gt3<00:01:22.440> our<00:01:23.039> hybrid<00:01:23.700> which<00:01:24.390> has

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
course the 911 gt3 our hybrid which has

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.020 
course the 911 gt3 our hybrid which has
as<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.960> know<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.140> hybrid<00:01:25.770> system<00:01:25.920> where<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
as you know a hybrid system where the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.249 
as you know a hybrid system where the
passenger<00:01:27.570> seat<00:01:27.810> would<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.840> building<00:01:31.170> of

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
passenger seat would be the building of

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.830 
passenger seat would be the building of
a<00:01:31.320> concept<00:01:31.679> car<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:33.000> doing<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
a concept car is just like doing a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.370 
a concept car is just like doing a
normal<00:01:34.200> project<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> studio<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.789> make<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
normal project in the studio we make the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.249 
normal project in the studio we make the
basic<00:01:37.380> forms<00:01:37.800> in<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:38.490> computer<00:01:38.940> software

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
basic forms in the computer software

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.649 
basic forms in the computer software
these<00:01:40.259> are<00:01:40.470> then<00:01:40.590> milled<00:01:40.940> we<00:01:41.940> mill<00:01:42.539> it

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
these are then milled we mill it

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.010 
these are then milled we mill it
initially<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.259> clay<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:44.190> we<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.490> physically

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
initially in clay then we can physically

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.100 
initially in clay then we can physically
change<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.290> form<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.740> then<00:01:47.189> re<00:01:47.369> measure<00:01:47.640> it

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
change the form and then re measure it

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.749 
change the form and then re measure it
rebuild<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> surfaces<00:01:49.740> eventually<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:50.610> have

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
rebuild the surfaces eventually we have

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.850 
rebuild the surfaces eventually we have
services<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.360> were<00:01:51.420> happy<00:01:51.689> with<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.439> they

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
services that were happy with and they

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.149 
services that were happy with and they
go<00:01:53.009> off<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.490> fabrication<00:01:54.350> here<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.710> there

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
go off to the fabrication here and there

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.179 
go off to the fabrication here and there
and<00:01:56.490> these<00:01:56.700> pieces<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.479> then<00:01:57.659> come<00:01:58.079> back

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
and these pieces have to then come back

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.920 
and these pieces have to then come back
and<00:01:59.189> fit

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
and fit

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.770 
and fit
we're<00:02:01.500> now<00:02:01.710> shortly<00:02:02.670> before<00:02:03.030> starting<00:02:03.480> fries

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
we're now shortly before starting fries

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.590 
we're now shortly before starting fries
in<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.890> autumn<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.730> this<00:02:05.850> year<00:02:05.910> I<00:02:06.120> guess<00:02:06.390> it's

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
in the autumn of this year I guess it's

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.260 
in the autumn of this year I guess it's
November<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.890> will<00:02:08.040> have<00:02:08.250> starting<00:02:08.729> fries<00:02:09.000> and

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
November we will have starting fries and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.030 
November we will have starting fries and
that's<00:02:09.390> where<00:02:09.600> theoretically<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
that's where theoretically we the

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.110 
that's where theoretically we the
designers<00:02:11.580> stop<00:02:12.450> work<00:02:12.900> on<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.290> car<00:02:13.970> if<00:02:14.970> you

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
designers stop work on the car if you

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.250 
designers stop work on the car if you
look<00:02:15.330> at<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.570> you<00:02:15.690> would<00:02:15.780> still<00:02:15.990> get<00:02:16.140> the

look at it you would still get the

look at it you would still get the
