the<00:00:53.250> flaw<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:53.969> i<00:00:54.269> think<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.499> just<00:00:55.920> that

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the flaw that i think is it's just that

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.700 
the flaw that i think is it's just that
there's<00:00:56.280> no<00:00:56.429> grip<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:56.999> controller

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
there's no grip on this controller

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.639 
there's no grip on this controller
basically<00:00:58.710> got<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.659> d<00:01:00.659> button<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.499> Y

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
basically got the d button and the Y

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.549 
basically got the d button and the Y
button<00:01:01.730> to<00:01:02.730> play<00:01:02.999> on<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.629> computer<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.379> need

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
button to play on the computer you need

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.640 
button to play on the computer you need
to<00:01:06.380> use<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.410> D<00:01:08.070> input<00:01:08.660> if<00:01:09.660> you<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.410> it<00:01:10.560> on

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
to use the D input if you have it on

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.700 
to use the D input if you have it on
there<00:01:10.920> if<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.790> gamepad<00:01:12.390> would<00:01:12.540> not<00:01:12.690> work<00:01:12.900> all

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
there if the gamepad would not work all

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.420 
there if the gamepad would not work all

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
load up the whole program and it's ready

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.350 
load up the whole program and it's ready
to<00:01:27.690> go<00:01:27.780> now<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.410> can<00:01:28.680> see<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.190> it<00:01:29.910> does<00:01:30.180> look

it's a bit complicated took me around
two<00:04:41.270> hours<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.750> get<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:42.169> whole<00:04:42.620> team<00:04:43.040> pad<00:04:43.310> up

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
two hours to get the whole team pad up

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.500 
two hours to get the whole team pad up
and<00:04:43.850> running<00:04:44.150> for<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.450> game<00:04:44.660> up<00:04:44.870> I<00:04:45.050> was<00:04:45.470> using

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
and running for the game up I was using

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.420 
and running for the game up I was using
but<00:04:47.510> other<00:04:47.780> than<00:04:48.020> that<00:04:48.110> is<00:04:48.530> keypad<00:04:49.010> work<00:04:49.220> is

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
but other than that is keypad work is

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.909 
but other than that is keypad work is
really<00:04:49.610> good<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:51.169> bars<00:04:51.380> are<00:04:51.620> actually

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
really good and the bars are actually

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.210 
really good and the bars are actually
one<00:04:52.160> point<00:04:52.430> three<00:04:52.490> meters<00:04:53.030> along<00:04:53.800> I'll<00:04:54.800> just

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
one point three meters along I'll just

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:02.320 
one point three meters along I'll just
drag<00:04:55.669> it<00:04:55.730> till<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.180> end<00:04:56.210> and<00:05:01.120> then<00:05:02.120> that's

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
drag it till the end and then that's

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:09.250 
drag it till the end and then that's
basically<00:05:02.720> it<00:05:02.840> now<00:05:03.169> plays<00:05:03.440> up<00:05:03.710> fella<00:05:07.840> so<00:05:08.840> the

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
basically it now plays up fella so the

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.830 
basically it now plays up fella so the
profiler<00:05:09.710> is<00:05:10.070> basically<00:05:10.820> a<00:05:10.880> free<00:05:11.090> program<00:05:11.419> if

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840
