00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.910
 high up the audience 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.769
 Hello God and welcome tsum 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:14.519
 let's play for you later 2014 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.870
 or 2015 on the bus driver simulator 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.070
 unfortunately did not appear because of it 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.230
 we have to get out of the old bridge 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.949
 Last year, Jack is playing long 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.300
 beautiful simulator with a very 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.640
 realistic scenario webers all 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.600
 we know we are sitting because we are not sitting 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.430
 Let's stand there and wait for the bus 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:39.930
 It may take a while to list shelves 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.149
 that's why we enjoy the time 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.469
 here under clear sunshine 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:52.199
 It is very hot today on this juliday 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:54.210
 in 2015 and there you are happy 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.449
 Of course if the air conditioned buses 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.710
 On time but I'm afraid in 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.230
 this game will not be the case 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.280
 I see there is a point in front 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.830
 that the bus or is it just any 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.710
 trucks just passing us rushing us 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.170
 Blowing the sand in the face you know it 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.580
 Not 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.900
 we have a beautiful bank on the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.460
 we strangely do not sit down 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.540
 We also can not walk we can 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.970
 stop here 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.170
 That's clear when we wait for the bus 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.479
 of course we do not run through the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.479
 area else the bus still drives at the end 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.549
 That's why you stand by us 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.049
 Stay that stupid is our phones 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.270
 unfortunately empty we have no more battery 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.100
 that means we can not do it now 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.979
 here with any play the time 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.320
 must drive it out like that 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.350
 People in the 80s and 90s 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.440
 when there were no cell phones just 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.790
 sit and wait 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.600
 We did not even bring a book 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.980
 and that we can read if necessary 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.600
 there is behind the seven mountains 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.070
 by the way, the punica oase 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.540
 I would like to run now times back and 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.190
 get me something to drink but in the 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.070
 in the meantime the bus arrives and drives 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.670
 us over so a horror scenario because 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.730
 here 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.400
 this 63 is not called line 63 that is 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.280
 only this bus comes here every 63 days 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.660
 We should not pass that 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.020
 miss this is life 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.020
 and death 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:25.310
 yes, monthly ticket so when the bus comes 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.320
 I show my time is the driver 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.320
 the month card and he will say 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:34.370
 climb a mister double enjoy 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:37.670
 Your ride in our air-conditioned bus 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.800
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.350
 sure the bus does not last 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.700
 more long 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.290
 I could in the meantime times 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.290
 make a poem out of the ribs 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:03:02.900
 I stand here in the desert and have 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:07.400
 now I want to go by bus 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.709
 rubs experienced experienced rhymes 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.170
 actually nothing at all then I start 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.160
 Again I'm standing in here 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.090
 Sun 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:23.120
 this is not a pan I am waiting for the 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:27.739
 bus that is total conclusion of the wind 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:31.130
 quietly blowing over the land here as well 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:39.560
 no trash can with a bottle with 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:47.240
 pawn the bagno plays like the music 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:47.240
 this is my greatest happiness in the distance 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:58.620
 whirls the velvet and this black 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:02.720
 I think an elephant is the point 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.520
 clouds are completely still up there 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.760
 for this poem you will make me one 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:14.210
 praise the day 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:19.340
 The sand is hot under my soles 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:23.550
 I'll get the bus myself 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.700
 The bank just got fresh 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.440
 painted 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.220
 there is no water here so i can 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.220
 also do not fish 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.470
 here is number 63 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.620
 and I would like to have a look now 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:53.850
 The street looks very bad 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.940
 That's why I want to go fast now 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.940
 home 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:05.990
 I can not think of any more space and it 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.990
 also looks more train a pig 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.720
 people slowly lose patience 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.960
 play 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:20.849
 I have no problem with it on the bus 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:24.569
 to wait i assume the driver is doing 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:26.610
 there are some weird ones back there 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:29.099
 after all, she does not want to cancel it 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.720
 he's doing some dirty things 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.979
 back there 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.840
 I 've heard back there behind 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.039
 the mountains is a puff that's why he has 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.199
 his bus probably there only 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.360
 turned off for a happy hour 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.759
 in the hour hotel in mind 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:47.520
 air-conditioned hourly hotel with his 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:49.169
 colleague gertrude the the 64 airbus 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.479
 controls in the opposite direction 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.009
 By the way, not passing by too 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.020
 steer yes they have a nice now 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.940
 Pieces in the air-conditioned hotel 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.979
 while I'm a passenger with the expensive 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.509
 paid monthly ticket must sit here 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.830
 in the blazing sun and almost got here 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:04.050
 already otherwise real as one of mine 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:10.560
 pronounced more on my pronunciation already 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:13.909
 clearly hearing quickie can 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.909
 actually does not take so long or 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.710
 which is the music over now and 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.659
 when the music takes some getting past is 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:29.930
 the whole weird we only hear 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:29.930
 still clinging to the spirit turns in the desert 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.460
 and here comes the music again oh god 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.550
 Thanks to startchance countries with comes 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.080
 just around the corner and kill me 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:52.150
 friends that can still be some time 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:53.380
 I dismiss you and that's what 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.930
 next time I would rather buy one 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.370
 I can still do trike at the same time 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.710
 participate in rally dakar 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.980
 that was the congenial waiting for you 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:08.230
 later the downloadlink is not in the 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:09.670
 video description because why thank you 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.930

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.930
