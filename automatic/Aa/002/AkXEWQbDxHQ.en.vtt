00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
so now that we've got the brushes all

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.200 
so now that we've got the brushes all
fitted<00:05:00.750> again<00:05:01.370> just<00:05:02.370> make<00:05:02.580> sure<00:05:02.820> that<00:05:03.090> you've

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210

and<00:05:07.490> now<00:05:08.490> we're<00:05:08.760> ready<00:05:08.910> to<00:05:09.090> refit<00:05:09.750> the<00:05:09.870> motor

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.649 

it's<00:05:15.310> always<00:05:15.430> worth<00:05:15.789> giving<00:05:16.120> them<00:05:16.360> all<00:05:16.479> to<00:05:16.629> a

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:16.659 
it's always worth giving them all to a

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.779 
it's always worth giving them all to a
spin<00:05:17.020> in<00:05:17.259> both<00:05:17.680> directions<00:05:18.099> once<00:05:18.550> you've

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.309 

again<00:05:26.680> just<00:05:26.949> tilt<00:05:27.189> the<00:05:27.310> machine<00:05:27.610> over<00:05:28.319> slide

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
again just tilt the machine over slide

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.879 
again just tilt the machine over slide

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
the motor onto the lugs make sure you

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.300 
the motor onto the lugs make sure you
get<00:05:33.009> it<00:05:33.189> onto<00:05:33.490> all<00:05:33.669> four<00:05:34.199> and<00:05:35.199> connect<00:05:36.039> the

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
get it onto all four and connect the

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.089 
get it onto all four and connect the
wiring<00:05:36.879> harness<00:05:37.389> back<00:05:37.689> up<00:05:39.090> and<00:05:40.710> you<00:05:41.710> just<00:05:41.889> need

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:42.099 
wiring harness back up and you just need

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.300 
wiring harness back up and you just need
to<00:05:42.129> put<00:05:42.370> the<00:05:42.460> bolts<00:05:42.759> in<00:05:43.379> you<00:05:44.379> don't<00:05:44.590> need<00:05:44.949> to<00:05:45.159> do

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
to put the bolts in you don't need to do

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.459 
to put the bolts in you don't need to do
them<00:05:45.550> too<00:05:45.879> tight<00:05:46.150> just<00:05:46.629> take<00:05:46.870> them<00:05:47.080> two<00:05:47.229> hand

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:47.469 
them too tight just take them two hand

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:52.200 
them too tight just take them two hand
tight<00:05:47.770> and<00:05:47.949> then<00:05:48.430> quarter<00:05:48.940> turn<00:05:49.509> and<00:05:51.210> when

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
tight and then quarter turn and when

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.510 
tight and then quarter turn and when
fitting<00:05:52.659> the<00:05:52.810> belts<00:05:53.169> it's<00:05:53.469> very<00:05:53.830> important

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
fitting the belts it's very important

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.020 
fitting the belts it's very important
that<00:05:54.699> you<00:05:54.849> line<00:05:55.270> the<00:05:55.840> belt<00:05:56.379> up<00:05:56.710> onto<00:05:57.639> the<00:05:57.789> motor

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
that you line the belt up onto the motor

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.230 
that you line the belt up onto the motor
pulley<00:05:58.360> and<00:05:58.900> then<00:05:59.590> line<00:05:59.979> it<00:06:00.009> up<00:06:00.340> to<00:06:00.400> the<00:06:00.729> center

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
pulley and then line it up to the center

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.119 
pulley and then line it up to the center
of<00:06:01.680> the<00:06:02.680> main<00:06:02.949> pulley<00:06:04.229> so<00:06:05.229> many<00:06:05.469> people<00:06:05.860> fit

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:06.129 
of the main pulley so many people fit

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:08.159 
of the main pulley so many people fit
belts<00:06:06.550> and<00:06:06.789> they<00:06:07.270> don't<00:06:07.509> line<00:06:07.779> them<00:06:08.020> up

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
belts and they don't line them up

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.830 
belts and they don't line them up
correctly<00:06:08.610> so<00:06:09.610> give<00:06:10.000> it<00:06:10.120> a<00:06:10.240> couple<00:06:10.479> of<00:06:10.629> turns

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
correctly so give it a couple of turns

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.100 
correctly so give it a couple of turns
look<00:06:11.680> down<00:06:11.919> from<00:06:12.189> the<00:06:12.340> top<00:06:12.580> or<00:06:13.569> from<00:06:13.629> the

look down from the top or from the
bottom<00:06:14.259> and<00:06:14.770> make<00:06:15.340> sure<00:06:15.610> the<00:06:15.849> belt<00:06:16.060> lines<00:06:16.569> up

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
bottom and make sure the belt lines up

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:25.080 
bottom and make sure the belt lines up
in<00:06:17.080> the<00:06:17.259> center<00:06:17.740> of<00:06:17.860> the<00:06:18.129> main<00:06:18.370> pulley<00:06:24.090> now

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
in the center of the main pulley now

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.909 
in the center of the main pulley now
we're<00:06:25.360> ready<00:06:25.569> to<00:06:25.690> reconnect<00:06:26.020> the<00:06:26.440> machine<00:06:26.770> to
