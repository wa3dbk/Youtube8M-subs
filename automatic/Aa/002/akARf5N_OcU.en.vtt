the<00:00:19.619> note<00:00:19.770> 4g<00:00:20.070> if<00:00:20.580> we<00:00:20.910> compare<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.449> touch<00:00:21.689> and

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
the note 4g if we compare the touch and

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.840 
the note 4g if we compare the touch and
the<00:00:22.289> display<00:00:22.590> on<00:00:22.830> both<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.250> phones<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.789> is

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
the display on both the phones it is

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.750 
the display on both the phones it is
quite<00:00:24.570> similar<00:00:24.869> but<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:26.189> thing<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.699> a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
quite similar but the thing is that a

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.759 
quite similar but the thing is that a
6000<00:00:27.359> plus<00:00:27.570> does<00:00:27.840> not<00:00:28.109> have<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> oleophobic

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
6000 plus does not have a oleophobic

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.849 
6000 plus does not have a oleophobic
coating<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.760> prone<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.000> smudges<00:00:30.650> if<00:00:31.650> you

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
coating so it is prone to smudges if you

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.430 
coating so it is prone to smudges if you
compare<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.309> build<00:00:32.520> quality<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:33.660> boo<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
compare the build quality it boo the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.310 
compare the build quality it boo the
phones<00:00:34.680> are<00:00:34.950> plastic<00:00:35.489> note<00:00:36.390> forties<00:00:36.780> heavier

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
phones are plastic note forties heavier

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.520 
phones are plastic note forties heavier
as<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.160> big<00:00:38.640> form<00:00:38.910> factor<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.629> might<00:00:39.989> feel

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
as a big form factor so you might feel

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.040 
as a big form factor so you might feel
that<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.100> bit<00:00:41.309> freemium<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:42.000> trust<00:00:42.690> me

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
that it is a bit freemium but trust me

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.900 
that it is a bit freemium but trust me
both<00:00:43.590> are<00:00:43.829> plastic<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.340> not<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.730> major

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
both are plastic so not a major

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.520 
both are plastic so not a major
difference<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> other<00:00:45.629> hand<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.469> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
difference on the other hand we have a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.709 
difference on the other hand we have a
small<00:00:46.770> form<00:00:47.039> factor<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.489> noise<00:00:47.700> 6000<00:00:48.180> plus<00:00:48.360> and

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
small form factor on noise 6000 plus and

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.740 
small form factor on noise 6000 plus and
the<00:00:49.320> back<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.219> bit<00:00:50.550> rubbish<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.300> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
the back is a bit rubbish so that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.430 
the back is a bit rubbish so that
provides<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.350> firm<00:00:53.000> grip<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> phone<00:00:54.840> coming

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
provides a firm grip on the phone coming

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.979 
provides a firm grip on the phone coming
to<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> performance<00:00:56.039> part<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.940> ran<00:00:57.719> into

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
to the performance part I ran into

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.010 
to the performance part I ran into
benchmark<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:59.010> both<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.550> phones<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
benchmark on both the phones and the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.149 
benchmark on both the phones and the
results<00:01:01.469> were<00:01:02.460> again<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:03.149> expected<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.949> both

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
results were again as expected the both

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.910 
results were again as expected the both
the<00:01:05.309> phones<00:01:05.549> gave<00:01:06.240> me<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.840> similar<00:01:07.350> kind<00:01:07.560> of

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the phones gave me a similar kind of

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.880 
the phones gave me a similar kind of
rating<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.299> as<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.840> see<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
rating so as you can see it's a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.330 
rating so as you can see it's a
difference<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.460> let's<00:01:11.820> say<00:01:12.590> 1800<00:01:13.590> score<00:01:13.860> which

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
difference of let's say 1800 score which

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.670 
difference of let's say 1800 score which
is<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.909> major<00:01:15.210> difference<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:16.470> a

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
is not a major difference I have a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.190 
is not a major difference I have a

sure that you keep a internal memory of

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
a bit free so that your phone doesn't

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.300 
a bit free so that your phone doesn't
start<00:01:47.820> slacking<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.810> long<00:01:48.990> run<00:01:49.259> now<00:01:49.920> let

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
start slacking in the long run now let

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.230 
start slacking in the long run now let
me<00:01:50.490> also<00:01:50.970> show<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:52.500> multi-touch<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.729> both

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
me also show you the multi-touch on both

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.590 
me also show you the multi-touch on both
the<00:01:54.450> handsets<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:57.090> it's<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.299> 10-point

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
the handsets so it's a 10-point

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.649 
the handsets so it's a 10-point
multi-touch<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.590> note<00:01:59.369> 4g<00:01:59.670> as<00:02:00.000> compared<00:02:00.600> to

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
multi-touch on note 4g as compared to

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.990 
multi-touch on note 4g as compared to
the<00:02:01.049> 5<00:02:01.200> point<00:02:01.409> multi-touch<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:02.070> a6000<00:02:02.790> plus

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
the 5 point multi-touch of a6000 plus

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.289 
the 5 point multi-touch of a6000 plus
but<00:02:03.920> 5<00:02:04.920> point<00:02:05.250> multi-touch<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.939> more<00:02:06.119> than

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
but 5 point multi-touch is more than

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.410 
but 5 point multi-touch is more than
enough<00:02:06.659> for<00:02:06.869> most<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.469> your<00:02:07.619> games

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
enough for most of your games

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
the case in lenovo a6000 however you can

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.730 
the case in lenovo a6000 however you can

set your default right storage as this
you<00:02:25.950> got<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:26.340> your<00:02:26.490> new<00:02:26.730> apps<00:02:26.970> will<00:02:27.360> get

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
you got so your new apps will get

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.630 
you got so your new apps will get
transferred<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.590> SD<00:02:28.860> card<00:02:28.890> by<00:02:29.250> default

image<00:03:21.960> is<00:03:22.110> larger<00:03:22.530> obviously<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.490> make<00:03:23.670> a

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
image is larger obviously so to make a

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.110 
image is larger obviously so to make a
pixel<00:03:23.910> camera<00:03:24.180> but<00:03:24.660> then<00:03:24.870> also<00:03:25.050> a<00:03:25.940> 6000<00:03:26.940> plus
