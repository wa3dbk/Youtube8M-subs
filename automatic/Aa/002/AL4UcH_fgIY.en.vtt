00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
that there is a definitive difference in

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:24.680

what<00:04:08.169> I'm<00:04:08.260> talking<00:04:08.650> about<00:04:08.709> so<00:04:09.159> let's<00:04:09.669> go<00:04:23.580> and

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
what I'm talking about so let's go and

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.570 
what I'm talking about so let's go and
there<00:04:25.690> you<00:04:25.840> go<00:04:26.020> as<00:04:26.349> you<00:04:26.409> heard<00:04:26.889> for<00:04:27.159> yourself

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580
