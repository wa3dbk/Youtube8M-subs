00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
inside its got a separate pocket so it's

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.660 
inside its got a separate pocket so it's
not<00:01:16.229> going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.560> touch<00:01:16.770> your<00:01:17.040> clothes<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.420 
not going to touch your clothes on the
inside<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.020> would<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.500> put<00:01:19.770> one<00:01:20.130> shoe<00:01:20.369> on

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
inside so you would just put one shoe on

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.840 
inside so you would just put one shoe on
on<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.909> side<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.530> then<00:01:22.530> put<00:01:22.799> another<00:01:23.009> shoe

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
and on this side and so you invert them
