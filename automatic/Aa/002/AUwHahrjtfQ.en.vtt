Saudi<00:00:13.220> Arabia<00:00:13.670> is<00:00:13.910> important<00:00:14.630> for<00:00:15.050> the<00:00:15.260> whole

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
Saudi Arabia is important for the whole

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.390 
Saudi Arabia is important for the whole
world<00:00:15.710> when<00:00:16.430> it<00:00:16.460> means<00:00:17.270> supply<00:00:17.780> of<00:00:18.170> oil<00:00:18.470> but

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
world when it means supply of oil but

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.240 
world when it means supply of oil but
and<00:00:19.670> that<00:00:20.090> also<00:00:20.360> gives<00:00:20.720> Saudi<00:00:21.170> Arabia<00:00:21.710> incomes

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
and that also gives Saudi Arabia incomes

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.970 
and that also gives Saudi Arabia incomes
and<00:00:22.520> I<00:00:23.300> think<00:00:23.599> it's<00:00:23.750> very<00:00:23.900> interesting<00:00:24.080> to<00:00:24.770> see

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
and I think it's very interesting to see

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.339 
and I think it's very interesting to see
now<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:25.340> strategy<00:00:26.180> for<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:27.080> future<00:00:28.000> that<00:00:29.000> is

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
now the strategy for the future that is

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.330 
now the strategy for the future that is
not<00:00:30.349> going<00:00:30.590> away<00:00:30.800> from<00:00:31.579> oil<00:00:31.820> but<00:00:32.180> using<00:00:33.340> the

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
not going away from oil but using the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.870 
not going away from oil but using the
income<00:00:34.790> from<00:00:34.820> oil<00:00:35.180> to<00:00:35.510> to<00:00:36.440> expand<00:00:37.010> new<00:00:37.310> sectors
