the<00:00:32.700> reason<00:00:32.880> why<00:00:33.030> i<00:00:33.059> chose<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.690> because

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
the reason why i chose this is because

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.069 
the reason why i chose this is because
water<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.680> quiet<00:00:35.070> ya<00:00:35.550> know<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.630> does<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:36.930> two

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
water is quiet ya know it does have two

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.540 
water is quiet ya know it does have two
fans<00:00:37.320> on<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:37.739> i'm<00:00:37.890> pretty<00:00:38.160> sure<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.489> is

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
fans on it but i'm pretty sure this is

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.400 
fans on it but i'm pretty sure this is
going<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.820> be<00:00:39.000> running<00:00:39.270> quieter<00:00:39.840> than<00:00:40.050> any

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
going to be running quieter than any

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.290 
going to be running quieter than any
other<00:00:40.860> solution<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.760> would<00:00:41.940> get<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.239> I

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
other solution that I would get and I

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.569 
other solution that I would get and I
wasn't<00:00:42.510> going<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.770> know<00:00:43.860> invest<00:00:44.250> money

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
wasn't going to you know invest money

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.360 
wasn't going to you know invest money
and<00:00:44.910> time<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.300> possibly<00:00:45.809> damage<00:00:46.800> everything

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
and time and possibly damage everything

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.130 
and time and possibly damage everything
in<00:00:47.520> my<00:00:47.610> computer<00:00:48.059> by<00:00:48.450> trying<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.719> do<00:00:48.870> some

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
in my computer by trying to do some

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.069 
in my computer by trying to do some
fancy<00:00:49.910> custom<00:00:50.910> water<00:00:51.090> loop<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.570> think<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.899> is

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
fancy custom water loop I think this is

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.959 
fancy custom water loop I think this is
going<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> really<00:00:52.770> good<00:00:53.010> solution<00:00:53.489> I'm

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
going to be a really good solution I'm

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.520 
going to be a really good solution I'm
going<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> be<00:00:54.270> overclocking<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.079> said<00:00:55.410> I'm

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
going to be overclocking the I said I'm

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.229 
going to be overclocking the I said I'm
not<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.829> be<00:00:55.920> pushing<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.340> way<00:00:56.850> too<00:00:56.910> hard

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
not going to be pushing it way too hard

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.400 
not going to be pushing it way too hard
but<00:00:57.390> I'm<00:00:57.480> gonna<00:00:57.600> be<00:00:57.780> doing<00:00:57.899> some<00:00:58.170> overclocking

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
but I'm gonna be doing some overclocking

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.950 
but I'm gonna be doing some overclocking
with<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.309> just<00:01:00.239> some<00:01:00.390> things<00:01:00.539> about<00:01:00.660> this

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
with it and just some things about this

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.139 
with it and just some things about this
with<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> case<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.770> i<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:01.859> i'm<00:01:02.340> pretty

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
with the case that i have i'm pretty

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.210 
with the case that i have i'm pretty
sure<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.570> will<00:01:03.690> fit<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:04.260> we'll<00:01:04.409> see<00:01:04.619> like

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
sure that it will fit but we'll see like

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.039 
sure that it will fit but we'll see like
I<00:01:05.309> just<00:01:05.339> said<00:01:05.549> I'm<00:01:05.850> gonna<00:01:06.000> be<00:01:06.180> using<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.510> i7

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
I just said I'm gonna be using the i7

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.380 
I just said I'm gonna be using the i7
4770k<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> back<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.270> actually

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
4770k and on the back it actually

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.500 
4770k and on the back it actually
doesn't<00:01:09.720> say<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.350> supports<00:01:10.860> LGA<00:01:11.640> 1150

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
doesn't say that it supports LGA 1150

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.780 
doesn't say that it supports LGA 1150
but<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.320> does<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:13.950> don't<00:01:14.250> worry<00:01:14.340> about<00:01:14.580> that

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
but it does so don't worry about that

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.580 
but it does so don't worry about that
this<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.180> going<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.360> be<00:01:15.420> fine<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> cpu

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
this is going to be fine for the cpu

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.410 
this is going to be fine for the cpu
that<00:01:16.710> we're<00:01:16.830> going<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.100> using<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.850> let's<00:01:18.150> go

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
that we're going to be using so let's go

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.510 
that we're going to be using so let's go
ahead<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.720> take<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.200> look<00:01:19.380> at<00:01:19.590> what<00:01:19.619> exactly<00:01:20.040> we

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
ahead and take a look at what exactly we

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.190 
ahead and take a look at what exactly we
get<00:01:20.700> inside<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> box<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.750> here<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
get inside the box so here it is the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.870 
get inside the box so here it is the
h100<00:01:22.770> i'm<00:01:22.920> going<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.100> go<00:01:23.189> ahead<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.490> take<00:01:23.670> it

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
h100 i'm going to go ahead and take it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.429 
h100 i'm going to go ahead and take it
out<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.299> plastic<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.140> first<00:01:25.350> i'm

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
out of this plastic it's the first i'm

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.200 
out of this plastic it's the first i'm
going<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:25.740> because<00:01:25.979> it's<00:01:26.189> giving<00:01:26.820> us<00:01:26.939> this

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
going to do because it's giving us this

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.620 
going to do because it's giving us this
very<00:01:28.369> annoying<00:01:29.369> kind<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:31.610> reflection<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:33.360> my

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630

hundred eyes you can see right here it
supports<00:01:37.950> intel<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.880> AMD<00:01:39.090> cpus<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.590> course<00:01:40.920> it

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
supports intel and AMD cpus of course it

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.039 
supports intel and AMD cpus of course it
has<00:01:41.280> coarser<00:01:41.729> links<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.240> will<00:01:42.570> be<00:01:42.600> able<00:01:42.689> to

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
has coarser links so you will be able to

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.260 
has coarser links so you will be able to
monitor<00:01:43.530> what<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> fans<00:01:44.579> are<00:01:44.759> doing<00:01:45.030> what

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
monitor what the fans are doing what

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.450 
monitor what the fans are doing what
exactly<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.899> temperatures<00:01:46.409> are<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.799> your<00:01:47.250> cpu

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
exactly the temperatures are on your cpu

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.639 
exactly the temperatures are on your cpu
here<00:01:48.149> we<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.299> extreme<00:01:48.869> performance<00:01:49.259> liquid

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
here we have extreme performance liquid

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.100 
here we have extreme performance liquid
cpu<00:01:50.100> cooler<00:01:50.490> with<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> hydro<00:01:51.509> series<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.020> i'm

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
cpu cooler with the hydro series so i'm

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.630 
cpu cooler with the hydro series so i'm
pretty<00:01:52.380> confident<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.460> going<00:01:53.549> to

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
pretty confident that this is going to

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.300 
pretty confident that this is going to
be<00:01:53.790> doing<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.869> pretty<00:01:55.049> good<00:01:55.140> job<00:01:55.259> as<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.189> can

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
be doing a pretty good job as you can

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.100 
be doing a pretty good job as you can
see<00:01:56.520> here<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.909> performs<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.570> much<00:01:57.719> better<00:01:57.899> than

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
see here it performs so much better than

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.350 
see here it performs so much better than
the<00:01:58.229> intel<00:01:58.560> box<00:01:58.799> cooler<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.369> these<00:01:59.790> are<00:02:00.090> at

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
the intel box cooler and these are at

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.940 
the intel box cooler and these are at
overclock<00:02:00.869> temperatures<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:01.649> there<00:02:01.799> should

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
overclock temperatures so there should

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.450 
overclock temperatures so there should
be<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.310> fine<00:02:02.399> for<00:02:03.060> our<00:02:03.500> 4770k<00:02:04.500> which<00:02:05.219> would

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
be just fine for our 4770k which would

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.160 
be just fine for our 4770k which would
be<00:02:05.549> running<00:02:05.790> around<00:02:05.880> 4.5<00:02:06.509> gigahertz<00:02:06.840> but

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
be running around 4.5 gigahertz but

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.839 
be running around 4.5 gigahertz but
we'll<00:02:07.259> see<00:02:07.409> how<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.590> goes<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.610> can<00:02:08.700> see

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
we'll see how that goes and you can see

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.770 
we'll see how that goes and you can see
down<00:02:09.030> here<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.509> says<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.050> doesn't

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
down here it says that it doesn't

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.840 
down here it says that it doesn't
say<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.200> supports<00:02:11.620> socket<00:02:12.069> 1150<00:02:12.700> which

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
say that it supports socket 1150 which

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.510 
say that it supports socket 1150 which
we're<00:02:13.060> using<00:02:13.270> but<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:14.080> does<00:02:14.380> don't<00:02:14.950> worry<00:02:15.100> so

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
we're using but it does don't worry so

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.740 
we're using but it does don't worry so
here<00:02:15.640> we<00:02:15.760> are<00:02:15.880> let's<00:02:16.090> go<00:02:16.240> ahead<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.510> unbox

recruited with some very confusing and

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.780 
recruited with some very confusing and
overwhelming<00:02:38.200> packaging<00:02:39.130> so<00:02:39.280> let's<00:02:39.430> try<00:02:39.640> and

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
overwhelming packaging so let's try and

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.910 
overwhelming packaging so let's try and
decipher<00:02:40.239> what<00:02:40.540> all<00:02:40.660> this<00:02:40.810> stuff<00:02:40.870> is<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:41.830> right

closed-loop<00:04:46.480> solution<00:04:46.960> where<00:04:47.110> you<00:04:47.230> don't

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
closed-loop solution where you don't

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.980 
closed-loop solution where you don't
have<00:04:47.740> to<00:04:47.980> maintain<00:04:48.190> any<00:04:48.880> reservoirs<00:04:49.720> or

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
have to maintain any reservoirs or

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.320 
have to maintain any reservoirs or
tubing<00:04:50.590> or<00:04:50.680> anything<00:04:51.250> like<00:04:51.280> that<00:04:51.430> go<00:04:52.120> ahead

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
tubing or anything like that go ahead

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.730 
tubing or anything like that go ahead
with<00:04:52.450> the<00:04:52.570> closed-loop<00:04:52.810> system<00:04:53.470> you<00:04:53.620> can

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
with the closed-loop system you can

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.620 
with the closed-loop system you can
actually<00:04:53.920> switch<00:04:54.340> out<00:04:54.550> these<00:04:54.760> fans<00:04:55.090> if

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
actually switch out these fans if

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.240 
actually switch out these fans if
they're<00:04:55.810> not<00:04:55.930> doing<00:04:56.170> it<00:04:56.380> for<00:04:56.410> you<00:04:56.590> I<00:04:56.770> know<00:04:56.860> not

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
they're not doing it for you I know not

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.610 
they're not doing it for you I know not
to<00:04:57.310> us<00:04:57.700> are<00:04:57.940> really<00:04:58.180> silent<00:04:58.780> and<00:04:58.960> very<00:04:59.320> good

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.530 
to us are really silent and very good
fans<00:04:59.890> they're<00:05:00.430> a<00:05:00.460> little<00:05:00.640> pricey<00:05:00.760> but<00:05:01.150> they'll

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
fans they're a little pricey but they'll

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.120 
fans they're a little pricey but they'll
get<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:01.840> job<00:05:02.050> done<00:05:02.080> better<00:05:02.440> than<00:05:02.680> these<00:05:02.800> fans

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
get the job done better than these fans

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.400 
get the job done better than these fans
will<00:05:03.370> I<00:05:03.400> might<00:05:03.940> swap<00:05:04.510> those<00:05:04.660> out<00:05:04.840> myself<00:05:05.080> but

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
will I might swap those out myself but

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.790 
will I might swap those out myself but
for<00:05:05.919> this<00:05:06.550> picking<00:05:07.300> of<00:05:07.450> cpu<00:05:07.870> cooler<00:05:08.110> is<00:05:08.380> pretty

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
for this picking of cpu cooler is pretty

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.230 
for this picking of cpu cooler is pretty
important<00:05:09.250> the<00:05:09.400> reason<00:05:09.640> why<00:05:09.730> I<00:05:09.760> chose<00:05:09.850> this

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
important the reason why I chose this

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.909 
important the reason why I chose this
one<00:05:10.450> because<00:05:10.510> I<00:05:11.230> wanted<00:05:11.590> something<00:05:11.890> that

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
one because I wanted something that

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.250 
one because I wanted something that
would<00:05:12.130> be<00:05:12.310> quiet<00:05:12.640> and<00:05:12.850> I<00:05:12.940> figured<00:05:13.330> well<00:05:13.360> water

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
would be quiet and I figured well water

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.610 
would be quiet and I figured well water
cooling<00:05:15.160> should<00:05:15.580> be<00:05:15.760> pretty<00:05:16.210> quiet<00:05:16.600> on<00:05:16.870> the

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
cooling should be pretty quiet on the

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.190 
cooling should be pretty quiet on the
performance<00:05:18.130> versus<00:05:19.090> the<00:05:19.360> temperature

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
performance versus the temperature

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.370 
performance versus the temperature
temperature<00:05:20.860> versus<00:05:21.600> noise<00:05:22.600> output<00:05:22.810> I<00:05:23.050> think

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
temperature versus noise output I think

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.140 
temperature versus noise output I think
it's<00:05:23.530> pretty<00:05:24.100> well<00:05:24.310> balanced<00:05:24.610> on<00:05:24.760> this<00:05:24.940> thing

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
it's pretty well balanced on this thing

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.940 
it's pretty well balanced on this thing
so<00:05:25.180> I<00:05:25.419> think<00:05:25.510> I'll<00:05:25.720> be<00:05:25.900> able<00:05:26.260> to<00:05:26.590> get<00:05:26.710> pretty

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
so I think I'll be able to get pretty

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.350 
so I think I'll be able to get pretty
good<00:05:27.130> temperatures<00:05:27.490> while<00:05:27.640> I'm<00:05:27.760> overclocking

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
good temperatures while I'm overclocking

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.469 
good temperatures while I'm overclocking
while<00:05:28.600> still<00:05:29.140> keeping<00:05:29.410> my<00:05:30.100> system<00:05:30.520> pretty<00:05:30.850> you

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
while still keeping my system pretty you

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.800 
while still keeping my system pretty you
know<00:05:31.510> cool<00:05:31.960> and<00:05:32.380> quiet<00:05:32.890> for<00:05:33.280> you<00:05:34.210> if<00:05:34.419> you<00:05:34.540> don't

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
know cool and quiet for you if you don't

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.469 
know cool and quiet for you if you don't
want<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.260> go<00:05:35.500> with<00:05:36.220> any<00:05:36.550> type<00:05:36.880> of<00:05:36.910> water

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
want to go with any type of water

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.330 
want to go with any type of water
cooling<00:05:37.870> if<00:05:37.990> you<00:05:38.110> just<00:05:38.290> don't<00:05:38.410> like<00:05:38.620> that<00:05:38.890> you

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
cooling if you just don't like that you

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.880 
cooling if you just don't like that you
there<00:05:39.610> are<00:05:39.729> some<00:05:39.970> pretty<00:05:40.330> high<00:05:40.720> quality<00:05:41.260> fans

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
there are some pretty high quality fans

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.620 
there are some pretty high quality fans
and<00:05:42.310> if<00:05:42.610> you<00:05:42.850> get<00:05:43.030> up<00:05:43.120> to<00:05:43.210> this<00:05:43.330> price<00:05:43.600> range

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
and if you get up to this price range

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.920 
and if you get up to this price range
just<00:05:44.140> was<00:05:44.229> about<00:05:44.820> $95<00:05:45.820> um<00:05:46.090> you<00:05:46.690> can<00:05:46.810> actually

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
just was about $95 um you can actually

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.020 
just was about $95 um you can actually
get<00:05:47.140> some<00:05:47.320> pretty<00:05:47.710> good<00:05:47.950> air<00:05:48.220> like<00:05:48.580> regular

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
get some pretty good air like regular

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.180 
get some pretty good air like regular
fans<00:05:49.960> to<00:05:50.290> just<00:05:50.470> go<00:05:50.560> straight<00:05:50.830> on<00:05:50.919> your<00:05:51.010> piece

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
fans to just go straight on your piece

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.550 
fans to just go straight on your piece
of<00:05:51.340> your<00:05:51.490> CPU<00:05:51.940> so<00:05:52.240> don't<00:05:52.960> think<00:05:53.200> that<00:05:53.320> you<00:05:53.410> have

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
of your CPU so don't think that you have

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.810 
of your CPU so don't think that you have
to<00:05:53.710> go<00:05:53.800> water<00:05:54.040> cold<00:05:54.340> if<00:05:54.460> you're<00:05:54.550> gonna<00:05:54.669> be

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
to go water cold if you're gonna be

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.000 
to go water cold if you're gonna be
overclocking<00:05:55.419> because<00:05:55.600> that<00:05:55.780> is<00:05:55.960> not<00:05:56.290> true<00:05:56.590> so

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
overclocking because that is not true so

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.290 
overclocking because that is not true so
