you have to get out and you punch it now

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.359 
you have to get out and you punch it now
it<00:01:37.320> doesn't<00:01:37.619> go<00:01:37.710> all<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.920> way<00:01:37.950> down<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.340> you

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
it doesn't go all the way down so you

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.399 
it doesn't go all the way down so you
may<00:01:38.640> want<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.000> get<00:01:39.150> back<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.720> c-130<00:01:40.110> just

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
may want to get back in a c-130 just

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.410 
may want to get back in a c-130 just
move<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.100> up<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.310> little<00:01:41.490> bit<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.909> know<00:01:42.000> gravity

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
move it up a little bit you know gravity

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.510 
move it up a little bit you know gravity
sort<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.049> takes<00:01:43.290> its<00:01:43.470> toll<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.860> it'll<00:01:44.189> push<00:01:44.369> it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
sort of takes its toll and it'll push it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.480 
sort of takes its toll and it'll push it
down<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.079> it'll<00:01:46.079> actually<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.590> drivable<00:01:46.979> now

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
down and it'll actually be drivable now

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.940 
down and it'll actually be drivable now
I<00:01:47.759> tried<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.420> get<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.720> tank<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.110> here<00:01:49.320> don't<00:01:49.649> do

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
that it blows it up the thing is too big

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.749 
that it blows it up the thing is too big
but<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.649> am<00:01:52.950> gonna<00:01:53.130> demonstrate<00:01:53.399> with<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
but I am gonna demonstrate with a

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.310 
but I am gonna demonstrate with a
four-wheeler<00:01:54.329> because<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.720> that's<00:01:54.930> only<00:01:55.110> car

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
maybe even the bigger trucks might not

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.160 
maybe even the bigger trucks might not
fit<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.189> never<00:02:05.700> tried<00:02:06.000> every<00:02:06.390> car<00:02:06.570> obviously<00:02:07.110> it

slides<00:02:36.890> out<00:02:37.190> because<00:02:37.490> obviously<00:02:37.640> no<00:02:37.910> gravity

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
slides out because obviously no gravity

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.030 
slides out because obviously no gravity
when<00:02:38.570> you're<00:02:38.660> going<00:02:38.930> forward<00:02:39.470> it's<00:02:39.830> gonna

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
when you're going forward it's gonna

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.880 
when you're going forward it's gonna
slide<00:02:40.310> backwards<00:02:40.610> so<00:02:40.970> that's<00:02:41.270> why<00:02:41.590> it's<00:02:42.590> just

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
slide backwards so that's why it's just

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.990 
slide backwards so that's why it's just
a<00:02:42.920> little<00:02:43.100> bit<00:02:43.190> tough<00:02:43.340> but<00:02:43.580> as<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.820> see<00:02:43.970> right

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
a little bit tough but as you see right

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.280 
a little bit tough but as you see right
here<00:02:44.120> all<00:02:44.360> you're<00:02:44.480> gonna<00:02:44.570> do<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:44.780> just<00:02:44.990> keep

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
here all you're gonna do is just keep

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.200 
here all you're gonna do is just keep
slamming<00:02:46.040> on<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.190> brakes<00:02:46.370> going<00:02:46.640> seminole

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
slamming on the brakes going seminole

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.390 
slamming on the brakes going seminole
brakes<00:02:47.360> going<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:47.960> it<00:02:48.110> should<00:02:48.500> eventually

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
brakes going and it should eventually

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.980 
brakes going and it should eventually
close<00:02:49.670> you'll<00:02:49.910> see<00:02:49.940> it<00:02:50.210> actually<00:02:50.480> closes<00:02:50.690> once

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
close you'll see it actually closes once

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.860 
close you'll see it actually closes once
we<00:02:51.140> get<00:02:51.260> in<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.560> air<00:02:51.800> so<00:02:52.550> you<00:02:53.030> may<00:02:53.270> have<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.630> try

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
we get in the air so you may have to try

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.480 
we get in the air so you may have to try
to<00:02:53.930> go<00:02:54.110> in<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.290> air<00:02:54.410> but<00:02:54.680> like<00:02:54.770> I<00:02:54.860> said<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:55.310> may

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
to go in the air but like I said you may

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.490 
to go in the air but like I said you may
just<00:02:55.640> want<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.850> save<00:02:56.090> before<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:56.930> do<00:02:57.140> this<00:02:57.260> in

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
just want to save before you do this in

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.750 
just want to save before you do this in
case<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.830> do<00:02:57.980> mess<00:02:58.130> up<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:58.400> don't<00:02:58.460> wanna<00:02:58.640> have

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
case you do mess up you don't wanna have

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.490 
case you do mess up you don't wanna have
to<00:02:58.820> go<00:02:58.880> back<00:02:59.090> down<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.450> land<00:02:59.600> it<00:02:59.750> again<00:02:59.960> and<00:03:00.140> do

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
to go back down and land it again and do

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.110 
to go back down and land it again and do
so<00:03:00.740> if<00:03:00.800> you<00:03:00.920> just<00:03:01.040> reload<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.430> save<00:03:01.610> and<00:03:01.970> it'll

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
so if you just reload the save and it'll

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.880 
so if you just reload the save and it'll
work<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.450> lot<00:03:02.600> better<00:03:02.780> but<00:03:03.380> as<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:03.620> see<00:03:03.770> we're

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
work a lot better but as you see we're

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.590 
work a lot better but as you see we're
going<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.040> take<00:03:04.220> off<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.940> thing<00:03:05.150> is<00:03:05.360> going

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
going to take off and the thing is going

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.910 
going to take off and the thing is going
to<00:03:05.690> shut<00:03:05.870> now<00:03:06.020> Elias<00:03:06.410> I<00:03:06.470> don't<00:03:06.680> know<00:03:06.740> why<00:03:06.860> the

like say somebody was in that car and
then<00:03:45.560> I<00:03:45.680> decided<00:03:45.980> to<00:03:46.100> drive<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:46.610> don't<00:03:46.670> know<00:03:47.000> if

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
then I decided to drive I don't know if

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.449 
then I decided to drive I don't know if
maybe<00:03:47.900> like<00:03:48.080> while<00:03:48.560> we're<00:03:48.769> in<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.040> air<00:03:49.070> if

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
maybe like while we're in the air if

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.490 
maybe like while we're in the air if
they<00:03:49.610> can<00:03:49.760> like<00:03:49.910> reverse<00:03:50.330> and<00:03:50.600> open<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.050> open

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500

they can like reverse and open the open
the<00:03:51.590> back<00:03:52.160> themselves<00:03:52.760> but<00:03:53.120> imagine<00:03:53.720> if<00:03:53.810> you

going back and I try just to go back to

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.940 
going back and I try just to go back to
figure<00:04:11.150> going<00:04:11.330> back

you<00:04:12.310> know<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.550> gravity<00:04:13.000> might<00:04:13.150> shut<00:04:13.450> it<00:04:13.599> but

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
you know the gravity might shut it but

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.170 
you know the gravity might shut it but
our<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.500> force<00:04:14.800> might<00:04:15.010> shut<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:15.370> but<00:04:15.849> it

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
our the force might shut it but it

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.729 
our the force might shut it but it
didn't<00:04:16.570> so<00:04:16.690> I<00:04:16.720> don't<00:04:17.109> know<00:04:17.200> that's<00:04:17.350> why<00:04:17.470> I<00:04:17.500> said

you might need to play with the mess
around<00:04:19.090> see<00:04:19.510> what<00:04:19.720> actually<00:04:20.139> works<00:04:20.380> because

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
around see what actually works because

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.080 
around see what actually works because

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
hangar it actually winds up blowing up
