00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello people welcome i am gÃ¼iza today 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.020
 this is the tutorial today 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.250
 I will teach how to make the fire effect in 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.290
 finger 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.630
 all you need is to put your finger 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.809
 A) Yes 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.000
 and leave it as still as possible thing that 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.240
 do not move so much the difficulty of this 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.890
 tutorial I take it as a medium low thing 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.680
 because you have to use trackers and 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.210
 you also have to use masks for good 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.009
 and to win all you need to is 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.419
 down here in the description first thing 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.820
 what they have to do is open after 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.680
 effects import all files and 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.149
 then use the tracer tool 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.340
 so that the tool was going to serve 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.980
 trackers to track the movement 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.270
 of the finger are going to see it now well what 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.610
 Next we have to do after 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.800
 open the adobe after effects we have to 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.740
 import our files we search in 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.630
 our folder the video files and 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.760
 the fire that is down here in the 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.800
 description remember then we are going to 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.140
 drag our video 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.420
 to create a new composition that is the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.550
 icon that is near the jar of the 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.140
 trash as you can see in the video there 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.269
 have to drag it there and we create a new 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.430
 composition after having created this 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.220
 new composition we move our video 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.590
 to be able to adjust the right in the 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.259
 moment where we raise the finger to 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.800
 learn the fire and shorten it 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.050
 putting our mouse on the edge 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.009
 right to be able to cut the video of 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.009
 a more precise way 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.240
 then to use our process of 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.430
 tracker we're going to new and we're going to 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.470
 object cancel these that you are not going to 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.380
 help for tracking and movement 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.840
 of the finger to then add the 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.420
 port we go to tracker then 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.820
 We click on our video and we can 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.369
 follow movement is going to see us put 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.530
 a picture on our screen and this 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.470
 we have to place it in our box 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.740
 finger the finger that lifts if the crawl 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.259
 of the finger is not good they have to put the 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.989
 tracker in another part of the hand that 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.369
 is going to mean that the same harrows the 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.020
 finger movement why because the 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.239
 finger moves next to the hand then 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.580
 it crawls on any other finger of that 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.980
 hand they will get the effect like me 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.800
 because in this case it did not work for me 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.540
 the crawl on the index finger after 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.600
 that has been tracked we must change 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.720
 Our destiny is movement 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.900
 avoid it and we must know that it goes to null 2 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.379
 then we apply and accept all 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.200
 and there we are going to create the tracking of the 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.829
 movement and now that tracking is going to 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.930
 have the null then we should put in 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.379
 our composition the fire that is going to 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.930
 be already transparent in this case and 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:53.340
 we should shrink it and move it in such 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.769
 way that it looks like it was 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.470
 coming out of the finger and when bailing it out 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.510
 have it right on our finger we should 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.390
 put was what is next to 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.940
 none that like a small spring what 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.489
 that we want and drag it away I cancel this 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.099
 means that now the fire is going to 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.879
 continue to annul 2 which is the follow-up 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.879
 finger 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.410
 the most lateral part of this tutorial is 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.810
 make the mask of fire because the 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.090
 mask because see if one does the 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.120
 fire effect with the with the video game 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.760
 I saw him and it looks like fire 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.000
 my finger but around you do not see the color 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.950
 of fire because usually fire 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.730
 color changes the surroundings of the finger 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.040
 if I set fire and do with my hand 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.770
 change color then see that what 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.840
 we were trying that what we're going to 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.940
 try to do now please put 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.890
 a lot of attention in this part do not forget 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.680
 no detail because when one fails and 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.100
 yes thing when one fails in a part in 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.990
 specific and advances have to become 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.120
 everything back so please attention 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.940
 now or now as I told you 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.070
 This is the process of creating 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.920
 masks we can create mask by squeezing 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.600
 control in our video or squeezing 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.870
 control was controlled as you 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:17.140
 want then we go to mode in one of 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.870
 our video duplicated and we put it in 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.930
 add to put the color of 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.080
 fire 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.910
 at hand then we go to the 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.910
 pen tool and we started to 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.490
 surround our our hand and close 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.350
 the most swallow when squeezing to have the 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.229
 mask we click on the tracks in 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.740
 our video we press efe and move 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:43.490
 we move those numbers the draft 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.470
 more precisely as you 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.860
 want in this case I'm going to put 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.380
 in 200 and so much so that it looks better and 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.479
 there you can see that the mask does not 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.340
 move next to the finger then we have to 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:58.400
 animate more expensive the frame by frame 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.169
 second to second or frame ex less than one 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.389
 second then minus 12 a then 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.490
 to do that we go to the mask 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.560
 that we carry in the little triangle we open and 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.360
 we set the clock that is next to 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.610
 mask tracing this is going to make 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.400
 every time we change our way of 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.590
 the mask in every second this one is going to 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.789
 change automatically then every 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.800
 once we move our cursor on 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.620
 our time scale is going to be that 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.630
 engrave the mask there as you can see 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.070
 this is from default so we're going to 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.070
 Advance in this process 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:34.030
 and what they tell me is secret and I do not know that 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.890
 misrule and never cared what 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.780
 I hope you liked this 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.670
 video I hope you share it put me 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.760
 like here is my effects video 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:45.250
 previous where is the part of my finger 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.440
 of the game tell me what effect they want 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.450
 learn in the next tutorials and not 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.960
 forget to subscribe is a goodbye that you are 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.960
 of hairs
