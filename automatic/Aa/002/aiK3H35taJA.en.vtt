00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.279
 Welcome friends once again to your 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:13.540
 electro club channel this time 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:13.540
 we will talk about single-phase motors 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.110
 we will talk about single-phase motors 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.050
 and a single-phase motor is found 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:29.310
 commonly in our homes in our 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.470
 homes like a water pump will be used a 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.870
 very common engine then we go to 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.740
 learn a little about this kind of 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.480
 engines 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:43.500
 a single-phase motor type normally 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.500
 comes with two slices 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.490
 the defendants 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.090
 we call a defendant a winding 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.090
 start 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.570
 there is another winding that we call 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.570
 work winding 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.120
 sliced of work also comes a 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.120
 centrifugal 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.770
 what is a scientist in a center of 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.710
 game a centrifuge is a device 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.500
 mechanical that is inserted in the arrow 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.360
 of the engine what this device does 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.700
 is that 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.210
 action to a microsite be a 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.600
 normally open switch closed 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.130
 in this case it is normally open 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.570
 then this center and football what 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.030
 does it 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.659
 is that when the engine starts 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.149
 spin start spinning 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.939
 by the same centrifugal force that 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.819
 generates the engine once it reaches 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.670
 rated speed this centrifuge to 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:56.219
 through the micro- swift that triggers 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.969
 to open that is what the belt does 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.130
 hugo opens the micro switch takes out the 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.590
 start-up defendant and stays with the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.679
 work winding that 's what it does 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.069
 the game center and we also have to 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.110
 single-phase motors 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:16.100
 several carry a capacitor 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.100
 a capacitor 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.080
 then of this type of engine the one 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.030
 have a capacitor let's talk about 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.670
 how are we going to connect 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.319
 all right 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.319
 like here I'm going to draw the outline 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.770
 I'm going to draw the power lines 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.860
 here is a power line 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.400
 although the other is for example would be the 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.620
 line and neutral if we are going to connect to 110 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.540
 volts but then we can also 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.590
 connect to 223 in this case would be the 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.980
 line and line 220 points 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:00.700
 let's leave it like that 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:04.260
 then the winding here is this is 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.260
 the job defendant 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.410
 is the work hand 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.730
 where is the starting winding and 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.730
 here we can connect 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.750
 but it is connected in series through the 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.250
 trained 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:27.180
 the micro switch to tell them 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.400
 that this is what the game center is 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.420
 center and fire 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:37.430
 and here he had already connected our 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.430
 starter winding 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.510
 how this engine works if you see 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.420
 the power line connects 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.349
 directly to the work coil at 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:53.439
 capacitor and this one centrifugal at the moment 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:56.769
 that the engine is stopped or not 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:04:00.400
 it does not work is closed then here it 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:03.099
 therefore closes the winding 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.430
 start says closes the entire circuit 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:09.430
 then at the moment that you give 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.760
 Supply voltage to the motor enter 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.760
 the two 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.769
 the two go to boot canopy and the 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.169
 of work between the two I return to 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:21.239
 repeat because he centrifugal makes 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.849
 this microsite is closed 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.450
 then they spend around 10 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:28.900
 seconds 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.810
 15 seconds not much less to the best and 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.290
 The centrifugal force of the motor makes 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.550
 that centrifuge is opened and even 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:42.660
 hear a slight motor noise 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:46.200
 you hear a click open opens the open 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.980
 the micro switch and take the defendant out 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:53.310
 start and we just stayed 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.810
 the work coil and there it stays 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.120
 the engine always working always 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.639
 simple 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.620
 and that is always that process always what 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:04.210
 they do when they start their water pump 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.210
 That's what he does 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.129
 this is the connection 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:13.680
 the diagram of an engine 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:16.259
 single phase that are used a lot 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.870
 as I repeat them again we do not occupy in 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:22.830
 our houses that is a bomb 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:27.350
 well for the moment that's all and we 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.350
 we see in the following video thanks
