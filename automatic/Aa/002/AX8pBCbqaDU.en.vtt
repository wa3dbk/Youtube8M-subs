this<00:00:41.370> interesting<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:42.000> two<00:00:42.030> reasons<00:00:42.149> one<00:00:43.110> he

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
this interesting for two reasons one he

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.450 
this interesting for two reasons one he
says<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.680> don't<00:00:43.920> want<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.340> go<00:00:44.430> back

into<00:00:44.850> matchmaking<00:00:45.090> now<00:00:45.930> from<00:00:46.140> what<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.350> were

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
into matchmaking now from what we were

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.440 
into matchmaking now from what we were
told<00:00:46.649> before<00:00:46.829> destiny<00:00:47.670> was<00:00:47.879> supposed<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.300> have

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
told before destiny was supposed to have

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.779 
told before destiny was supposed to have
no<00:00:48.750> main<00:00:48.989> menu<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.950> matchmaking<00:00:50.370> was<00:00:50.579> all

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
no main menu and the matchmaking was all

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.880 
no main menu and the matchmaking was all
done<00:00:51.000> behind<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.420> scenes<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.559> seems<00:00:52.770> to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
done behind the scenes so this seems to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.590 
done behind the scenes so this seems to
conflict<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.640> honestly<00:00:54.120> I'm<00:00:54.239> not<00:00:54.270> sure

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
conflict with that honestly I'm not sure

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.209 
conflict with that honestly I'm not sure
what<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.930> think<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.440> definitely<00:00:55.620> seems<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
what to think but it definitely seems a

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.920 
what to think but it definitely seems a
bit<00:00:56.340> confusing<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.090> mean<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.539> think<00:00:57.780> we're

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
bit confusing I mean I think we're

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.000 
bit confusing I mean I think we're
definitely<00:00:58.109> going<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.920> whole

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
definitely going to have the whole

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.740 
definitely going to have the whole
behind-the-scenes<00:00:59.670> matchmaking<00:01:00.210> thing<00:01:00.510> work

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
behind-the-scenes matchmaking thing work

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.450 
behind-the-scenes matchmaking thing work
you'll<00:01:00.989> run<00:01:01.350> into<00:01:01.379> players<00:01:01.829> just<00:01:02.190> as<00:01:02.309> you're

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
you'll run into players just as you're

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.189 
you'll run into players just as you're
going<00:01:02.579> along<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.690> makes<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.960> sound<00:01:04.080> like

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
going along but this makes it sound like

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.060 
going along but this makes it sound like
there's<00:01:04.379> actually<00:01:04.680> some<00:01:04.860> kind<00:01:05.040> of

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
there's actually some kind of

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.490 
there's actually some kind of
matchmaking<00:01:05.580> lobby<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.689> really<00:01:07.110> don't<00:01:07.229> know

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
matchmaking lobby so I really don't know

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.109 
matchmaking lobby so I really don't know
now<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.130> other<00:01:08.340> reason<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.820> find<00:01:09.030> this

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
now the other reason I find this

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.760 
now the other reason I find this
interesting<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.780> because<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.170> confirms<00:01:10.560> that

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
interesting is because it confirms that

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.770 
interesting is because it confirms that
destiny<00:01:11.310> will<00:01:11.549> not<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:11.970> dedicated<00:01:12.450> servers

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
destiny will not have dedicated servers

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.780 
destiny will not have dedicated servers
the<00:01:13.590> game<00:01:13.770> will<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:14.010> hosted<00:01:14.369> by<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the game will be hosted by one of the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.700 
the game will be hosted by one of the
players<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.600> as<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.140> Halo<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.500> Call

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
players just as it is in Halo and Call

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.260 
players just as it is in Halo and Call
of<00:01:16.890> Duty<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.369> most<00:01:17.580> other<00:01:17.820> first-person

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
of Duty and most other first-person

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.390 
of Duty and most other first-person
shooters<00:01:18.750> now<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.409> think<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.830> was<00:01:19.979> already

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
shooters now I think this was already

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.190 
shooters now I think this was already
kind<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.700> assumed<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.659> seems<00:01:21.869> more<00:01:21.960> like

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
kind of assumed but this seems more like

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.600 
kind of assumed but this seems more like
some<00:01:22.229> pretty<00:01:22.470> solid<00:01:22.860> proved<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.280> me<00:01:23.400> and

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
some pretty solid proved to me and

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.010 
some pretty solid proved to me and
honestly<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.360> little<00:01:24.570> bit<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.810> letdown

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
honestly it's a little bit of a letdown

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.080 
honestly it's a little bit of a letdown
I<00:01:25.439> was<00:01:25.799> hoping<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.220> destiny<00:01:26.729> might<00:01:26.909> have

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
I was hoping that destiny might have

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.940 
I was hoping that destiny might have
dedicated<00:01:27.479> servers<00:01:27.780> if<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.650> don't<00:01:28.829> know

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
dedicated servers if you don't know

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.620 
dedicated servers if you don't know
generally<00:01:29.520> dedicated<00:01:30.000> servers<00:01:30.329> are<00:01:30.450> going<00:01:30.570> to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
generally dedicated servers are going to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.969 
generally dedicated servers are going to
have<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> lot<00:01:30.960> less<00:01:31.110> lag<00:01:31.380> you're<00:01:31.680> not<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:31.920> to

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
have a lot less lag you're not going to

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.859 
have a lot less lag you're not going to
have<00:01:32.159> black<00:01:32.460> screens<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.180> disconnects<00:01:33.659> and

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
have black screens and disconnects and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.510 
have black screens and disconnects and
all<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.170> kind<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.439> crap<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:35.040> again<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
all that kind of crap but again the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.219 
all that kind of crap but again the
majority<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.060> first-person<00:01:36.509> shooters<00:01:36.960> don't

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
majority of first-person shooters don't

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.140 
majority of first-person shooters don't
have<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.590> dedicated<00:01:37.860> servers<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.850> can't

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
have the dedicated servers so you can't

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.850 
have the dedicated servers so you can't
really<00:01:39.240> expect<00:01:39.720> any<00:01:39.960> different<00:01:40.140> from<00:01:40.409> destiny

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
really expect any different from destiny

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.859 
really expect any different from destiny
now<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.400> think<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.820> means<00:01:42.030> pretty<00:01:42.390> flat<00:01:42.689> out

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
now I think this means pretty flat out

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.260 
now I think this means pretty flat out
the<00:01:43.020> destiny<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.560> not<00:01:43.590> an<00:01:44.070> MMO<00:01:44.460> absolutely<00:01:45.119> no

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the destiny is not an MMO absolutely no

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.270 
the destiny is not an MMO absolutely no
way<00:01:45.450> because<00:01:46.110> without<00:01:46.259> dedicated<00:01:46.920> servers

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
way because without dedicated servers

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.649 
way because without dedicated servers
you're<00:01:47.520> not<00:01:47.700> going<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.970> get<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.240> large<00:01:48.390> amount

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
you're not going to get the large amount

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.300 
you're not going to get the large amount
of<00:01:48.750> players<00:01:48.930> needed<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.500> classify<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.040> as<00:01:50.189> an

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
of players needed to classify it as an

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.399 
of players needed to classify it as an
MMO<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> local<00:01:51.509> host<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.200> there's

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
MMO with a local host like this there's

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.109 
MMO with a local host like this there's
no<00:01:52.619> way<00:01:52.770> you're<00:01:52.920> gonna<00:01:53.009> get<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.549> know<00:01:53.579> you

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
no way you're gonna get you know you

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.340 
no way you're gonna get you know you
probably<00:01:54.329> couldn't<00:01:54.630> even<00:01:54.750> get<00:01:54.869> 30<00:01:55.079> players

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
probably couldn't even get 30 players

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.410 
probably couldn't even get 30 players
and<00:01:55.680> you're<00:01:56.369> certainly<00:01:56.640> not<00:01:56.729> going<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.000> get<00:01:57.119> 50

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
and you're certainly not going to get 50

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.539 
and you're certainly not going to get 50
or<00:01:57.540> 100<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.590> we're<00:01:58.740> definitely<00:01:58.920> not<00:01:59.250> going<00:01:59.460> to

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
or 100 so we're definitely not going to

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.010 
or 100 so we're definitely not going to
have<00:01:59.700> really<00:02:00.000> large<00:02:00.149> player<00:02:00.509> accounts<00:02:00.899> in

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
have really large player accounts in

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.749 
have really large player accounts in
destiny<00:02:01.409> which<00:02:01.619> kind<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.040> sucks<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.670> be

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
destiny which kind of sucks but to be

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.160 
destiny which kind of sucks but to be
honest<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.090> should<00:02:03.299> be<00:02:03.390> expected<00:02:03.990> they

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
honest it should be expected they

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.780 
honest it should be expected they
already<00:02:04.439> pretty<00:02:04.710> much<00:02:04.890> told<00:02:05.130> us<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.460> wasn't<00:02:05.640> an

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
already pretty much told us it wasn't an

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.580 
already pretty much told us it wasn't an
MMO<00:02:06.119> now<00:02:06.570> real<00:02:06.750> quick<00:02:06.899> I'd<00:02:07.049> like<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.320> point<00:02:07.439> out

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
MMO now real quick I'd like to point out

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.410 
MMO now real quick I'd like to point out
the<00:02:07.740> question<00:02:08.160> did<00:02:08.340> ask<00:02:08.580> what<00:02:09.000> are<00:02:09.119> some<00:02:09.300> of

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
the question did ask what are some of

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.059 
the question did ask what are some of
the<00:02:09.450> more<00:02:09.660> TV

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
the more TV

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.500 
the more TV
things<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.489> testers<00:02:10.849> have<00:02:10.939> had<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.150> do<00:02:11.299> for

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
things that testers have had to do for

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.379 
things that testers have had to do for
either<00:02:11.959> halo<00:02:12.499> or<00:02:12.709> destiny<00:02:13.459> but<00:02:13.879> I<00:02:13.909> definitely

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:14.389 
either halo or destiny but I definitely

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:15.940 
either halo or destiny but I definitely
think<00:02:14.719> this<00:02:14.989> answer<00:02:15.379> is<00:02:15.409> referring

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
think this answer is referring

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.800 
think this answer is referring
specifically<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.519> destiny<00:02:17.060> because<00:02:17.540> he<00:02:17.659> keeps

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
specifically to destiny because he keeps

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.869 
specifically to destiny because he keeps
mentioning<00:02:18.079> squad<00:02:18.650> squads<00:02:19.040> came<00:02:19.249> up<00:02:19.430> twice<00:02:19.670> in

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
mentioning squad squads came up twice in

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.270 
mentioning squad squads came up twice in
the<00:02:19.969> answer<00:02:20.269> and<00:02:20.510> halo<00:02:21.499> doesn't<00:02:21.829> have<00:02:21.950> squads

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
the answer and halo doesn't have squads

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.099 
the answer and halo doesn't have squads
so<00:02:22.549> I<00:02:22.579> think<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:22.999> is<00:02:23.120> definitely<00:02:23.269> a<00:02:23.629> destiny

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:24.109 
so I think this is definitely a destiny

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:25.959 
so I think this is definitely a destiny

long<00:02:56.120> bursting<00:02:56.810> with<00:02:56.840> bungie<00:02:57.290> secret<00:02:57.650> sauce

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
long bursting with bungie secret sauce

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.860 
long bursting with bungie secret sauce
so<00:02:58.489> that<00:02:58.639> basically<00:02:58.790> goes<00:02:59.239> along<00:02:59.510> with<00:02:59.659> what<00:02:59.719> I

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
so that basically goes along with what I

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.530 
so that basically goes along with what I
said<00:03:00.109> in<00:03:00.199> my<00:03:00.230> GDC<00:03:00.829> video<00:03:01.159> basically<00:03:01.639> that<00:03:02.030> GDC

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
said in my GDC video basically that GDC

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.240 
said in my GDC video basically that GDC
isn't<00:03:02.959> really<00:03:03.260> your<00:03:03.379> standard<00:03:03.769> marketing

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
isn't really your standard marketing

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.309 
isn't really your standard marketing
event<00:03:04.519> like<00:03:04.790> III<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.540> we're<00:03:05.870> not<00:03:05.989> going<00:03:06.169> to<00:03:06.230> be

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
event like III and we're not going to be

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.809 
event like III and we're not going to be
getting<00:03:06.439> any<00:03:06.650> regular<00:03:07.099> marketing<00:03:07.519> trailer

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819

getting any regular marketing trailer
out<00:03:08.000> of<00:03:08.030> GDC<00:03:08.540> but<00:03:09.199> like<00:03:09.349> the<00:03:09.469> answer<00:03:09.769> says

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:09.949 
out of GDC but like the answer says

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:11.319 
out of GDC but like the answer says
there<00:03:10.159> is<00:03:10.310> going<00:03:10.489> to<00:03:10.579> be<00:03:10.609> a<00:03:10.699> significant

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
there is going to be a significant

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:12.789 
there is going to be a significant
amount<00:03:11.510> of<00:03:11.629> footage<00:03:11.989> revealed<00:03:12.379> there<00:03:12.620> and

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
amount of footage revealed there and

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.170 
amount of footage revealed there and
hopefully<00:03:13.340> they're<00:03:13.609> gonna<00:03:13.669> share<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.030> good

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
hopefully they're gonna share a good

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.999 
hopefully they're gonna share a good
amount<00:03:14.389> of<00:03:14.509> that<00:03:14.659> with<00:03:14.840> us<00:03:15.019> and<00:03:15.259> even<00:03:15.769> if<00:03:15.859> they

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:16.009 
amount of that with us and even if they

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:17.439 
amount of that with us and even if they
didn't<00:03:16.340> which<00:03:16.489> I'm<00:03:16.639> sure<00:03:16.819> they<00:03:16.970> will<00:03:17.150> we'd

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:17.449 
didn't which I'm sure they will we'd

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:18.819 
didn't which I'm sure they will we'd
still<00:03:17.689> get<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.840> bunch<00:03:18.019> of<00:03:18.169> photos<00:03:18.379> and<00:03:18.680> stuff

from other people moving on this next

from other people moving on this next
question<00:03:20.989> is<00:03:21.319> very<00:03:21.560> interesting<00:03:22.069> it<00:03:22.430> comes

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:22.729 
question is very interesting it comes

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:25.179 
question is very interesting it comes
from<00:03:22.819> Masterson<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.780> he<00:03:23.989> asked<00:03:24.319> in<00:03:24.560> destiny

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:25.189 
from Masterson and he asked in destiny

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:27.369 
from Masterson and he asked in destiny
can<00:03:25.430> replay<00:03:25.790> as<00:03:25.939> the<00:03:26.060> aliens<00:03:26.449> or<00:03:26.659> we<00:03:27.139> locked

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
can replay as the aliens or we locked

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.770 
can replay as the aliens or we locked
into<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.739> human<00:03:27.889> race<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:28.519> if<00:03:28.970> we<00:03:29.120> are<00:03:29.299> why

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
into the human race and if we are why

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.229 
into the human race and if we are why
what's<00:03:30.139> the<00:03:30.319> reason<00:03:30.650> now<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.310> answer<00:03:31.519> is<00:03:31.729> not

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
what's the reason now the answer is not

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.240 
what's the reason now the answer is not
all<00:03:32.509> of<00:03:32.659> the<00:03:32.750> aliens<00:03:33.139> in<00:03:33.319> destiny<00:03:33.709> are<00:03:33.859> evil

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
all of the aliens in destiny are evil

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.039 
all of the aliens in destiny are evil
just<00:03:34.729> like<00:03:34.849> not<00:03:35.060> all<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.389> humans<00:03:35.720> are<00:03:35.840> good

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
just like not all the humans are good

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.020 
just like not all the humans are good
we've<00:03:36.590> barely<00:03:36.919> scratched<00:03:37.099> the<00:03:37.459> surface<00:03:37.519> on

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
we've barely scratched the surface on

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.789 
we've barely scratched the surface on
character<00:03:38.479> and<00:03:38.659> customization<00:03:39.379> options

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
character and customization options

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.679 
character and customization options
you'll<00:03:39.979> have<00:03:40.129> access<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.579> in<00:03:40.909> destiny<00:03:41.329> but

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:41.689 
you'll have access to in destiny but

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:42.849 
you'll have access to in destiny but
we're<00:03:41.810> not<00:03:41.959> going<00:03:42.139> to<00:03:42.229> dig<00:03:42.379> in<00:03:42.500> any<00:03:42.620> deeper

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
we're not going to dig in any deeper

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.009 
we're not going to dig in any deeper
today<00:03:43.280> now<00:03:43.729> obviously<00:03:43.909> that's<00:03:44.389> very<00:03:44.689> exciting

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
today now obviously that's very exciting

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.420 
today now obviously that's very exciting
because<00:03:45.290> it<00:03:45.530> means<00:03:45.650> we'll<00:03:45.799> probably<00:03:45.859> have

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
because it means we'll probably have

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.610 
because it means we'll probably have
alien<00:03:46.909> allies<00:03:47.150> in<00:03:47.540> destiny<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.169> even

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
alien allies in destiny and even

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.229 
alien allies in destiny and even
possibly<00:03:49.009> play<00:03:49.310> as<00:03:49.459> them<00:03:49.609> although<00:03:49.939> to<00:03:50.150> be

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
possibly play as them although to be

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.759 
possibly play as them although to be
honest<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:50.629> kind<00:03:50.870> of<00:03:51.019> doubt<00:03:51.229> we're<00:03:51.470> going<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.650> be

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
honest I kind of doubt we're going to be

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.530 
honest I kind of doubt we're going to be
able<00:03:51.859> to<00:03:52.040> play<00:03:52.250> as<00:03:52.400> aliens<00:03:52.790> just<00:03:53.269> because<00:03:53.509> of

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
able to play as aliens just because of

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.030 
able to play as aliens just because of
the<00:03:53.629> whole<00:03:53.780> traveler<00:03:54.259> thing<00:03:54.500> how<00:03:54.709> it<00:03:54.829> saved

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
the whole traveler thing how it saved

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.979 
the whole traveler thing how it saved
humanity<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.759> were<00:03:55.909> the<00:03:56.030> guardians<00:03:56.359> and<00:03:56.840> just

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
humanity and were the guardians and just

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.330 
humanity and were the guardians and just
the<00:03:57.079> whole<00:03:57.169> feeling<00:03:57.590> of<00:03:57.650> it<00:03:57.799> it<00:03:57.889> just<00:03:57.919> doesn't

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
the whole feeling of it it just doesn't

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.709 
the whole feeling of it it just doesn't
seem<00:03:58.459> like<00:03:58.489> playing<00:03:58.849> as<00:03:59.000> aliens<00:03:59.329> would<00:03:59.449> really

00:03:59.709 --> 00:03:59.719 
seem like playing as aliens would really

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.330 
seem like playing as aliens would really
fit<00:03:59.959> it<00:04:00.319> would<00:04:00.409> be<00:04:00.530> cool<00:04:00.739> and<00:04:01.040> if<00:04:01.099> they<00:04:01.189> can

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
fit it would be cool and if they can

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.800 
fit it would be cool and if they can
make<00:04:01.370> it<00:04:01.489> work<00:04:01.699> in<00:04:01.849> a<00:04:01.909> story<00:04:02.180> that's<00:04:02.239> awesome

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
make it work in a story that's awesome

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.749 
make it work in a story that's awesome
but<00:04:03.019> i'm<00:04:03.199> not<00:04:03.319> sure<00:04:03.620> if<00:04:03.739> they<00:04:03.859> could<00:04:04.129> know<00:04:04.639> it

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:04.759 
but i'm not sure if they could know it

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:06.550 
but i'm not sure if they could know it
also<00:04:05.030> says<00:04:05.239> that<00:04:05.269> not<00:04:05.569> all<00:04:05.780> humans<00:04:05.989> are<00:04:06.289> good

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
also says that not all humans are good

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.439 
also says that not all humans are good
so<00:04:07.069> that<00:04:07.219> means<00:04:07.430> besides<00:04:07.789> all<00:04:07.939> the<00:04:08.030> alien

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449 
so that means besides all the alien

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:09.490 
so that means besides all the alien
enemies<00:04:08.780> were<00:04:08.930> probably<00:04:09.079> going<00:04:09.289> to<00:04:09.349> have<00:04:09.409> to

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
enemies were probably going to have to

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.619 
enemies were probably going to have to
fight<00:04:09.769> humans<00:04:10.189> as<00:04:10.310> well<00:04:10.340> which<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.299> be<00:04:11.389> honest

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
fight humans as well which to be honest

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.839 
fight humans as well which to be honest
that<00:04:11.780> makes<00:04:11.959> perfect<00:04:12.289> sense<00:04:12.500> non<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.519> the<00:04:13.609> next

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
that makes perfect sense non to the next

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.490 
that makes perfect sense non to the next
question<00:04:13.969> which<00:04:14.359> comes<00:04:14.389> from<00:04:14.780> element<00:04:15.229> zero

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
question which comes from element zero

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.949 
question which comes from element zero
he<00:04:15.949> asks<00:04:16.310> how<00:04:16.639> bigger<00:04:16.880> levels<00:04:17.329> in<00:04:17.539> destiny

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
he asks how bigger levels in destiny

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.449 
he asks how bigger levels in destiny
compared<00:04:18.440> to<00:04:18.529> the<00:04:18.650> levels<00:04:18.949> from<00:04:19.130> your<00:04:19.279> past

one here comes from Joe and he says

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.110 
one here comes from Joe and he says
Venus<00:05:08.800> it's<00:05:09.310> pretty<00:05:09.670> and<00:05:09.850> I<00:05:09.940> like<00:05:10.090> the

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
Venus it's pretty and I like the

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.090 
Venus it's pretty and I like the
combatants<00:05:10.780> you<00:05:10.870> find<00:05:11.140> there<00:05:11.350> now<00:05:11.770> it's<00:05:11.950> been

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
combatants you find there now it's been

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.100 
combatants you find there now it's been
hinted<00:05:12.400> at<00:05:12.520> that<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.760> vex<00:05:13.060> control<00:05:13.540> Venus<00:05:13.900> and

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.140 
hinted at that the vex control Venus and
that<00:05:14.200> seems<00:05:14.410> highly<00:05:14.620> likely<00:05:14.970> so<00:05:15.970> that's

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
that seems highly likely so that's

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.670 
that seems highly likely so that's
probably<00:05:16.450> what<00:05:16.750> he<00:05:16.810> means<00:05:17.020> although<00:05:17.470> honestly

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
probably what he means although honestly

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.770

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.300 
something I noticed across all of these
is<00:05:40.900> that<00:05:41.140> they're<00:05:41.410> really<00:05:41.740> only<00:05:41.919> talking

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310

about<00:05:42.520> Mars<00:05:43.000> Venus<00:05:43.450> and<00:05:43.810> the<00:05:43.870> moon<00:05:44.260> they

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
about Mars Venus and the moon they

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.050 
about Mars Venus and the moon they

and it's been said that we'll be able to
explore<00:05:55.480> every<00:05:55.780> planet<00:05:56.110> in<00:05:56.169> our<00:05:56.290> solar<00:05:56.350> system

explore every planet in our solar system

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.280 
explore every planet in our solar system
now<00:05:57.580> it<00:05:57.700> does<00:05:57.850> make<00:05:58.030> me<00:05:58.060> wonder<00:05:58.330> if<00:05:58.600> Venus<00:05:58.990> Mars

00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.290

and<00:05:59.620> our<00:05:59.710> Moon<00:05:59.950> are<00:06:00.190> going<00:06:00.340> to<00:06:00.400> be<00:06:00.490> like<00:06:00.610> the

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
and our Moon are going to be like the

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.520 
and our Moon are going to be like the
main<00:06:00.940> focus<00:06:01.210> and<00:06:01.630> the<00:06:01.720> other<00:06:01.870> planets<00:06:02.290> are<00:06:02.440> not

main focus and the other planets are not

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.650 
main focus and the other planets are not
as<00:06:02.770> important<00:06:03.250> but<00:06:03.580> probably<00:06:04.000> that's<00:06:04.240> not<00:06:04.480> it

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
as important but probably that's not it
