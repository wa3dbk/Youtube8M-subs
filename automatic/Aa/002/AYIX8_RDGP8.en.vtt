00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
you're doing with some of these guns you

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.979 
you're doing with some of these guns you
could<00:00:40.649> potentially<00:00:41.510> consistently<00:00:42.510> go<00:00:42.719> for

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
could potentially consistently go for

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.510 
could potentially consistently go for
headshots<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.739> mean<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.129> was<00:00:44.250> running<00:00:44.460> around

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
headshots I mean I was running around

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.810 
headshots I mean I was running around
the<00:00:44.670> p90<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.420> TDM<00:00:46.350> no<00:00:46.559> shark<00:00:46.800> canals<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.370> I

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
the p90 on TDM no shark canals and I

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.250 
the p90 on TDM no shark canals and I
would<00:00:48.000> see<00:00:48.149> an<00:00:48.239> enemy<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.539> fair<00:00:48.870> distance<00:00:49.110> away

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
would see an enemy a fair distance away

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.290 
would see an enemy a fair distance away
know<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.219> was<00:00:50.460> low<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.670> health<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.270> I

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
know that I was low on health and I

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.700 
know that I was low on health and I
needed<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.570> land<00:00:51.750> some<00:00:51.899> headshots<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.410> him<00:00:52.590> to

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
needed to land some headshots on him to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.959 
needed to land some headshots on him to
get<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.039> victory<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.550> come<00:00:53.699> out<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
get the victory to come out of the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.970 
get the victory to come out of the
firefight<00:00:54.329> alive<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.199> was<00:00:55.350> able<00:00:55.829> to

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
firefight alive and I was able to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.189 
firefight alive and I was able to
consistently<00:00:56.879> land<00:00:57.149> headshots<00:00:57.629> back-to-back

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
consistently land headshots back-to-back

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.920 
consistently land headshots back-to-back
even<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.039> while<00:00:59.250> hipfire<00:00:59.730> they're<00:01:00.359> incredibly

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
even a while hipfire they're incredibly

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.650 
even a while hipfire they're incredibly
fun<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.320> use<00:01:01.530> some<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.309> them<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:02.579> thinking<00:01:02.910> wait

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
fun to use some of them be thinking wait

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.539 
fun to use some of them be thinking wait
a<00:01:03.870> second<00:01:04.260> maybe<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.680> reason<00:01:05.010> why<00:01:05.159> we<00:01:05.430> don't

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
a second maybe the reason why we don't

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.370 
a second maybe the reason why we don't
have<00:01:05.790> some<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.150> these<00:01:06.240> guns<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.689> battle<00:01:06.990> or<00:01:07.140> is

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
have some of these guns in battle or is

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.320 
have some of these guns in battle or is
that<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.400> sounds<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.030> little<00:01:09.060> bit

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
that this sounds a little bit

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.940 
that this sounds a little bit
overpowered<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.080> you're<00:01:10.260> able<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.590> hipfire

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
overpowered if you're able to hipfire

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.830 
overpowered if you're able to hipfire
and<00:01:11.220> go<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.580> headshots<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.689> this

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
and go for headshots and have this

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.719 
and go for headshots and have this
pinpoint<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.350> accuracy<00:01:13.950> well<00:01:14.369> then<00:01:14.549> what's

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
pinpoint like accuracy well then what's

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:15.920 
pinpoint like accuracy well then what's
the<00:01:14.850> point<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.090> having<00:01:15.180> all<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> other<00:01:15.600> guns

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
the point of having all the other guns

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.179 
the point of having all the other guns
in<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> game<00:01:16.259> why<00:01:16.409> wouldn't<00:01:16.799> everyone<00:01:16.979> would

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
in the game why wouldn't everyone would

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.890 
in the game why wouldn't everyone would
just<00:01:17.220> want<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.520> use<00:01:17.670> those<00:01:17.939> well<00:01:18.600> they<00:01:18.780> were

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
just want to use those well they were

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.420 
just want to use those well they were
they<00:01:19.380> were<00:01:19.439> amazing<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.100> don't<00:01:20.280> get<00:01:20.369> me

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
they were amazing like don't get me

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.770 
they were amazing like don't get me
wrong<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.000> would<00:01:21.119> not<00:01:21.270> say<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.450> they<00:01:21.720> were

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
wrong but I would not say that they were

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.499 
wrong but I would not say that they were
the<00:01:22.500> top<00:01:22.799> tier<00:01:23.159> guns<00:01:23.460> if<00:01:24.090> you've<00:01:24.240> ever<00:01:24.420> played

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
battle 2 3 4 kills a couple of hours you

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.270 
battle 2 3 4 kills a couple of hours you
would<00:01:26.820> quickly<00:01:27.000> realize<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.900> m16a3<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.880 
would quickly realize that the m16a3 the
m416<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.479> even<00:01:30.869> something<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.409> AEK

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
m416 and even something like the AEK

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.190 
m416 and even something like the AEK
were<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.579> higher<00:01:32.820> tier<00:01:33.150> weapons<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:34.049> want

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
were the higher tier weapons if you want

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.850 
were the higher tier weapons if you want
to<00:01:34.290> be<00:01:34.380> competitive

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
to be competitive

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.080 
to be competitive
those<00:01:35.189> were<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.549> guns<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.939> would

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
those were the guns that you would

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.090 
those were the guns that you would
gravitate<00:01:36.240> towards<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.020> then<00:01:37.409> all<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
gravitate towards and then all of the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.219 
gravitate towards and then all of the
others<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.369> especially<00:01:39.180> these<00:01:39.420> hipfire<00:01:39.869> guns

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
others and especially these hipfire guns

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.200 
others and especially these hipfire guns
were<00:01:40.860> definitely<00:01:41.310> competitive<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:42.090> you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
were definitely competitive like you

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.789 
were definitely competitive like you
could<00:01:42.390> still<00:01:42.600> do<00:01:42.720> very<00:01:42.750> well<00:01:42.990> but<00:01:43.680> they

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
could still do very well but they

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.740 
could still do very well but they
weren't<00:01:43.950> flat-out<00:01:44.479> overpowered<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
weren't flat-out overpowered and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.050 
weren't flat-out overpowered and
especially<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.500> hipfire<00:01:46.799> guns<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.460> p90

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
especially the hipfire guns like the p90

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.719 
especially the hipfire guns like the p90
they<00:01:48.540> added<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.170> gameplay<00:01:49.799> experience<00:01:50.490> they

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
they added a gameplay experience they

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.789 
they added a gameplay experience they
had<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.509> think<00:01:51.750> about<00:01:51.930> combat<00:01:52.320> differently

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
had you think about combat differently

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.380 
had you think about combat differently
than<00:01:53.220> all<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.790> other<00:01:53.939> weapons<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
than all of the other weapons in the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.959 
than all of the other weapons in the
game<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.840> we<00:01:55.110> don't<00:01:55.140> really<00:01:55.799> have<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.490> in

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
game and we don't really have that in

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.030 
game and we don't really have that in
battlefield<00:01:57.420> 4<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.439> guess<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> point

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
battlefield 4 and so I guess the point

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.440 
battlefield 4 and so I guess the point
that<00:01:59.159> I'm<00:01:59.250> trying<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.520> get<00:01:59.610> across<00:01:59.729> is<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.210> if

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
that I'm trying to get across is that if

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.630 
that I'm trying to get across is that if
there's<00:02:00.630> ever<00:02:00.780> new<00:02:01.380> weapons<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> horizon

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
there's ever new weapons on the horizon

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.580 
there's ever new weapons on the horizon
maybe<00:02:02.820> dice<00:02:03.090> will<00:02:03.299> surprise<00:02:03.960> us<00:02:04.229> with<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> new

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
maybe dice will surprise us with a new

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.230 
maybe dice will surprise us with a new
weapons<00:02:04.890> great<00:02:05.070> DLC<00:02:05.460> I'd<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> little

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
weapons great DLC I'd be a little

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.789 
weapons great DLC I'd be a little
surprised<00:02:06.570> by<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.930> because<00:02:07.079> we're<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.409> long

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
surprised by that because we're so long

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.169 
surprised by that because we're so long
in<00:02:07.979> development<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:08.520> they've<00:02:08.640> surprised<00:02:09.030> us

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
in development but they've surprised us

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.360 
in development but they've surprised us
in<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.360> past<00:02:09.539> or<00:02:09.959> if<00:02:10.530> they<00:02:10.679> go<00:02:10.860> through<00:02:11.190> to

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
in the past or if they go through to

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.070 
in the past or if they go through to
balance<00:02:11.760> out<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:11.940> PDW<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.720> little<00:02:12.930> bit

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
balance out the PDW is a little bit

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.560 
balance out the PDW is a little bit
more<00:02:13.260> let's<00:02:13.980> be<00:02:14.130> honest<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.460> pdws<00:02:15.000> are<00:02:15.210> still

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
more let's be honest the pdws are still

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.330 
more let's be honest the pdws are still
are<00:02:15.900> still<00:02:16.260> pretty<00:02:16.530> weak<00:02:16.770> compared<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.190> all

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
are still pretty weak compared to all

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.530 
are still pretty weak compared to all
the<00:02:17.520> other<00:02:17.640> weapons<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.090> game<00:02:18.240> especially

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
the other weapons of the game especially

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.060 
the other weapons of the game especially
the<00:02:18.960> carbines<00:02:19.380> when<00:02:19.590> you're<00:02:19.710> playing<00:02:19.830> as<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
the carbines when you're playing as the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.640 
the carbines when you're playing as the
engineer<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:21.180> would<00:02:21.360> be<00:02:21.480> nice<00:02:21.750> if<00:02:22.110> they<00:02:22.380> maybe

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
engineer it would be nice if they maybe

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.850 
engineer it would be nice if they maybe
had<00:02:23.010> some<00:02:23.310> guns<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:24.090> were<00:02:24.210> primarily

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
had some guns that were primarily

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.740 
had some guns that were primarily
primarily<00:02:25.860> designed<00:02:26.100> around<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:27.510> hip

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
primarily designed around just hip

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.840 
primarily designed around just hip
firing<00:02:28.020> your<00:02:28.260> enemy<00:02:28.560> down<00:02:28.770> don't<00:02:29.610> get<00:02:29.730> me

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
firing your enemy down don't get me

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.580 
firing your enemy down don't get me
wrong<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:30.150> realize<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:30.960> possible<00:02:31.530> to

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
wrong I realize that it is possible to

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.260 
wrong I realize that it is possible to
do<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:32.220> battlefield<00:02:32.670> 4<00:02:32.730> like<00:02:33.000> hopefully

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
do this in battlefield 4 like hopefully

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.330 
do this in battlefield 4 like hopefully
today's<00:02:33.750> video<00:02:34.020> has<00:02:34.230> illustrated<00:02:34.740> that<00:02:34.890> you

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
today's video has illustrated that you

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.220 
today's video has illustrated that you
run<00:02:35.490> around<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.850> p90<00:02:36.330> if<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.600> want<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:37.050> you

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
run around the p90 if you want to you

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.020 
run around the p90 if you want to you
can<00:02:37.410> still<00:02:37.650> do<00:02:37.860> well<00:02:38.010> by<00:02:38.190> just<00:02:38.250> hipfire<00:02:38.730> people

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
can still do well by just hipfire people

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.820 
can still do well by just hipfire people
down<00:02:39.240> but<00:02:39.870> at<00:02:39.990> least<00:02:40.200> when<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.410> balance<00:02:40.710> between

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
down but at least when I balance between

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.830 
down but at least when I balance between
the<00:02:41.040> two<00:02:41.160> games<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.730> doesn't<00:02:42.300> seem<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.570> be<00:02:42.690> as

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
the two games it doesn't seem to be as

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.450 
the two games it doesn't seem to be as
accurate<00:02:43.320> there<00:02:43.440> seems<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.740> be<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.920> hell<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.370> a

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
accurate there seems to be a hell of a

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.070 
accurate there seems to be a hell of a
lot<00:02:44.610> more<00:02:44.640> bullet<00:02:45.000> spread<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:45.810> doesn't

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
lot more bullet spread and it doesn't

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.320 
lot more bullet spread and it doesn't
seem<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.620> be<00:02:46.740> as<00:02:46.920> consistent<00:02:47.550> as<00:02:47.910> its

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
seem to be as consistent as its

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.720 
seem to be as consistent as its
battlefield<00:02:48.810> 3<00:02:49.020> counterpart<00:02:49.620> maybe<00:02:50.340> it's<00:02:50.580> all

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
battlefield 3 counterpart maybe it's all

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.230 
battlefield 3 counterpart maybe it's all
in<00:02:50.850> my<00:02:50.970> head

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
in my head

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.000 
in my head
maybe<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.600> have<00:02:51.780> absolutely<00:02:52.290> no<00:02:52.470> idea<00:02:52.500> what<00:02:52.920> I'm

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
maybe I have absolutely no idea what I'm

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.199 
maybe I have absolutely no idea what I'm
talking<00:02:53.040> about<00:02:53.340> which<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.790> distinct

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
talking about which is a distinct

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.090 
talking about which is a distinct
possibility<00:02:54.420> they're<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.500> same<00:02:55.740> stats

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
possibility they're the same stats

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.699 
possibility they're the same stats
between<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.580> two<00:02:56.730> titles<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:57.600> can<00:02:58.410> swear

the m16a3 the m16a3 was a fan-favorite
back<00:03:37.260> in<00:03:37.440> battlefield<00:03:37.860> 3<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.340> g3a3<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.239> very

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
back in battlefield 3 the g3a3 is a very

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.960 
back in battlefield 3 the g3a3 is a very
iconic<00:03:39.959> gun<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:40.920> when<00:03:41.130> people<00:03:41.160> learn<00:03:41.640> that

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
iconic gun and so when people learn that

iconic gun and so when people learn that
we<00:03:42.090> were<00:03:42.180> getting<00:03:42.269> gonna<00:03:42.540> get<00:03:42.720> these<00:03:42.900> Grose's

it's new weapons to play with they were

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.479 
it's new weapons to play with they were
also<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.150> little<00:03:48.630> disappointed<00:03:49.320> DICE's<00:03:50.160> reason

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
also a little disappointed DICE's reason

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.030 
also a little disappointed DICE's reason
behind<00:03:50.640> this<00:03:50.940> is<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.690> g3a3<00:03:52.170> is<00:03:52.709> pretty

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
behind this is that the g3a3 is pretty

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.910 
behind this is that the g3a3 is pretty
much<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.820> scar-h<00:03:54.450> assault<00:03:55.019> rifle<00:03:55.410> they<00:03:55.769> would

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
much the scar-h assault rifle they would

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.100 
much the scar-h assault rifle they would
bring<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:56.280> in<00:03:56.430> it<00:03:56.670> would<00:03:56.760> basically<00:03:57.030> just<00:03:57.360> be<00:03:57.600> a

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
bring it in it would basically just be a

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.530 
bring it in it would basically just be a
reskin<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.280> g3a3<00:03:59.670> with<00:04:00.209> slightly

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
reskin of the g3a3 with slightly

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.110 
reskin of the g3a3 with slightly
different<00:04:00.690> stats<00:04:01.320> same<00:04:02.010> play<00:04:02.280> style<00:04:02.640> same<00:04:02.970> way

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
different stats same play style same way

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.430 
different stats same play style same way
that<00:04:03.269> you<00:04:03.390> would<00:04:03.540> use<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:03.930> but<00:04:04.019> it<00:04:04.140> would<00:04:04.230> just

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
that you would use it but it would just

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.470 
that you would use it but it would just
be<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:04.590> weapon<00:04:04.830> skin<00:04:05.220> same<00:04:05.820> width<00:04:06.000> same<00:04:06.030> thing

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
be a weapon skin same width same thing

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.380 
be a weapon skin same width same thing
with<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.720> m16a3<00:04:07.590> we<00:04:08.130> have<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.340> lot<00:04:08.670> of<00:04:08.880> guns<00:04:09.120> at

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
with the m16a3 we have a lot of guns at

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.820 
with the m16a3 we have a lot of guns at
that<00:04:09.510> mirror<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:10.019> type<00:04:10.200> of<00:04:10.230> play<00:04:10.440> style<00:04:10.739> that

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
that mirror that type of play style that

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.740 
that mirror that type of play style that
we<00:04:10.890> had<00:04:11.040> back<00:04:11.250> in<00:04:11.400> battle-ax<00:04:11.730> 3<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:12.540> that's

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
we had back in battle-ax 3 and so that's

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.930 
we had back in battle-ax 3 and so that's
the<00:04:12.930> reason<00:04:13.110> why<00:04:13.320> we<00:04:13.830> got<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.190> guns<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:14.790> we

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
the reason why we got the guns that we

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.060 
the reason why we got the guns that we
did<00:04:15.150> with<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.390> weapons<00:04:15.720> great<00:04:15.930> dlc<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.830> crows

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.450 
that same theme with hipfire weapons and
why<00:04:32.629> I<00:04:32.659> think<00:04:32.990> that<00:04:33.349> this<00:04:33.590> could<00:04:33.860> be<00:04:34.009> a<00:04:34.039> really

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
why I think that this could be a really

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.029 
why I think that this could be a really
cool<00:04:34.639> way<00:04:34.879> of<00:04:35.120> adding<00:04:35.779> in<00:04:36.080> a<00:04:36.259> unique<00:04:36.680> gameplay

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
cool way of adding in a unique gameplay

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.519 
cool way of adding in a unique gameplay
and<00:04:37.580> also<00:04:38.029> fits<00:04:38.300> the<00:04:38.419> same<00:04:38.659> mindset<00:04:39.080> that<00:04:39.319> dice

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:39.529 
and also fits the same mindset that dice

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.019 
and also fits the same mindset that dice
really<00:04:40.039> would<00:04:40.189> want<00:04:40.340> to<00:04:40.460> bring<00:04:40.639> something

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:41.029 
really would want to bring something

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:42.489 
really would want to bring something
unique<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.569> different<00:04:41.840> to<00:04:41.930> all<00:04:42.110> of<00:04:42.289> the<00:04:42.379> other

00:04:42.489 --> 00:04:42.499 
unique and different to all of the other

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:43.779 
unique and different to all of the other
weapons<00:04:42.710> in<00:04:42.979> the<00:04:43.129> game

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
weapons in the game

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.059 
weapons in the game
and<00:04:44.150> then<00:04:44.270> lastly<00:04:44.629> my<00:04:44.900> final<00:04:45.469> reason<00:04:45.860> why<00:04:46.039> I

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:46.069 
and then lastly my final reason why I

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.100 
and then lastly my final reason why I
would<00:04:46.340> love<00:04:46.490> to<00:04:46.669> have<00:04:46.879> this<00:04:47.120> is<00:04:47.330> that<00:04:47.779> it<00:04:47.900> might

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
would love to have this is that it might

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.920 
would love to have this is that it might
just<00:04:48.469> be<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:48.830> one<00:04:49.039> thing<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.939> elevates<00:04:50.479> some

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
just be the one thing that elevates some

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.230 
just be the one thing that elevates some
of<00:04:51.050> these<00:04:51.169> PDW<00:04:51.919> to<00:04:52.129> the<00:04:52.219> status<00:04:52.639> that<00:04:53.060> they're

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
of these PDW to the status that they're

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.439 
of these PDW to the status that they're
finally<00:04:53.599> viable<00:04:54.379> the<00:04:54.860> POWs<00:04:55.520> have<00:04:55.789> had<00:04:56.090> a<00:04:56.120> hard

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
finally viable the POWs have had a hard

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.659 
finally viable the POWs have had a hard
time<00:04:56.569> in<00:04:57.080> this<00:04:57.259> game<00:04:57.409> we<00:04:57.830> all<00:04:58.009> know<00:04:58.310> it<00:04:58.490> if

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
time in this game we all know it if

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.040 
time in this game we all know it if
you're<00:04:58.819> playing<00:04:59.029> as<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.150> engineer<00:04:59.629> a<00:04:59.779> lot<00:04:59.960> of

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
you're playing as the engineer a lot of

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.929 
you're playing as the engineer a lot of
people<00:05:00.259> will<00:05:00.379> just<00:05:00.409> opt<00:05:00.770> to<00:05:00.919> use<00:05:00.949> the<00:05:01.460> carbines

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:01.939 
people will just opt to use the carbines

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:03.459 
people will just opt to use the carbines
because<00:05:02.659> for<00:05:02.840> the<00:05:02.900> most<00:05:03.050> part<00:05:03.169> they<00:05:03.439> have

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:03.469 
because for the most part they have

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.200 
because for the most part they have
around<00:05:03.889> the<00:05:04.099> same<00:05:04.279> rounds<00:05:04.639> per<00:05:04.789> minute

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
around the same rounds per minute

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.330 
around the same rounds per minute
they<00:05:05.419> don't<00:05:05.659> drop<00:05:05.960> off<00:05:06.169> and<00:05:06.379> damage<00:05:06.680> nearly<00:05:07.219> as

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
they don't drop off and damage nearly as

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.860 
they don't drop off and damage nearly as
quickly<00:05:07.610> as<00:05:07.849> the<00:05:08.029> pdws

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
quickly as the pdws

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.149 
quickly as the pdws
and<00:05:08.960> for<00:05:09.379> the<00:05:09.439> most<00:05:09.620> part<00:05:09.860> they're<00:05:10.009> just

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:10.159 
and for the most part they're just

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:11.769 
and for the most part they're just
all-around<00:05:10.400> better<00:05:11.029> weapons<00:05:11.479> for<00:05:11.629> more

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:11.779 
all-around better weapons for more

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.689 
all-around better weapons for more
situations<00:05:12.500> because<00:05:13.159> if<00:05:13.279> you're<00:05:13.400> playing<00:05:13.580> as

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
situations because if you're playing as

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.159 
situations because if you're playing as
the<00:05:13.729> engineer<00:05:14.360> you're<00:05:14.539> gonna<00:05:14.629> want<00:05:14.930> something

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
the engineer you're gonna want something

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.140 
the engineer you're gonna want something
that<00:05:15.379> does<00:05:15.560> more<00:05:15.740> damage<00:05:15.800> at<00:05:16.250> a<00:05:16.279> distance<00:05:16.729> the

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
that does more damage at a distance the

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.450 
that does more damage at a distance the
carbines<00:05:17.689> are<00:05:17.870> just<00:05:18.259> are<00:05:18.500> just<00:05:18.889> a<00:05:19.009> better<00:05:19.129> pick

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
carbines are just are just a better pick

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.040 
carbines are just are just a better pick
compared<00:05:19.879> to<00:05:19.969> the<00:05:20.060> personal<00:05:20.360> defense<00:05:20.449> weapons

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
compared to the personal defense weapons

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.110 
compared to the personal defense weapons
and<00:05:21.319> so<00:05:21.710> it'd<00:05:21.830> be<00:05:21.860> nice<00:05:22.099> if<00:05:22.370> we<00:05:22.430> had<00:05:22.550> something

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
and so it'd be nice if we had something

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.570 
and so it'd be nice if we had something
like<00:05:23.689> this<00:05:23.990> increase<00:05:24.740> in<00:05:24.889> hipfire<00:05:25.189> accuracy

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
like this increase in hipfire accuracy

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.350 
like this increase in hipfire accuracy
to<00:05:26.330> maybe<00:05:26.599> make<00:05:26.870> some<00:05:27.169> of<00:05:27.259> these<00:05:27.349> pdws<00:05:28.039> a

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
to maybe make some of these pdws a

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.969 
to maybe make some of these pdws a
little<00:05:29.360> bit<00:05:29.479> more<00:05:29.689> appealing<00:05:30.110> I<00:05:30.439> don't<00:05:30.830> think

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
little bit more appealing I don't think

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:31.809 
little bit more appealing I don't think
it<00:05:31.039> would<00:05:31.129> all<00:05:31.219> of<00:05:31.279> a<00:05:31.310> sudden<00:05:31.520> make<00:05:31.639> them

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:31.819 
it would all of a sudden make them

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:33.339 
it would all of a sudden make them
overpowered<00:05:32.509> I<00:05:32.599> don't<00:05:32.750> think<00:05:32.900> it'll<00:05:33.050> go<00:05:33.139> that

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:33.349 
overpowered I don't think it'll go that

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.730 
overpowered I don't think it'll go that
far<00:05:33.620> but<00:05:34.189> it<00:05:34.729> might<00:05:35.330> be<00:05:35.599> the<00:05:35.779> thing<00:05:36.020> that<00:05:36.319> not

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
far but it might be the thing that not

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.499 
far but it might be the thing that not
only<00:05:36.919> just<00:05:37.159> makes<00:05:37.370> them<00:05:37.550> fun<00:05:37.759> to<00:05:37.969> use<00:05:38.180> makes

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:38.509 
only just makes them fun to use makes

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:40.719 
only just makes them fun to use makes
them<00:05:38.659> very<00:05:38.839> distinctive<00:05:39.439> but<00:05:39.919> also<00:05:40.099> elevates

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
them very distinctive but also elevates

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:42.519 
them very distinctive but also elevates
their<00:05:40.939> power<00:05:41.150> so<00:05:41.599> that<00:05:41.750> people<00:05:42.110> will<00:05:42.259> finally

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:42.529 
their power so that people will finally

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:44.559 
their power so that people will finally
start<00:05:43.009> to<00:05:43.129> use<00:05:43.310> a<00:05:43.490> few<00:05:43.969> more<00:05:44.149> of<00:05:44.240> these<00:05:44.330> things

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:44.569 
start to use a few more of these things

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:46.749 
start to use a few more of these things
on<00:05:44.719> the<00:05:44.899> battlefield<00:05:45.500> but<00:05:46.339> I'd<00:05:46.430> like<00:05:46.520> to<00:05:46.580> know

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
on the battlefield but I'd like to know

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.760 
on the battlefield but I'd like to know
what<00:05:47.029> you<00:05:47.210> guys<00:05:47.389> think<00:05:47.629> about<00:05:47.779> this<00:05:48.139> do<00:05:48.589> you

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
what you guys think about this do you

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.079 
what you guys think about this do you
agree<00:05:49.009> with<00:05:49.219> me<00:05:49.399> do<00:05:49.550> you<00:05:49.669> think<00:05:49.699> that<00:05:49.909> that

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:50.089 
agree with me do you think that that

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:52.420 
agree with me do you think that that
would<00:05:50.180> add<00:05:50.360> in<00:05:50.629> some<00:05:51.020> fun<00:05:51.349> unique<00:05:51.770> play<00:05:52.039> styles

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
would add in some fun unique play styles

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.800 
would add in some fun unique play styles
that<00:05:52.520> we<00:05:52.639> don't<00:05:52.819> really<00:05:53.000> have<00:05:53.240> right<00:05:53.509> now<00:05:53.539> and

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
that we don't really have right now and

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.570 
that we don't really have right now and
battle<00:05:54.020> before<00:05:54.139> or<00:05:54.680> do<00:05:54.979> you<00:05:55.069> think<00:05:55.099> I'm<00:05:55.399> just

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
battle before or do you think I'm just

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.369 
battle before or do you think I'm just
crazy<00:05:55.759> you<00:05:56.089> think<00:05:56.149> that's<00:05:56.389> the<00:05:56.509> worst<00:05:56.750> idea

00:05:57.369 --> 00:05:57.379 
crazy you think that's the worst idea

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:59.139 
crazy you think that's the worst idea
ever<00:05:57.439> and<00:05:57.770> you<00:05:58.039> would<00:05:58.159> hate<00:05:58.370> if<00:05:58.490> dice<00:05:58.729> added

00:05:59.139 --> 00:05:59.149 
ever and you would hate if dice added

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:00.850 
ever and you would hate if dice added
any<00:05:59.330> more<00:05:59.539> development<00:06:00.020> time<00:06:00.169> trying<00:06:00.800> to

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860
