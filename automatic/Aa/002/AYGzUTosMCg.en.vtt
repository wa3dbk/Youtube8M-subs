a little early from the top and I can go

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.810 
a little early from the top and I can go
ahead<00:00:37.510> and<00:00:37.660> top<00:00:38.530> one<00:00:38.770> like<00:00:39.010> you<00:00:39.190> all<00:00:39.219> day<00:00:39.550> long

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
so that's not that hard to do so how do

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.260 
so that's not that hard to do so how do
we<00:00:42.850> fix<00:00:43.180> it<00:00:43.390> though<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:45.040> fix<00:00:45.310> it<00:00:45.490> by<00:00:45.670> doing<00:00:45.730> this

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
we fix it though we fix it by doing this

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.630 
we fix it though we fix it by doing this
we<00:00:47.050> fix<00:00:47.350> it<00:00:47.530> by<00:00:47.680> trying<00:00:48.010> to<00:00:48.100> feel<00:00:48.370> the

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
we fix it by trying to feel the

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.780 
we fix it by trying to feel the
downswing<00:00:49.600> is<00:00:50.020> a<00:00:50.829> little<00:00:51.220> bit<00:00:51.340> more<00:00:51.610> of<00:00:51.700> this

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
downswing is a little bit more of this

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.420 
downswing is a little bit more of this
angle<00:00:52.270> held<00:00:52.540> and<00:00:52.870> not<00:00:53.320> trying<00:00:53.740> to<00:00:53.860> release<00:00:54.220> the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
angle held and not trying to release the

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.850 
angle held and not trying to release the
club<00:00:54.670> head<00:00:54.820> so<00:00:55.060> quickly<00:00:55.480> into<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:55.780> ball<00:00:55.989> so

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
club head so quickly into the ball so

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.990 
club head so quickly into the ball so
why<00:00:57.040> do<00:00:57.100> we<00:00:57.220> do<00:00:57.400> that<00:00:57.430> with<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.730> driver

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
why do we do that with the driver

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.030 
why do we do that with the driver
because<00:00:58.420> we're<00:00:58.630> trying<00:00:58.870> to<00:00:58.989> put<00:00:59.170> club<00:00:59.500> face<00:00:59.739> on

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
because we're trying to put club face on

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.160 
because we're trying to put club face on
ball<00:01:00.370> real<00:01:00.640> quick<00:01:01.030> so<00:01:01.270> the<00:01:01.360> first<00:01:01.600> move<00:01:01.870> down

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
ball real quick so the first move down

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.380 
ball real quick so the first move down
is<00:01:02.410> to<00:01:02.440> throw<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.070> club<00:01:03.370> that's<00:01:03.880> a<00:01:04.000> common

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:26.319 
in the first part of that downswing

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.830 
in the first part of that downswing
maintain<00:01:27.249> that<00:01:27.520> angle<00:01:27.969> and<00:01:28.119> it's<00:01:28.630> going<00:01:28.780> to

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
maintain that angle and it's going to

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.449 
maintain that angle and it's going to
release<00:01:29.139> as<00:01:29.409> you<00:01:29.499> turn<00:01:29.709> the<00:01:29.740> corner<00:01:30.189> going

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
downswing feel like you maintain this

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.080 
downswing feel like you maintain this
angle<00:01:46.539> between<00:01:46.659> your<00:01:46.959> left<00:01:47.139> arm<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:47.499> shaft
