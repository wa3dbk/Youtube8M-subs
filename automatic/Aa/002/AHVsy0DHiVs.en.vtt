00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
right down immediately or if you don't

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.380 
right down immediately or if you don't
have<00:00:32.070> one<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.279> hand<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:32.730> most<00:00:33.000> people<00:00:33.239> don't

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
have one on hand like most people don't

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.620 
have one on hand like most people don't
you<00:00:33.690> can<00:00:33.840> simply<00:00:34.170> toss<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.860> stove

bismuth<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.780> an<00:00:36.960> amazing<00:00:37.559> metal<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.280> we<00:00:38.399> can

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
bismuth is an amazing metal that we can

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.580 
bismuth is an amazing metal that we can
melt<00:00:38.730> down<00:00:38.940> very<00:00:39.239> easily<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:40.170> like<00:00:40.230> gallium

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
melt down very easily just like gallium

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.959 
melt down very easily just like gallium
as<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.010> might<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.280> seen<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.460> few<00:00:41.670> weeks<00:00:41.850> ago

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
as you might have seen a few weeks ago

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.209 
as you might have seen a few weeks ago
however<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:43.260> does<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> higher<00:00:44.010> melting

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
however this does have a higher melting

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.400 
however this does have a higher melting
point<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.149> we<00:00:45.300> can<00:00:45.450> get<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.809> lot<00:00:46.050> cheaper

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
point but we can get it a lot cheaper

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.979 
point but we can get it a lot cheaper
than<00:00:46.770> we<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.280> gallium<00:00:47.789> now<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.570> melting

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
than we can gallium now the melting

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.619 
than we can gallium now the melting
point<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.289> bismuth<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.820> 271<00:00:50.820> point<00:00:51.090> 3<00:00:51.329> degrees

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
point of bismuth is 271 point 3 degrees

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.069 
point of bismuth is 271 point 3 degrees
Celsius<00:00:51.660> or<00:00:52.640> 523<00:00:53.640> point<00:00:54.000> three<00:00:54.510> four<00:00:54.780> degrees

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
Celsius or 523 point three four degrees

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.560 
Celsius or 523 point three four degrees
Fahrenheit<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.520> stovetop<00:00:56.940> should<00:00:57.420> work

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
Fahrenheit so a stovetop should work

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.020 
Fahrenheit so a stovetop should work
just<00:00:57.600> fine<00:00:58.289> once<00:00:58.859> you've<00:00:59.010> melted<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.489> down<00:00:59.699> on

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
just fine once you've melted it down on

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.420 
just fine once you've melted it down on
your<00:01:00.390> stovetop<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.530> pour<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.039> out<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.370> do

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
your stovetop you can pour it out and do

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.640 
your stovetop you can pour it out and do
a<00:01:02.460> mold<00:01:02.760> or<00:01:03.059> into<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> bowl<00:01:03.570> whatever<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.470> want

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
a mold or into a bowl whatever you want

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.320 
a mold or into a bowl whatever you want
to<00:01:04.710> do<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.280> know<00:01:05.369> test<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.790> out<00:01:05.909> see<00:01:06.180> how<00:01:06.299> it

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
to do you know test it out see how it

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.850 
to do you know test it out see how it
works<00:01:07.460> after<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:09.240> let<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.689> cool<00:01:09.990> down<00:01:10.049> quite<00:01:10.830> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
works after I let this cool down quite a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.120 
works after I let this cool down quite a
bit

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
bit

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.550 
bit
you'll<00:01:11.640> take<00:01:11.880> probably<00:01:12.630> about<00:01:12.780> 10<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.200> 15

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
you'll take probably about 10 to 15

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.620 
you'll take probably about 10 to 15
minutes<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.549> can<00:01:14.729> peel<00:01:14.970> off<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.299> remainder

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
minutes you can peel off the remainder

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.370 
minutes you can peel off the remainder
from<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> pan<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.530> comes<00:01:16.770> off<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.159> tinfoil

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
from the pan and comes off like tinfoil

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.870 
from the pan and comes off like tinfoil
save<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.530> for<00:01:19.770> later<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.340> can<00:01:20.490> melt<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.820> down

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
save this for later you can melt it down

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.539 
save this for later you can melt it down
again<00:01:21.330> now<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:22.320> main<00:01:22.560> reason<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.040> want<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.340> show

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
again now the main reason I want to show

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.100 
again now the main reason I want to show
everyone<00:01:23.759> bismuth<00:01:24.299> was<00:01:24.600> because<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.049> its

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
everyone bismuth was because of its

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.469 
everyone bismuth was because of its
ability<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.619> create<00:01:25.830> hopper<00:01:26.490> crystals<00:01:26.939> these

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
ability to create hopper crystals these

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.480 
ability to create hopper crystals these
are<00:01:27.630> basically<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.140> crystal<00:01:28.500> with<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> outer

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
are basically a crystal with the outer

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.149 
are basically a crystal with the outer
edges<00:01:29.759> formed<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.720> not<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.140> inside<00:01:31.590> areas

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
edges formed but not the inside areas

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.160 
edges formed but not the inside areas
think<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.939> like<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.090> small<00:01:33.450> crystal<00:01:33.960> wall

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
think of it like a small crystal wall

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.109 
think of it like a small crystal wall
now<00:01:34.530> when<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.770> comes<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.040> bismuth<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:35.729> quite

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
now when it comes to bismuth it's quite

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.999 
now when it comes to bismuth it's quite
hard<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.509> pull<00:01:36.810> off<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.200> effect<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.890> it's

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
hard to pull off this effect and it's

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.460 
hard to pull off this effect and it's
going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> take<00:01:38.400> time<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.030> practice<00:01:39.689> always

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
going to take time and practice always

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.200 
going to take time and practice always
wear<00:01:40.650> gloves<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.369> very<00:01:41.670> reason<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.150> see

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
wear gloves for this very reason you see

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
about 10 to 15 minutes of cooling I went

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.420 
about 10 to 15 minutes of cooling I went
ahead<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.230> broke<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.590> out<00:02:55.710> of<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.890> mold<00:02:56.100> and

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
ahead and broke it out of the mold and

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.700 
ahead and broke it out of the mold and
you<00:02:56.820> can<00:02:56.970> see<00:02:57.150> here<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.510> we<00:02:57.630> did<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.110> fact<00:02:58.470> get

not be the best so let's swap it up a
little<00:03:03.330> bit<00:03:03.570> here<00:03:05.540> do<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.600> see<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.930> square

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320
