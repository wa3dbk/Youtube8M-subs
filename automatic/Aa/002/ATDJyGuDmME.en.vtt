00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.960 
videos and right now we're actually
running<00:03:47.790> in<00:03:48.240> unity<00:03:49.230> 5<00:03:49.500> now<00:03:50.459> that's<00:03:50.730> what<00:03:50.940> I

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
running in unity 5 now that's what I

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.490 
running in unity 5 now that's what I
wanted<00:03:51.240> to<00:03:51.390> talk<00:03:51.570> to<00:03:51.720> you<00:03:51.840> all<00:03:51.900> about<00:03:52.020> today

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
wanted to talk to you all about today

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.070 
wanted to talk to you all about today
we've<00:03:53.459> done<00:03:53.640> a<00:03:53.670> lot<00:03:53.910> of<00:03:53.940> internal<00:03:54.510> testing<00:03:54.900> and

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
we've done a lot of internal testing and

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.770 
we've done a lot of internal testing and
that<00:03:55.200> is<00:03:55.380> one<00:03:55.590> of<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.770> reasons<00:03:56.190> for<00:03:56.600> for<00:03:57.600> some

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
that is one of the reasons for for some

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.840 
that is one of the reasons for for some
delays<00:03:58.110> because<00:03:58.680> obviously<00:03:59.340> all<00:03:59.550> the<00:03:59.640> time

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
delays because obviously all the time

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.580 
delays because obviously all the time
we're<00:04:00.060> testing<00:04:00.480> things<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:01.230> know<00:04:01.320> we're<00:04:01.500> not

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
we're testing things you know we're not

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.070 
we're testing things you know we're not
adding<00:04:01.920> new<00:04:01.950> features<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:02.940> there's<00:04:03.930> not

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
adding new features and there's not

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.480 
adding new features and there's not
really<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.350> lot<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.650> show<00:04:04.860> you<00:04:04.920> so<00:04:05.250> it's<00:04:05.370> not

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
really a lot to show you so it's not

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.760 
really a lot to show you so it's not
really<00:04:05.790> worth<00:04:06.000> stop<00:04:06.750> wasting<00:04:07.170> your<00:04:07.200> time<00:04:07.320> with

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
really worth stop wasting your time with

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.970 
really worth stop wasting your time with
with<00:04:08.580> things<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:08.910> you<00:04:09.000> don't<00:04:09.150> want<00:04:09.420> to<00:04:09.450> see

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
with things that you don't want to see

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.979 
with things that you don't want to see
as<00:04:10.980> right<00:04:11.400> now<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:11.640> the<00:04:11.989> multiplayer

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
as right now the the multiplayer

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.590 
as right now the the multiplayer
framework<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.739> actually<00:04:14.100> in<00:04:14.310> place<00:04:14.640> unless

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
framework is actually in place unless

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.340 
framework is actually in place unless
you<00:04:15.720> just<00:04:15.900> seem<00:04:16.109> just<00:04:16.470> connected<00:04:16.919> to<00:04:17.040> a<00:04:17.070> game

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
you just seem just connected to a game

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.280 
you just seem just connected to a game
the<00:04:19.350> databases<00:04:20.130> are<00:04:20.160> in<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:21.660> backbone<00:04:22.049> of<00:04:22.109> the

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
the databases are in the backbone of the

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.870 
the databases are in the backbone of the
game<00:04:22.440> is<00:04:22.590> in<00:04:22.740> so<00:04:22.979> really<00:04:23.310> now<00:04:23.490> we're<00:04:23.729> going<00:04:23.820> to

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
game is in so really now we're going to

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.200 
game is in so really now we're going to
start<00:04:24.120> focusing<00:04:24.479> on<00:04:24.960> re-implementing

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
start focusing on re-implementing

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.059 
start focusing on re-implementing
all<00:04:26.600> of<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:26.870> features<00:04:27.229> that<00:04:27.259> you<00:04:27.500> all<00:04:27.710> saw

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:28.069 
all of the features that you all saw

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:30.640 
all of the features that you all saw
know<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:28.580> love<00:04:28.759> and<00:04:29.050> really<00:04:30.050> work<00:04:30.289> with<00:04:30.319> the

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
know and love and really work with the

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.439 
know and love and really work with the
community<00:04:31.130> to<00:04:31.160> make<00:04:31.460> sure<00:04:31.669> that<00:04:31.880> we<00:04:32.030> add<00:04:32.270> as

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
community to make sure that we add as

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.689 
community to make sure that we add as
much<00:04:32.630> of<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:32.990> stuff<00:04:33.259> that<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.220> community

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
much of the stuff that the community

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.850 
much of the stuff that the community
wants<00:04:34.970> as<00:04:35.090> possible<00:04:35.630> so<00:04:36.560> we're<00:04:36.710> really

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
wants as possible so we're really

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.860 
wants as possible so we're really
looking<00:04:37.039> forward<00:04:37.430> to<00:04:37.550> development<00:04:38.360> from<00:04:38.720> this

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
looking forward to development from this

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.279 
looking forward to development from this
point<00:04:39.110> forward<00:04:40.599> obviously<00:04:41.599> things<00:04:42.020> are<00:04:42.139> going

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
point forward obviously things are going

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:43.659 
point forward obviously things are going
to<00:04:42.349> change<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:42.710> lot<00:04:42.860> they<00:04:43.130> should<00:04:43.340> look<00:04:43.460> much

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
to change a lot they should look much

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.990 
to change a lot they should look much
better<00:04:43.880> than<00:04:44.210> they<00:04:44.360> do<00:04:44.419> now<00:04:44.780> even<00:04:45.699> but<00:04:46.699> unit

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
better than they do now even but unit

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.420 
better than they do now even but unit
five<00:04:47.240> sort<00:04:47.690> of<00:04:47.840> looking<00:04:48.650> really<00:04:48.949> positive

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
five sort of looking really positive

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.450 
five sort of looking really positive
it's<00:04:50.300> a<00:04:50.330> big<00:04:50.509> change<00:04:50.750> for<00:04:50.930> us<00:04:51.229> but<00:04:52.130> we're<00:04:52.340> glad

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
it's a big change for us but we're glad

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.779 
it's a big change for us but we're glad
we're<00:04:52.759> making<00:04:53.060> it<00:04:53.740> obviously<00:04:54.740> this<00:04:54.919> does<00:04:55.370> mean

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
we're making it obviously this does mean

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.610 
we're making it obviously this does mean
there's<00:04:55.970> going<00:04:56.060> to<00:04:56.120> be<00:04:56.210> some<00:04:56.509> delays<00:04:56.810> but

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
there's going to be some delays but

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.659 
there's going to be some delays but
we're<00:04:57.800> confident<00:04:58.310> that<00:04:58.400> we<00:04:58.610> can<00:04:58.759> still<00:04:59.030> get<00:04:59.270> a

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
we're confident that we can still get a

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.850 
we're confident that we can still get a
distress<00:05:01.669> intensity<00:05:02.240> here<00:05:02.360> in<00:05:02.449> February<00:05:02.860> we

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
distress intensity here in February we

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.400 
distress intensity here in February we
did<00:05:04.009> want<00:05:04.220> it<00:05:04.310> to<00:05:04.460> be<00:05:04.580> alpha<00:05:05.090> but<00:05:05.509> I<00:05:05.750> we<00:05:06.289> don't

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
did want it to be alpha but I we don't

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.320 
did want it to be alpha but I we don't
think<00:05:06.620> it's<00:05:06.800> going<00:05:06.830> to<00:05:06.979> happen<00:05:07.190> now<00:05:07.580> because

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
think it's going to happen now because

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.360 
think it's going to happen now because
of<00:05:08.599> the<00:05:08.720> delays<00:05:09.020> with<00:05:09.289> the<00:05:09.320> new<00:05:09.560> engine<00:05:12.370> that

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
of the delays with the new engine that

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.279 
of the delays with the new engine that
being<00:05:13.610> said<00:05:13.849> if<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.300> distress<00:05:14.870> tests<00:05:15.199> are

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
being said if the distress tests are

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:16.960 
being said if the distress tests are
good<00:05:15.410> enough<00:05:15.650> then<00:05:15.949> we'll<00:05:16.130> leave<00:05:16.400> them<00:05:16.610> up<00:05:16.759> for

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
good enough then we'll leave them up for

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.850 
good enough then we'll leave them up for
you<00:05:17.060> all<00:05:17.180> to<00:05:17.300> play<00:05:17.509> if<00:05:17.870> they're<00:05:18.440> not<00:05:18.590> will

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
you all to play if they're not will

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.560 
you all to play if they're not will
maybe<00:05:19.039> have<00:05:19.310> them<00:05:19.460> on<00:05:19.610> for<00:05:19.909> a<00:05:19.940> week

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
maybe have them on for a week

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.499 
maybe have them on for a week
take<00:05:20.930> them<00:05:21.110> down<00:05:21.820> while<00:05:22.820> we<00:05:22.940> work<00:05:23.120> on<00:05:23.360> whatever

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:23.509 
take them down while we work on whatever

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:25.270 
take them down while we work on whatever
the<00:05:23.750> problems<00:05:24.110> are<00:05:24.289> but<00:05:24.530> really<00:05:24.800> sort<00:05:25.009> of<00:05:25.099> we

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
the problems are but really sort of we

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.339 
the problems are but really sort of we
want<00:05:25.460> to<00:05:25.490> work<00:05:25.669> with<00:05:25.909> the<00:05:26.000> community<00:05:26.539> and<00:05:26.990> make

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
can see their shadows are looking much

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.600

00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:13.379 
implemented and this is just generally a

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:17.689 
implemented and this is just generally a
much<00:07:14.750> better<00:07:15.750> improvement<00:07:16.439> of<00:07:16.560> the<00:07:16.740> of<00:07:17.009> the

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:17.699 
much better improvement of the of the

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:20.839 
much better improvement of the of the
old<00:07:17.849> system<00:07:18.740> so<00:07:19.740> I'll<00:07:19.860> go<00:07:19.979> ahead<00:07:20.009> and<00:07:20.340> close<00:07:20.550> I

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:20.849 
old system so I'll go ahead and close I

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:22.719 
old system so I'll go ahead and close I
think<00:07:21.180> that<00:07:21.270> pretty<00:07:21.419> much<00:07:21.539> covers<00:07:21.659> everything
