00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
differences in relationships and if we

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.839 
differences in relationships and if we

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
think it's a big significant factor or

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.490 
think it's a big significant factor or
not<00:00:27.060> um<00:00:28.220> from<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.340> legal<00:00:29.609> point<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.240> view

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
not um from a legal point of view

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:38.440 
not um from a legal point of view
obviously<00:00:31.700> yeah<00:00:32.840> personally<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:34.110> think<00:00:36.380> that

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
obviously yeah personally I think that

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.410 
obviously yeah personally I think that
just<00:00:39.450> as<00:00:39.800> love<00:00:40.800> doesn't<00:00:41.250> depend<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.700> gender<00:00:42.210> I

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
just as love doesn't depend on gender I

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.299 
just as love doesn't depend on gender I
don't<00:00:42.930> think<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.290> really<00:00:43.320> depends<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.100> it

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
don't think it really depends on it

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.799 
don't think it really depends on it
either<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.910> think<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:46.230> just<00:00:46.379> weird<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:47.250> us<00:00:47.809> as

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
either I think it's just weird for us as

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.569 
either I think it's just weird for us as
a<00:00:48.870> society<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.739> see<00:00:51.020> to<00:00:52.020> understand<00:00:53.010> that

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
a society to see to understand that

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.580 
a society to see to understand that
there<00:00:53.879> might<00:00:54.059> be<00:00:54.120> love<00:00:54.510> between<00:00:54.930> people<00:00:55.050> of

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
there might be love between people of

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.660 
there might be love between people of
drastically<00:00:56.399> different<00:00:56.820> ages<00:00:57.410> but

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
drastically different ages but

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.250 
drastically different ages but
everybody's<00:00:59.670> different<00:00:59.940> everybody<00:01:00.780> matures

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
everybody's different everybody matures

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.429 
everybody's different everybody matures
differently<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.789> there<00:01:03.359> might<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.780> 16<00:01:04.320> year

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
differently so there might be a 16 year

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.530 
differently so there might be a 16 year
old<00:01:04.559> who's<00:01:04.799> more<00:01:05.189> mature<00:01:05.489> than<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.729> 22<00:01:06.210> year<00:01:06.390> old

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
old who's more mature than a 22 year old

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.750 
old who's more mature than a 22 year old
and<00:01:06.810> if<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.710> relate<00:01:07.950> with<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.220> person

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and if you can relate with that person

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.080 
and if you can relate with that person
then<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.210> don't<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:10.229> why<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.369> possibility<00:01:12.060> of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
then I don't see why the possibility of

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.149 
then I don't see why the possibility of
love<00:01:12.920> doesn't<00:01:13.920> exist<00:01:14.090> um<00:01:15.439> yeah<00:01:16.439> would<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.830> kind

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
love doesn't exist um yeah would be kind

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.429 
love doesn't exist um yeah would be kind
of<00:01:17.280> weird<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.880> see<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> 30<00:01:18.479> year<00:01:18.720> old<00:01:18.869> dating<00:01:19.320> a

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
of weird to see a 30 year old dating a

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.230 
of weird to see a 30 year old dating a
19<00:01:20.430> year<00:01:20.970> old<00:01:21.119> but<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.229> funny<00:01:22.710> because<00:01:23.009> it's

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
19 year old but it's funny because it's

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.530 
19 year old but it's funny because it's
only<00:01:24.240> really<00:01:24.360> matters<00:01:25.110> when<00:01:25.409> were<00:01:26.070> younger

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
only really matters when were younger

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.569 
only really matters when were younger
because<00:01:27.540> once<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:27.900> get<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.500> 40<00:01:28.950> 50<00:01:29.520> or

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
whatever people could be like 5 10 15

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.950 
whatever people could be like 5 10 15
years<00:01:32.369> apart<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.000> no<00:01:33.270> one<00:01:33.420> even<00:01:33.540> really

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
years apart and no one even really

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.749 
years apart and no one even really
thinks<00:01:34.229> twice<00:01:34.320> about<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.040> then<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.729> think

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
thinks twice about it and then you think

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.840 
thinks twice about it and then you think
about<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.479> that's<00:01:36.810> weird<00:01:37.070> when<00:01:38.070> she

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
about it it's like that's weird when she

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.969 
about it it's like that's weird when she

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
that I don't know I don't really think

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.310 
that I don't know I don't really think
it's<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.070> huge<00:01:44.250> factor<00:01:44.610> personally<00:01:45.570> that

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
it's a huge factor personally that

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.710 
it's a huge factor personally that
doesn't<00:01:46.619> mean<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.920> would<00:01:47.250> readily<00:01:48.119> you

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
doesn't mean that I would readily you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.840 
doesn't mean that I would readily you

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
know be interested in someone that's 10

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.730 
know be interested in someone that's 10
years<00:01:51.030> younger<00:01:51.210> than<00:01:51.479> me<00:01:51.689> or<00:01:51.869> even<00:01:52.439> 10<00:01:52.619> years

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
years younger than me or even 10 years

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.770 
years younger than me or even 10 years
older<00:01:53.100> than<00:01:53.250> me<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:53.630> depends<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
older than me but depends on the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.590 
older than me but depends on the
circumstances<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.770> really<00:01:56.310> age<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.270> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
circumstances and really age is just a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.190 
circumstances and really age is just a
number<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:58.729> really<00:01:59.729> believe<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.840> doesn't

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
number I really believe that it doesn't

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.749 
number I really believe that it doesn't
say<00:02:01.350> much<00:02:01.500> about<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.950> except<00:02:02.310> for<00:02:02.490> how<00:02:02.579> long

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
say much about you except for how long

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.630 
say much about you except for how long
you've<00:02:03.000> lived<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.950> amount<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.280> years

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
you've lived and the amount of years

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.920 
you've lived and the amount of years
that<00:02:05.909> you've<00:02:06.060> been<00:02:06.090> living<00:02:06.299> doesn't

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
that you've been living doesn't

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.609 
that you've been living doesn't
necessarily<00:02:07.819> make<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.959> wiser<00:02:09.959> or<00:02:10.229> more

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
necessarily make you wiser or more

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.580 
necessarily make you wiser or more
mature<00:02:10.920> than<00:02:10.950> someone<00:02:11.459> else<00:02:11.660> so<00:02:12.660> personally<00:02:13.410> I

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
mature than someone else so personally I

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.710 
mature than someone else so personally I
think<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.040> age<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.519> a<00:02:14.550> really<00:02:14.940> big<00:02:15.209> factor
