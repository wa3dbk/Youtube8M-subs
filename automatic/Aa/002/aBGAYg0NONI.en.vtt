00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
ones that start to come out of ammo so I

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.270

switched<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:46.970> my<00:02:47.060> rifle<00:02:51.040> what<00:02:52.040> do<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:52.190> guys

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
switched to my rifle what do you guys

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.070 
switched to my rifle what do you guys
think<00:02:52.340> of<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.640> ballistics<00:02:53.360> in<00:02:53.480> this<00:02:53.630> game<00:02:53.840> I

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
think of the ballistics in this game I

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.260 
think of the ballistics in this game I
think<00:02:54.710> they're<00:02:54.980> pretty<00:02:55.100> nice<00:02:55.310> when<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.120> kill

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
think they're pretty nice when you kill

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.880 
think they're pretty nice when you kill
someone<00:02:56.510> like<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:57.050> shoot<00:02:57.230> their<00:02:57.380> legs<00:02:57.590> you'll

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.980 
someone like you shoot their legs you'll
be<00:02:58.520> down<00:02:58.670> in<00:02:58.880> their<00:02:59.000> knees<00:02:59.300> and<00:02:59.630> they<00:02:59.720> can't

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
be down in their knees and they can't

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.840 
be down in their knees and they can't
move<00:03:00.320> or<00:03:00.680> anything<00:03:00.950> I'm<00:03:01.220> gonna<00:03:01.340> try<00:03:01.550> and<00:03:01.670> crawl

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850
