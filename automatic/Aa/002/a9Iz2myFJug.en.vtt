00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.359
 what can we do to avoid that 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.370
 freezing of the pipes because in 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.819
 principle we can ask for a series of 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.819
 basic tips 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.710
 consists mainly one would be lining 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.480
 all the outer mesh pipe and what 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.310
 logical would be to cover it with a foam 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.099
 special in this case is called nozzle 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.050
 and good to air several thicknesses and with 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.820
 that would be pretty good enough 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.519
 solved the problem then 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.160
 subsequently we have let's say the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.830
 caution that if we have the floor 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.930
 empty we are on vacation then 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.910
 have the empty pipes of the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.900
 installation so that precisely we do not 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.460
 bust 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.650
 and then also but on the other hand 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.510
 we have to keep in mind that when 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.340
 we get the heating and we have 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.350
 facilities that come rush 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.330
 externally by housing or by 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.100
 terraces always first we have to 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.840
 have lined with the mouthpiece that 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.580
 mentioned above and 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.980
 later always try when 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.530
 it is very cold to have at least 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.449
 heating to a minimum or skipping two 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.860
 times a day to prevent them from freezing 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.500
 and then well there's also 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.880
 currently all the boilers 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.610
 modern come with a thermostat 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.829
 environment which we say what it does is 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.229
 that in case of obvious freezing 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.610
 when the temperature drops a lot what 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.710
 does is that the boiler automatically 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.280
 is high and prevents the plane 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.880
 antifreeze for example in 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.530
 Gas heating or solar panels 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.750
 Well, man, actually, if there is now 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.460
 same anti freeze products and 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.869
 but, well, I think that with a 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.759
 series of tips like the ones that I'm 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.580
 mentioning I think it would be enough 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.770
 having a climatology never 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.509
 You know when you can say burst of 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.920
 the installation also depends on the 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.750
 orientation factor from said 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.360
 installation 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.690
 it is also a matter of prevention the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.520
 made to expose it as such that series of 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.890
 compounds but something mainly me 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.750
 I do not advise them in principle because 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.700
 it can maybe damage the installation 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.590
 you have to know also what material 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.119
 the installation is done but I think 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.340
 that following with those tips would be 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.560
 would be enough and one thing I'm in 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.470
 a lost village of salamanca 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.650
 I do not have the gossip to see what can 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.080
 use sawdust what I run from fabrics 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.480
 corks that is the good principle if not 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.880
 you have the necessary scribe matter 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.640
 Well the cork would be fine 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.310
 let's say reinforce it with cork 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.040
 melamine can see the theme 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.080
 sawdust and others is a subject of one of a 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.300
 installation that is seen is going to be 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.170
 complicated mainly I think that 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.959
 with a cork would be 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.870
 a type of silicone that is becoming 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.930
 something that currently does not exist 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.980
 silicone as well comments this if what 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.480
 What can be done is to put a gutter 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.769
 the kind of those who put on air 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.110
 conditioning in the facilities 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.640
 views as a preventive measure say if 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.349
 we do not have the keel and we do not have 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.000
 the cork if we can put a gutter 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.879
 plastic exterior of any 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.680
 plastic in the market 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.680
 and this of fabrics and that does not help 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:12.200
 before the temperature drops one 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.200
 I think it would not be convenient
