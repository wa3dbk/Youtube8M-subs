00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
why is that so small man so all of the

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.300 
why is that so small man so all of the
big<00:00:03.480> garbage<00:00:03.750> cans<00:00:04.200> have<00:00:04.589> these<00:00:04.920> little

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
big garbage cans have these little

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.430 
big garbage cans have these little
handles<00:00:05.850> or<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.420> hinge<00:00:06.690> on<00:00:06.870> it<00:00:07.080> so<00:00:07.259> if<00:00:07.319> you

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
handles or the hinge on it so if you

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.140 
handles or the hinge on it so if you
pick<00:00:07.649> it<00:00:07.770> up<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.069> try<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.250> use<00:00:08.490> it<00:00:08.670> as<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> shield

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
pick it up and try to use it as a shield

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
ammunition with this but it's always

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.720 
ammunition with this but it's always
going<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.440> make<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> good<00:00:16.949> shield<00:00:17.190> like<00:00:17.460> maybe

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730
