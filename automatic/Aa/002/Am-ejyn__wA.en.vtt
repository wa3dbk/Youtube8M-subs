00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
I think we're all gonna have to regroup

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.370 
I think we're all gonna have to regroup
and<00:04:58.140> invest<00:04:58.530> this<00:04:58.710> or<00:04:59.520> search<00:05:00.510> this<00:05:00.780> criminal

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
and invest this or search this criminal

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.830 
and invest this or search this criminal

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
so we can investigate I think it's

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.290
