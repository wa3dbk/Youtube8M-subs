00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
and wrinkles and accentuated my pores

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.620 
and wrinkles and accentuated my pores
and<00:00:28.199> then<00:00:28.980> no<00:00:29.160> matter<00:00:29.340> how<00:00:29.460> little<00:00:29.880> bit<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.420> use

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and then no matter how little bit I use

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.749 
and then no matter how little bit I use
on<00:00:30.810> my<00:00:30.840> face<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.650> still<00:00:32.130> gives<00:00:32.369> me<00:00:32.489> this

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
on my face it still gives me this

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.090 
on my face it still gives me this
powdery<00:00:33.329> finish<00:00:33.600> which<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.320> don't<00:00:34.469> like

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
powdery finish which I don't like

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.090 
powdery finish which I don't like
and<00:00:35.489> maybe<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.600> could<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:36.840> been<00:00:37.050> better<00:00:37.440> if<00:00:37.860> I

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
and maybe it could have been better if I

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.680 
and maybe it could have been better if I
had<00:00:38.280> used<00:00:38.520> some<00:00:39.360> setting<00:00:40.230> spray<00:00:41.180> such<00:00:42.180> as<00:00:42.390> mac

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
on your skin and it doesn't have a lot

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.510 
on your skin and it doesn't have a lot
of<00:01:14.670> coverage<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:15.950> this<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.100> never<00:01:17.280> my

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
of coverage but this is never my

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.560 
of coverage but this is never my
objective<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.530> always<00:01:19.530> let<00:01:19.740> my<00:01:19.920> imperfections

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
objective I always let my imperfections

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.240 
objective I always let my imperfections
show<00:01:21.570> through<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.680> are<00:01:22.770> looking<00:01:23.070> for

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
show through but if you are looking for

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.520 
show through but if you are looking for
a<00:01:23.280> heavier<00:01:23.640> coverage<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.420> think<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.350> could

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
a heavier coverage I think you could

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.380 
a heavier coverage I think you could
build<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.860> up<00:01:26.150> so<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.540> wear<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.979> number<00:01:29.430> b20

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
build it up so I wear it in number b20

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.230 
build it up so I wear it in number b20
which<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.869> second<00:01:31.259> widest<00:01:31.680> shade<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:33.150> I'm

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
which is the second widest shade and I'm

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.620 
which is the second widest shade and I'm
considering<00:01:33.750> buying<00:01:34.020> v30<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.130> summer<00:01:35.630> so

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
considering buying v30 for the summer so

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.580 
considering buying v30 for the summer so
the<00:01:37.140> product<00:01:37.530> comes<00:01:37.799> with<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.579> kabuki<00:01:38.970> brush

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
the product comes with this kabuki brush

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.580 
the product comes with this kabuki brush
so<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.220> box<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.939> box<00:01:42.150> contains<00:01:42.720> 10

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
so this this box this box contains 10

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.480 
so this this box this box contains 10
grams<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.070> product<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:45.259> it<00:01:46.259> costs<00:01:46.710> 70<00:01:47.130> euros

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
grams of product and it costs 70 euros

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.010 
grams of product and it costs 70 euros
and<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.820> think<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.180> because<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.780> brush

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
and I think it's because of the brush

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.600 
and I think it's because of the brush
because<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.500> brush<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:50.040> really<00:01:50.340> good

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
because the brush is of really good

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.730 
because the brush is of really good
quality<00:01:50.880> but<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.630> don't<00:01:51.899> use<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.259> because<00:01:52.409> it's

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
quality but I don't use it because it's

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.429 
quality but I don't use it because it's
a<00:01:52.829> little<00:01:53.100> bit<00:01:53.250> too<00:01:53.460> dense<00:01:53.670> for<00:01:53.850> me<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:55.079> I

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
a little bit too dense for me so I

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.990 
a little bit too dense for me so I
normally<00:01:55.979> apply<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.280> with<00:01:56.549> my<00:01:56.759> Real

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
normally apply it with my Real

so<00:02:15.480> if<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.900> had<00:02:16.079> to<00:02:16.200> rate<00:02:16.409> this<00:02:16.680> product<00:02:17.040> and

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
so if I had to rate this product and

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.640 
so if I had to rate this product and
probably<00:02:17.849> give<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.239> four<00:02:18.599> stars<00:02:18.629> out<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.260> five

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
probably give it four stars out of five

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.039 
probably give it four stars out of five
because<00:02:20.099> of<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.760> price<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.329> think<00:02:21.569> it's<00:02:21.959> a

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
because of the price I think it's a

little<00:02:22.200> bit<00:02:22.469> too<00:02:22.650> expensive<00:02:22.890> other<00:02:23.879> than<00:02:24.180> that

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
little bit too expensive other than that

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.929 
little bit too expensive other than that
