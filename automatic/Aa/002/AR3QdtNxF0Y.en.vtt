would say up to up I eat people if

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.750 
would say up to up I eat people if
you're<00:00:27.779> more<00:00:28.050> than<00:00:28.199> 8<00:00:28.410> people<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.859> feed<00:00:29.369> you

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
you're more than 8 people to feed you

you're more than 8 people to feed you
might<00:00:29.939> want<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.420> larger<00:00:31.019> machine<00:00:31.880> so<00:00:32.880> let's

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
might want a larger machine so let's

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.150 
might want a larger machine so let's
just<00:00:33.510> take<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.750> quick<00:00:34.020> look<00:00:34.260> at<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.860> various

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
just take a quick look at the various

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.540 
just take a quick look at the various
components<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:36.120> first<00:00:36.510> part<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.620> steam

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
components the first part is the steam

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.880 
components the first part is the steam
vent<00:00:38.760> which<00:00:39.510> comes<00:00:39.930> off<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.440> put<00:00:40.829> our

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
vent which comes off we just put our

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.010 
vent which comes off we just put our
fingers<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> back<00:00:41.430> here<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.559> lift<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.710> up

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
fingers in the back here and lift it up

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.600 
fingers in the back here and lift it up
now<00:00:46.020> most<00:00:46.230> rice<00:00:46.440> cookers<00:00:46.770> these<00:00:46.920> days<00:00:47.129> do<00:00:47.370> have

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
now most rice cookers these days do have

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.119 
now most rice cookers these days do have
a<00:00:47.910> removable<00:00:48.059> steam<00:00:48.660> vent<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.649> one<00:00:49.890> is

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
a removable steam vent but this one is

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.580 
a removable steam vent but this one is
slightly<00:00:50.969> different<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.140> compute

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
slightly different in that is compute

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.880 
slightly different in that is compute
comprised<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.579> two<00:00:54.050> different<00:00:55.050> parts<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
comprised of two different parts so to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.360 
comprised of two different parts so to
open<00:00:56.070> up<00:00:56.309> just<00:00:57.120> push<00:00:57.300> down<00:00:57.329> here<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.250> it<00:00:59.250> comes

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
open up just push down here and it comes

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.630 
open up just push down here and it comes
apart<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.989> when<00:01:01.170> you're<00:01:01.289> washing<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.800> up<00:01:01.980> after

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
apart so when you're washing it up after

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.929 
apart so when you're washing it up after
use<00:01:02.820> you'd<00:01:03.210> probably<00:01:03.420> want<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.780> wash<00:01:03.989> up<00:01:04.939> both

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
use you'd probably want to wash up both

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.840 
use you'd probably want to wash up both
sections<00:01:06.900> individually<00:01:07.670> putting<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.760> back

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
sections individually putting it back

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.149 
sections individually putting it back
together<00:01:09.000> pretty<00:01:09.390> straightforward<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.979> just

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
together pretty straightforward we just

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.760 
together pretty straightforward we just
have<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.400> align<00:01:11.640> these<00:01:11.909> two<00:01:11.970> sections<00:01:12.770> with

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
have to align these two sections with

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.539 
have to align these two sections with
the<00:01:13.920> top<00:01:14.100> part<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:15.170> then<00:01:16.170> close<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.430> it

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
the top part and then close it and it

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.840 
the top part and then close it and it
just<00:01:17.580> clips<00:01:17.939> back<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:20.189> putting<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.640> part

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
just clips back in so putting this part

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.520 
just clips back in so putting this part
back<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.090> again<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:22.110> simple<00:01:22.350> matter

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
back in again it's just a simple matter

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.359 
back in again it's just a simple matter
of<00:01:22.619> pushing<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:24.150> take<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.479> off<00:01:24.630> just

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
of pushing it on and we take it off just

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.649 
of pushing it on and we take it off just
by<00:01:26.369> pulling<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.820> off<00:01:29.240> then<00:01:30.240> when<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:30.479> take<00:01:30.630> a

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
by pulling it off then when we take a

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.230 
by pulling it off then when we take a
look<00:01:30.780> inside<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.320> don't<00:01:31.470> will<00:01:32.340> see<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.880> it's

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
look inside you don't will see that it's

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.030 
look inside you don't will see that it's
going<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.509> our<00:01:33.630> lid<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.650> most<00:01:34.829> rice

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
going in our lid and like most rice

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.679 
going in our lid and like most rice
cookers<00:01:35.400> these<00:01:35.549> days<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.909> inner<00:01:36.030> lid<00:01:36.240> comes

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
cookers these days the inner lid comes

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.020 
cookers these days the inner lid comes
off<00:01:36.990> we<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.310> lift<00:01:38.460> up<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.790> catch

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
off we just have to lift up this catch

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.789 
off we just have to lift up this catch
at<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.299> front<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.759> pops<00:01:42.000> out<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:43.560> here's

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
at the front and it pops out and here's

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.280 
at the front and it pops out and here's
another<00:01:44.100> difference<00:01:44.340> with<00:01:44.670> most<00:01:45.659> inner<00:01:46.049> lids

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
another difference with most inner lids

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.560 
another difference with most inner lids
because<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.100> pressure<00:01:47.369> rice<00:01:47.670> cooker<00:01:48.060> it

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
because it's a pressure rice cooker it

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.710 
because it's a pressure rice cooker it
has<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.869> ball<00:01:49.110> bearing<00:01:49.259> section<00:01:50.149> here<00:01:53.720> but

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
has this ball bearing section here but

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.289 
has this ball bearing section here but
it's<00:01:54.840> pretty<00:01:54.899> much<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.500> same<00:01:55.530> as<00:01:56.270> all<00:01:57.270> other

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
it's pretty much the same as all other

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.330 
it's pretty much the same as all other
rice<00:01:57.869> cookers<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.740> put<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.979> back<00:01:59.130> in

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
rice cookers in that to put it back in

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.310 
rice cookers in that to put it back in
we<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.240> have<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.509> align<00:02:00.719> these<00:02:01.049> two<00:02:01.110> sections

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
we just have to align these two sections

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.760 
we just have to align these two sections
and<00:02:03.850> then<00:02:04.850> push<00:02:06.340> pretty<00:02:07.340> straightforward

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
and then push pretty straightforward

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.550 
and then push pretty straightforward
other<00:02:09.770> things<00:02:10.070> that<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.369> race<00:02:10.490> becomes<00:02:10.940> with

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
other things that the race becomes with

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.770 
other things that the race becomes with
are<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.760> nonstick<00:02:14.390> rice<00:02:14.810> spatula<00:02:15.350> and<00:02:16.780> the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
are the nonstick rice spatula and the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.040 
are the nonstick rice spatula and the
measuring<00:02:18.770> cup<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.580> this<00:02:19.730> is<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:20.240> Japanese

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
measuring cup so this is a Japanese

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.980 
measuring cup so this is a Japanese
measuring<00:02:21.530> cup<00:02:21.740> it's<00:02:22.570> 180<00:02:23.570> milliliter

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
measuring cup it's 180 milliliter
