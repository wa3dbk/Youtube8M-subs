 very simple recipe of Greek origin and 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.559
 well this recipe surely had its 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.580
 beginnings in italy why because good 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.420

 Tomato meat and it's really delicious 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.020
 let's start with the meat here 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.450
 we have our lean meat that 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.730
 originally made with lamb and 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.660
 Do you know that Greek food is always 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:28.710
 uses lamb meat but let's 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:32.640
 tropicalize the recipe and go 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.119
 to put beef then oil of 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.460
 olive that can not miss and I put 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.830
 first the meat so it does not burn 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:48.030
 garlic and onion then let's 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.250
 put the meat in the pan will 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.180
 add a little salt to go 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.180
 seasoning 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.430
 and he knows that very important also when 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.920
 we put the meat like that in the heat 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.160
 directly without any condiments 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.570
 we can appreciate the freshness and 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.300
 quality of the meat 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.050
 if you start to appreciate an aroma 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.200
 different strange then the meat then 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.320
 it's not fresh it should smell good I see the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.720
 to smell you to know how cool it is 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.680
 the meat then now we are going to 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.050
 add the onion let's start 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.540

 so good is that is pretty good no 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.510
 there is a wave like in prepared tartar meat 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.290
 plasticulture with nothing 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:04.590

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.810
 clove powder you perceived the nail paris 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.010

 You do not know what flavors so delicious you can 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.920
 be a little strange to mix cinnamon and 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.770
 clove with meat but in greece good 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.100
 It's very common and it's a few flavors 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:57.190
 so I like to bring the house to 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.980
 the table every day with the flavors of 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.470
 world brought here in a very 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.570
 simple then let it cook and 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.040
 we will make our bÃ©chamel sauce 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.660
 surely you have seen how 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.690
 we do here in our day we are going to 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.880
 melt the same amount of butter 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.580
 that of flour but now we are going to 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.209
 infuse a little garlic to the 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.690
 butter a grated garlic clove 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.750
 a few seconds nothing more and as they were two 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.860
 spoonfuls of butter let's 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.200
 add two tablespoons of flour 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.320
 then here quickly 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.150
 we mix we remove the raw flavor to 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.450
 the flour we do not let it get 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:44.430
 too dark the truth and you 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:48.470
 add milk let's add milk 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.760
 and here we are going to put nutmeg 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.600
 then also the nutmeg raise 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:57.210
 a very rich flavor we will leave and 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.790
 wait until it thickens and when species 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.010
 good be a delicious bechamel sauce and 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.830
 how this good dish is made in the 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:09.610
 oven let's put it in 1 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:12.360
 refractory to furnace like this I'm going to 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.970
 put a little salad 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.820
 then let's mix our pasta 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.400
 with the stew with our meat this is 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:24.340
 previously known pen pasta 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.680
 originally it takes citi that are about 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.730
 cylinders but it's not easy to find 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:33.070
 The sit and the pen pasta is perfect 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.740
 let's add it to it and do not know how it smells 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.770
 lady the cinnamon and the nail do it for 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.350
 please be surprised when 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:45.400
 prepare for the whole family then 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:48.220
 we mix perfectly and we put it in 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:54.169
 a refractory like this is going to enter the 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:56.599
 oven if we distribute it very well 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:59.210
 And then imagine that these birds 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:01.669
 mel already thick then cover 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:06.370
 completely of the bechamel sauce and 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:10.099
 to finish we will put bread crushed 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:14.539
 completely ground bread all covered 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:18.590
 with Parmesan cheese then we put it 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:20.840
 Baked for approximately 25 minutes 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.539
