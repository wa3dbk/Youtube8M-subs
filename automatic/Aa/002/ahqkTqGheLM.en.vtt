ticket sales that they want but right

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.200 
ticket sales that they want but right
now<00:04:37.560> they<00:04:37.979> face<00:04:38.159> an<00:04:38.370> even<00:04:38.460> bigger<00:04:38.940> problem

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
now they face an even bigger problem

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.999 
now they face an even bigger problem
because<00:04:39.720> if<00:04:39.870> they<00:04:40.050> are<00:04:40.110> not<00:04:40.259> able<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.800> pay

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
because if they are not able to pay

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.580 
because if they are not able to pay
production<00:04:41.699> what<00:04:42.270> does<00:04:42.599> this<00:04:42.750> say<00:04:43.110> for<00:04:43.500> the

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
production what does this say for the

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.460 
production what does this say for the
wrestlers<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.729> are<00:04:44.970> on<00:04:45.210> that<00:04:45.690> roster<00:04:46.080> that

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
wrestlers that are on that roster that

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.309 
wrestlers that are on that roster that
means<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.889> wrestlers<00:04:47.340> are<00:04:47.520> probably<00:04:48.150> late<00:04:49.139> on

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:49.319 
means the wrestlers are probably late on

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:51.469 
means the wrestlers are probably late on
payments<00:04:49.590> as<00:04:49.860> well<00:04:49.889> like<00:04:50.220> I<00:04:50.340> said<00:04:50.400> this<00:04:51.210> is<00:04:51.270> a

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
payments as well like I said this is a

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.180 
payments as well like I said this is a
long-term<00:04:51.870> discussion<00:04:52.650> we<00:04:52.710> could<00:04:52.860> talk<00:04:52.979> about

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
long-term discussion we could talk about

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.010 
long-term discussion we could talk about
what<00:04:53.310> TNA<00:04:53.580> should<00:04:53.849> fix<00:04:54.090> and<00:04:54.330> what<00:04:54.720> they<00:04:54.840> have

worst of times they have faced and this
is<00:05:12.840> where<00:05:12.990> TNA<00:05:13.349> needs<00:05:13.560> to<00:05:13.710> really<00:05:14.090> refocus
