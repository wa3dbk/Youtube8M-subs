00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 the world is heading for the editorial 6 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.000
 I am rather calm and I am happy 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.280
 that has turned on again and again 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.160

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.559

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.670
 Stein is looking over 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:21.180
 There you saw such a little horse 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.279
 what's on the copper and yes I want you 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.430
 let's see what it was all about 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.019
 originally it was just a job of 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.670
 professor of me that too 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.619
 wrong because I do not really have any 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.770
 great idea of ​​these 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.770
 here at once you can with such a 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.360
 Horse on the back and is even 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.500
 devices on it works 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.090
 really and what you guys thank you now 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.030
 get rid of it I already have it 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:53.090
 and now you can do that 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:57.930
 here on the head there goes very well 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.250
 beautiful through the desert yes works 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.149
 does not take any harm even 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.949
 still jumping at it 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:08.549
 I'll show you again 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:11.670
 you see, he already has one 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:17.090
 funny names chrome it's not that 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:20.090
 best already runs logically conversion 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.090
 Beginning 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:49.189
 there is comic driving is not that 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.920
 misjudge now I show you as you 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.509
 that makes you have a purposeful one here 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.130
 drives here an untamed drive is 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.189
 no matter 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:04.640
 you need a bus on whom you placed 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:06.259
 and you need the nameplates below 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.510
 different if I am not mistaken 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:12.849
 here in the I decoration tool under 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.530
 tool are 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:19.099
 I take 2 directly, there are two 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:23.120
 possibilities via name tags too 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.190
 Once it is you can do it all 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.480
 make way 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.430
 So just grabs on the 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.859
 Amboss right click grabs the left there 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:36.079
 in and called the nameplate chrome 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.500
 with dark chrome and then you take 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.670
 here 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.989
 the name tag out or there 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.819
 a second name with that 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:48.819
 works that is once thin 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.910
 no idea if you really on the 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.069
 must start writing big and so on 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.840
 at least it's important because the English 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:06.350
 word for lunch something like that and 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:10.639
 build for bones and now you can 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.530
 take your horse or another 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:15.500
 mod works but that too I show 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.650
 you too and zack right click on the 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.310
 goes with the name tag and he is 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.110
 on the head 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:30.410
 the whole works well with the 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:34.739
 farmers on the head and you can there 3 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:37.160
 Here you can still do that 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.530
 also put on armor 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.890
 Do not press a sword here either 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.380
 Attract direction 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.930
 so now in armor and is up 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:53.069
 the head drives the field you can like 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.440
 then also lived ten them though 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:01.260
 bit brutal from up here like that 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:04.319
 even looked at me extra for 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.480
 this jux and madness another child 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.739
 he has made and claus child beside me 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.739
 his hands do not give a damn 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:19.970
 other mods did work of course 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:21.989
 also for this we first create some 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:27.890
 I think the spiders were very good 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.890
 funny the hpa the good old crib 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:36.240
 is long are long because the cast the 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.680
 are really great two nextel of course 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.010
 works well with cows and 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.010
 pigs 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:53.690
 let's do that first the game and 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:05:01.880
 Now the construction not me on now 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:07.160
 head civilian i war chest and 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.720
 unloved creeper's head and her 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.930
 Of course, I'm still attacking only myself 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.110
 I am currently in creative mode and whiter 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.110
 tiger 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.790
 There is another possibility 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:25.280
 especially if now in creative motto 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:30.620
 are you able to take the spurs and 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:35.180
 that also pack here in the anvil 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:39.050
 the name in the tree to tree or chrome 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:42.620
 Dealers are a lot easier crooked 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.260
 change and then you can do the bourne and 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.990
 you see the name is also from the 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.400
 adam everything with this construction and 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.280
 gets hot then always crooked 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:57.290
 that means is upside down and now 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:06:14.530
 Let's say a guest is called Krumpen 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:21.350
 clamped firmly that the Jews are much 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:22.220
 It could always be chrome at night 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:27.940
 want to change 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:30.650
 really dangerous now you see the 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.160
 So that 's normal and that's one 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.160
 on the head 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:39.169
 the reason that the reason is the chrome 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:48.919
 just the group is not on it anymore 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:50.120
 the head with mu yes that's it 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:55.720

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.720
 spectators look again
