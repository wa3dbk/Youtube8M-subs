events and didn't realize there was a
real<00:00:28.500> private<00:00:28.920> side<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.220> how<00:00:29.340> money<00:00:29.550> works

that's<00:00:30.599> what<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:30.810> learned<00:00:31.019> about<00:00:31.080> here<00:00:31.410> you've

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
that's what we learned about here you've

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.020 
that's what we learned about here you've
got<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:32.040> probably<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.550> two<00:00:32.669> days<00:00:32.820> you've

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
got that probably the two days you've

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.700 
got that probably the two days you've
been<00:00:33.180> hearing<00:00:33.390> some<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.230> strategies<00:00:34.410> that

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
been hearing some of the strategies that

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.630 
been hearing some of the strategies that
are<00:00:34.860> unconventional<00:00:36.290> alternative<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.649> like<00:00:38.520> to

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
are unconventional alternative I like to

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.520 
are unconventional alternative I like to
say<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.000> they're<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.960> two<00:00:40.140> percent

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
say that they're the the two percent

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.810 
say that they're the the two percent
strategies<00:00:41.010> ninety-eight<00:00:41.489> percent<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
strategies ninety-eight percent of the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.280 
strategies ninety-eight percent of the
population<00:00:41.910> operates<00:00:42.660> one<00:00:42.809> way<00:00:43.020> which

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
population operates one way which

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.619 
population operates one way which
clearly<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.280> not<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.550> right<00:00:44.700> way<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.210> two

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
clearly is not the right way and two

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.760 
clearly is not the right way and two
percent<00:00:45.930> operates<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.440> way<00:00:46.559> where

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
percent operates in a way where

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.260 
percent operates in a way where
recession<00:00:47.430> depression<00:00:47.550> doesn't<00:00:48.000> matter

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270
