00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.429
 welcome to retro tv Hello My name is Goldman 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.889
 I want you today at Saab equal to the Panasonic is the 7 and 7 one 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:14.219
 little to imagine 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.609
 usually it works automatically so that means the camera is watching 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.140
 to which light do we have 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.289
 and adjusts automatically in white balance 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.320
 In some situations, it does not just work that way, especially when you do 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.779
 for example, in enclosed spaces "and so took one 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.380
 special form of artificial light prevails or even stupid for the 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.630
 People it is OrbÃ¡n MASUMY plainly has a few more and not a basket 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.350
 Incandescent and more expensive it will be really nice a ship and there 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.340
 the automatic usually does not follow anymore 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.760
 But there is a very simple way to stop this 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.790
 all you need is one 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.310
 white sheet of paper 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.660
 usually you and a din-a4 should have samples with you that does 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.310
 all a bit more comfortable here 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.270
 Iquique one with the little notes 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.430
 yes he has the price equal to the seven and seven must manually adjust 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.400
 the whole thing 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.370
 first of all in those 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.630
 switch manual mode 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.040
 the retiree way the camera 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.100
 then we have the button down here for the white BBS Reuter 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.830
 1 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.020
 crushing on the market 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.530
 here we already have the default from the camera do not go main markets Goldman 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.730
 Ansari b 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.600
 You can go through it 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.780
 Percent presets of the camera have even higher here than the default for 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.730
 sunlight 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.950
 after Scott has some sunshine outside, that fits too 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.280
 fairly 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.640
 therefore March leads the cloudy sky you already see the kicking bit more 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.810
 in the hotel 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.580
 this basically Tantris z 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.830
 and another for another artificial light which is exactly what 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.860
 I do not know that I have to try it 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.280
 I did most of it 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.280
 if I have artificial light really with manual white balance 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.420
 besides, "come right here 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.320
 if this beautiful part is blind here 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.320
 the camera is ready for manual white balance 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.340
 Altena quite simply a white note in front of it 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.190
 I am always relatively close 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.190
 and then press here 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.899
 to the camera says goodbye 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:16.689
 and then it was all over 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.119
 then one could start to turn 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:20.509
 that he knows the white balance 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.839
 which is important when it comes to two pretty plain it comes from outside 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.589
 Summer you have a percentage of artificial light 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:29.639
 It is always worth it to make a new white balance when we go to 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.389
 Example one afternoon while turning 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:35.669
 or what many also make name bans in roles in movies that are just too good 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:39.099
 that they make these raisins and from the outside no daylight Rheine 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.219
 They were able to completely control the lighting situation inside 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.399
 that he has them different according to situation but main thing he has 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.999
 you use this tool with the Manuel at the same time and the white sheet of paper 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.209
 By the way unusual for photo accessories 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.099
 is pretty cheap to have 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.639
 banned spectators until next time at Red Bull TV
