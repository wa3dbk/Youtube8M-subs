00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the coast of Gibraltar and that a

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.290 
the coast of Gibraltar and that a

Russian search and rescue vessel was

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.049 
Russian search and rescue vessel was
chasing<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.260> has<00:00:52.739> believed<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.820> ship

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
chasing it it has believed that the ship

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.819 
chasing it it has believed that the ship
may<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.329> been<00:00:54.570> taken<00:00:54.899> over<00:00:54.960> by<00:00:55.110> pirates<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
may have been taken over by pirates and

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.680 
may have been taken over by pirates and
so<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.460> why<00:00:56.670> perhaps<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.300> had<00:00:57.480> been

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
so that is why perhaps it had been

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.200 
so that is why perhaps it had been
giving<00:00:58.020> flight<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.949> as<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.579> now<00:00:59.760> know<00:00:59.789> those

different and confusing reports let's
have<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> listen

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.100 

my<00:02:09.770> version<00:02:09.979> is<00:02:10.310> it's<00:02:10.880> still<00:02:11.420> in<00:02:11.540> history<00:02:11.900> and

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
my version is it's still in history and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.830 
my version is it's still in history and
I<00:02:12.560> think<00:02:12.830> maybe<00:02:13.160> it<00:02:13.520> will<00:02:13.910> be<00:02:14.120> in<00:02:14.239> history<00:02:14.599> as

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
I think maybe it will be in history as

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.650 
I think maybe it will be in history as
long<00:02:15.230> as<00:02:15.380> we<00:02:15.530> live<00:02:15.680> just<00:02:15.739> because<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:17.360> doesn't

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
long as we live just because it doesn't

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.729 
long as we live just because it doesn't
look<00:02:17.810> like<00:02:18.670> anything<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.940> lot<00:02:20.599> of<00:02:20.630> people<00:02:21.440> and

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
look like anything a lot of people and

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.400 
look like anything a lot of people and
media<00:02:22.160> speculating<00:02:23.120> about<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:23.599> think<00:02:24.050> it's<00:02:24.230> a

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
media speculating about I think it's a

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.580 
media speculating about I think it's a
quite<00:02:25.040> unique<00:02:25.459> case<00:02:26.120> not<00:02:26.660> something<00:02:27.110> we'll

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
quite unique case not something we'll

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.720 
quite unique case not something we'll
meet<00:02:27.920> later<00:02:28.190> on<00:02:28.520> but<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.810> say<00:02:30.470> that<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.310> piracy

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
meet later on but I say that the piracy

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.900 
meet later on but I say that the piracy
is<00:02:32.060> our<00:02:32.569> equation<00:02:33.080> some<00:02:33.860> commercial<00:02:34.519> dispute

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.910 
ship is running out of fuel it could
still<00:03:55.940> be<00:03:56.180> taken<00:03:56.900> over<00:03:57.140> by<00:03:57.170> pirates<00:03:57.739> and

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
still be taken over by pirates and

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.590

therefore<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.400> crew<00:03:58.640> members<00:03:59.030> which<00:03:59.450> are

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
therefore the crew members which are

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.960 
therefore the crew members which are
Russian<00:03:59.959> could<00:04:00.410> be<00:04:00.560> at<00:04:00.650> risk<00:04:00.760> everyone<00:04:01.760> is

Russian could be at risk everyone is

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.819 
Russian could be at risk everyone is
