00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
videos turned out to be kind of on the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.920 
videos turned out to be kind of on the
low<00:01:32.190> end<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.940> didn't<00:01:33.240> they<00:01:33.479> were<00:01:33.540> not

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
low end like I didn't they were not

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.930 
low end like I didn't they were not
satisfactory<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.890> my<00:01:35.040> eyes<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:40.850> so<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.880> think

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
satisfactory in my eyes and so I think

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.340 
satisfactory in my eyes and so I think
I'm<00:01:42.149> going<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.300> redo<00:01:42.570> them<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> more

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
I'm going to redo them and have a more

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.920 
I'm going to redo them and have a more
simplified<00:01:43.710> because<00:01:44.430> if<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.759> airdam<00:01:45.210> if<00:01:45.780> I

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
simplified because if I airdam if I

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.570 
simplified because if I airdam if I
aired<00:01:46.200> them<00:01:46.530> right<00:01:46.770> now<00:01:46.950> I'd<00:01:47.160> have<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.460> do<00:01:47.550> a

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
aired them right now I'd have to do a

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.430 
aired them right now I'd have to do a
lot<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.820> editing<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:49.050> would<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.229> longer

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
lot of editing and it would be longer

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.340 
lot of editing and it would be longer
than<00:01:49.680> they<00:01:49.979> would<00:01:50.190> then<00:01:50.970> they<00:01:51.090> should<00:01:51.360> be<00:01:51.390> and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
than they would then they should be and

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.630 
than they would then they should be and
I<00:01:52.470> don't<00:01:52.619> want<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.830> to<00:01:53.009> happen<00:01:53.039> really

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.850 

and<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.759> bike<00:01:57.970> is<00:01:58.180> actually<00:01:58.360> really<00:01:58.860> amazing

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
and a bike is actually really amazing

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.039 
and a bike is actually really amazing
feeling<00:02:00.369> like<00:02:00.520> that<00:02:00.759> if<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:01.479> bike<00:02:01.630> feels<00:02:01.869> the

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
feeling like that if the bike feels the

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.219 
feeling like that if the bike feels the
more<00:02:02.290> it<00:02:02.920> feels<00:02:03.369> better<00:02:03.690> than<00:02:04.690> before<00:02:04.930> the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
more it feels better than before the

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.790 
more it feels better than before the
maintenance<00:02:05.619> obviously<00:02:07.470> so

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
maintenance obviously so

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.640 
maintenance obviously so
so<00:02:10.370> in<00:02:10.880> that<00:02:11.210> regard<00:02:11.420> it's<00:02:11.930> going<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.290> take<00:02:12.620> a

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
so in that regard it's going to take a

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.670 
so in that regard it's going to take a
little<00:02:12.890> bit<00:02:13.810> about<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:15.170> will<00:02:15.260> take<00:02:15.440> about<00:02:15.530> a

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
little bit about it will take about a
