incidence of tuberculosis in yeah and

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.360 
incidence of tuberculosis in yeah and
this<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.020> probably<00:02:22.230> because<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.920> multiple

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
this is probably because of the multiple

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.100 
this is probably because of the multiple
pregnancies<00:02:24.000> they<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.360> during<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:24.900> time

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
pregnancies they have during that time

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.070 
pregnancies they have during that time
that's<00:02:26.070> when<00:02:26.220> they<00:02:26.519> get<00:02:26.970> because<00:02:27.299> if<00:02:27.570> marry<00:02:27.870> me

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
that's when they get because if marry me

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.890 
that's when they get because if marry me
yes<00:02:28.709> they<00:02:29.010> become<00:02:29.280> weakened<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.880> contact<00:02:30.299> us

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
yes they become weakened the contact us

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.080 
yes they become weakened the contact us
so<00:02:31.019> really<00:02:31.430> tuberculosis<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.580> something<00:02:32.970> in

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
so really tuberculosis is something in

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.370 
so really tuberculosis is something in
Pakistan<00:02:33.570> which<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.810> waiting<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.290> attack

anyone yes because they infected all
right<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.880> only<00:02:38.910> thing<00:02:39.239> is<00:02:39.690> when<00:02:39.930> they<00:02:40.110> become

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
right the only thing is when they become

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.600 
right the only thing is when they become
diseased<00:02:40.830> hmm

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610
