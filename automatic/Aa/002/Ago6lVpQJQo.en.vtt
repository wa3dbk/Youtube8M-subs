00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.649
 Hello everyone in this video, I will show you 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.070
 how to recover lithium ion 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.440
 battery that stopped 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.559
 let you strain because of the deep 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.490
 overdischarge for this we need 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.860
 here is a wonderful device is 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.230
 chinese clone 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:29.420
 charging imax b6 cost about 20 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:33.019
 dollars well and a multimeter of course for 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.830
 start checking battery expose 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:39.739
 its in voltage measurement mode and 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:45.140
 We look as it is known black wire then 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:47.690
 earth two red is a plus and a tester 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.770
 shows some milvolts there 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.230
 There is essentially a voltage, he does not give out 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:59.030
 however, it does not generate voltage itself 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.850
 battery charge controller we see here 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.009
 two outputs one of them minus 2 plus 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.390
 who go directly with the lady 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:10.640
 One battery per controller here 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.009
 there is a voltage of 26 volts of course for 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.189
 lyte is very small but in order to 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:20.290
 the controller started up and started to issue 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:24.380
 voltage we need to charge the battery 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.210
 approximately at least to 3.2 volts 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.020
 and then the controller will understand that the battery 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:36.020
 principle but discharged controller 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:40.479
 I will begin to understand well, let's get down to 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.579
 you will need a negative wire 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:48.439
 crocodile 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:54.079
 pick up the ground on the red wire on 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:57.710
 food tester until we remove I will not 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:00.799
 charge a large current select mode 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:08.229
 charge lithium polymer batteries go 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:13.010
 here voltage is 37 volts of one can 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:16.660
 I guess Iâ€™ll put the total on charge current 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:21.120
 1 1 is quite safe to charge 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.239
 attack confirm and look 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.340
 went charge as you can see voltage 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:30.000
 growing at the bank was 26 when charging 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.180
 she grew to 297 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.510
 after some time the voltage 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.840
 reach 3.2 volts i will disconnect the charger 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.120
 device and most likely the battery will start 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.819
 already fully working that is, we can 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.500
 throw you a tablet in this case 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:57.930
 as in the tablet thread or in 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:03:00.150
 phone and theme format I'm charging 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.829
 Likely for now I will disconnect as this 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.829
 the process can be quite long 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.030
 Well, judging by the indications of the charger 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.549
 the device currently on the bank is 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.319
 charging time is three and a half volts then 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.750
 there is if you remove the charge will be a little bit 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:26.299
 less but nonetheless we can already 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:30.450
 check whether the charge controller itself gives 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:33.120
 tension look great three with 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:37.370
 half a volt that is now 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.370
 try to connect the charger 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.860
 battery voltage three integers 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.870
 almost a tenth of a volt and look at 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.030
 conclusions 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.319
 there is voltage behind the controller now 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.780
 this battery will be perceived 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:04.030
 tablet and will charge that is 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.680
 can we say that we restored perry 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.989
 dead battery so you can do 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.909
 mobile phone batteries with 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.709
 laptop batteries true 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:16.289
 Of course he will achieve it 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:19.289
 disassemble and look he is a little his 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.289
 will lose
