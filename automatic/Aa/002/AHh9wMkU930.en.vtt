this<00:00:18.660> board<00:00:18.960> was<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.350> Borden<00:00:19.740> good<00:00:20.100> luck<00:00:20.279> by

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
this board was the Borden good luck by

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.759 
this board was the Borden good luck by
there<00:00:20.850> are<00:00:20.970> some<00:00:21.480> very<00:00:21.510> good<00:00:21.930> very<00:00:22.439> good<00:00:22.560> deal

so what I did was to insert this in the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.490 
so what I did was to insert this in the
middle<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.859> card<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.670> here<00:00:30.420> got<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.900> L

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
middle of this card so here got the L

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.750 
middle of this card so here got the L
room<00:00:31.769> connected<00:00:32.669> here<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.600> left<00:00:33.809> side

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
room connected here on the left side

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.000 
room connected here on the left side
then<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.090> elevator<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.899> second<00:00:37.440> position

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
then the elevator and second position

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.500 
then the elevator and second position
then<00:00:39.469> at<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> place<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.070> throttle

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
then at the place of the throttle

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.959 
then at the place of the throttle
however<00:00:42.510> connected<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.670> stability<00:00:44.670> switch

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
however connected the stability switch

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.959 
however connected the stability switch
which<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.530> connected<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:47.399> guess<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
which is connected to the I guess the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.410 
which is connected to the I guess the
fifth<00:00:48.270> channel<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.500> receiver<00:00:50.239> I'm<00:00:51.239> not

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
fifth channel of the receiver I'm not

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.299 
fifth channel of the receiver I'm not
too<00:00:51.570> sure<00:00:51.750> if<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.989> with<00:00:52.199> if<00:00:52.530> it's<00:00:52.710> any<00:00:53.039> useful

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
too sure if it with if it's any useful

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.060 
too sure if it with if it's any useful
for<00:00:53.670> me<00:00:53.789> because<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.239> anyway<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.050> i'm<00:00:55.710> using

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
for me because it's anyway the i'm using

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.020 
for me because it's anyway the i'm using
the<00:00:56.190> four<00:00:56.640> channel<00:00:57.030> standard<00:00:58.190> remote<00:00:59.190> from<00:00:59.789> de

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the four channel standard remote from de

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.150 
the four channel standard remote from de
nom<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.570> i'm<00:01:00.870> not<00:01:00.899> sure<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.379> i<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.800> connect

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
nom so i'm not sure if i have to connect

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.299 
nom so i'm not sure if i have to connect
this<00:01:02.309> stability<00:01:02.609> switch<00:01:03.180> i'll<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:05.129> read

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
this stability switch i'll just read

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.000 
this stability switch i'll just read
that<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.850> was<00:01:06.119> kind<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.510> necessary<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:07.770> i'm

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
that it was kind of necessary but i'm

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.700 
that it was kind of necessary but i'm
not<00:01:08.159> too<00:01:08.310> sure<00:01:08.810> anyway<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.110> last<00:01:10.320> one<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
not too sure anyway the last one is the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.190 
not too sure anyway the last one is the
rudder<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.490> right<00:01:11.670> side<00:01:11.939> here<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:13.049> this

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
rudder on the right side here so this

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.570 
rudder on the right side here so this
was<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:14.090> input<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.080> output<00:01:16.259> I've<00:01:17.250> got

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
was the input and as the output I've got

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.670 
was the input and as the output I've got
the<00:01:17.970> rudder<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.650> put<00:01:20.070> em<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.580> position

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
the rudder on the put em one position

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.190 
the rudder on the put em one position
the<00:01:22.680> rudder<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.400> m1<00:01:23.970> position<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.810> then

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the rudder on this m1 position and then

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.950 
the rudder on this m1 position and then
on<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> second<00:01:25.890> m2<00:01:26.430> I've<00:01:26.880> got<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> error<00:01:27.689> on

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
on the second m2 I've got the error on

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.050 
on the second m2 I've got the error on
and<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:29.009> m4<00:01:29.970> not<00:01:30.299> m3<00:01:30.990> but<00:01:31.200> m4<00:01:31.829> I've<00:01:32.520> got<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
and on m4 not m3 but m4 I've got the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.649 
and on m4 not m3 but m4 I've got the
elevator<00:01:34.610> so<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.759> all<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.210> all<00:01:36.329> connected

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
elevator so it's all it's all connected

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.749 
elevator so it's all it's all connected
at<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.020> moment<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.530> i'll<00:01:37.619> try<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> fit<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
at the moment so i'll try to fit in the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.770 
at the moment so i'll try to fit in the
card<00:01:39.720> into<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.350> plane<00:01:40.909> as<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.240> might<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.570> able

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
card into the plane as you might be able

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.420 
card into the plane as you might be able
to<00:01:43.140> see<00:01:43.439> I've<00:01:43.909> had<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.320> do<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> little<00:01:46.619> little

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
to see I've had to do a little little

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.060 
to see I've had to do a little little
hole<00:01:47.700> at<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.360> back<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.020> cockpit<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.680> in

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
hole at the back of the cockpit to in

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.399 
hole at the back of the cockpit to in
order<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.610> card<00:01:50.970> as<00:01:51.210> much<00:01:51.689> as<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
order to have the card as much as the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.230 
order to have the card as much as the
back<00:01:52.619> at<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> back<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:53.729> possible<00:01:54.619> so<00:01:56.240> let's

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
back at the back as possible so let's

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.590 
back at the back as possible so let's
try<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.899> fit<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.740> so

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.459 

so<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.780> role<00:02:03.990> has<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.799> go<00:02:04.950> at<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.460> front<00:02:05.759> and

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
so the role has to go at the front and

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.650 
so the role has to go at the front and
i'll<00:02:07.469> try<00:02:07.710> my<00:02:08.009> best<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.789> have<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.119> card<00:02:09.390> as

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
i'll try my best to have the card as

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.000 
i'll try my best to have the card as
much<00:02:10.080> as<00:02:10.500> them<00:02:11.599> as<00:02:12.599> much<00:02:12.900> on<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.230> original<00:02:13.800> as

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
much as them as much on the original as

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.680 
much as them as much on the original as
possible<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.670> course<00:02:15.379> so<00:02:17.300> here<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.540> way

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
possible of course so here is the way

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.490 
possible of course so here is the way
i'm<00:02:19.019> doing<00:02:19.470> i'm<00:02:19.620> just<00:02:20.040> putting<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.400> on<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.730> top

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
i'm doing i'm just putting it on the top

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.910 
i'm doing i'm just putting it on the top
straight<00:02:22.500> on<00:02:22.620> there<00:02:22.799> on<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.160> receiver<00:02:24.920> as

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
straight on there on the receiver as

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.259 
straight on there on the receiver as
flat<00:02:26.250> as<00:02:26.280> possible<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:27.890> adding<00:02:28.890> some<00:02:29.220> tape<00:02:29.640> to

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
flat as possible and adding some tape to

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:37.309 
flat as possible and adding some tape to
secure<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.900> in<00:02:31.200> place<00:02:35.720> seems<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.870> be<00:02:36.989> going<00:02:37.110> ok

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
secure it in place seems to be going ok

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.400 
secure it in place seems to be going ok
so<00:02:39.140> this<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:41.040> setup<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:42.810> seems<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.170> be<00:02:43.290> a

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
so this is the setup it seems to be a

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.770 
so this is the setup it seems to be a
bit<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.799> flat<00:02:44.730> like<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.569> wanted<00:02:46.549> so<00:02:47.549> now<00:02:48.420> I'm

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
bit of flat like I wanted so now I'm

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.580 
bit of flat like I wanted so now I'm
going<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.230> test<00:02:49.879> I've<00:02:50.879> got<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.150> test<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:52.019> plug<00:02:52.470> it

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
going to test I've got a test to plug it

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.880 
going to test I've got a test to plug it
in<00:02:52.709> with<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.760> standard<00:02:54.239> receiver<00:02:55.140> from<00:02:55.440> Dean

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
in with the standard receiver from Dean

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.069 
in with the standard receiver from Dean
I'm<00:02:56.069> which<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.430> 44<00:02:56.970> challenge<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:57.690> I'll<00:02:57.780> turn

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
I'm which is a 44 challenge so I'll turn

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:10.849 
I'm which is a 44 challenge so I'll turn
it<00:02:58.200> on<00:02:59.329> I'll<00:03:01.819> plug<00:03:02.819> this<00:03:03.030> in<00:03:03.299> and<00:03:09.530> as<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.560> can

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
it on I'll plug this in and as you can

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.160 
it on I'll plug this in and as you can
see<00:03:10.889> I<00:03:11.340> mean<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.850> so<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.120> was<00:03:12.329> almost<00:03:12.540> out<00:03:13.109> of

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
see I mean it so it was almost out of

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.129 
see I mean it so it was almost out of
the<00:03:13.500> box<00:03:14.090> that<00:03:15.090> it's<00:03:15.720> doing<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.079> job<00:03:16.200> of

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
the box that it's doing the job of

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:30.840 
the box that it's doing the job of
stabilizing<00:03:21.530> stable<00:03:22.530> items<00:03:22.829> as<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.130> plane

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.050 

it's<00:03:31.480> all<00:03:31.720> stabilized<00:03:32.350> at<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.680> moment<00:03:33.010> so

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:44.760 

dang<00:03:37.060> ok<00:03:41.070> so<00:03:42.070> here<00:03:42.850> it<00:03:42.940> is<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.750> was<00:03:43.990> a<00:03:44.020> way<00:03:44.740> to

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
dang ok so here it is it was a way to

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.640 
dang ok so here it is it was a way to
fit<00:03:45.220> this<00:03:46.530> this<00:03:48.150> kk<00:03:49.150> copter<00:03:49.600> card<00:03:50.020> on<00:03:50.350> through

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
fit this this kk copter card on through

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.950 
fit this this kk copter card on through
the<00:03:50.920> plane<00:03:51.190> just<00:03:51.550> to<00:03:52.210> note<00:03:52.390> that<00:03:52.420> I've

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
the plane just to note that I've

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.680 
the plane just to note that I've
inserted<00:03:53.320> into<00:03:54.070> the<00:03:54.190> card<00:03:54.520> the<00:03:54.700> open<00:03:55.210> air<00:03:55.450> I<00:03:55.630> a

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
inserted into the card the open air I a

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.760 
inserted into the card the open air I a
euro<00:03:56.260> open<00:03:56.950> arrow<00:03:57.750> software<00:03:58.750> version<00:03:59.200> 1.3

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
euro open arrow software version 1.3

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.840 
euro open arrow software version 1.3
better<00:04:00.670> I<00:04:01.090> guess<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.660> really<00:04:02.440> it<00:04:02.590> worked

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
better I guess and really it worked

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.690 
better I guess and really it worked
straight<00:04:03.850> out<00:04:04.000> of<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.300> box<00:04:04.860> I<00:04:05.860> just<00:04:06.490> had<00:04:06.670> to

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
straight out of the box I just had to

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.130 
straight out of the box I just had to
invert<00:04:07.500> few<00:04:08.500> of<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.740> gyro<00:04:09.100> which<00:04:09.550> were<00:04:10.140> I

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
invert few of the gyro which were I

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.780 
invert few of the gyro which were I
think<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:11.470> was<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.650> error<00:04:12.100> on<00:04:12.400> which<00:04:12.580> was

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
think it was the error on which was

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.840 
think it was the error on which was
inverted<00:04:13.080> so<00:04:14.080> you<00:04:14.590> use<00:04:14.800> P<00:04:15.100> I<00:04:15.130> think<00:04:15.550> you<00:04:15.640> use

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
inverted so you use P I think you use

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.770 
inverted so you use P I think you use
the<00:04:16.090> role<00:04:16.390> pots<00:04:17.380> that<00:04:17.650> you<00:04:18.100> put<00:04:18.280> in<00:04:18.400> 0<00:04:18.880> and<00:04:19.270> then

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
the role pots that you put in 0 and then

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.780 
the role pots that you put in 0 and then
you<00:04:19.989> then<00:04:20.830> you<00:04:20.860> move<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:22.050> the<00:04:23.190> at<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.490> remote

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
you then you move the the at the remote

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.100 
you then you move the the at the remote
level<00:04:25.300> you<00:04:25.720> move<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:26.650> sticks<00:04:27.870> okay<00:04:28.870> guys

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
level you move the sticks okay guys

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.040 
level you move the sticks okay guys
thank<00:04:29.770> you<00:04:29.830> for<00:04:29.920> watching
