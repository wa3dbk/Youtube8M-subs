00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.070
 hello friends how many times have we said 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.770
 that it is important to have quadriceps 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.200
 strong to protect your knees today 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.689
 we will learn a series of exercises that 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.509
 will help us improve the strength of 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.880
 this very important muscle if you want 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.279
 get more details about asthma 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.040
 anatomy you can click on the image 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.740
 that appear on the top edge 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.380
 we divide its strengthening into three 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.630
 levels a first level indicated for 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.000
 very weak quadriceps as a consequence 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.400
 of knee operations or a long 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.590
 inactivity a second level for 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.050
 improve your strength when we start to 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.870
 have joint problems because of 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.239
 age and a third level indicated for 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.910
 young people who want to invest in 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.070
 health of your knees avoiding problems 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.950
 in the future 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.650
 in this video we will take care of the third 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.380
 level if it seems too hard you can 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.300
 check the lower levels doing 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.700
 click on the corresponding images 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.420
 that appear on the screen 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.610
 and this routine is great for those 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.520
 young people who are worried 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.259
 by the state of health of your knees or 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.229
 those that have undergone 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.720
 ligamentoplasty surgery at an age 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.189
 early the exercises that we propose 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.189
 They are the following 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.780
 little chair on the wall in the close-up 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.030
 exercise which we will use maneuver 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.460
 warming we support our back 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.150
 against the wall and flex the 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.360
 knees at 90 degrees we hold on the 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.030
 position between 45 seconds and one minute and 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.510
 medium according to the possibilities of each 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.060
 one performing 4 sets of the exercise 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.640
 we will avoid supporting our hands on 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.550
 knees thus doing all the work 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.780
 with our quadriceps we must perform 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.840
 between 3 to 5 repetitions of the exercise 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.940
 maintaining the position between 45 and 90 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.060
 seconds 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.040
 squat for the second exercise 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.050
 we will need a stick or cane that we 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.680
 help maintain good posture 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.870
 during the exercise we placed the cane 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.180
 on our neck we separate the 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.220
 slightly at a distance 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.040
 superior to the width of our shoulders 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.860
 from that position we double our 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.410
 knees sending our buttocks towards 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.620
 back as if we wanted to sit down 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:49.430
 until a 90 - degree bend 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.650
 of knee we keep the contraction 5 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.430
 seconds and we return to the position 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.310
 initial despite its apparent simplicity 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.709
 this exercise can be complicated to 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.170
 perform in no time our 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.780
 knees should exceed the tip of 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.200
 our feet and in no time 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.709
 heels must be detached from the ground on 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.209
 secret is in flexing the hip well 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:18.230
 trying to take the cream as 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:21.020
 possible later we made 4 series of 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.160
 12 repetitions resting a minute 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.370
 between each series 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.650
 I explain the third exercise and more 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.860
 complicated of the series to opinion of a 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.980
 server is the split in the split we must 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.030
 take a stride forward 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.030
 descending the knee of the leg 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.880
 later until touching the ground for 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.240
 again return to the starting position as 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.830
 Lightning as quickly as possible 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.990
 depending on the length of the stride 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.960
 the exercise will have more or less 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:55.230
 Difficulty with greater stride 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.840
 difficulty we made three sets of 16 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.180
 repetitions alternating a stride with 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.580
 each leg what will give us 8 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.650
 repetitions for each leg if 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:09.500
 you need more intensity we can 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.500
 increase repetitions up to 24 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.980
 lateral tape the last exercise can 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.860
 considered as a lateral split in the 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.740
 that we made a stride towards a 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.720
 lateral again we must launch one of 

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.510
 our legs sideways 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.000
 bend the knees and lower the 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.700
 buttocks until achieving a flex of 90 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.840
 knee degrees as we explained 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.000
 in the second exercise or squat 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.790
 we keep for 2 seconds and through 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.960
 an explosive movement we recover the 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.960
 initial position 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.010
 the new one depending on the length of 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.130
 the stride in exercise will have greater or 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.490
 Less difficulty to greater stride greater 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.830
 difficulty we made three sets of 16 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.350
 repetitions alternating a stride 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.590
 lateral with each leg what will give us 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.750
 8 repetitions per leg if 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:10.070
 you need more intensity we can 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:12.710
 increase repetitions up to 24 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.350
 we recommend carrying out the routine 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.300
 two or three days a week in days 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.080
 alternate to maintain a good 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.240
 tonicity and strength of your quadriceps 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.910
 Feel free to modify series and 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.490
 repetitions to the routine adapting it well 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.620
 to your possibilities if the routines 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.020
 too hard we can make a 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.650
 mix between the exercises of phase 2 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.080
 and stage 3 cheer up and include this 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.060
