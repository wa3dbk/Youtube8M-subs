week we're going to be talking about the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.540 
week we're going to be talking about the
Griffin<00:00:13.490> beacon<00:00:14.350> so<00:00:15.350> the<00:00:15.469> iOS<00:00:15.860> beacon<00:00:16.309> it's<00:00:16.460> a

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
Griffin beacon so the iOS beacon it's a

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.279 
Griffin beacon so the iOS beacon it's a
device<00:00:16.820> that<00:00:16.850> allows<00:00:17.300> you<00:00:17.449> to<00:00:17.480> use<00:00:17.750> your<00:00:17.779> iPad

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
device that allows you to use your iPad

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.529 
device that allows you to use your iPad
your<00:00:18.320> iPhone<00:00:18.650> or<00:00:18.890> even<00:00:19.190> your<00:00:19.250> ipod<00:00:19.609> touch<00:00:19.910> to

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
your iPhone or even your ipod touch to

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.570 
your iPhone or even your ipod touch to
use<00:00:20.810> it<00:00:20.929> as<00:00:21.080> a<00:00:21.109> universal<00:00:21.589> remote<00:00:21.619> and<00:00:22.099> so

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
use it as a universal remote and so

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.529 
use it as a universal remote and so
we're<00:00:22.759> going<00:00:22.880> to<00:00:22.939> talk<00:00:23.060> a<00:00:23.089> little<00:00:23.240> bit<00:00:23.419> about

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
we're going to talk a little bit about

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.120 
we're going to talk a little bit about
the<00:00:23.720> software<00:00:24.199> portion<00:00:24.560> of<00:00:24.679> things<00:00:24.830> because

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
the software portion of things because

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.189 
the software portion of things because
there's<00:00:25.279> an<00:00:25.429> app<00:00:25.699> that<00:00:25.990> corresponds<00:00:26.990> to<00:00:27.109> the

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
there's an app that corresponds to the

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.649 
there's an app that corresponds to the
device<00:00:27.410> itself<00:00:27.759> along<00:00:28.759> with<00:00:28.999> some<00:00:29.509> of<00:00:29.599> the

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:29.659 
device itself along with some of the

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.929 
device itself along with some of the
actual<00:00:29.960> hardware<00:00:30.289> features<00:00:30.579> so<00:00:31.579> the<00:00:31.730> device

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
actual hardware features so the device

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.000 
actual hardware features so the device
is<00:00:32.150> prob<00:00:32.660> about<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:32.960> size<00:00:33.170> of<00:00:33.290> a<00:00:33.380> coaster<00:00:33.829> I've

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
is prob about the size of a coaster I've

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.550 
is prob about the size of a coaster I've
got<00:00:34.730> a<00:00:34.760> nice<00:00:34.940> little<00:00:35.090> heft<00:00:35.360> to<00:00:35.450> it<00:00:35.570> I'll<00:00:36.290> so<00:00:36.470> you

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
got a nice little heft to it I'll so you

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.840 
got a nice little heft to it I'll so you
can<00:00:36.680> see<00:00:36.800> from<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:37.070> top<00:00:37.280> it<00:00:37.460> looks<00:00:37.640> like<00:00:37.820> a

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
can see from the top it looks like a

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.000 
can see from the top it looks like a
little<00:00:38.120> pebble<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:39.410> best<00:00:39.710> way<00:00:39.800> to<00:00:39.860> think

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
little pebble the best way to think

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.850 
little pebble the best way to think
about<00:00:40.130> it<00:00:40.250> is<00:00:40.370> almost<00:00:40.490> like<00:00:40.670> a<00:00:40.730> triangle<00:00:41.120> so

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
about it is almost like a triangle so

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.800 
about it is almost like a triangle so
when<00:00:42.860> you're<00:00:42.980> holding<00:00:43.280> it<00:00:43.370> up<00:00:43.520> right<00:00:43.730> you<00:00:44.600> want

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
when you're holding it up right you want

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.870 
when you're holding it up right you want
the<00:00:45.020> top<00:00:45.440> side<00:00:45.710> to<00:00:45.890> be<00:00:46.010> pointing<00:00:46.430> at<00:00:46.580> your

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
the top side to be pointing at your

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.440 
the top side to be pointing at your
devices<00:00:47.510> so<00:00:47.840> if<00:00:48.140> you<00:00:48.470> actually<00:00:48.650> flip<00:00:49.070> it<00:00:49.220> over

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
devices so if you actually flip it over

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.690 
devices so if you actually flip it over
you'll<00:00:50.450> get<00:00:50.570> a<00:00:50.630> little<00:00:50.810> TV<00:00:51.110> icon<00:00:51.830> there<00:00:52.010> so

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
you'll get a little TV icon there so

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.830 
you'll get a little TV icon there so
that's<00:00:52.850> just<00:00:52.940> basically<00:00:53.330> tell<00:00:53.570> me<00:00:53.690> that

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
that's just basically tell me that

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.180 
that's just basically tell me that
that's<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.170> direction<00:00:54.560> that<00:00:54.800> it's<00:00:55.010> going<00:00:55.100> to

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
that's the direction that it's going to

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.860 
that's the direction that it's going to
be<00:00:55.310> pointing<00:00:55.640> it<00:00:55.790> and<00:00:56.030> again<00:00:56.420> just<00:00:56.570> think<00:00:56.810> of

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
be pointing it and again just think of

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.360 
be pointing it and again just think of
it<00:00:56.960> as<00:00:57.080> a<00:00:57.110> remote<00:00:57.380> control<00:00:57.830> so<00:00:57.860> it's<00:00:58.190> going<00:00:58.310> to

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
it as a remote control so it's going to

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.310 
it as a remote control so it's going to
have<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:58.700> be<00:00:58.730> pointing<00:00:59.270> at<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.600> devices<00:01:00.110> that

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
have to be pointing at the devices that

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.860 
have to be pointing at the devices that
you<00:01:00.530> are<00:01:00.740> planning<00:01:01.100> to<00:01:01.220> control<00:01:01.720> the<00:01:02.720> good

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
you are planning to control the good

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.270 
you are planning to control the good
thing<00:01:02.990> about<00:01:03.050> it<00:01:03.290> is<00:01:03.470> this<00:01:03.620> has<00:01:03.830> quite<00:01:04.159> a<00:01:04.189> bit

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
thing about it is this has quite a bit

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.859 
thing about it is this has quite a bit
of<00:01:04.400> range<00:01:04.670> you're<00:01:05.330> essentially<00:01:05.720> getting

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
of range you're essentially getting

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.499 
of range you're essentially getting
about<00:01:06.229> 30<00:01:06.799> feet<00:01:07.070> of<00:01:07.340> range<00:01:07.430> so<00:01:07.939> if<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:08.210> have<00:01:08.390> it

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
about 30 feet of range so if you have it

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.029 
about 30 feet of range so if you have it
you<00:01:08.719> know<00:01:08.810> somewhere<00:01:09.109> behind<00:01:09.259> you<00:01:09.560> somewhere

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
you know somewhere behind you somewhere

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:11.260 
you know somewhere behind you somewhere
in<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.159> room<00:01:10.369> as<00:01:10.549> long<00:01:10.670> as<00:01:10.820> it's<00:01:10.969> you<00:01:11.179> know

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
in the room as long as it's you know

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.760 
in the room as long as it's you know
pointing<00:01:11.570> to<00:01:11.659> your<00:01:11.719> devices<00:01:12.020> then<00:01:12.619> you're

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
pointing to your devices then you're

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.669 
pointing to your devices then you're
okay<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.130> go<00:01:13.249> it<00:01:14.090> syncs<00:01:14.570> to<00:01:14.600> your<00:01:14.810> iPad<00:01:15.530> or<00:01:15.560> your

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
okay to go it syncs to your iPad or your

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:17.950 
okay to go it syncs to your iPad or your
iPhone<00:01:15.799> via<00:01:16.340> bluetooth<00:01:16.789> so<00:01:17.119> even<00:01:17.630> if<00:01:17.719> you<00:01:17.810> go

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
iPhone via bluetooth so even if you go

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.359 
iPhone via bluetooth so even if you go
outside<00:01:18.200> of<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.590> room<00:01:18.770> as<00:01:18.979> long<00:01:19.130> as<00:01:19.249> you're

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
outside of the room as long as you're

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.099 
outside of the room as long as you're
within<00:01:19.549> Bluetooth<00:01:19.999> range<00:01:20.270> which<00:01:20.539> is<00:01:20.569> give<00:01:20.990> or

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
within Bluetooth range which is give or

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:23.559 
within Bluetooth range which is give or
take<00:01:21.259> about<00:01:21.499> 20<00:01:21.859> feet<00:01:22.100> you<00:01:22.819> can't<00:01:23.119> control<00:01:23.420> it

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
take about 20 feet you can't control it

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:24.999 
take about 20 feet you can't control it
so<00:01:23.689> if<00:01:23.810> you<00:01:23.960> happen<00:01:24.109> to<00:01:24.259> go<00:01:24.380> into<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.890> kitchen

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
have used slightly different labeling or

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.720 
have used slightly different labeling or
something<00:04:04.739> would<00:04:04.830> have<00:04:04.950> made<00:04:05.100> more<00:04:05.280> sense<00:04:05.519> as

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
something would have made more sense as

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.820 
something would have made more sense as
to<00:04:05.760> what<00:04:06.330> they<00:04:06.510> are<00:04:06.540> but<00:04:06.959> literally<00:04:07.260> you<00:04:07.620> just

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
to what they are but literally you just

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.740 
to what they are but literally you just
pick<00:04:08.100> one<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.489> then<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.120> start<00:04:09.390> using<00:04:09.540> the

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
pick one and then you start using the

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.350 
pick one and then you start using the
functionality<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.500> you<00:04:11.370> know<00:04:11.459> if<00:04:11.670> it<00:04:12.090> starts

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
functionality and you know if it starts

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.420 
functionality and you know if it starts
working<00:04:12.480> great<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.350> tap<00:04:13.590> use<00:04:13.860> this<00:04:14.040> one<00:04:14.250> and

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
working great you tap use this one and

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.699 
working great you tap use this one and
then<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:14.820> saves<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.239> if<00:04:15.390> not<00:04:15.930> again<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.560> go

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
then it saves it if not again you go

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.490 
then it saves it if not again you go
back<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.250> try<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.060> different<00:04:18.269> ones<00:04:18.600> what

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
back and you try the different ones what

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.560 
back and you try the different ones what
I<00:04:19.530> found<00:04:19.799> a<00:04:19.919> bit<00:04:20.070> more<00:04:20.220> helpful<00:04:20.669> however<00:04:20.850> is<00:04:21.180> to

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
I found a bit more helpful however is to

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.780 
I found a bit more helpful however is to
use<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.900> wizard<00:04:22.080> so<00:04:22.800> if<00:04:22.919> you<00:04:23.040> use<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.460> remote

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
use the wizard so if you use the remote

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.659 
use the wizard so if you use the remote
wizard<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:24.600> simply<00:04:24.900> tap<00:04:25.169> on<00:04:25.320> it<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:26.430> first

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
wizard you simply tap on it the first

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.070 
wizard you simply tap on it the first
thing<00:04:26.820> that<00:04:26.850> does<00:04:27.090> it<00:04:27.270> ask<00:04:27.450> you<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.690> touch<00:04:27.900> the

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:29.659 
power button to see if it function

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.290 
worked and they basically would
pre-program<00:04:41.069> everything<00:04:41.430> for<00:04:41.639> me<00:04:41.759> so<00:04:41.909> it's<00:04:42.029> a

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
pre-program everything for me so it's a

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.089 
pre-program everything for me so it's a
little<00:04:42.539> bit<00:04:42.629> easier<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:43.110> use<00:04:43.259> if<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:43.770> hit<00:04:43.919> no

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
little bit easier to use if I hit no

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.119 
little bit easier to use if I hit no
again<00:04:44.400> it'll<00:04:44.580> just<00:04:44.819> try<00:04:44.999> something<00:04:45.419> different

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
again it'll just try something different

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.640 
again it'll just try something different
as<00:04:47.129> we<00:04:47.279> can<00:04:47.400> go<00:04:47.490> back<00:04:47.669> here<00:04:47.909> again<00:04:48.379> so<00:04:49.379> a<00:04:49.409> lot<00:04:49.620> of

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
as we can go back here again so a lot of

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.200 
as we can go back here again so a lot of
cool<00:04:49.860> stuff<00:04:49.889> that<00:04:50.159> you<00:04:50.219> can<00:04:50.370> do<00:04:50.520> if<00:04:50.699> there's

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
cool stuff that you can do if there's

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.629 
cool stuff that you can do if there's
buttons<00:04:51.569> that<00:04:52.110> aren't<00:04:52.590> showing<00:04:53.039> up<00:04:53.249> on<00:04:53.460> the

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
buttons that aren't showing up on the

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.119 
buttons that aren't showing up on the
remote<00:04:53.879> so<00:04:54.210> let's<00:04:54.509> say<00:04:54.659> I<00:04:54.689> go<00:04:54.779> back<00:04:55.139> and<00:04:55.469> let's

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:56.129 
remote so let's say I go back and let's

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.019 
remote so let's say I go back and let's
see<00:04:56.430> will<00:04:56.729> do<00:04:56.909> my<00:04:57.710> samsung<00:04:58.710> TV<00:04:59.039> again<00:04:59.759> pretty

can do is just got this activities

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.209 
can do is just got this activities
button<00:05:35.099> down<00:05:35.279> here<00:05:35.310> if<00:05:35.879> you<00:05:36.000> tap<00:05:36.270> that<00:05:37.009> you<00:05:38.009> can

button down here if you tap that you can

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:40.519 
button down here if you tap that you can
add<00:05:38.370> activities<00:05:39.180> now<00:05:39.449> activities<00:05:40.259> are

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:40.529 
add activities now activities are

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:43.610 
add activities now activities are
essentially<00:05:41.009> like<00:05:41.189> macros<00:05:41.789> so<00:05:42.479> if<00:05:42.810> you<00:05:43.110> let's

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
essentially like macros so if you let's

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.010 
essentially like macros so if you let's
say<00:05:43.770> you<00:05:43.830> selected<00:05:44.430> watch<00:05:44.610> TV<00:05:45.089> what<00:05:45.870> you'd

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
say you selected watch TV what you'd

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.869 
say you selected watch TV what you'd
wanted<00:05:46.349> to<00:05:46.469> do<00:05:46.649> is<00:05:46.800> you<00:05:46.919> can<00:05:47.069> activate<00:05:47.610> it<00:05:47.669> so

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 
wanted to do is you can activate it so

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.600 
wanted to do is you can activate it so
that<00:05:48.029> it<00:05:48.120> operates<00:05:48.469> certain<00:05:49.469> devices<00:05:49.770> so<00:05:50.250> if

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
that it operates certain devices so if

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.429 
that it operates certain devices so if
you<00:05:50.699> wanted<00:05:50.939> to<00:05:51.029> turn<00:05:51.210> on<00:05:51.360> if<00:05:51.990> you<00:05:52.169> clicked<00:05:52.439> on

00:05:52.429 --> 00:05:52.439 
you wanted to turn on if you clicked on

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:54.439 
you wanted to turn on if you clicked on
like<00:05:52.740> say<00:05:52.979> watch<00:05:53.250> movies<00:05:53.729> it<00:05:54.000> would<00:05:54.210> turn<00:05:54.389> on

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:54.449 
like say watch movies it would turn on

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:56.990 
like say watch movies it would turn on
your<00:05:54.930> DVD<00:05:55.349> player<00:05:55.379> and<00:05:55.800> your<00:05:56.250> TV<00:05:56.610> and<00:05:56.819> it<00:05:56.909> would

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
your DVD player and your TV and it would

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.459 
your DVD player and your TV and it would
give<00:05:57.149> you<00:05:57.240> that<00:05:57.300> functionality<00:05:57.899> on<00:05:58.259> the
