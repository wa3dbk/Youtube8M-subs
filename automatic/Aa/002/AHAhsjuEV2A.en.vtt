something<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:31.109> our<00:00:31.199> playground<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:32.759> start

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
something to our playground so we start

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.720 
something to our playground so we start
to<00:00:33.210> looking<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.960> stencils<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.280> took<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> look

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
at the pavement and realized we couldn't

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.250 
at the pavement and realized we couldn't
paint<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.460> top<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.059> weeds<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> tracks

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.470 
paint on top of the weeds and the tracks
and<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:40.950> began<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.309> try<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.700> figure<00:00:41.910> out<00:00:42.059> what

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
and we began to try to figure out what

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.170 
and we began to try to figure out what
do<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.600> do<00:00:42.780> how<00:00:43.050> do<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.230> get<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.739> made<00:00:44.180> clean

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
do you do how do you get it made clean

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.330 
do you do how do you get it made clean
like<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> parking<00:00:45.930> lot<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.739> really<00:00:46.770> knew

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
like a parking lot we really knew

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.549 
like a parking lot we really knew
nothing<00:00:48.059> about<00:00:49.520> resurfacing<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.760> playground

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
with us where I don't do sealants every

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.080 
with us where I don't do sealants every
day<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.039> seemed<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> pretty<00:00:59.730> straight

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
day it seemed like a pretty straight

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.660 
day it seemed like a pretty straight
forward<00:01:00.359> project<00:01:01.050> where<00:01:01.559> I'd<00:01:02.010> help<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> PTA

forward project where I'd help the PTA
look<00:01:02.969> at<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.180> few<00:01:03.359> different<00:01:03.390> quotes<00:01:03.899> and

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
look at a few different quotes and

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.929 
look at a few different quotes and
evaluate<00:01:04.830> from<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.100> technical<00:01:05.460> perspective

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
were looking at the quotes when melzar

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.440 
were looking at the quotes when melzar
found<00:01:10.290> study<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.729> made<00:01:12.000> us<00:01:12.119> think<00:01:12.360> twice

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
found study and that made us think twice

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.399 
found study and that made us think twice
about<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.810> whole<00:01:12.990> thing

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
about the whole thing

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the USGS study was conducted in Texas

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.800 
the USGS study was conducted in Texas
and<00:01:16.740> they<00:01:17.400> found<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.240> coal<00:01:18.570> tar

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
and they found that the coal tar

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.929 
and they found that the coal tar
sealants<00:01:19.229> had<00:01:19.710> an<00:01:19.890> order<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.460> magnitude

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
sealants had an order of magnitude

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.050 
sealants had an order of magnitude
higher<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.509> these<00:01:22.070> PAHs<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.640> they<00:01:23.759> tracked

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
higher of these PAHs so they tracked

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.240 
higher of these PAHs so they tracked
those<00:01:24.420> byproducts<00:01:25.409> through<00:01:25.799> their<00:01:25.950> eco

those byproducts through their eco
system<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.820> found<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.090> they<00:01:27.210> were<00:01:27.299> causing

it<00:01:57.780> starts<00:01:57.860> giving<00:01:58.860> off<00:01:58.979> fumes<00:01:59.280> again<00:01:59.520> I

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
it starts giving off fumes again I

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.010 
it starts giving off fumes again I
didn't<00:02:00.090> want<00:02:00.240> my<00:02:00.329> kids<00:02:00.360> exposed<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.259> that

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
didn't want my kids exposed to that

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.800 
didn't want my kids exposed to that
so<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.890> PTA<00:02:03.189> had<00:02:03.460> a<00:02:03.490> dilemma<00:02:03.880> they<00:02:04.750> were

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
so the PTA had a dilemma they were

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.960 
so the PTA had a dilemma they were
obligated<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.590> spend<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.070> money<00:02:06.189> donated<00:02:06.790> for

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.180 
obligated to spend the money donated for
the<00:02:07.030> project<00:02:07.509> but<00:02:08.170> they<00:02:08.410> debated<00:02:08.860> whether

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
the project but they debated whether

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.520 
the project but they debated whether
they<00:02:09.399> could<00:02:09.459> in<00:02:09.880> good<00:02:10.179> conscience<00:02:10.690> put<00:02:11.440> an

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
playground in spite of the fact it was

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.640 
playground in spite of the fact it was
an<00:02:15.790> industry-wide<00:02:16.239> standard<00:02:16.930> procedure

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
an industry-wide standard procedure

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.040 
an industry-wide standard procedure
there<00:02:18.370> was<00:02:18.459> a<00:02:18.489> huge<00:02:18.730> debate<00:02:18.880> some<00:02:19.750> people

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
there was a huge debate some people

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.470 
there was a huge debate some people
believe<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.160> studies<00:02:21.489> some<00:02:21.970> people<00:02:22.209> couldn't

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
believe the studies some people couldn't

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.390 
believe the studies some people couldn't
understand<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.959> studies<00:02:23.260> some<00:02:23.620> people<00:02:23.890> said

maybe<00:02:24.640> this<00:02:24.849> is<00:02:25.000> just<00:02:25.030> an<00:02:25.239> alarmist<00:02:25.630> study

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
maybe this is just an alarmist study

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.050 
maybe this is just an alarmist study
people<00:02:26.680> really<00:02:26.890> didn't<00:02:27.099> want<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:27.580> believe<00:02:27.819> the

people really didn't want to believe the

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.920 
people really didn't want to believe the
studies<00:02:28.650> once<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.920> knew<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:31.090> difference<00:02:31.569> about

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
studies once I knew the difference about

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.590 
studies once I knew the difference about
what<00:02:32.170> my<00:02:32.319> kids<00:02:32.620> are<00:02:32.769> being<00:02:32.890> exposed<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.819> not<00:02:34.330> to

what my kids are being exposed to not to
mention<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:35.019> fact<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.380> what<00:02:35.950> are<00:02:36.069> we<00:02:36.190> two

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
mention the fact that what are we two

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.090 
mention the fact that what are we two
blacks<00:02:36.640> from<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:36.880> Grand<00:02:37.150> River<00:02:37.330> I<00:02:38.100> couldn't

turn<00:02:39.280> my<00:02:39.549> head<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:40.239> other<00:02:40.390> way<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:40.930> say<00:02:41.890> let's

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
turn my head the other way and say let's

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.670 
turn my head the other way and say let's
just<00:02:42.670> do<00:02:42.880> what<00:02:43.060> everybody<00:02:43.480> does<00:02:43.720> part<00:02:44.470> of<00:02:44.530> our

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680

just do what everybody does part of our
mission<00:02:45.280> statement<00:02:45.700> here<00:02:45.880> at<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.090> school<00:02:46.390> is

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
mission statement here at the school is

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.210 
mission statement here at the school is
to<00:02:46.840> think<00:02:47.049> about<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.410> environment<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:48.160> to

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
to think about the environment and to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.000 
to think about the environment and to
think<00:02:48.519> about<00:02:48.580> how<00:02:49.410> our<00:02:50.410> actions<00:02:50.650> are

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
think about how our actions are

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.559 
think about how our actions are
affecting<00:02:51.130> everybody<00:02:51.760> else<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.120> infecting

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
affecting everybody else and infecting

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.420 
affecting everybody else and infecting
the<00:02:52.660> environment<00:02:53.200> so<00:02:53.500> some<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.160> studies

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
the environment so some of the studies

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.140 
the environment so some of the studies
that<00:02:54.519> we<00:02:54.670> read<00:02:55.030> were<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:57.370> was<00:02:57.519> natural<00:02:57.910> for<00:02:57.970> us

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
that we read were it was natural for us

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.059 
that we read were it was natural for us
to<00:02:58.209> think<00:02:58.330> about<00:02:58.569> their<00:02:58.900> conclusions<00:02:59.410> once<00:02:59.890> we

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
to think about their conclusions once we

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.070 
to think about their conclusions once we
decided<00:03:00.549> to<00:03:01.060> pay<00:03:01.239> attention<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.720> this<00:03:01.810> study

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
decided to pay attention to this study

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.229 
decided to pay attention to this study
we<00:03:02.290> started<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.620> look<00:03:02.709> for<00:03:02.970> alternatives<00:03:03.970> and

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
we started to look for alternatives and

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.390 
we started to look for alternatives and
everybody<00:03:04.989> we<00:03:05.110> called<00:03:05.349> was<00:03:05.620> using<00:03:05.980> coal<00:03:06.160> tar

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
everybody we called was using coal tar

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.970 
everybody we called was using coal tar
we<00:03:07.150> started<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.480> look<00:03:07.600> for<00:03:07.660> some<00:03:07.980> alternatives

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
we started to look for some alternatives

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.340 
we started to look for some alternatives
after<00:03:09.760> much<00:03:10.390> searching<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:11.019> after<00:03:11.260> even

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
after much searching and after even

talking<00:03:11.829> about<00:03:11.890> what<00:03:12.280> if<00:03:12.370> we<00:03:12.459> do<00:03:12.579> nothing<00:03:13.030> and

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
talking about what if we do nothing and

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.330

how<00:03:13.480> do<00:03:13.540> we<00:03:13.690> give<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.019> money<00:03:14.140> back<00:03:14.500> or<00:03:14.859> use<00:03:15.190> the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
how do we give the money back or use the
