she took the Tom up the canyon so we

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.610 
she took the Tom up the canyon so we
decided<00:03:17.129> to<00:03:17.250> circle<00:03:17.670> around<00:03:18.410> we<00:03:19.410> didn't

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
decided to circle around we didn't

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.710 
decided to circle around we didn't
circle<00:03:19.950> round<00:03:20.130> enough<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.730> kept<00:03:20.970> on<00:03:21.090> going<00:03:21.540> and

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
it went across the next Canyon and got

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.500 
it went across the next Canyon and got
some<00:03:25.500> video<00:03:25.769> of<00:03:25.799> it<00:03:26.099> going<00:03:26.519> up<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.269> other<00:03:27.419> side

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.280 
some video of it going up the other side
and<00:03:28.139> then<00:03:28.919> we<00:03:29.370> decided<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:30.000> get<00:03:30.269> on<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.840> top<00:03:31.079> of

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
and then we decided to get on the top of

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.740 
and then we decided to get on the top of
that<00:03:31.440> Canyon<00:03:31.849> and<00:03:33.440> we<00:03:34.440> set<00:03:34.769> up<00:03:34.950> that<00:03:35.940> call<00:03:36.269> one

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
that Canyon and we set up that call one

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.140 
that Canyon and we set up that call one
time<00:03:37.079> and<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.650> gobbled<00:03:38.069> right<00:03:38.250> back<00:03:38.489> so<00:03:38.910> we

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
time and it gobbled right back so we

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.180
