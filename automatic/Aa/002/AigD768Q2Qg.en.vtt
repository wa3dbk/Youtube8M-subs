00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
of Air Force Ones also from 1997 these

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.300 
of Air Force Ones also from 1997 these
are<00:01:42.720> black<00:01:42.900> and<00:01:43.080> white<00:01:43.260> Air<00:01:43.500> Force<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:43.979> canvas

are black and white Air Force one canvas

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.310 
are black and white Air Force one canvas
as<00:01:44.610> seen<00:01:47.540> now<00:01:48.540> what<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.780> really<00:01:49.140> love<00:01:49.290> about

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
as seen now what I really love about

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.580 
as seen now what I really love about
these<00:01:50.479> is<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.600> they<00:01:51.869> got<00:01:51.990> an<00:01:52.140> all-white

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
these is that they got an all-white

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.520 
these is that they got an all-white
missile<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.340> think<00:01:54.180> if<00:01:54.270> they<00:01:54.390> put<00:01:54.420> black<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
missile I think if they put black on the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.830 
missile I think if they put black on the
bottom<00:01:55.650> portion<00:01:56.060> it<00:01:57.060> probably<00:01:57.450> wouldn't<00:01:57.720> be

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840
