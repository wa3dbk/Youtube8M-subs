00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:13.330
 this means that you rent it 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:16.689
 I don't really understand what you do 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.849
 listen if it doesn't sell or rent to us 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.050
 the building we will have to move and it 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.340
 study at this time can not 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.320
 allow core we take the risk of 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.029
 close i know 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.180
 that's why I took this 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.890
 decision no but here to me that I 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.419
 I fully understand I found myself 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.880
 long ago in the same situation not 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.170

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.090

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.170
 everything I owed the building not 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.020
 I give him is mine 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.329
 it is not sold or rented good 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.560
 evening 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.990
 wait at least because of violation 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.760
 respect range it takes revenge this way because the 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.380
 wine that lied not made wind of 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.800
 talking to him would keep us to what we do 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.500
 Dad will solve everything 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.950

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.170

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.520
 better for us but I wish I could trust 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.619
 even so they can not issue 2000 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.630

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.460

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.950
 aspect is fine 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.820
 this is the fundamental scene of 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.340
 the whole movie and let me explain this scene 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.869
 there is a collapse of the character and such 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.549
 collapse cannot be represented in 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.070
 no other way than through 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.070
 his tears true and sincere tears 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.179

 god I was before his arrival 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.769
 I tried the scene with Fran and when I did it 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:20.310
 heard or attempted to reproduce 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:23.140
 the expression he was looking for is 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.360
 stunned by what I see 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.920

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.470

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.940

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.100

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.660

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.200

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.709
 part
