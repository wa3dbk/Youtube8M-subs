00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
and then in between blending it out I'm

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.459 
and then in between blending it out I'm
just<00:00:56.699> kind<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.059> darkening<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.140> adding<00:00:58.350> more

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
just kind of darkening and adding more

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.590 
just kind of darkening and adding more
pigment<00:00:58.859> especially<00:00:59.309> along<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.940> bottom<00:01:00.270> line

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
pigment especially along the bottom line

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.720 
pigment especially along the bottom line
like<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.050> bottom<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.309> where<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.520> want

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
like the bottom of it is where I want

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.399 
like the bottom of it is where I want
the<00:01:02.940> darkest<00:01:03.390> color<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.899> think<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.170> color

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
the darkest color and I think is color

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.609 
the darkest color and I think is color
to<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:07.189> so<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.430> pretty<00:01:08.790> simple<00:01:09.600> I'm<00:01:10.470> just

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
to be so it's pretty simple I'm just

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.109 
to be so it's pretty simple I'm just
going<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.799> bring<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.100> little<00:01:11.250> bit<00:01:11.460> closer<00:01:11.760> to

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
going to bring a little bit closer to

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.350 
going to bring a little bit closer to
ease<00:01:12.590> I<00:01:13.590> am<00:01:14.250> just<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.520> little<00:01:14.790> bit<00:01:14.880> more<00:01:15.060> above

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
ease I am just a little bit more above

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.390 
ease I am just a little bit more above
and<00:01:16.080> then<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.470> tear<00:01:16.680> duct<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.100> that's<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
and then the tear duct but that's the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:32.530 
and then the tear duct but that's the
basic<00:01:17.790> look<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.380> black<00:01:20.280> eye

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
and now to make it a bit more extreme

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.190 
boon of blending it up slightly and then
putting<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.160> in<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.880> corner<00:02:11.240> and<00:02:11.480> little<00:02:11.990> dabs

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
putting it in a corner and little dabs

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.490 
putting it in a corner and little dabs
of<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.880> little<00:02:13.880> sporadic<00:02:14.480> dabs<00:02:14.810> on<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.260> upper

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
of it little sporadic dabs on the upper

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.020 
of it little sporadic dabs on the upper
eyelid<00:02:15.650> as<00:02:15.890> well<00:02:15.950> I'm<00:02:16.400> gonna<00:02:16.580> start<00:02:16.850> blending

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
eyelid as well I'm gonna start blending

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.410 
eyelid as well I'm gonna start blending
that<00:02:17.270> with<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:17.740> sponge<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:22.760> know<00:02:22.880> darken<00:02:23.300> that

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
that with a sponge you know darken that

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.720 
that with a sponge you know darken that
lower<00:02:24.080> line<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:24.560> she's<00:02:24.950> in<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.160> blue<00:02:25.370> but<00:02:25.670> I

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
lower line and she's in the blue but I

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.400 
lower line and she's in the blue but I
think<00:02:25.940> that<00:02:26.060> lays<00:02:26.240> a<00:02:26.270> little<00:02:26.570> bit<00:02:26.690> too<00:02:26.990> harsh

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
think that lays a little bit too harsh

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.890 
think that lays a little bit too harsh
so<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:28.370> can<00:02:28.580> go<00:02:28.700> out<00:02:28.850> and<00:02:29.180> try<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.540> blend<00:02:29.810> out

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
so I can go out and try and blend out

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.870 
so I can go out and try and blend out
the<00:02:30.080> blue<00:02:30.260> of<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.560> sponge

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.490 

it's<00:02:34.880> like<00:02:35.000> cuz<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:35.570> was<00:02:35.720> quite<00:02:35.990> dark<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.350> just

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
it's like cuz I was quite dark I just

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.890 
it's like cuz I was quite dark I just
really<00:02:36.800> have<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:37.040> blend<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.400> out<00:02:37.520> now

mostly along the bottom where I want it
to<00:02:49.349> be<00:02:49.440> darkest<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.069> then<00:02:50.159> padding<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.909> over

these little broken capillary dots as
well<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:11.220> see<00:03:11.370> on<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.579> outer<00:03:11.730> corner<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.150> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
well you see on the outer corner of the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.059 
well you see on the outer corner of the
eye<00:03:12.269> on<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.629> upper<00:03:12.840> eyelid<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.620> then<00:03:13.799> blend

eye on the upper eyelid and then blend

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.000 
eye on the upper eyelid and then blend
it<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.310> soften<00:03:14.549> it<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.790> little<00:03:14.879> bit<00:03:19.010> again

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
it to soften it a little bit again

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.589 
it to soften it a little bit again
ducking<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.549> bottom<00:03:20.790> line<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:23.359> little<00:03:24.359> bit

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
ducking the bottom line a little bit

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:31.069 
ducking the bottom line a little bit
more<00:03:24.750> in<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.959> eyelid<00:03:29.480> add<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.510> bit<00:03:30.690> more<00:03:30.720> yellow

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
more in the eyelid add a bit more yellow

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.630 
more in the eyelid add a bit more yellow
as<00:03:31.319> well<00:03:31.349> because<00:03:31.829> I<00:03:31.980> realize<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.280> little

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
as well because I realize that little

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.569 
as well because I realize that little
yellow<00:03:33.379> blend<00:03:34.379> it<00:03:34.530> out<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.950> bit<00:03:35.099> more<00:03:35.400> yellow

just<00:03:35.970> on<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.180> outer<00:03:36.359> edge<00:03:36.599> below<00:03:37.409> the<00:03:37.650> darkest

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
just on the outer edge below the darkest

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.250 
just on the outer edge below the darkest
part<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.370> purple

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.980 

just<00:03:45.260> using<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.620> sponge<00:03:45.800> kind<00:03:46.310> of<00:03:46.990> softener

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
just using the sponge kind of softener

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.520 
just using the sponge kind of softener
or<00:03:48.170> blend<00:03:48.800> it<00:03:48.920> out<00:03:49.040> a<00:03:49.070> little<00:03:49.220> bit<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:51.290> then

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
or blend it out a little bit and then

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.230 
or blend it out a little bit and then
again<00:03:51.800> it's<00:03:52.070> um<00:03:52.280> some<00:03:52.520> purple<00:03:52.910> this<00:03:53.030> time<00:03:53.090> I

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
again it's um some purple this time I

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.880 
again it's um some purple this time I
mix<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.630> pad<00:03:53.810> with<00:03:53.990> a<00:03:54.020> little<00:03:54.260> bit<00:03:54.380> blue<00:03:54.650> to

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
mix the pad with a little bit blue to

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.580 
mix the pad with a little bit blue to
get<00:03:54.980> a<00:03:55.040> darker<00:03:55.220> line<00:03:56.170> it's<00:03:57.170> going<00:03:57.380> to<00:03:57.440> bring

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
get a darker line it's going to bring

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:05.920 
get a darker line it's going to bring
that<00:03:57.710> out<00:04:04.030> put<00:04:05.030> a<00:04:05.060> little<00:04:05.300> bit<00:04:05.390> more<00:04:05.630> of<00:04:05.780> the

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
that out put a little bit more of the

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.140 
that out put a little bit more of the
dabs<00:04:06.680> of<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:06.980> purple<00:04:07.370> across<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:07.790> outer<00:04:07.940> edge

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
dabs of the purple across the outer edge

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.040 
dabs of the purple across the outer edge
of<00:04:08.330> the<00:04:08.420> corner<00:04:08.690> to<00:04:08.810> get<00:04:08.960> broken<00:04:09.290> capillaries

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
of the corner to get broken capillaries

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.300 
of the corner to get broken capillaries
you<00:04:12.050> decide<00:04:12.350> to<00:04:12.440> add<00:04:12.560> some<00:04:12.710> across<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:13.130> nose

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
you decide to add some across the nose

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.040 
you decide to add some across the nose
as<00:04:13.550> well<00:04:13.700> because<00:04:13.940> it's<00:04:14.180> quite<00:04:14.510> an<00:04:14.630> extreme

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
as well because it's quite an extreme

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.560 
as well because it's quite an extreme
back<00:04:15.320> I<00:04:15.500> would<00:04:15.890> likely<00:04:16.070> be<00:04:17.000> a<00:04:17.030> bit<00:04:17.150> of<00:04:17.239> bruising

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
back I would likely be a bit of bruising

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.699 
back I would likely be a bit of bruising
across<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:17.930> nose<00:04:18.110> as<00:04:18.350> well<00:04:18.730> using<00:04:19.730> the<00:04:20.709> brush

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
across the nose as well using the brush

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.590 
across the nose as well using the brush
and<00:04:22.100> then<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.460> sponge<00:04:22.730> which<00:04:23.150> both<00:04:23.360> have

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
and then the sponge which both have

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.560 
and then the sponge which both have
residues<00:04:24.440> of<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.740> colors<00:04:25.040> on<00:04:25.190> them<00:04:25.480> kind<00:04:26.480> of

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
residues of the colors on them kind of

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.240 
residues of the colors on them kind of
get<00:04:26.690> like<00:04:26.900> a<00:04:26.960> subtle<00:04:27.170> color<00:04:27.500> variation<00:04:28.070> on<00:04:28.160> the

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
get like a subtle color variation on the

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:35.080 
get like a subtle color variation on the
nose<00:04:29.620> because<00:04:30.620> that's<00:04:30.770> not<00:04:30.920> the<00:04:31.070> focus<00:04:34.090> and

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090
