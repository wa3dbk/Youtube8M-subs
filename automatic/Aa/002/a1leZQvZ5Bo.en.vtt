 all alone which are steam 100 degrees and 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.409
 the 15 minutes 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.799
 and here we go our vegetables are in 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.509
 train of cooking you are going to salt 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.460

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.439
 all the faces and you're going to grab 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.180
 in a pan or two minutes this 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.590
 phase there comes colors and I saw 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.939
 putting on a little grid he goes out 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.070
 to be deceived 1 and here we will do 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.630
 a small vinaigrette sauce a small 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.240
 little and goes very very well that feed 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.829
 so let's go 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.020
 here is a little bit of vinegar and there you 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.689
 will dissolve here do add the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.399
 mustard and you often say that the 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.530
 that we live it for that matter 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.479
 I am a little mixed herbs 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.430
 tarragon chervil chives 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.260
 finally you add cloud wanted me from a 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:02:00.550
 wrong wrong, that's what makes for me 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:03.940
 that's all added finely chop month 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.250
 by that I nod capers many 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.280
 teeth under the pickles it works 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.660
 as well 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.120
 and here we will add a little bit 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.830
 of oil like a vinaigrette have created 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.760
 a new one volume of vinegar and 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.240
 four boeing here he is and there you 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.120
 emulsify any dilution there and we will 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:36.010
 add to finish all the herbs 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:39.040
 fresh and no 4 this is indeed a 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.570
 sauce a little bit a little bit ghribli 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.310
 pampered is not there is no cooked offer but 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.930
 it's super delicious and it's going to 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.680
 serve as accompaniment with the little ones 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.180
 steamed vegetables 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:53.110
 the little beef tenderloin you'll see 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:55.680
 it's top top top here we go and here are our 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.680
 vegetables are ready 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.820
 we will check the cooking at the tip 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.070
 of a knife 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:06.660
 this is one of the super impeccable super ok 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:10.050
 and now we will put our net 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.410
 of beef in the colorful add a 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:16.520
 little time we know scented 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.520
 hockey a little trick of mill pepper 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.940
 he will give a little flower 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.350
 salt at the exit of the oven example lo 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.700
 and there we will look for temperature 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.130
 since we had our vegetables at 100 ° and 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.540
 their car at 55 degrees to keep 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.680
 really that really hub side of 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.260
 the future okay and then the vegetables 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.670
 have stayed warm it's gone on it 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.070
 just bake you go 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.620
 see it's intuitive like a smartphone 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.900
 you click on steam 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.420
 we can choose 55 degrees if you 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.240
 like cooking rather bleeding 60 ° if 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.370
 you like a point and here we go we go 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.350
 to put about 25 minutes are there 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.350
 tags and the shape of your beef tenderloin 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.510
 here we go 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.810
 here is the beef tenderloin looking towards good 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.320
 I will close the oven anyway lose 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.359
 with a powerful thing perfect we have 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.769
 just wait a little bit of 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.870
 time and a few minutes before 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.430
 tasting so that the movie rests on 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.349
 going room is very slightly all 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.770
 the action of the motor keeps the salts 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:29.810
 minerals 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.849
 we will wait a few minutes before 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.870
 taste we will taste competition this 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.110
 we did together and you will see 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.590
 so super good so it's very convenient to 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.590
 My opinion
