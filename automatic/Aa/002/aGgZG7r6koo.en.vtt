now let me tell you the difference here

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.060 
now let me tell you the difference here
is<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.600> why<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.780> preferred<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:22.830> as

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
is as to why I preferred this one as

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.640 
is as to why I preferred this one as
opposed<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> farm<00:01:24.540> raised<00:01:24.810> look<00:01:25.439> at<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
opposed to the farm raised look at the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.179 
opposed to the farm raised look at the
color<00:01:25.920> difference<00:01:26.720> this<00:01:27.720> has<00:01:28.049> more<00:01:28.290> fat<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.070> it

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
color difference this has more fat in it

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.600 
color difference this has more fat in it
the<00:01:29.369> farm<00:01:29.670> raised<00:01:30.170> salmon<00:01:31.170> than<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.070> wild

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
the farm raised salmon than the wild

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.510 
the farm raised salmon than the wild
salmon<00:01:32.909> because<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.960> wild<00:01:34.380> salmon<00:01:34.650> has<00:01:35.100> more

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
salmon because the wild salmon has more

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.929 
salmon because the wild salmon has more
water<00:01:35.939> more<00:01:36.299> ocean<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.710> roam<00:01:37.979> around<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.640> thus

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
water more ocean to roam around and thus

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.560 
water more ocean to roam around and thus
it's<00:01:39.659> leaner<00:01:40.200> with<00:01:40.619> less<00:01:40.890> fat<00:01:41.220> where<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.270> that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
it's leaner with less fat where is that

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.380 
it's leaner with less fat where is that
farm<00:01:42.960> raised<00:01:43.290> salmon<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:44.520> shucked<00:01:44.939> together

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
farm raised salmon is shucked together

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.870 
farm raised salmon is shucked together
and<00:01:45.899> whatever<00:01:46.439> they<00:01:46.649> raise<00:01:46.890> him<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:47.820> a

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
and whatever they raise him in but a

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.880 
and whatever they raise him in but a
whole<00:01:48.119> bunch<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.450> others<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:49.140> less<00:01:49.439> room<00:01:49.860> to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
whole bunch of others with less room to

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.300 
whole bunch of others with less room to
maneuver<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.820> work<00:01:51.360> off<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.899> fat<00:01:52.170> that's<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
maneuver and work off the fat that's the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.520 
maneuver and work off the fat that's the
difference<00:01:53.759> between<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.360> two<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:55.320> is

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
difference between the two and this is

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.120 
difference between the two and this is
why<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.710> prefer<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:57.659> wild<00:01:58.170> salmon<00:01:58.469> it's<00:01:58.890> more

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
why I prefer the wild salmon it's more

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.850 
why I prefer the wild salmon it's more
expensive<00:01:59.340> but<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.360> healthier<00:02:00.840> as<00:02:01.380> opposed

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
expensive but it's healthier as opposed

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.770 
expensive but it's healthier as opposed
to<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> farm<00:02:02.430> raised<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.360> look<00:02:03.540> at<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
to the farm raised and just look at the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.200 
to the farm raised and just look at the
difference<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.409> color<00:02:04.969> highlight<00:02:05.969> and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
difference in the color highlight and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.650 
difference in the color highlight and
it's<00:02:06.390> very<00:02:06.630> simple<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.350> prepare<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.979> salmon

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
it's very simple to prepare this salmon

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.790 
it's very simple to prepare this salmon
first<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.810> will<00:02:09.989> cut<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.229> up<00:02:10.470> into<00:02:10.649> small

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
first I will cut it up into small

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.190 
first I will cut it up into small
portion<00:02:11.550> sizes<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.180> then<00:02:12.569> apply<00:02:12.870> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
portion sizes and then apply the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.430 
portion sizes and then apply the
Olive<00:02:13.530> Oyl<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:14.300> lot<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.540> then<00:02:15.690> after<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.110> olive

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
Olive Oyl a lot and then after the olive

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.610 
Olive Oyl a lot and then after the olive
oil<00:02:16.620> put<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.099> lemon<00:02:17.610> pepper<00:02:18.030> seasoning<00:02:21.620> okay

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
oil put on lemon pepper seasoning okay
