kind of thing and I want to let you guys

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.240 
kind of thing and I want to let you guys
know<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.820> misconception<00:00:52.190> how<00:00:53.190> do

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
know that that is a misconception how do

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.950 
know that that is a misconception how do
I<00:00:53.370> know<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:54.239> might<00:00:54.539> have<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:54.690> been<00:00:54.840> a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.510 
I know that it might have just been a
translation<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.590> think<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.309> how<00:00:56.460> it

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
translation but I think this is how it

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.819 
translation but I think this is how it
was<00:00:56.640> supposed<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.149> when<00:00:57.840> Bartolomeo<00:00:58.559> is
