is a trail guide to teach us about trees

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.529 
is a trail guide to teach us about trees
and<00:00:22.680> why<00:00:22.949> they're<00:00:23.160> important<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:24.330> would<00:00:24.390> be

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
and why they're important that would be

all right now the beginning is a little
strenuous<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.579> lots<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.199> tree<00:00:55.199> seps<00:00:55.590> what<00:00:55.890> I

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
strenuous and lots of tree seps what I

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:05.249 
strenuous and lots of tree seps what I
call<00:00:56.309> tree<00:00:56.670> roots<00:00:56.910> death

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.170 

I'm<00:01:05.740> sure<00:01:06.039> you<00:01:06.159> guys<00:01:06.340> have<00:01:06.549> all<00:01:06.640> heard<00:01:06.939> the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
I'm sure you guys have all heard the

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.830 
I'm sure you guys have all heard the
terms<00:01:07.450> of<00:01:07.659> tree<00:01:07.960> huggers<00:01:08.439> and<00:01:08.710> I'm<00:01:09.100> a<00:01:09.130> tree<00:01:09.840> but

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
terms of tree huggers and I'm a tree but

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.690 
terms of tree huggers and I'm a tree but
you<00:01:11.380> know<00:01:11.500> what<00:01:11.710> a<00:01:11.860> better<00:01:12.159> thing

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
you know what a better thing

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.060 
you know what a better thing
trees<00:01:13.119> were<00:01:13.299> probably<00:01:13.539> like<00:01:13.810> even<00:01:14.079> more<00:01:14.229> if<00:01:14.770> we

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
trees were probably like even more if we

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.340 
trees were probably like even more if we
give<00:01:15.670> them<00:01:15.729> a<00:01:15.850> kiss<00:01:16.090> why<00:01:16.600> you<00:01:16.659> think<00:01:16.929> they

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
give them a kiss why you think they

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.679 
give them a kiss why you think they
would<00:01:17.500> like<00:01:17.619> a<00:01:17.649> slow<00:01:18.219> in<00:01:18.460> this<00:01:19.200> because<00:01:21.689> we

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
would like a slow in this because we

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.230 
would like a slow in this because we
give<00:01:22.899> them<00:01:23.200> a<00:01:23.530> carbon<00:01:24.130> arc<00:01:24.310> so<00:01:24.700> that's<00:01:24.970> what<00:01:25.119> we

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
give them a carbon arc so that's what we

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.490 
give them a carbon arc so that's what we
exhale<00:01:26.520> absolutely<00:01:27.520> they<00:01:27.880> give<00:01:28.179> us<00:01:28.500> oxygen

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
exhale absolutely they give us oxygen

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.580 
exhale absolutely they give us oxygen
and<00:01:30.250> we<00:01:30.399> give<00:01:30.759> them<00:01:30.969> some<00:01:31.929> sign<00:01:32.289> this<00:01:32.439> what

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
and we give them some sign this what

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.959 
and we give them some sign this what
we're<00:01:32.740> doing<00:01:32.920> we<00:01:33.039> will<00:01:33.189> blow<00:01:33.340> a<00:01:33.369> limit<00:01:33.759> it

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969 
we're doing we will blow a limit it

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:45.460 
we're doing we will blow a limit it
should<00:01:34.450> be<00:01:34.509> blue<00:01:34.689> I<00:01:34.719> guess

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.730 

you<00:01:46.040> guys<00:01:46.220> can<00:01:46.460> identify<00:01:46.610> trees<00:01:47.360> by<00:01:47.810> looking

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
you guys can identify trees by looking

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.220 
you guys can identify trees by looking
at<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:48.980> leaves<00:01:49.220> you<00:01:49.970> can<00:01:50.090> identify<00:01:50.300> a<00:01:50.690> tree<00:01:51.020> by

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
at the leaves you can identify a tree by

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.860 
at the leaves you can identify a tree by
looking<00:01:51.620> at<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.920> bark<00:01:52.340> by<00:01:53.150> looking<00:01:53.540> at<00:01:53.690> the

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
looking at the bark by looking at the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.220 
looking at the bark by looking at the
seed<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.650> tree<00:01:54.890> produces<00:01:55.130> like<00:01:55.930> we<00:01:56.930> need<00:01:57.080> to

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
seed the tree produces like we need to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.930 
seed the tree produces like we need to
identify<00:01:57.320> trees<00:01:58.010> sometimes<00:01:58.250> in<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.670> winter

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
identify trees sometimes in the winter

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.000 
identify trees sometimes in the winter
time<00:01:59.150> and<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.510> way<00:01:59.630> to<00:01:59.690> identify<00:01:59.900> maple<00:02:00.740> tree

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
time and the way to identify maple tree

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.940 
time and the way to identify maple tree
is<00:02:01.300> opposite<00:02:02.300> branching<00:02:02.510> most<00:02:03.320> trees<00:02:03.650> have

is opposite branching most trees have

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.030 
is opposite branching most trees have
alternate<00:02:04.910> branches<00:02:05.480> obvious<00:02:06.350> abrasion<00:02:06.920> if

branch in no time because we don't have
the<00:02:47.390> leaves

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.380 

it's<00:02:53.470> that

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.240 

when<00:02:57.990> we<00:02:58.140> find<00:02:58.380> leaves<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.890> we<00:02:58.950> don't<00:02:59.130> know

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
when we find leaves and we don't know

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.070 
when we find leaves and we don't know
what<00:02:59.400> they<00:02:59.520> are<00:02:59.700> you<00:03:00.090> can<00:03:00.270> look<00:03:00.600> in<00:03:00.870> this

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
what they are you can look in this

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.810 
what they are you can look in this
little<00:03:01.380> book<00:03:01.710> and<00:03:01.920> try<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.160> match<00:03:02.400> up<00:03:02.430> the

leaves sassafras tree is the tree that

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.700 
leaves sassafras tree is the tree that
has<00:03:05.310> three<00:03:05.700> different<00:03:05.730> shapes<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.690> leaves<00:03:07.020> and

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
has three different shapes of leaves and

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.160 
has three different shapes of leaves and
one<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:08.100> them<00:03:08.250> is<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.610> mitten<00:03:09.210> like<00:03:09.390> there's<00:03:10.020> the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
one of them is a mitten like there's the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.500 
one of them is a mitten like there's the
fruit<00:03:10.440> from<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.800> sassafras<00:03:11.490> tree<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:12.300> has<00:03:12.330> a

fruit from the sassafras tree it has a

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.090 
fruit from the sassafras tree it has a
hard<00:03:12.960> seed<00:03:13.400> enclosed<00:03:14.400> in<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.880> fruit<00:03:16.040> why<00:03:17.040> do

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
hard seed enclosed in the fruit why do

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.410 
hard seed enclosed in the fruit why do
you<00:03:17.220> guys<00:03:17.340> think<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.760> trees<00:03:18.000> are<00:03:18.210> going

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
you guys think the trees are going

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.600 
you guys think the trees are going
dormant<00:03:18.630> think<00:03:19.350> about<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.830> three<00:03:20.040> things<00:03:20.370> I

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
dormant think about the three things I

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.000 
dormant think about the three things I
said<00:03:20.670> trees<00:03:21.150> need<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:21.990> know<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.560> water

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
said trees need it you know and water

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.780 
said trees need it you know and water
you<00:03:23.850> need<00:03:24.090> water<00:03:24.330> you<00:03:24.840> need<00:03:25.530> carbon<00:03:25.980> -<00:03:26.130> they

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
you need water you need carbon - they

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.930 
you need water you need carbon - they
need<00:03:27.000> carbon<00:03:27.420> dioxide<00:03:28.230> good<00:03:28.560> one<00:03:28.830> tonight

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.280 

we're<00:03:32.940> not<00:03:33.060> getting<00:03:33.330> enough<00:03:33.540> sunlight<00:03:33.840> for

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
we're not getting enough sunlight for

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.560 
we're not getting enough sunlight for
the<00:03:34.370> photosynthesis<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.520> occur<00:03:35.580> then<00:03:36.360> they

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
the photosynthesis to occur then they

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.960 
the photosynthesis to occur then they
fall<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.260> I<00:03:37.470> think<00:03:37.770> they<00:03:37.980> give<00:03:38.730> more

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
fall and I think they give more

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.120 
fall and I think they give more
nutrients<00:03:39.570> for<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.840> trees<00:03:40.260> so<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.770> sort<00:03:41.070> of

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
nutrients for the trees so it sort of

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.490 
nutrients for the trees so it sort of
restarts<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:41.910> think<00:03:42.180> starts<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.750> gang-up<00:03:43.080> starts

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
restarts I think starts a gang-up starts

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.770 
restarts I think starts a gang-up starts
all<00:03:43.620> together<00:03:43.980> it's<00:03:44.310> spring<00:03:44.790> when<00:03:45.420> we<00:03:45.510> start

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
all together it's spring when we start

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.420 
all together it's spring when we start
getting<00:03:45.900> more<00:03:46.050> daylight<00:03:46.560> hours<00:03:47.010> starts<00:03:47.310> up

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
getting more daylight hours starts up

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.199 
getting more daylight hours starts up
again<00:03:47.520> in<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.880> spring

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
again in the spring

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.320 
again in the spring
yeah<00:03:48.680> yeah<00:03:49.680> cuz<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.010> leaves<00:03:50.220> fall<00:03:50.520> it's<00:03:51.180> like

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
yeah yeah cuz the leaves fall it's like

00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:00.530 
yeah yeah cuz the leaves fall it's like
hmm<00:03:51.830> tasty<00:03:52.830> leaves

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540
