 tv powered by baden tv 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.639
 We want to lead our series here 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.250
 start a new series 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.240
 we forgot this series concert day 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.960
 are after defeats again and again 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.140
 got up 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.220
 that has done in erfurt and 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.650
 now we want it just like that 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.480
 rise in chemnitz here at home from 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.890
 home audience a good game 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.720
 make and win 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.030
 Of course I also hope for a good one 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.949
 support I think that can 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.809
 use team 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.070
 in the far round of all parts of the 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.680
 audience I hope that the team 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.120
 this will also support the necessary 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.170
 patience ice a fierce opponent 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.699
 at chemnitz and then you can to 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.040
 opponent is a strong team 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.979
 so the team in the front midfield 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.979
 The table is both individual 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.540
 We also have the class blocked 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:59.140
 is they still expensive in 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.619
 your rows 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.089
 tino semmer or ranger are all good 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:06.580
 guys, the driver can also make gates 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.130
 a good a good team already 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.850
 in the game of play has demanded everything and it 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.430
 do it again 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.950
 I calculate here with the balanced 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.539
 game and I hope that we play this game 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.070
 bring ours to our side 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.750
 in our fight and I hope 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.859
 of course a consistent one 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.859
 over 90 minutes 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.450
 Dennis Kempe Kai Schwertfeger both 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.410
 chipped 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.150
 Dennis Kempe was at the beginning of the 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.760
 week last pulled front 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.590
 Thighs not so severe 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.620
 yes, it's just a border we 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.140
 will have to look , I think now 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.620
 last moments make him playable 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.380
 or not and kai sword-sweeper 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.520
 is also suffering from his knee problems 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.780
 Injury of the knee is also 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.340
 so he still has pain but 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.430
 possibly also so that it could go 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.820
 also that was finally early, first of all 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.820
 then experience 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.360
 thought to 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.500
 it is clear that there is no gordon 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.370
 We know that we played well 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.680
 but in the games before again and again 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.180
 have forgotten a weak phase 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.580
 but not the 20 25 games before the 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.200
 We did it very well 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.050
 have martin stoll good replacement 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.570
 now it's just the last one 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.130
 to find impressions to believe 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.080
 a golden trail back he knows he 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.220
 has made fault the why a 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.430
 ultimately knows innocent in the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.540
 team in detail after the game 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.010
 just had the feeling that 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.450
 he can process back into the track 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.590
 come 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.020
 or maybe it's better 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.610
 Advise to bring a fresh power 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.209
 with martin stoll 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.060
 yes that would think just before 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.180
 final decision then 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.320
 think on friday evening or friday morning 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.320
 who will make the decision 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.870
 my cancer has both against erfurt one 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.530
 made a good game then came out for 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.030
 Hackers had come but also again 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.880
 Munster showed that his nerves in 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.070
 handle has something to move 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.280
 accordingly, of course , so too 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.140
 Reward would then just think 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.310
 how to align that on the 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.590
 Mittelfeld the center 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.630
 what changed are more powerful ones 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.870
 has or outside that must then 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.870
 watch 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.430
 is now clear again that one the 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.430
 focus on the last games 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.230
 Once together with the team 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.550
 worked easy to recognize 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.590
 now all the emotions again 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.910
 Put in everything you have 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.010
 the team endeavors the team has 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.550
 I have to have a good character 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.710
 Clearly everyone says the team 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.570
 There is not everything for doing so 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.030
 the team gives everything the team 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.570
 does everything and now it gets easy to 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.690
 knowledge 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.980
 four games three and a half weeks and then 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.670
 it is over that is now again 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.080
 all emotions all art of playing everything 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.970
 you have everything that goes with it all 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.560
 passion you can because of there 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.530
 to put in and tried that 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.720
 team to make it clear that there now 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.840
 must come more 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:26.510
