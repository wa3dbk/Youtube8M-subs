00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 the iren on her the question domscheit 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.640
 Bergs was not easy at all 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.690
 to reach at all because they are not 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.019
 own mobile phone 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.300
 why not that too has a lot to do with it 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.670
 I do not part of this real time 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.109
 Reality I am all too much 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.789
 quickly so that it also so in this 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.710
 whole context a bit the problem 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.439
 but it is on the other side as well 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.170
 so this phone me in everything 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.760
 I also supervise and I do that 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.830
 can not escape at the moment where 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.939
 I can use this station with me for like this 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.369
 I have the nice set the other day 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.809
 read this is the most perfect bug 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.510
 ever built 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.420
 Every mobile phone is a principle of the principle 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.399
 potential room microphone that somewhere 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.010
 Anyone who is himself anyway 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.420
 access to this device 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.550
 can be activated to listen with 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.170
 what happens in this room 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.969
 that means anyone who can sit here 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.649
 theoretically without him any of it 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.840
 monitored through war at home with 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.789
 using his own phone that is in 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.500
 he did it right and he can 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.300
 be recorded because of this phone 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.809
 a camera also owns that 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.129
 right and and when i 'm around that 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.170
 to make it even worse 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.729
 a professionally organized market 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.200
 in which exactly such weak spots 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.820
 are traded so there is one 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.220
 market in which you today as 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.659
 industry spy as secret service or as 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.330
 credit cards counterfeiters or whoever 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.170
 always for money of a weak spot 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.350
 able to buy 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.000
 the one found a security man 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.920
 has and can with this weak point 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.570
 They then attack a special device 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.119
 so that means I need now also 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.950
 number from any of the sitting here 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.420
 I know them and then I can get in 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.310
 this phone is a hack so it is 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.290
 not so trivial that only the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.970
 number needs yes there are medium and 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.920
 how to do that and how soon 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.820
 someone has an interest in it 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.220
 implement 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.810
 There is no real complexity in there 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.579
 way that is then only question of it 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.950
 Whether you have some capital in your hand 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.500
 can and a bit what it is something 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.300
 For example, the front here wants the first 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.860
 row sits at home off to 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.240
 When you are sitting on the sofa, you are comfortable 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.160
 with her husband friend what also in the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.660
 talk that is relatively difficult 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.640
 but we do not talk here 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.110
 over large amounts so many 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.060
 weak spots may be in four 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.800
 or five-digit amount somehow 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.630
 so I acted that way now 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.310
 be smart will make this cell phone 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.180
 or is somehow scary 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.130
 turn off 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.480
 usually if you have an iphone 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.070
 make me lonely 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.990
 there is the battery in there you can 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.980
 also do not remove this battery and 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.630
 more and more manufacturers of mobile phones 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.130
 forbid them that in which there is no 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.380
 physical possibility gives this 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.670
 so you can remove battery 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.690
 never really mind it 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.660
 that really means that 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.180
 That is still active 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.430
 can at least be activated and that 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.200
 continues to collect data 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.580
 and the next problem is this one 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.170
 everything depends on it's back 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.120
 actually that's not him even apple 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.880
 reveals what this phone at all 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.370
 Does it scandals regularly? 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.380
 new release where is transferred 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.640
 how much information this phone 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.270
 about her behavior on apple 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.280
 forwarded 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.350
 in which they pushed some point a 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.030
 wlans booked the phone only 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.140
 has seen by no where 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.820
 they might not have been active at all 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.590
 other user data 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.060
 they are passed on to apple and 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.560
 apple makes profit in this 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.690
 sell the sell the then 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.220
 maybe also to the nsa so also 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.260
 is a market that has established itself 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.540
 that more and more governments because they are the 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.890
 can not directly get data yes 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.530
 commercial data providers 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.570
 shopping and you can hear that here already 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.250
 Murmuring in the audience because we all 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.250
 presumably the first time hears
