00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.117
The Boo in the Shoe

00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:27.033
By Kuzhali Manickavel

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:30.033
Have you ever seen Boos?

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:32.867
They are playful creatures

00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:34.367
you think you see

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:36.283
under your bed

00:00:36.283 --> 00:00:37.700
at night.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.950
Some look like

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.450
orange zebras,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.617
others like flying snails.

00:00:44.617 --> 00:00:46.367
They can tease

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:49.033
or make you sneeze -

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:50.783
they can even make

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:52.867
chocolates appear

00:00:52.867 --> 00:00:57.367
in empty pockets!

00:00:57.367 --> 00:00:59.450
Puzzle, the Boo

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.617
looked a bit

00:01:00.617 --> 00:01:02.283
like an elephant,

00:01:02.283 --> 00:01:04.117
only he was purple

00:01:04.117 --> 00:01:06.450
most of the time

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.867
and the size of a mouse.

00:01:10.867 --> 00:01:13.367
Meera stumbled upon him

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:16.617
one morning by accident.

00:01:16.617 --> 00:01:18.200
There he was,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.783
sniffing and moaning,

00:01:20.783 --> 00:01:22.033
his backside

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:27.283
firmly wedged inside her shoe.

00:01:27.283 --> 00:01:29.533
“I must be dreaming,”

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.283
she thought.

00:01:31.283 --> 00:01:32.617
She poked him

00:01:32.617 --> 00:01:35.367
to see what would happen.

00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:37.117
“Ouch!”

00:01:37.117 --> 00:01:41.200
howled Puzzle.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.700
“Oh! I’m very sorry,”

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.950
she apologized.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.033
“I’m stuck!” he bawled.

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:53.200
In fact,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.450
he had been stuck there

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.283
all night

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.700
and had given up hope

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.283
of ever getting free.

00:02:04.283 --> 00:02:06.200
Meera examined

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.117
him closely.

00:02:10.117 --> 00:02:10.950
“Let me see

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.450
if I can help,”

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.367
she said,

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:21.033
pulling him by the legs.

00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:25.617
She pushed him from behind.

00:02:25.617 --> 00:02:27.367
She even banged the shoe

00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:33.617
against the floor.

00:02:33.617 --> 00:02:35.367
“I could put you

00:02:35.367 --> 00:02:37.700
in soapy water,”

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.700
she suggested.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.783
No,

00:02:42.783 --> 00:02:44.033
Puzzle was

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:47.867
scared of bubbles.

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:48.950
“What if I poured

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.367
oil on you?”

00:02:51.367 --> 00:02:53.783
she asked.

00:02:53.783 --> 00:02:55.283
Puzzle began

00:02:55.283 --> 00:02:58.033
to squeak and sob.

00:02:58.033 --> 00:02:59.950
He certainly didn’t want oil

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:07.700
poured on him!

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.783
“I know how to stop

00:03:09.783 --> 00:03:12.117
you from crying!”

00:03:12.117 --> 00:03:16.117
Meera shouted merrily.

00:03:16.117 --> 00:03:19.950
She started to tickle Puzzle.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.117
Boos are very ticklish,

00:03:22.117 --> 00:03:23.533
and soon he was

00:03:23.533 --> 00:03:26.450
squirming and giggling.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.867
The more Meera

00:03:27.867 --> 00:03:29.950
tickled him,

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.617
the more he squirmed

00:03:32.617 --> 00:03:36.867
until suddenly...

00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:40.283
“Look! You’re unstuck!”

00:03:40.283 --> 00:03:42.867
cried Meera excitedly,

00:03:42.867 --> 00:03:44.783
clapping her hands.

00:03:44.783 --> 00:03:47.700
Puzzle blinked.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.617
He wiggled his legs.

00:03:50.617 --> 00:03:54.033
He wiggled his tail.

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:56.617
Then he wiggled his whole body,

00:03:56.617 --> 00:04:00.450
just to make sure.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.867
“Yay! I’m free!”

00:04:03.867 --> 00:04:05.367
he trumpeted

00:04:05.367 --> 00:04:10.033
as he bounced around the room.

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:12.117
He bounced onto her hand

00:04:12.117 --> 00:04:15.700
and smiled.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.367
“What would you like

00:04:17.367 --> 00:04:19.367
before I go?

00:04:19.367 --> 00:04:22.533
Chocolates?

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:27.200
Shall I make your school disappear?”

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.283
“Do you have to go?”

00:04:30.283 --> 00:04:34.617
asked Meera sadly.

00:04:34.617 --> 00:04:37.617
“I wish you could stay.

00:04:37.617 --> 00:04:42.200
We could be friends!”

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.617
Boos didn’t

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:45.450
have human friends.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.200
“That’s a great idea!”

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.117
he squeaked.

00:04:49.117 --> 00:04:51.033
“Just say

00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:53.033
‘Puzzle the Boo,

00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:55.450
I want to see you’

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.450
and I’ll come!”

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.033
“Promise?”

00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:00.700
she asked

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.283
“I promise!”

00:05:02.283 --> 00:05:03.867
winked

00:05:03.867 --> 00:05:05.533
Puzzle.

00:05:05.533 --> 00:05:07.033
The school bus

00:05:07.033 --> 00:05:09.283
honked loudly.

00:05:09.283 --> 00:05:10.367
“Okay,

00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:12.533
we’ll play after school.

00:05:12.533 --> 00:05:13.783
See you later!”

00:05:13.783 --> 00:05:15.033
she said

00:05:15.033 --> 00:05:16.200
as she

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.367
rushed outside.

00:05:18.367 --> 00:05:20.200
After school,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.367
Meera went

00:05:21.367 --> 00:05:23.867
to the garden.

00:05:23.867 --> 00:05:26.617
She shut her eyes

00:05:26.617 --> 00:05:27.783
and murmured

00:05:27.783 --> 00:05:35.200
the magic words.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.450
There was a humming sound,

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.450
and Puzzle appeared

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:46.033
in a flash!

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:47.533
They laughed

00:05:47.533 --> 00:05:50.867
and played until sunset.

00:05:50.867 --> 00:05:53.283
And from that day on,

00:05:53.283 --> 00:05:55.117
Meera and Puzzle

00:05:55.117 --> 00:05:58.283
became best friends.
