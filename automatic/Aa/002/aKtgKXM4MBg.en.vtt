00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 Hello everyone and welcome one more day to the 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.490
 your loli world channel today I bring you the 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.379
 top guayana number 5 and in number 5 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.059
 we have vinci and playing with has nothing 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.620
 of carry there we see it as good the 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.940
 enemy team is attacking the base and 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.280
 have to defend the vividor there we see 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.379
 how are all going to the attack we see how 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.449
 are finished with the first one ends with the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.039
 second that alone with the ignition ends 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.210
 also with nocturnal that was attacking 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.560
 well and this one escapes with very little life 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.420
 we see how light is entering the base 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.369
 but serious mistake you do not have you can not 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.040
 leave that you can not afford it just 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.440
 also with lux and the last one you have left 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.030
 it's three that a three against that has me 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.620
 very little to do we see how it is 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.059
 attacking basic takes away a lot 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.540
 launches the last and ends with the great 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.540
 sale here 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.350
 and number four this week we have to 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.510
 boris gonzÃ¡lez who is playing with wing 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.620
 and good guys here we have the first 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.630
 sale here that we have been sent with 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.460
 queens and the truth is pretty enough 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.960
 good with a little bit of luck but 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.370
 well let's see it below 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.170
 Here we see how his team is is 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.020
 hiding in the bushes waiting for 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.880
 that they jump and serious error does and 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.590
 so they have all the win we see 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.050
 like billy to be or nautical and 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.540
 perfect these three enemies which 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.330
 Matt makes Windows faster because 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.460
 it has caused a very high damage we see 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.810
 how the enemy team is divided and here 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.400
 and I thought we will be selling 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.770
 but serious mistake because let's see 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.270
 then a subject that is a bit clever and 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.400
 return to the team fight when you should not 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.560
 here we see how quincy spending damage just 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.050
 with wales to end with is meat give 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.729
 yes also and here we see how we 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.170
 it appeared saying I charge all of 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.720
 but it's not going to be like that 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.159
 we see how it also ends with demos going to 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.170
 It seems that you kill them thanks to 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.200
 the barrier is thrown and gets removed 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.109
 the poison and very good clip and in the number 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.670
 of times week we have here will play no 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.439
 I know how to produce the name I'm sorry and 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.319
 well we see it is a 3 against 3 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:54.619
 we see with swing many you say will be 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.969
 federated yes but good is a good thing what 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.459
 you are going to see below I will not say 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.920
 I'm not going to cover the clip here we see it 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.170
 as the day is launched by him and he says yes 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.530
 I'm going against everything going against three that 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.149
 they are a mission and brad ends with and what 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.829
 good that you have swing is that you have a 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.720
 absorption of life that is not normal and 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:14.090
 you see damage that does the damage that it recovers 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.680
 which is incredible here we see as brand 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.209
 is almost with all life and thanks to 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.670
 that recovery of life ends with the 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.670
 three makes a triple kill very good clip 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.230
 and this week's number we have to 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.760
 joselito that has sent us a piece of 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.040
 clip with caciques here we will see 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.180
 we see how it jumps for the first 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.250
 they automatically destroyed it to morgana 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.810
 we see how it appears sack what destroyed 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.490
 You are also with very few and more lives 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.290
 in the last escape he gets it 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.960
 we see how it comes in blister has said gas 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.660
 behind ends with ropes and justly 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.160
 just complete great we also see how 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.720
 will go up and neither short nor lazy will 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.520
 launches for her to kill him and perform 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.520
 a big sale kill very good clip 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:59.190
 and in number 1 this week of 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.720
 more than good fiction this clip you do not go 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.580
 to see a sale here the good in the 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.500
 previous clip that got this guy 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.210
 the number one did not show us up in 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.770
 touch and one block here or nothing for the 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.070
 style but to give us a monster like 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.170
 he showed us forgiveness how to escape when 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.370
 you're in trouble and did not show it with a 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.990
 of argan but in this case it's not going to 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.460
 demonstrate with a set and double-check 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.880
 there we see how three enemies come to 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.910
 for him 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.040
 very smart throws the last task and leaves 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.780
 the shadow attached to the wall and we see how 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.880
 will go back into the shade and throw again 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.110
 the shadows to get away and leave the 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.910
 three enemies with their mouths open 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.770
 asking where the hell this 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.300
 where he left us but good guys 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.610
 this does not stay here 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.550
 this continues there in the same game 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.680
 with the same character as is obvious is 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.960
 is going to do another of his and he's going to 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.850
 say no no to me do not get me and well 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.710
 we see it here that your team is 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.850
 groping the baron here I give him a 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.560
 little bit forward because it's pulled 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.750
 enough time around here trying the 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.570
 watch that not enter not stay 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.280
 looking and good here we see how already 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.660
 have seen what they have raised and grace 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.690
 he makes a big mistake that is so much grace 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.640
 we see how it causes a lot of damage 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.130
 jump towards him kills him back to the bush 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.590
 so hesitate in a caracas way 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.590
 incredible and chizo can not with him either 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.740
 jump to the baron ends with the baron and now 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.630
 if it was missing little ends it also gets 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.630
 you with a piece of clip yes sir 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.900
