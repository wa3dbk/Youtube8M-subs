00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
has a ton of it kind of so we do have an

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.750 
has a ton of it kind of so we do have an
event<00:04:08.099> going<00:04:08.340> on<00:04:08.489> right<00:04:08.640> now<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:11.370> weekend

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
event going on right now the weekend

event going on right now the weekend
defenders<00:04:12.150> are<00:04:12.299> saying<00:04:12.480> some<00:04:12.629> like<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:13.459> it's

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
defenders are saying some like that it's

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.099 
defenders are saying some like that it's
basically<00:04:14.819> just<00:04:15.000> Valkyrie<00:04:16.250> tangu<00:04:17.780> athena<00:04:18.780> and

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
basically just Valkyrie tangu athena and

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.810 
basically just Valkyrie tangu athena and
i<00:04:19.380> think<00:04:19.650> either<00:04:21.620> super<00:04:22.620> golds<00:04:23.130> or<00:04:23.340> super

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
i think either super golds or super

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.969 
i think either super golds or super
metal<00:04:24.200> i'm<00:04:25.200> not<00:04:25.349> sure<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:26.840> we're<00:04:27.840> getting<00:04:27.979> 10

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
metal i'm not sure and we're getting 10

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.920 
metal i'm not sure and we're getting 10
a<00:04:29.130> thousand<00:04:30.410> powell<00:04:31.410> points<00:04:31.830> every<00:04:32.729> day<00:04:32.940> for

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
a thousand powell points every day for

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.070 
a thousand powell points every day for
four<00:04:34.110> days<00:04:34.260> i<00:04:34.320> think<00:04:35.300> so<00:04:36.300> make<00:04:36.539> sure<00:04:36.570> you<00:04:36.810> save

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
four days i think so make sure you save

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.779 
four days i think so make sure you save
that<00:04:37.190> actually<00:04:38.190> it<00:04:38.250> was<00:04:38.370> all<00:04:38.490> going<00:04:38.610> to<00:04:38.699> talk

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
that actually it was all going to talk

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.939 
that actually it was all going to talk
about<00:04:38.940> now<00:04:39.180> i<00:04:39.210> think<00:04:39.330> about<00:04:39.630> it<00:04:39.750> save<00:04:40.349> that<00:04:40.380> for

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
about now i think about it save that for

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.000 
about now i think about it save that for
an<00:04:41.370> event<00:04:41.639> just<00:04:41.910> because<00:04:42.240> if<00:04:42.539> the<00:04:42.870> pallig<00:04:43.260> for

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
an event just because if the pallig for

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.379 
an event just because if the pallig for
that<00:04:44.130> event<00:04:44.599> has<00:04:45.770> a<00:04:46.770> lot<00:04:47.010> of<00:04:47.039> super<00:04:47.430> like<00:04:47.760> metal

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
that event has a lot of super like metal

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:49.909 
that event has a lot of super like metal
dragons<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:48.810> supers<00:04:49.080> and<00:04:49.110> stuff<00:04:49.410> i<00:04:49.620> say

spending the power points as soon as

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.040 
spending the power points as soon as
they<00:04:54.599> get<00:04:54.750> them<00:04:55.010> but<00:04:56.010> for<00:04:56.539> the<00:04:57.539> times<00:04:57.780> that<00:04:57.930> we

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
they get them but for the times that we

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.430 
they get them but for the times that we

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
get those like a thousand points you

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.839 
get those like a thousand points you
really<00:05:01.620> want<00:05:01.770> to<00:05:01.800> save<00:05:01.949> this<00:05:02.099> for<00:05:02.220> an<00:05:02.340> event
