truck we're going to doing a bunch of

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.829 
truck we're going to doing a bunch of
different<00:00:12.630> compartments<00:00:13.230> for<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:14.719> this<00:00:15.719> is

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
different compartments for it this is

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.420 
different compartments for it this is
going<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.020> be<00:00:16.080> real<00:00:16.199> complicated<00:00:16.619> job<00:00:17.100> there's

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
going to be real complicated job there's

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.000 
going to be real complicated job there's
a<00:00:17.490> lot<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.670> things<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:18.449> have<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.619> exclude

a lot of things that we have to exclude
which<00:00:20.520> always<00:00:20.730> makes<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.270> more<00:00:21.420> complicated

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
which always makes it more complicated

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.890 
which always makes it more complicated
as<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.850> can<00:00:24.000> see<00:00:24.150> we<00:00:24.330> are<00:00:24.359> definitely<00:00:24.720> going

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.600 
of my door which means that we cannot
fit<00:01:41.180> this<00:01:41.360> thing<00:01:41.600> inside<00:01:42.170> of<00:01:42.350> our<00:01:42.470> booth<00:01:42.680> so

posted<00:02:16.060> all<00:02:17.060> right<00:02:17.300> so<00:02:17.540> we<00:02:17.660> have<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:18.200> vehicle

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
posted all right so we have the vehicle

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.620 
posted all right so we have the vehicle
mast<00:02:19.700> off<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:21.320> appropriate<00:02:21.860> areas<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.640> want

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
mast off the appropriate areas that want

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.449 
mast off the appropriate areas that want
to<00:02:23.720> be<00:02:23.810> done<00:02:24.020> it's<00:02:24.800> actually<00:02:25.160> kind<00:02:25.340> of<00:02:25.370> a

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
to be done it's actually kind of a

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.620 
to be done it's actually kind of a
complicated<00:02:26.440> deal<00:02:27.440> because<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:28.459> lot<00:02:29.330> of<00:02:29.360> places

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
complicated deal because a lot of places

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.190 
complicated deal because a lot of places
that<00:02:30.470> need<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.160> be<00:02:31.190> excluded<00:02:31.880> versus<00:02:32.570> included

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
that need to be excluded versus included

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.650 
that need to be excluded versus included
in<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.440> spray<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.790> masking<00:02:35.269> gets<00:02:35.450> pretty

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
in the spray so the masking gets pretty

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.020 
in the spray so the masking gets pretty
complicated<00:02:35.810> but<00:02:36.500> we've<00:02:37.370> got<00:02:37.550> it<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.730> braised

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
complicated but we've got it a braised

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.630 
complicated but we've got it a braised
and<00:02:38.560> it's<00:02:39.560> pretty<00:02:39.650> much<00:02:39.800> ready<00:02:40.070> to<00:02:40.220> be<00:02:40.340> further

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
and it's pretty much ready to be further

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.509 
and it's pretty much ready to be further
masked<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.239> sprayed<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:43.040> try<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:43.250> get<00:02:43.370> to

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
masked and sprayed and try and get to

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.860 
masked and sprayed and try and get to
later<00:02:43.700> today<00:02:46.150> we<00:02:47.150> are<00:02:47.269> going<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.450> do<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.570> top

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
later today we are going to do the top

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.160 
later today we are going to do the top
this<00:02:48.110> bumper<00:02:48.820> will<00:02:49.820> be<00:02:49.940> adding<00:02:50.300> aggregate<00:02:50.900> so

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
this bumper will be adding aggregate so

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.479 
this bumper will be adding aggregate so
sand<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.160> mix<00:02:52.400> which<00:02:52.850> will<00:02:53.180> give<00:02:53.989> it<00:02:54.110> added

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
sand to the mix which will give it added

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.460 
sand to the mix which will give it added
grip<00:02:55.489> so<00:02:56.330> people<00:02:56.630> aren't<00:02:56.720> slipping<00:02:57.019> off<00:02:57.320> of

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
grip so people aren't slipping off of

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.660 
grip so people aren't slipping off of
this<00:02:57.560> that<00:02:57.769> can<00:02:57.890> be<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.040> problem<00:02:58.100> of<00:02:58.580> those

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
this that can be a problem of those

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.020 
this that can be a problem of those
bumpers<00:03:00.880> there's<00:03:01.880> doors<00:03:02.239> here<00:03:03.910> we're<00:03:04.910> going

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
bumpers there's doors here we're going

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.030 
bumpers there's doors here we're going
to<00:03:05.090> include<00:03:05.420> in<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.630> spray<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.530> we've<00:03:06.680> masked

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
to include in the spray so we've masked

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.110 
to include in the spray so we've masked
underneath<00:03:07.430> those

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.820 

we're<00:03:11.120> going<00:03:11.269> up<00:03:11.569> and<00:03:11.750> around<00:03:12.019> this<00:03:12.349> cabinet

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
we're going up and around this cabinet

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.860 
we're going up and around this cabinet
area<00:03:13.099> and<00:03:13.280> we're<00:03:13.640> doing<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.879> interior<00:03:14.540> of<00:03:14.599> it

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
area and we're doing the interior of it

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.690 
area and we're doing the interior of it
so<00:03:15.019> we'll<00:03:15.170> open<00:03:15.349> those<00:03:15.620> doors<00:03:15.650> up<00:03:16.159> and<00:03:16.430> mass

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
so we'll open those doors up and mass

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.720 
so we'll open those doors up and mass
the<00:03:16.909> insight<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:17.540> spray<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.989> floor<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.379> that

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
the insight and spray the floor of that

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.180 
the insight and spray the floor of that
so<00:03:19.730> that's<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:20.239> bit<00:03:20.390> complicated<00:03:20.540> as<00:03:21.110> well<00:03:24.190> you

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
so that's a bit complicated as well you

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.800 
so that's a bit complicated as well you
can<00:03:25.310> see<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:25.610> spray<00:03:25.849> equipment<00:03:26.030> is<00:03:26.480> just

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
can see the spray equipment is just

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.080 
can see the spray equipment is just
above<00:03:27.379> the<00:03:27.440> masking<00:03:28.099> line<00:03:28.280> so<00:03:28.519> will<00:03:28.670> mask<00:03:28.879> all

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
above the masking line so will mask all

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.449 
above the masking line so will mask all
that<00:03:29.239> off<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:29.750> exclude<00:03:30.709> that<00:03:30.860> from<00:03:31.069> the<00:03:31.190> spray

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
that off and exclude that from the spray

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.320 
that off and exclude that from the spray
of<00:03:31.489> course<00:03:32.830> gauges<00:03:33.830> and<00:03:34.010> whatnot<00:03:34.340> will<00:03:34.640> have

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
of course gauges and whatnot will have

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.059 
of course gauges and whatnot will have
to<00:03:35.480> mask<00:03:35.750> over<00:03:36.140> appropriately<00:03:38.290> so<00:03:39.290> yeah<00:03:39.860> all

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
to mask over appropriately so yeah all

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.380 
to mask over appropriately so yeah all
in<00:03:40.190> all<00:03:40.340> it's<00:03:40.909> going<00:03:41.030> to<00:03:41.090> be<00:03:41.209> an<00:03:41.299> interesting

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
in all it's going to be an interesting

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.080 
in all it's going to be an interesting
job<00:03:41.930> especially<00:03:42.579> since<00:03:43.579> it's<00:03:43.730> not<00:03:43.879> going<00:03:44.000> to

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
job especially since it's not going to

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.670 
job especially since it's not going to
fit<00:03:44.209> inside<00:03:44.390> that<00:03:44.569> door<00:03:44.959> as<00:03:45.230> i<00:03:45.349> talked<00:03:45.560> about

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
fit inside that door as i talked about

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.910 
fit inside that door as i talked about
so<00:03:46.190> we're<00:03:47.090> going<00:03:47.150> to<00:03:47.299> kind<00:03:47.510> of<00:03:47.540> fit<00:03:48.079> everything

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
so we're going to kind of fit everything

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.890 
so we're going to kind of fit everything
from<00:03:49.340> this<00:03:49.489> truck<00:03:49.760> into<00:03:49.940> that<00:03:50.239> door<00:03:50.480> as<00:03:50.660> best

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
from this truck into that door as best

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.759 
from this truck into that door as best
we<00:03:50.989> can<00:03:51.459> all<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.670> way<00:03:52.790> up<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.180> light<00:03:53.450> and

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
we can all the way up to the light and
