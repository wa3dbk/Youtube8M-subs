and this is quite spectacular to this is

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.510 
and this is quite spectacular to this is
a<00:01:27.790> stringer<00:01:28.510> type<00:01:29.290> zone<00:01:29.710> and<00:01:29.980> you<00:01:30.040> can<00:01:30.280> see

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
a stringer type zone and you can see

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.120 
a stringer type zone and you can see
that<00:01:30.550> with<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.330> bar<00:01:31.960> code<00:01:32.260> has<00:01:32.530> been<00:01:33.240> actually

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
that with the bar code has been actually

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.730 
that with the bar code has been actually
smearing<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.600> sulfides<00:01:37.600> in<00:01:37.900> through<00:01:38.200> nice

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
smearing the sulfides in through nice

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.650

gray<00:01:39.100> streaks<00:01:39.580> all<00:01:39.820> through<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:41.010> sulfides

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
gray streaks all through the sulfides

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.950 
gray streaks all through the sulfides
again<00:01:43.660> another<00:01:43.960> very<00:01:44.350> impressive<00:01:44.920> zone<00:01:45.160> and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
again another very impressive zone and

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.440 
again another very impressive zone and
this<00:01:46.960> is<00:01:47.170> getting<00:01:47.770> down<00:01:48.120> about<00:01:49.120> halfway

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
this is getting down about halfway

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.860 
this is getting down about halfway
through<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.230> the<00:01:50.830> trench

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870

the<00:01:53.110> pretty<00:01:53.710> hard<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.190> see<00:01:54.580> I<00:01:54.610> know<00:01:55.620> but<00:01:56.620> again

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
the pretty hard to see I know but again

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.090 
the pretty hard to see I know but again

this here is the end of the end of the
trench<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:11.239> can<00:03:11.419> see<00:03:11.629> we've<00:03:11.870> reached

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 
trench and you can see we've reached

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.759 
trench and you can see we've reached
where<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:12.889> water<00:03:13.840> level<00:03:14.840> is<00:03:15.019> and<00:03:15.230> from<00:03:15.409> here

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
where the water level is and from here

where the water level is and from here
the<00:03:15.829> bedrock<00:03:16.579> just<00:03:16.849> drops<00:03:17.090> right<00:03:17.239> off<00:03:17.569> so<00:03:17.840> this

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
the bedrock just drops right off so this

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.569 
the bedrock just drops right off so this
is<00:03:18.139> as<00:03:18.290> far<00:03:18.500> as<00:03:18.650> we've<00:03:18.799> been<00:03:18.919> able<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.189> trench

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
is as far as we've been able to trench

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.319

but you can see digging down even with
this<00:03:25.299> trench<00:03:26.299> down<00:03:26.569> into<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:26.989> test<00:03:27.230> hole<00:03:27.530> that

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
this trench down into the test hole that

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.209 
this trench down into the test hole that
it's<00:03:29.510> still<00:03:29.719> heavily<00:03:30.019> altered<00:03:30.349> mineralized

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:31.219 
it's still heavily altered mineralized

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:35.619 
it's still heavily altered mineralized
the<00:03:31.969> last<00:03:32.209> bucket<00:03:32.569> to<00:03:32.959> come<00:03:33.560> up<00:03:33.709> was<00:03:34.010> a<00:03:34.629> nice

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
the last bucket to come up was a nice

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.979 
the last bucket to come up was a nice
solid<00:03:35.989> chunk<00:03:36.799> of<00:03:36.949> massive<00:03:37.370> sulfide<00:03:37.849> so<00:03:38.750> this

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
solid chunk of massive sulfide so this

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.550 
solid chunk of massive sulfide so this
is<00:03:39.139> quite<00:03:39.349> spectacular<00:03:41.109> transfer<00:03:42.109> probably

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
is quite spectacular transfer probably

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:51.110 
is quite spectacular transfer probably
can't<00:03:42.769> see<00:03:42.979> much<00:03:43.129> of<00:03:43.189> their<00:03:44.060> butt

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.960 

mineral<00:03:52.120> shareholders<00:03:52.840> this<00:03:53.080> is<00:03:53.940> quite<00:03:54.940> a

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
mineral shareholders this is quite a

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.870 
mineral shareholders this is quite a
nice<00:03:55.240> discovery
