 sign up and that will help me a lot is 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.570
 always make more videos here nobody 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.229
 it's very very very heavy it will weigh 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.460
 But now that I've started recording 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.040
 show the settings here that I 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:16.340
 I'm running on full HD 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:20.690
 v5 disabled quality I put everything 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.400
 in the medium everything in the distance division is a 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.920
 tip for you is what's weighing 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.530
 very disgusting 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.600
 if you have the lowest 70 or any 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.970
 another card for you to have an idea 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.520
 agent not 70 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.680
 the new nvidia card does not have 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.870
 I have to put here the distance 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.050
 split in half 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.860
 they have a good fps I 'm placing 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.330
 here 20% sometimes I had one depending 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.860
 of the occasion 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.220
 but most of the time regiment by 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.540
 cent there I put environment the club where 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.519
 I came to the head of the field to expand there and 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.519
 I also left it on that these options 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:04.280
 here people weigh almost nothing or almost 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.620
 nothing can even activate and quietly 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.560
 and one thing that I realized is another 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.650
 tip I'll give you guys the type is 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.570
 you put null quality on the bass 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.420
 disable everything thinking that you will have a 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.120
 performance you do not go because 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.340
 When I left everything in here, everything. 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.720
 deactivated and this only for lack of 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.810
 move I do not like 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.660
 leave everything off he uses little to 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.820
 percentage of the video card here 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:37.030
 there the game to continue giving leg of 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.030
 same way catching fpf falling 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.829
 play a little here for you to see how 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.390
 is that it is running here on my pc 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:48.860
 remembering that there is the description of my pc 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.349
 there is going to be the configuration also lost 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.040
 still my pc will stay in one in the 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.040
 video description 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.069
 we protest come faster 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.069
 possible 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:23.010
 roma safari and google not only kill these 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.010
 a bug here guys 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.949
 when we take shopping 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.250
 I'm going to make a pair of coac up in 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.320
 high places that a lot of people do not 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:48.300
 to show here the fps for you as 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:52.540
 is that under the 'face' was recording 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:55.390
 open world at least easy to maintain 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.930
 O here in a 30 fps home sometimes 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:01.000
 low 28 depending on the place where the 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:09.150
 people watching and recording, too. 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.150
 consumes even more fps 26 there 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.120
 29 the graphic of this game is very much 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:23.690
 very very 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:26.460
 I was seeing in an honest face. 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.820
 I was seeing in international forums 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.920
 so that in Brazil saying that 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.380
 this game with the textures are on a high 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.770
 consuming more than 3GB of memory 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:44.160
 old video then graphic on top of 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:48.650
 deputy in mauá is for those who have 69 78 gb 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:53.660
 of memory a process of relatively 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:56.070
 good already know how it will run 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.900
 remembering that are having more trouble 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.900
 fpf drugs because I'm recording 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:22.870
 Another tip, this game is very bad. 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:24.039
 organized for those who have amd cpu 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.029
 the company said it is working 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:30.069
 to make a pad there because it looks like me 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:31.839
 I do not know, I do not know if it's true because 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:33.039
 here it appears that you are using all the 

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:35.979
 my cpu 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:39.610
 but it seems that this game is only using 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:43.089
 is using only a cpu of the amd type 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:45.759
 if you have one facing 2008 on 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:47.860
 club he will use very much in the sun and 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:51.059
 others will not have much use 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:54.399
 then we will risk the fall of fps 

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:57.789
 A friend of mine gave me the hint for how 

00:06:54.399 --> 00:07:00.219
 configure the game cpus amd where 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:04.110
 I will leave in the description of the video that 

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:06.249
 You say and if it worked, not beauty. 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:10.210
 Thanks everyone, I think it 's one more 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:12.789
 Video will stop here and hope 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:15.210
 like there starting my channel now 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:18.490
 I need your help there. 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.759
 writes of a like if possible favorite 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.759
 there 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:40.710
 and it was worth his bad performance but that goes there 

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:40.710
 Hell, it 's okay , I went there.
