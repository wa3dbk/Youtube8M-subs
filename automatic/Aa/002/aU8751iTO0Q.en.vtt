because the flatness of the back lays
against<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> table<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.250> can't<00:01:38.490> hear<00:01:38.670> it

it's<00:01:39.240> not<00:01:39.450> much<00:01:39.720> different<00:01:39.750> or<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.680> much

better but it's definitely slight and

better but it's definitely slight and
noticeable<00:01:43.259> which<00:01:43.500> makes<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.920> better<00:01:44.220> when<00:01:44.490> it

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
noticeable which makes it better when it
