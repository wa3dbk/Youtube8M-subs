00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.139
 how are you friends are you friends me wales thousand 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:15.010
 thank you, thank you for selecting 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.320
 this money today I want to present you this 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.160
 heart 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.810
 it is a heart thought many call it 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.810
 third dimension 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.100
 Y 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:33.870
 we started in this part of here 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:37.530
 is the center are 46 balloons are divided and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:42.289
 it is weaving in a triangle 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.289
 on the side of the side 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.989
 doing 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.380
 and the truth is a bit difficult 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.910
 we need a little more practice 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.190
 many times to do this kind of 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.500
 figures since many times we 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.870
 we are losing in what is this the 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.870
 country with bubble pinch bubble 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.690
 bigger things incorporating that are 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.700
 of all of the same size so that 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.980
 our heart to be deformed do not go 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.700
 sideways 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.299
 or towards the other 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.130
 and this is the result, well, I want 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.119
 share it with the dogs we have already 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.539
 done some heart tutorials and 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.429
 I wanted to share be with you 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:29.549
 what do you think does not have to be a day 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:32.369
 special to give one like this and 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.890
 soon we will have a course of 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.950
 ballooning there we will be giving 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.710
 knowing this technique which is also 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.710
 use to make numbers letters 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.970
 and remember that the preference is 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.420
 a little more distortion of balloons a 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.210
 little more than patience but what 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.690
 this heart seems in a column that 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.690
 you do 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.610
 It would be an excellent combination 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.100
