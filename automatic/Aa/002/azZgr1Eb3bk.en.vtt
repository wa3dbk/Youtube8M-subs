00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.010
 in this contribution in this further 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.650
 contribution let's analyze the 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.720
 teaching and offensive developments of the 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.550
 Juventus team 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.340
 as everyone knows Antonio's Juventus 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.590
 Count won the Scudetto interpreting 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.200
 effectively and sometimes even 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.290
 spectacular module 3 5 2 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.670
 this game system allows the 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.710
 bianconeri to dispose of the three defenders 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.770
 able both to build the band game 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.390
 inside the camp that to widen by 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.440
 exploit the width of the land of 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.989
 game 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.390
 besides these in front of the same there 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.030
 are at least three midfielders with a 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.729
 vertex step pirlo and two interiors of 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.460
 midfield with skillful marquis and vidal 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.950
 both to phrasing and then to build 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.210
 the maneuver that fits in the projection 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.490
 offensive 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.640
 the 3 5 2 world also has two 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.950
 side panels that can depending on the 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.280
 tactical context to approach the 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.920
 attackers therefore give amplitude to the 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.930
 offensive front or lower for 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.990
 facilitate the five ball round 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.670
 defenders when the tactical context is 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.470
 requires a detail here 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.650
 interesting is precisely what with the 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.350
 3 5 2 teams can take advantage of either 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.270
 the internal area of ​​the field where there are 6 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.430
 of 26 players among defenders three 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.150
 midfielders to start the 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.180
 game that widen the front of the 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.100
 maneuver lowering the midfielders 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.890
 side and then making a turn 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.860
 ball 5 this feature allows 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.280
 to teams lined up with the 3 5 2 of 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.860
 being able to manage i 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.110
 timing of the maneuver 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.500
 regardless of how the opponents 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.090
 let the juventus take the field in 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.850
 particular has a defender 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.299
 central like bonucci able to change 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.670
 quickly the front of the game and the two 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.160
 side as targets in particular 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.240
 chiellini to insert ball and chain 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.310
 when needed for 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.610
 hear midfielders to earn 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.580
 midfielders on the pitch just 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.620
 the extra weapon of the Juventus team 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.160
 we can consider the various lines 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:49.180
 marchisio and vidal deft both a 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.880
 phrase and guarantee the team the 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.570
 right speed and right playing times 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.530
 but also to fit into the area of 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.050
 finalization 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.600
 not by chance last year marchisio ha 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.740
 scored well 9 goals in the league while 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.230
 vidal has scored 7 and if we make a 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.690
 quick count of goals scored by 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.090
 midfielders and those marked by 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.640
 tips we see that more or less the same 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.190
 they are the same 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.250
 the juventus is a team capable of 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.770
 develop and develop maneuvers 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.840
 enveloping and arriving at 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.319
 conclusion through rapid combinations 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.870
 between the bridges insertions by the 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.290
 internal conclusions from outside the 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.209
 midfielders and cuts and insertions 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.900
 of the laterals 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.600
 in the images shown video we see 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:48.310
 as the team of Antonio Count prepares 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.890
 these played during training 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:55.220
 to be able to properly manage i 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.830
 rhythms and times of attack preparing the 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.690
 finishing is essential that the school gives 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.489
 sap to make a turn flaw 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.670
 clean linear defensive 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.890
 hence the players come 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.560
 stimulated in this respect to do 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.000
 so that the blade slides 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:15.760
 constantly from one side to the other of the 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.760
 field with precision and speed 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.949
 in this further series of 

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:44.519
 exercises at the three central defenders 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:48.119
 and two side midfielders yes 

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:51.239
 adds the median and the team 

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:53.459
 committed to circulating as 

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:56.099
 precedence the ball to one side 

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:58.799
 to the other of the field and in particular 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:02.309
 we can see how on the ground of 

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:04.469
 two roms come to draw themselves b 

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:07.549
 within which the players do 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:07.549
 circulate the ball 

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:22.229
 on the other front the midfielders 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:24.719
 internal the central midfielder and the 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:27.959
 tips instead develop a series of 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:30.419
 play what combinations to free ed 

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:32.879
 occupy spaces with the intent of 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:35.839
 finalize the action in the central area 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:39.719
 hence the team is divided 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:42.209
 initially in two groups a group that 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:44.399
 exercises in the ball round and a group 

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:48.029
 as you see on the video that finalizes 

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:51.300
 the action while subsequently yes 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:53.789
 they put together the various pieces of the 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.039
 proposed exercises and the team 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.969
 wish that is a simulation series 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:00.449
 in the form of matches 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:00.449
 actions 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:33.180
 in this next phase we see two 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:36.660
 teams that are in the 2nd half field 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:39.570
 deployed through a series 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.180
 of shadow actions to maintain possession 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:45.360
 of the ball with speed and speed 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.790
 taking advantage of the various diamonds and miscellaneous 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.100
 game triangles that come to 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:56.100
 create on the field to follow the 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:59.370
 exercises sees the two teams in 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:02.220
 alternate way to do the same 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:05.010
 principle of the exercise shown in 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.890
 previously, however, taking advantage of everything 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:10.830
 the size of the field with a team 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:14.310
 actively engaged and the other 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:17.610
 that acts defensively in a manner 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.830
 pass through this excitement yes 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:22.110
 train multiple streams of play in the 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:25.140
 team and if they had players a 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:27.840
 move in constantly and me 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.490
 injury to one another to make in 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:34.310
 so that the ball figures on one side 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:34.310
 he gave the head with extreme rapidity
