00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.530
 The name has to be released by the Caribbean 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.780
 vulgar is that of caravaca but in the 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:12.309
 back cover of the box that the lid 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.650
 later that is where it's going to mounted 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:18.140
 the coating between the steering wheel and the 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.000
 close system 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.000
 then retires in the caravaca 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.140
 of these screws 1 2 3 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.349
 missing 13 bad guys that go inside the 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.149
 caravaca the 13 mm 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.610
 easily identify only remove 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.230
 the screws that are on the edge 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.640
 those on the edge plus the 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.550
 exteriors that are also towards the 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.440
 edge of caravaca 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.390
 and she can remove the piece this has 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.110
 sealed with glue between retires 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.110
 we will protest 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:01:00.440
 these screws of 13 are the cane 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.960
 the wings of the adjustment shells 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.430
 for this for this piece there is a 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.979
 tool but not all 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.600
 universities have them to explain it 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.360
 you can remove it 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.710
 doing a kind of ratchet with 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.290
 two long or two screwdrivers 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.000
 long levers between point and point and 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.130
 she came out screwed 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.050
 what happens if they do not remove these two 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.450
 shells can not get the transmission to 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.460
 could not draw the spirit that 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.770
 is the center axis of these from the part of 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.530
 movements the pinions 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.680
 they remove the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.380
 remove the shells 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.480
 they remove a pin that brings the fixed train that 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.220
 is this the axis takes the fixed train that 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:45.260
 generates the movement between the motor and the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.790
 Cow box brings the part of 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.070
 in there is a pin that is with some 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.320
 tip pliers oppress it and they can 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.240
 run to the extent that they run it he goes to 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.640
 have an extra one pin in doing is 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.979
 a piece that comes striated 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.320
 they remove the pin and can now remove 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.140
 the lg takes after the shaft is removed 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.100
 you can already remove what is the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.729
 shells the transmission 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.900
 pinion adjustment within three 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.940
 fixed train that also has it 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.380
 remove brings two screws but they come in 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.270
 the inside party wait to be removed 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.670
 is 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.860
 the transmission can already access these 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.850
 two screws to remove the shaft 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.520
 taking 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.480
 to be able to remove both the axis of the train 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.940
 already can enter in matter of 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.710
 remove all that are ends remove 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.480
 this past with a boot pins remove 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.950
 this other pin with boot pins remove 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.990
 this other pin with boot pins because 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.970
 this one the reverse crazy pinion 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.670
 if you do not remove this pinion you can not take out 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.970
 nothing in the box either 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.720
 it's also exact they already remove what they are 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.340
 Pine trees 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.590
 here is another ping ping ping ping ready 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.330
 they retire these are the springs of 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.349
 adjust the box so that so that 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.530
 these projects 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:02.260
 these change pins are maintained 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.640
 in the at the point in the centers here 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.800
 where it is already oppressed is more 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.569
 difficult to vote the change if I do 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.040
 force does not vote so easy but if the 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.019
 another here comes out easily 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.799
 they at the bottom bring the 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.799
 balines 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.290
 the problem is not that they are lost 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.060
 to take it into account under 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.060
 every spring there is a sphere 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.030
 where you can continue with 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.030
 uncover the part of the fifth 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.710
 to remove the fifth then remove 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.290
 this stage with these screws remove 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.600
 this stage within this stage also 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.060
 there is another past that is the one that handles 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.070
 fifth fork that goes to who 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.130
 have to remove the brings two ends about 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.810
 Two eye pressure ring true 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.180
 then remove the interian pins 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.670
 to the past to be able to remove the part of 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.410
 the fifth after they remove the 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.390
 Fifth pinion which is the most mobile 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.510
 there are already access to other screws 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.670
 that take this stage against the head of 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.080
 box 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.670
 and after they remove those screws 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.980
 of the housing can now remove the 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.819
 fifth control and you can access 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.499
 remove all opinion and 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.150
 and to the internal piÃ±onerÃ­a this day the 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:17.630
 drives with springs on Friday with 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.709
 disorders the wedges the bronzes revise 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.780
 at a time how are the tuners 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.690
 the tuners are these pieces do not 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.430
 I know if you can record it more easily in 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.070
 what will be suddenly in this part you see 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.620
 a little better in the part to this you see 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.570
 of a color of this same golden color 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.289
 that is bronze there are two pieces if 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.150
 you dress them like an exact mentioned wheel 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.520
 there is a small one in bronze and there is another 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.500
 behind the same way if you saw her 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.300
 back is the synchronizer of the 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.240
 change that is the one that keeps the change 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.430
 always in exact traction which is in 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.650
 metal and the one that is in bronze that is the 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.660
 brake so that every time you go to 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.419
 insert a change is synchronize the box 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.120
 so that the changes do not sound and those 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:03.080
 visits that is next to that of the 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.930
 golden is the synchronizer this yes and the 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.400
 bronze the gold is the bronze so that 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.160
 the box slows down every time you go to 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.070
 send a change that bronze what it does 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.340
 is to brake him 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.470
 pinion the target pinion of the change in 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.510
 it slows it down so that the synchronizer 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.370
 square and not in the change 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.610
 that's why when you do not sometimes in panties 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.560
 well that the bed does not reach exactly if not 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.390
 reaches for the box well for more than you 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.730
 you want the bronze not enough to stop it 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.780
 because in the box like you in panties 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.780
 the house loses speed 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.300
 I not think I should leave because the same 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:44.789
 your 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:48.270
 here is this hairpin works from this 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:50.249
 way if she works here she brings a 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.919
 army here to the top that handles all 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:56.539
 the changes yes but when you go to 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.539
 put in it works in this way 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:11.060
 I give them that type and as for what 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.060
 take into account 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.210
 yes at least go and look to see what I 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.870
 it's necessary to buy to leave it there is a 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.870
 repairing
