00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.930
 Baldacci 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.720
 well it him everyone is 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.340
 risky cost I hope you go 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.630
 all very well friends and today 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.769
 we find ourselves for a new video 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.619
 with a little bit of gameplay 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:23.710
 multiplayer of call of duty black ops 3 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.210
 which of course comes 2 3 by no match 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.400
 so here I am I thought if I take 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.749
 gameplay on this black of troy as much 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.189
 take to Americans like that there is a 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:31.779
 little bit of luck anyway that you 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.500
 have not seen this gameplay already 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.270
 on Youtube 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.440
 so I think I was proposing you 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.520
 from time to time little gameplay on 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.990
 black ops 3 when I'm doing little 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.850
 topics and that's because you have to know 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.020
 that I play too much at call of duty and 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.310
 so I say bah these are all 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.780
 to make a little gameplay just 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.090
 to start talking to you a little bit 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.620
 of my first impressions and also of 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.330
 know exactly yours in the 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.920
 comments so here for now 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.690
 I told myself at the beginning I 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.820
 not hide that I do not even have code 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.660
 beta j I was not interested anymore 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.160
 all the news 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.050
 for me call of duty it was a small 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.250
 little dead somehow you see me I 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.630
 play more so I could gameplay that's 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.800
 for that I wish I could 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.900
 from time to time here are some used 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.189
 gameplay black ops 3 it could be 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.500
 nice here is an adventure 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.020
 or so on on just one 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.130
 debate where a subject and so well here's for 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.180
 what is the gameplay one is a little 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.170
 little pincer scared and me if it's 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.550
 really what interests me is for 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.270
 that I was a little bit to see on the 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.240
 paving chain 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.950
 it's really the sniper and I find 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.090
 that frankly it is not bad 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.920
 it's not bad at all and I would love 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.170
 to know a little bit your opinions because 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.580
 that frankly at first as I said 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.720
 I was not interested anymore because I 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.130
 I was told that call of duty was a 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.990
 little bit dead I told myself that this 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.120
 black ops 3 how did it go with the 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.370
 always this futuristic spirit etc 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.290
 I told myself it's going to go too far and 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.150
 in the end in the end not at all what they 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.340
 have done is that simply it's 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.110
 a black ops 2 but really spent on 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.909
 next gen a black as of sea in 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.490
 improve my really has that feeling 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.990
 just by seeing a little gameplay we have 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.400
 this feeling that we are on a call of 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.130
 Duty you see then when we play I 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.990
 think it's the same as it is 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.190
 sees a simple and gameplay shows us 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.210
 that of course we are a call of duty 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.729
 see it's really not like on 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.840
 advance warfare and we see we have this little 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.549
 side me I really find anyway 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.590
 as for the sniper I do not have too much 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.929
 alarm gameplay view for a friend 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.069
 to be or an assault rifle but in any 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.599
 case when it comes to saiper I find 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.760
 it is much like that of 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.709
 black ops 2 and like I loved bo 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.269
 well here I am inevitably I think that bach 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.800
 to the three women interested so good 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.700
 before saying it's a game 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.830
 exceptional etc 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.910
 I'm waiting to maybe be able to play it 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.930
 a little bit so unfortunately I have 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.160
 no beta I did not get too 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.569
 interested all this I have not followed too much 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.190
 the news somehow 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.660
 but that's why not paris games 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.830
 week when to test at a friend I 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.840
 do not know I do not know how I 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.860
 I'm going to do it, but that's it 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.000
 I'm still waiting to see it's 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.620
 only first pictures 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.790
 but what we can see is 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.530
 also in lan in the game is not 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.489
 completely finished as if from 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.079
 what we can see frankly he has 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.019
 looks interesting he looks nice I 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.760
 think he will not disappoint us 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.780
 shown'art we never disappointed 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.400
 finally for me anyway 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.510
 personally to take can have 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.930
 all a different opinion 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.010
 in short, it's already the end of this 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.420
 little video I wanted to give you a 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.920
 little bit but my first impressions 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.810
 on precisely this is the first 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.980
 gameplay that can be seen on youtube and 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.599
 you propose one that you do not have 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.810
 maybe never seen sniper in 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.310
 any case and so here it is for me 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.110
 I will try to get a code 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.220
 beta as soon as possible because good I think 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.680
 that you know all this but he goes there 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.940
 have a beta on ps4 xbox choice and 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.400
 it is then with a little bit of advanced 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.290
 I believe on ps4 in August so this is the 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.819
 early August I finally believe me I would be 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.049
 not there so I send back when I can 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.250
 what to test right away I would be even 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.910
 on my arm I think you are 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.380
 as numerous 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.940
 it's a shame that they take it out 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.920
 really at the moment when in general the 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.599
 people go on vacation but that's it for 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.790
 really to really give me an opinion 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.560
 a little more complete because here we go 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.870
 to say that it's my opinion I give it to you 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.150
 had after some gameplay view times 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.040
 few images while ben here is a 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.959
 notice it is done anyway 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.950
 deepen a little the thing you see good 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.269
 I think there are some who have a 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.500
 little bit followed the news that 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.450
 maybe a lot more videos 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.069
 we can make an opinion with here 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.840
 the different impressions of youtuber 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.700
 or anything he could see from 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.709
 anyway the cottier youtuber speaks 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.959
 who will tell you the things he had there 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.310
 the 3 you know very well if its clause 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.989
 was not called on a call of duty 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.910
 see then you're going to watch a video more 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.220
 you will be able to give you a little notice 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.470
 more precise will brief me mine and 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.299
 would not lend very developed finally short 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.040
 anyway I hope in fact this 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.660
 little video you will have liked we get 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.410
 will find again very soon on my 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.640
 Youtube channel 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.760
 big kisses had risked lecce in 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.760
 all
