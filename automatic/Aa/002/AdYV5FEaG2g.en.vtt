now<00:00:00.599> we<00:00:00.659> want<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.110> talk<00:00:01.319> about<00:00:01.939> the<00:00:02.939> shoulder

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
now we want to talk about the shoulder

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.340 
now we want to talk about the shoulder
the<00:00:03.870> shoulder<00:00:04.160> is<00:00:05.160> by<00:00:05.670> far<00:00:06.170> the<00:00:07.170> most

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
the shoulder is by far the most

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.720 
the shoulder is by far the most
complicated<00:00:07.859> joints<00:00:08.490> in<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:10.349> body<00:00:10.730> because

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
complicated joints in the body because

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.890 
complicated joints in the body because
the<00:00:12.240> shoulder<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:13.290> such<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.679> shallow<00:00:14.099> joint<00:00:14.900> it

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
the shoulder is such a shallow joint it

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.540 
the shoulder is such a shallow joint it
allows<00:00:16.199> us<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.470> have<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.770> tremendous<00:00:17.039> range

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
allows us to have a tremendous range

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.240 
allows us to have a tremendous range
motion<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.390> but<00:00:18.630> being<00:00:19.410> shallow<00:00:19.770> it

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
motion in it but being shallow it

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.060 
motion in it but being shallow it
doesn't<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.300> stability<00:00:21.710> say<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
doesn't have the stability say that the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.019 
doesn't have the stability say that the
hip<00:00:23.250> joint<00:00:23.550> nice<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.689> shoulders<00:00:25.730> tend<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.849> have

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
hip joint nice so shoulders tend to have

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.560 
hip joint nice so shoulders tend to have
a<00:00:27.060> lot<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.599> problems<00:00:28.080> there<00:00:29.039> are<00:00:29.070> many<00:00:30.000> many

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
a lot of problems there are many many

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.220 
a lot of problems there are many many
different<00:00:30.900> kinds<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.800> shoulder<00:00:32.730> ailments<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
different kinds of shoulder ailments the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.220 
different kinds of shoulder ailments the
most<00:00:34.530> common<00:00:35.100> one<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.820> will<00:00:36.059> see<00:00:36.390> is

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
most common one that you will see is

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.860 
most common one that you will see is
called<00:00:37.500> frozen<00:00:38.309> shoulder<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.450> frozen

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
called frozen shoulder the frozen

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.979 
called frozen shoulder the frozen
shoulder<00:00:40.050> can<00:00:40.379> mean<00:00:40.559> many<00:00:41.100> many<00:00:41.280> things<00:00:41.989> one

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
shoulder can mean many many things one

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.750 
shoulder can mean many many things one
of<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.200> main<00:00:43.440> things<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:43.980> can<00:00:44.219> mean<00:00:44.399> is

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
of the main things that can mean is

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.389 
of the main things that can mean is
something<00:00:45.059> called<00:00:45.480> adhesive<00:00:46.440> capsulitis

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
something called adhesive capsulitis

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.420 
something called adhesive capsulitis
there's<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.969> capsule<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.170> surrounds<00:00:49.649> every

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
there's a capsule that surrounds every

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.930 
there's a capsule that surrounds every
joint

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
joint

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.270 
joint
however<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.110> shoulder<00:00:52.590> it's<00:00:52.770> particularly

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
however the shoulder it's particularly

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.380 
however the shoulder it's particularly
delicate<00:00:54.379> it's<00:00:55.379> supposed<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:56.070> about<00:00:56.390> that

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
delicate it's supposed to be about that

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.000 
delicate it's supposed to be about that
thick<00:00:57.829> okay<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.420> when<00:01:00.420> people<00:01:01.010> get

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
thick okay and when people get

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.299 
thick okay and when people get
inflammation<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.390> joint<00:01:04.019> capsule<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:05.100> can

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
inflammation of the joint capsule it can

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.910 
inflammation of the joint capsule it can
get<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.909> thing<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.990> when<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.560> gets<00:01:07.650> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
get to that thing and when it gets to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.429 
get to that thing and when it gets to
this<00:01:08.070> thickness<00:01:08.630> you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.659> imagine<00:01:10.320> that

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
this thickness you can imagine that

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.899 
this thickness you can imagine that
there<00:01:10.650> isn't<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.950> whole<00:01:11.130> lot<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.369> movement<00:01:11.850> in

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
there isn't a whole lot of movement in

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.260 
there isn't a whole lot of movement in
the<00:01:12.030> shoulder<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.540> becomes<00:01:12.900> frozen<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.920> that's

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
the shoulder it becomes frozen so that's

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.880 
the shoulder it becomes frozen so that's
one<00:01:16.100> shoulder<00:01:17.100> addition<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.360> do

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
one shoulder addition that we have to do

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.720 
one shoulder addition that we have to do
why<00:01:19.890> does<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.280> joint<00:01:20.580> capsule<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.150> heaven

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
why does the joint capsule in heaven

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.930 
why does the joint capsule in heaven
the<00:01:22.210> question<00:01:22.600> right<00:01:23.640> usually<00:01:24.640> it's<00:01:24.790> because

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
the question right usually it's because

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.390 
the question right usually it's because
of<00:01:25.450> something<00:01:25.860> biomechanically<00:01:26.860> wrong<00:01:27.070> in

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
of something biomechanically wrong in

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.640 
of something biomechanically wrong in
the<00:01:27.520> joint<00:01:27.900> instead<00:01:28.900> of<00:01:29.020> fitting<00:01:29.320> properly

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
the joint instead of fitting properly

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.940 
the joint instead of fitting properly
into<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:30.460> glenoid<00:01:31.210> fossa<00:01:31.660> the<00:01:32.260> head<00:01:32.740> of<00:01:32.830> the

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
into the glenoid fossa the head of the

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.890 
into the glenoid fossa the head of the
humerus<00:01:33.250> can<00:01:33.520> go<00:01:33.700> up<00:01:33.760> on<00:01:33.940> this<00:01:34.120> angle<00:01:34.390> or<00:01:34.660> that

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
humerus can go up on this angle or that

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.500 
humerus can go up on this angle or that
angle<00:01:35.380> maybe<00:01:35.650> it's<00:01:35.860> too<00:01:36.070> jammed<00:01:36.430> in<00:01:36.760> there<00:01:37.360> are

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
angle maybe it's too jammed in there are

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.170 
angle maybe it's too jammed in there are
many<00:01:38.050> many<00:01:38.590> reasons<00:01:38.680> why<00:01:39.250> to<00:01:39.310> do<00:01:39.730> that<00:01:39.940> but

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
many many reasons why to do that but

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.290 
many many reasons why to do that but
once<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.600> starts<00:01:40.990> to<00:01:41.110> do<00:01:41.350> that<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:42.670> starts<00:01:42.850> to

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
once it starts to do that it starts to

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.540 
once it starts to do that it starts to
rub<00:01:43.600> on<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.050> specific<00:01:44.710> part<00:01:45.010> of<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.250> joint

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
rub on a specific part of the joint

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.480 
rub on a specific part of the joint
capsule<00:01:46.150> and<00:01:47.080> instead<00:01:47.530> of<00:01:47.650> gliding<00:01:48.190> that<00:01:48.400> the

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
capsule and instead of gliding that the

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.510 
capsule and instead of gliding that the
joint<00:01:48.730> capsule<00:01:49.560> friction<00:01:50.560> builds<00:01:50.740> up<00:01:51.130> and

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
joint capsule friction builds up and

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.880 
joint capsule friction builds up and
when<00:01:51.670> friction<00:01:51.910> builds<00:01:52.240> up<00:01:52.570> all<00:01:53.110> that<00:01:53.440> bubbly

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
when friction builds up all that bubbly

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.340 
when friction builds up all that bubbly
lubricant<00:01:54.490> fits<00:01:54.880> in<00:01:55.150> there<00:01:55.360> between<00:01:56.050> the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
lubricant fits in there between the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.110 
lubricant fits in there between the
fractional<00:01:56.800> layers<00:01:57.040> and<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.490> capsule<00:01:58.000> and

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
fractional layers and the capsule and

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.860 
fractional layers and the capsule and
whatnot<00:01:58.510> starts<00:01:59.290> to<00:01:59.440> become<00:01:59.590> sticky<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.870> thus

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
whatnot starts to become sticky and thus

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.080 
whatnot starts to become sticky and thus
it's<00:02:02.080> called<00:02:02.320> adhesive<00:02:02.830> capsulitis<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
it's called adhesive capsulitis the

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.450 
it's called adhesive capsulitis the
other<00:02:04.270> very<00:02:05.260> important<00:02:05.830> issue<00:02:06.010> with<00:02:06.310> the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
other very important issue with the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.960 
other very important issue with the
shoulder

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
shoulder

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.720 
shoulder
well<00:02:07.450> two<00:02:07.660> more<00:02:07.900> that<00:02:08.080> are<00:02:08.140> great<00:02:08.500> one<00:02:09.160> is

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:09.730 
well two more that are great one is

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.300 
well two more that are great one is
called<00:02:10.260> impingement<00:02:11.260> syndrome<00:02:11.350> so

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
called impingement syndrome so

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.840 
called impingement syndrome so
impingement<00:02:12.940> syndrome<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:14.640> classically<00:02:15.640> when

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
impingement syndrome is classically when

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.130 
impingement syndrome is classically when
somebody<00:02:16.480> tries<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.840> add<00:02:17.350> up<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:17.890> shoulder

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
somebody tries to add up the shoulder

genetically some people have a tendency

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.190 
genetically some people have a tendency
to<00:02:42.220> have<00:02:42.850> their<00:02:44.580> acromion<00:02:45.580> process<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:46.840> too

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
to have their acromion process is too

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.060 
to have their acromion process is too
big<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.800> it<00:02:47.890> slopes<00:02:48.340> down<00:02:48.489> and<00:02:49.480> where<00:02:49.810> the

the chromium and the clavicles there's a

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.110 
the chromium and the clavicles there's a
little<00:02:56.980> bit<00:02:57.100> now<00:02:57.280> in<00:02:57.490> there<00:02:57.670> where<00:02:57.850> it<00:02:57.910> passes

little bit now in there where it passes

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.140 
little bit now in there where it passes
through<00:02:58.480> into<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.230> humerus<00:02:59.700> that<00:03:00.700> can<00:03:00.970> now

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
through into the humerus that can now

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.390 
through into the humerus that can now
becomes<00:03:01.690> constricted<00:03:02.440> from<00:03:02.740> the<00:03:02.890> bone<00:03:03.100> growth

becomes constricted from the bone growth

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.290 
becomes constricted from the bone growth
and<00:03:04.770> if<00:03:05.770> that<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.430> case<00:03:07.470> sometimes<00:03:09.300> manual

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
and if that is the case sometimes manual

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.480 
and if that is the case sometimes manual
therapy<00:03:10.840> is<00:03:10.930> helpful<00:03:11.740> but<00:03:12.520> in<00:03:12.940> severe<00:03:13.750> cases

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
therapy is helpful but in severe cases

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.220 
therapy is helpful but in severe cases
surgery<00:03:15.490> is<00:03:15.730> requirement<00:03:16.240> and<00:03:16.600> it's<00:03:16.720> what<00:03:16.960> is

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
surgery is requirement and it's what is

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.770 
surgery is requirement and it's what is
the<00:03:17.260> most<00:03:17.560> common<00:03:17.770> shoulder<00:03:18.190> surgery<00:03:19.120> the

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
the most common shoulder surgery the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.560 
the most common shoulder surgery the
third<00:03:20.650> thing<00:03:20.920> that<00:03:20.980> I<00:03:21.160> see<00:03:21.520> very<00:03:22.210> commonly

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
third thing that I see very commonly

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.180 
third thing that I see very commonly
with<00:03:23.080> shoulders<00:03:23.500> is<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:25.590> long<00:03:26.590> head<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.010> the

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
with shoulders is the long head of the

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.530 
with shoulders is the long head of the
biceps<00:03:28.050> coming<00:03:29.050> out<00:03:29.200> of<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.440> groove<00:03:29.830> and

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
biceps coming out of the groove and

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.760 
biceps coming out of the groove and
moving<00:03:31.540> over<00:03:31.810> toward<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.110> short<00:03:32.440> head<00:03:32.650> of<00:03:32.680> the

moving over toward the short head of the

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.500 
moving over toward the short head of the
bicep<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:35.580> is<00:03:36.580> commonly<00:03:37.180> called

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
bicep and that is commonly called

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.400 
bicep and that is commonly called
bicipital<00:03:38.170> tendonitis<00:03:39.130> it<00:03:39.880> happens<00:03:40.410> usually

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
bicipital tendonitis it happens usually

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.960 
bicipital tendonitis it happens usually
from<00:03:41.950> lifting<00:03:42.400> something<00:03:42.700> too<00:03:43.060> heavy<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:44.970> the

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
from lifting something too heavy and the

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.410 
from lifting something too heavy and the
short<00:03:46.690> head<00:03:46.870> of<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.020> bicep<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:47.800> pulled<00:03:48.160> the

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
short head of the bicep and pulled the

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.750 
short head of the bicep and pulled the
long<00:03:49.420> head<00:03:49.720> of<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.870> bicep<00:03:50.410> towards<00:03:50.860> itself

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
long head of the bicep towards itself

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.780 
long head of the bicep towards itself
okay<00:03:52.540> and<00:03:53.200> pop<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.740> long<00:03:53.920> head<00:03:54.190> of<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.310> bicep

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
okay and pop the long head of the bicep

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.090 
okay and pop the long head of the bicep
out<00:03:54.970> of<00:03:55.180> its<00:03:55.330> groove<00:03:55.630> then<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.680> long<00:03:56.860> head<00:03:57.070> of

out of its groove then the long head of

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.979 
out of its groove then the long head of
the<00:03:57.220> bicep<00:03:57.730> instead<00:03:58.150> of<00:03:58.270> being<00:03:58.480> in<00:03:58.630> a<00:03:58.720> nice

comfortable groove is rubbing against

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.280 
comfortable groove is rubbing against
the<00:04:02.830> humerus<00:04:03.489> and<00:04:03.870> that's<00:04:04.870> what<00:04:05.080> causes

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
the humerus and that's what causes

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.760 
the humerus and that's what causes
bicycle<00:04:06.100> tendonitis
