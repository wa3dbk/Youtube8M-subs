00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.040

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.360

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.730
 We talked about how you say working the house. 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.830
 how to get a girl out of the way and 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.050
 keep everything in its proper place with 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.660
 much more productivity today we go 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.630
 talk about how to do house cleaning 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.189
 in a more organized way and not 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.699
 stop being reached 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.699
 come on 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.370
 A good way for you is to achieve 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.420
 keep your home clean and 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.879
 organized 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.409
 Are you leaving over the weeks all 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.269
 cleaning activities 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.089
 so nothing is more than you are 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.519
 fractionate your cleaning routine will 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.219
 do everything at once on Saturday 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.379
 much with your saturday already from china 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.420
 Are you going to do it during the week? 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.420
 will assign everything you would do in the 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.100
 Saturday over 5 or if you prefer 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.590
 six days a week 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.840
 It will not take you more than 15 minutes to 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.819
 It's true that it takes you 15 minutes to 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.700
 do these tasks you doing a 

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:20.509
 little every day you will be less 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.490
 weary 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.990
 You'll be able to take advantage of the end of 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.380
 without a full day's 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.690
 and you receive that visit from 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.490
 last minute you will be able to receive 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.119
 visits without fear of the house being 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.080
 dirty 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.909
 It's a suggestion, for example, are you? 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.009
 divide your home environments by 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.890
 amount of weeks you have 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.149
 available to be able to do this cleaning 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.579
 fractional then if you have five 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.369
 environments you already know that you will 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.180
 clean is an environment for each day of 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.710
 week 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.600
 It's along our videos that I 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.820
 I have given some other suggestions that 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.210
 make sense of this division of tasks 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.079
 but today is double is a show only tip in 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.969
 two 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.750
 to help in this mission for you too 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:11.180
 spent a lot of time there doing the cleaning 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.730
 and we have a very large list and 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.799
 lose lose focus child calls 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.140
 phone rings we will get to 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.549
 Mobile message is there for us 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.380
 will see a social network when I saw 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.609
 people are standing there cleaning people 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.620
 did not have a clean 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.630
 so the very good tip we use 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.230
 for everything not only for cargo cleaning 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.799
 but also for other tasks including 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.780
 company is you use a stopwatch 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:38.420
 This time, this is my number. 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.220
 Kitchen, I look at everything I need to remember. 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.709
 connected without class today puts the number of 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.880
 professionals is necessary to make a good 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.890
 cup 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.860
 provide and need to clean 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.640
 fast or take care of something 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.340
 of the House 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.770
 I put him to work also 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.550
 probability of losing focus is well 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.440
 smaller 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.560
 you will still lose focus at the beginning 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.300
 it is certainly an adaptation phase but 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.160
 the trend if this happens decreases 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.110
 much because we are seeing a 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.820
 commitment and all that people 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.980
 established a commitment to 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.810
 possibility to run away 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.330
 since we have to do in the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.900
 our house is much smaller as is the 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.030
 cake 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.010
 You're not going to go out to the bakery with 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.870
 a cake in the oven goes or at least not 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.820
 Should you put the name to? 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.190
 to run you have to stay try yourself 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.440
 good to spend that time that will come back to 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.660
 studying here he's going to burn is not 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.850
 different from this house cleaning routine 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.840
 you are committing yourself by placing the 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.610
 your stop watch your team from the phone 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.980
 or anything else 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.960
 the property you lose focus is well 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.960
 and you will do it within that 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.510
 I suggest 15 minutes for you not to 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.650
 get tired because your routine 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.870
 probably already well run by the 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.180
 rhythm of life that we take more than 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.920
 15 minutes to leave a little tired and 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.290
 it would be difficult for you to find in your routine 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.340
 so I suggest you make 15 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.980
 minutes per day 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.850
 Okay, so put your name on it . 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.950
 to function 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.410
 place your notebook to work and 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.020
 distribute your business throughout the week 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.670
 and then of course you come back here for me 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.820
 tell us what you think of this idea ok 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.360
 good is this people until the third video a 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.360
 kiss
