00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.030
 the one that happens is that it's worth I'm tricolor and 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.790
 well here we are in another tutorial 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.740
 minecraft and good this time as you see in 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.300
 the title today in the intro 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.610
 how to make a crop of whatever 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.000
 be at your charge and good wheat what is it 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.590
 that at the moment we can do and with how 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.990
 you see with automatic collection and you see that 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.090
 activated the mechanism if the water is there 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.250
 but good is one thing I wanted to say 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.440
 so that it does not go like that on the sides and 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.870
 go up instead of giving one of 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.820
 then we give two and that's it but 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.710
 now he reads us gays because when 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.170
 let's start more when I explain it to you 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.839
 I will tell you there so that you do not commit 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.550
 same mistake that I do not go like and some 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:48.739
 they stay on top of the rocks is that 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.270
 we have to put and it is not what 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.200
 we look for vale 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.730
 so let's see more or less how I am 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.440
 the mechanism and from behind but we're going 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.970
 teaches us enough and to perform 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.640
 the next tutorial then we need 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.440
 a little reddish stone water pistons 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.140
 normal 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.790
 stone pebble whatever and good a 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.890
 pick a shovel to facilitate the 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.110
 work is basically not for anything else 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.060
 and good is what we have to do is and 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.530
 placing five blocks with a block of 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.410
 separation each 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.360
 there you see that I have four and I would miss 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.410
 one there you always see with a block of 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.390
 separation 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.800
 You see how to get there and what all 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.470
 we have to do is make three columns 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.450
 well three we have to do all five 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.619
 that we put with three tall is worth three 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.390
 height blocks 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.970
 there you see how I'm going to fill it is 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.070
 very important that three blocks of 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.950
 height there you see how all the 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.250
 columns pillars which are three of 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.610
 height 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.950
 and well you see how it is becoming more or 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.620
 less similar is taking shape and 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.750
 we put one there one on the right just 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.610
 on this side because it's basically for the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.250
 water so that it does not seep through 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.170
 so now we have to unite all 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.640
 the pillars on top placing that 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.380
 hollow that we had left at the beginning 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.229
 but only above below not only 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.940
 there and as you can see there I make a face 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.310
 pretty big that I was a little bit 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.980
 stuck I say good what happened and it turns out 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.050
 that it was not necessary to place the 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.390
 pebble so we disassembled so not 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.400
 you had done well if you had not 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.140
 started then we remove it or we do not 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.550
 nothing simply before that there is 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.010
 go placing the pistons in that 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.720
 position looking up there like 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.120
 you see in the little holes we had 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.739
 left before and behind each python or 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.290
 in front we are making a hole 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.880
 well ahead it's worth and it's staying 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.850
 pretty good and in that game we've 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.830
 done then we put the rest in stone 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.410
 reddish as you want to call it is worth so 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.209
 we join everyone from behind and in the block 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.450
 of the medium right in the middle because we get 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.459
 one 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.140
 a rest is better 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.060
 and that we have taken for you 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.680
 we put a small lever there 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.290
 we see how the mechanism works for 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.540
 everything is going perfectly and we have to 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.340
 now place in that in that position the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.310
 pistons are worth there you see how it is 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.920
 pretty simple to the best 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.900
 or it costs but it's not worth it now 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.120
 fill the holes in the top 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.130
 up but only the rivals still 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.420
 they have to be in the blocks of 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.730
 half like that with nothing 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.180
 that's where the water is going to go there 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.220
 You see how it is staying in the circuit 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.920
 you see that it is quite simple and now in 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.930
 the middle then we are taking two towards 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.910
 backwards or forwards as you wish 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.590
 good depends on our position is worth 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.360
 we are taking two and now we are going back to 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.160
 unite vale there is see that is enough 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.390
 simple just watching the video you can 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.690
 do we do not need me 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.940
 but good nothing happens here I tell you 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.650
 I comment and I always say this is worth now 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.780
 from the front, then in the 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.910
 blocks that are not sad because we are going 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.110
 doing we are going we can do it of 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.940
 the 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.890
 of the length that we want but here yes 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.959
 I'm going to tell you that we need to do it 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.180
 two tall is worth so that we are not 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.769
 filter and let's go up 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.750
 Now we have to do as a small 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.700
 way that's where they're going to go all 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.129
 the 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.140
 all seeds and wheats other things 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.489
 that we are going to place is simply is 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.609
 there because that's where the 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.620
 water and now, as you see 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.359
 you have to place the water right behind in 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.250
 the first piston but not the second one 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.750
 you see there behind you have to place the 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.729
 water and if it would not come out very 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.180
 important this must be placed in the 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.190
 from behind and there we see how 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.530
 before there was water now we removed it and 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.639
 you see how it works perfectly so 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.789
 we would only miss 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:41.009
 Well, I do not know what it's called in this way 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.780
 of earth when you hit it with wings like this 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.999
 I do not want to say one thing that is not 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.430
 but good we prepare the earth for 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:50.310
 put seeds there as you see then 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:54.479
 we will have to put it below or if 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.950
 you want on top of the pebbles 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:00.370
 we could put 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.710
 plates I think they are called cobb them 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.240
 I say complete stone not like that 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.560
 we could put water over there so 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.260
 would happen what happened to me that also 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.530
 It was another quite important face but 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.330
 leaving nothing good and my fails because 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.760
 I hope that you get enough 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.320
 well better than me because because 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.840
 it's true that I got a little bad but 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.090
 well just that I wanted you 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.610
 you stayed with the mechanism and how it goes 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.200
 this and one is nothing nothing else on my part 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.090
 so far the tutorial I hope that you 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.520
 has served that works for you and that 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.380
 it came out better than me and nothing nothing like 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.330
 I say nothing else on my part the action has 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.460
 liked and charisma tutorials news 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.710
