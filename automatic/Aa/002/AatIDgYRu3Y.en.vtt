figured a lot of you guys probably
haven't<00:00:40.140> even<00:00:40.260> played<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.800> map<00:00:40.980> enrolled<00:00:41.370> at

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
haven't even played this map enrolled at

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
haven't even played this map enrolled at
war<00:00:41.610> since<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.360> game<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.690> old<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.079> without

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
war since that game is so old so without

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.470 
war since that game is so old so without
further<00:00:43.320> ado<00:00:43.730> let's<00:00:44.730> get<00:00:44.910> into<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.270> now

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
further ado let's get into it now

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.840 
further ado let's get into it now
starting<00:00:46.200> off<00:00:46.289> here<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.219> top<00:00:47.579> mid

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
starting off here this is the top mid

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.549 
starting off here this is the top mid
part<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> map<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.170> what<00:00:49.289> kind<00:00:49.500> of

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
part of the map and this is what kind of

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.930 
part of the map and this is what kind of
separates<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.190> map<00:00:50.370> into<00:00:50.579> four<00:00:50.760> quadrants

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
separates the map into four quadrants

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.850 
separates the map into four quadrants
there's<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.510> spot<00:00:51.750> over<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:51.989> there's<00:00:52.649> this

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
there's a spot over here there's this

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.439 
there's a spot over here there's this
side<00:00:53.129> there's<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.760> others<00:00:54.000> phone<00:00:54.210> over<00:00:54.420> there

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
side there's the others phone over there

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.720 
side there's the others phone over there
and<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:55.199> there's<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.469> side<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.430> know

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
and then there's that side so I know

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.310 
and then there's that side so I know
this<00:00:56.879> thing<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.120> obviously<00:00:57.570> pretty<00:00:57.780> important

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
this thing is obviously pretty important

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.810 
this thing is obviously pretty important
and<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.890> most<00:00:59.010> people<00:00:59.309> know<00:00:59.370> about<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> two

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
and in most people know about the two

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.000 
and in most people know about the two
main<00:01:00.030> ways<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.359> get<00:01:00.449> up<00:01:00.570> onto<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.989> one<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.469> by

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
main ways to get up onto it one is by

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.410 
main ways to get up onto it one is by
hopping<00:01:02.219> up<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.550> top<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.730> these<00:01:02.910> crates<00:01:03.239> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
hopping up on top of these crates and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.210 
hopping up on top of these crates and
hopping<00:01:03.690> up<00:01:03.780> from<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.080> bond<00:01:04.350> or<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> spot

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
hopping up from this bond or on the spot

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.740 
hopping up from this bond or on the spot
on<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.460> other<00:01:05.610> side<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> map<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.600> hop

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
on the other side of the map you can hop

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.420 
on the other side of the map you can hop
up<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.110> generator<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.799> then<00:01:08.130> hop<00:01:08.280> up

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
up on this generator and then hop up

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.740 
up on this generator and then hop up
again<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.850> everybody<00:01:09.210> knows<00:01:09.240> about<00:01:09.390> those

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
again so everybody knows about those

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.450 
again so everybody knows about those
those<00:01:09.960> are<00:01:09.990> pretty<00:01:10.170> obvious<00:01:10.380> now<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.280> less

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
those are pretty obvious now the less

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.130 
those are pretty obvious now the less
obvious<00:01:11.880> ways<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.180> getting<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.450> here<00:01:12.659> or<00:01:12.810> in

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
obvious ways of getting up here or in

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.050 
obvious ways of getting up here or in
each<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.619> these<00:01:13.799> cubby<00:01:14.220> holes<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.670> every

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
each of these cubby holes so every

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.609 
each of these cubby holes so every
single<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.509> these<00:01:15.630> cubby<00:01:15.990> holes<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.590> are

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
single one of these cubby holes that are

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.620 
single one of these cubby holes that are
in<00:01:16.770> each<00:01:16.920> corner<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:18.060> middle<00:01:18.390> part<00:01:18.540> of

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
in each corner of this middle part of

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.060 
in each corner of this middle part of
the<00:01:18.720> map<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.470> hop<00:01:19.560> up<00:01:19.619> like<00:01:19.890> this

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
the map you can just hop up like this

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.980 
the map you can just hop up like this
and<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:20.670> hop<00:01:20.820> up<00:01:20.970> again<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.420> that's<00:01:21.600> super

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and then hop up again and that's super

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.539 
and then hop up again and that's super
super<00:01:22.290> easy<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.710> if<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.860> find<00:01:23.040> yourself<00:01:23.189> in

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
super easy so if you find yourself in

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.969 
super easy so if you find yourself in
that<00:01:23.700> area<00:01:24.060> or<00:01:24.390> even<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.080> are<00:01:25.200> even<00:01:25.560> if

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
that area or even if you are even if

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.920 
that area or even if you are even if
you're<00:01:26.130> outside<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:27.180> out<00:01:27.360> here<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.810> can

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
you're outside like out here you can

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.780 
you're outside like out here you can
just<00:01:27.990> hop<00:01:28.200> up<00:01:28.259> hop<00:01:28.619> up<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.400> then

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
just hop up hop up like that and then

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.890 
just hop up hop up like that and then
you're<00:01:29.909> going<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.150> good<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.479> you're<00:01:30.750> up

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
you're going to be good to go you're up

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.660 
you're going to be good to go you're up
top<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.619> could<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.159> pretty<00:01:32.280> useful<00:01:32.490> now

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
top so that could be pretty useful now

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.249 
top so that could be pretty useful now
also<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.420> get<00:01:33.509> up<00:01:33.600> top<00:01:33.780> from<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.049> middle

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
also you can get up top from the middle

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.990 
also you can get up top from the middle
to<00:01:34.290> maps<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.799> one<00:01:35.220> way<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.579> do<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.729> is

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
to maps so one way you can do this is

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.310 
to maps so one way you can do this is
just<00:01:36.030> by<00:01:36.270> hopping<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.720> generator<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
just by hopping on this generator and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.780 
just by hopping on this generator and
then<00:01:37.439> hopping<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.130> boom<00:01:38.310> you're<00:01:38.430> up<00:01:38.549> here

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
then hopping up and boom you're up here

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.580 
then hopping up and boom you're up here
then<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.299> can<00:01:39.329> also<00:01:39.570> hop<00:01:39.900> up<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.350> half

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
then you can also hop up on this half

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.350 
then you can also hop up on this half
wall<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.490> you're<00:01:41.549> up<00:01:41.700> or<00:01:41.880> if<00:01:42.270> you

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
wall like this and you're up or if you

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.030 
wall like this and you're up or if you
went<00:01:42.479> off<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.840> side<00:01:42.899> hop<00:01:43.619> up<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:43.920> this

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
went off to this side hop up on this

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.340 
went off to this side hop up on this
half<00:01:44.250> wall<00:01:44.490> turn<00:01:44.880> around<00:01:45.210> jump<00:01:45.720> across<00:01:45.899> there

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
half wall turn around jump across there

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.410 
half wall turn around jump across there
you<00:01:46.470> go<00:01:46.590> you're<00:01:46.890> up<00:01:47.009> top<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.579> those<00:01:48.030> are<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
you go you're up top so those are the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.179 
you go you're up top so those are the
primary<00:01:48.869> ways<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.200> get<00:01:49.290> up<00:01:49.409> top<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.890> just<00:01:50.040> you

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
primary ways to get up top and just you

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.069 
primary ways to get up top and just you
know<00:01:50.280> kind<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.820> cheat<00:01:51.390> around<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.780> know<00:01:51.869> if

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
know kind of I cheat around you know if

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.389 
know kind of I cheat around you know if
somebody's<00:01:52.530> trying<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.770> take<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> flag<00:01:53.220> and

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
somebody's trying to take a flag and

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.770 
somebody's trying to take a flag and
running<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.880> side<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.180> map<00:01:54.390> you

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
running it on that side of the map you

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.660 
running it on that side of the map you
can<00:01:54.869> hop<00:01:55.020> up<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:55.979> run<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> class<00:01:56.369> and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
can hop up like this we run a class and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.760 
can hop up like this we run a class and
boom<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.540> can<00:01:57.659> attack<00:01:57.930> them<00:01:58.110> rather<00:01:58.649> than

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
boom you can attack them rather than

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.830 
boom you can attack them rather than
having<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.520> run<00:01:59.729> all<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.240> way<00:02:00.270> around<00:02:00.479> like

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
having to run all the way around like

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.209 
having to run all the way around like
this<00:02:01.049> you're<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.530> ground<00:02:01.680> floor<00:02:01.950> you

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
this you're on the ground floor you

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.139 
this you're on the ground floor you
aren't<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.579> don't<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.850> good<00:02:03.000> line<00:02:03.119> of

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
aren't you don't have a good line of

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.550 
aren't you don't have a good line of
sight<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.630> they're<00:02:03.780> probably<00:02:03.930> already<00:02:04.259> past

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
sight and they're probably already past

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.319 
sight and they're probably already past
you<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.070> that's<00:02:05.640> just<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.939> quick<00:02:05.969> way<00:02:06.299> to

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
you so that's just a quick way to

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.930 
you so that's just a quick way to
traverse<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.049> map<00:02:07.229> now<00:02:07.469> moving<00:02:08.459> on<00:02:08.700> let's

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
traverse the map now moving on let's

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.400 
traverse the map now moving on let's
just<00:02:09.209> let's<00:02:09.690> move<00:02:09.810> our<00:02:09.959> way<00:02:10.080> around<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
just let's move our way around the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.630 
just let's move our way around the
outside<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.920> map<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.220> cover<00:02:11.340> everything

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
outside of the map and cover everything

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.040 
outside of the map and cover everything
that<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.940> know<00:02:12.000> because<00:02:12.510> there<00:02:12.690> are<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> lot<00:02:13.020> of

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
that I know because there are a lot of

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.610 
that I know because there are a lot of
good

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
good

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.199 
good
lots<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:13.980> different<00:02:14.549> ways<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.670> take<00:02:15.000> cover

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
lots and different ways to take cover

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.149 
lots and different ways to take cover
and<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:16.260> have<00:02:16.379> the<00:02:16.470> advantage<00:02:16.769> over<00:02:16.830> enemies

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
and and have the advantage over enemies

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.009 
and and have the advantage over enemies
so<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.549> one<00:02:17.940> is<00:02:18.090> right<00:02:18.360> here<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.750> can<00:02:18.870> hop<00:02:18.989> up

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
so a one is right here you can hop up

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.720 
so a one is right here you can hop up
right<00:02:19.379> like<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.069> then<00:02:20.159> crouch<00:02:20.400> down<00:02:20.670> and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
right like this and then crouch down and

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.309 
right like this and then crouch down and
you<00:02:21.030> can<00:02:21.150> see<00:02:21.390> over<00:02:21.659> this<00:02:21.780> way<00:02:22.019> you<00:02:22.080> know<00:02:22.170> if

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
you can see over this way you know if

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.750 
you can see over this way you know if
enemies<00:02:22.620> are<00:02:22.739> running<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.010> flag<00:02:23.250> or<00:02:23.489> trying<00:02:23.700> to

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
enemies are running a flag or trying to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.339 
enemies are running a flag or trying to
capture<00:02:23.909> your<00:02:24.090> domination<00:02:24.450> point<00:02:24.840> or<00:02:25.019> you

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
capture your domination point or you

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.509 
capture your domination point or you
know<00:02:25.440> doing<00:02:25.620> whatever<00:02:25.830> they<00:02:26.069> have<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.220> do<00:02:26.400> this

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
know doing whatever they have to do this

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.610 
know doing whatever they have to do this
is<00:02:26.610> just<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.819> good<00:02:27.000> defensive<00:02:27.450> spot<00:02:27.750> if<00:02:27.959> you

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
is just a good defensive spot if you

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.960 
is just a good defensive spot if you
think<00:02:28.769> enemies<00:02:29.129> are<00:02:29.159> to<00:02:29.340> be<00:02:29.430> coming<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:29.760> way

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
think enemies are to be coming this way

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.910 
think enemies are to be coming this way
now<00:02:30.239> i'm<00:02:30.629> moving<00:02:30.900> on<00:02:30.959> over<00:02:31.200> here<00:02:31.470> there's<00:02:31.829> a

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
now i'm moving on over here there's a

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.410 
now i'm moving on over here there's a
really<00:02:32.159> good<00:02:32.370> spot<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.640> jump<00:02:32.909> over<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:33.180> half

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
really good spot to jump over this half

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.710 
anything if you think they're coming
from<00:03:47.459> this<00:03:47.639> side<00:03:47.699> what<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.120> can<00:03:48.239> do<00:03:48.299> is<00:03:48.419> hop<00:03:48.540> up

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
from this side what you can do is hop up

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.420 
from this side what you can do is hop up
on<00:03:48.900> these<00:03:49.139> like<00:03:49.440> this<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.859> I<00:03:49.919> just<00:03:50.190> messed

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
on these like this and I just messed

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.890 
on these like this and I just messed
that<00:03:50.579> up<00:03:50.639> I<00:03:50.819> do<00:03:50.879> that<00:03:51.060> all<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.299> time<00:03:51.510> be

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
that up I do that all the time be

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.930 
that up I do that all the time be
careful<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.799> you<00:03:52.919> don't<00:03:53.129> double<00:03:53.609> mantle

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
careful that you don't double mantle

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.759 
careful that you don't double mantle
this<00:03:54.090> but<00:03:54.690> anyway<00:03:55.139> you<00:03:55.199> hop<00:03:55.440> up<00:03:55.470> on<00:03:55.739> the

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
this but anyway you hop up on the

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.319 
this but anyway you hop up on the
sandbags<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.430> have<00:03:56.519> a<00:03:56.579> perfect<00:03:56.790> line<00:03:57.180> of

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
sandbags and you have a perfect line of

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.659 
sandbags and you have a perfect line of
sight<00:03:57.510> with<00:03:57.540> some<00:03:57.959> cover<00:03:58.169> over<00:03:58.919> this<00:03:59.370> thing

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
sight with some cover over this thing

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:00.949 
sight with some cover over this thing
right<00:03:59.879> here<00:03:59.910> so<00:04:00.299> that's<00:04:00.449> pretty<00:04:00.660> good<00:04:00.810> and

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
right here so that's pretty good and

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.210 
right here so that's pretty good and
then<00:04:01.049> also<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:01.440> can<00:04:01.560> do<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.739> same<00:04:01.919> thing<00:04:02.099> from

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
then also you can do the same thing from

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.740 
then also you can do the same thing from
the<00:04:02.340> other<00:04:02.519> side<00:04:02.790> if<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.480> think<00:04:03.660> they're

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
the other side if you think they're

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.059 
the other side if you think they're
going<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:03.959> be<00:04:04.019> coming<00:04:04.109> from<00:04:04.260> over<00:04:04.560> here<00:04:04.590> so

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
going to be coming from over here so

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.189 
going to be coming from over here so
that<00:04:05.549> can<00:04:05.669> be<00:04:05.730> pretty<00:04:05.970> useful<00:04:06.060> now<00:04:06.449> moving<00:04:07.049> on

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
that can be pretty useful now moving on

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.500 
that can be pretty useful now moving on
over<00:04:07.379> here<00:04:07.590> this<00:04:08.160> is<00:04:08.430> a<00:04:08.459> very<00:04:08.879> very<00:04:09.150> very<00:04:09.269> good

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
over here this is a very very very good

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.390 
over here this is a very very very good
spot<00:04:09.930> if<00:04:10.079> you're<00:04:10.139> trying<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.650> push<00:04:10.889> this<00:04:11.129> spawn

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
spot if you're trying to push this spawn

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.920 
spot if you're trying to push this spawn
so<00:04:11.639> let's<00:04:11.819> say<00:04:11.970> you're<00:04:12.150> in<00:04:12.209> an<00:04:12.299> objective<00:04:12.449> mode

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
so let's say you're in an objective mode

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.180 
so let's say you're in an objective mode
you<00:04:13.049> know<00:04:13.109> whatever<00:04:13.379> you<00:04:13.410> want<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.620> do<00:04:13.739> you're

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
you know whatever you want to do you're

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.740 
you know whatever you want to do you're
pushing<00:04:14.609> this<00:04:14.730> way<00:04:14.970> you<00:04:15.389> want<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.599> get<00:04:15.690> an

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
pushing this way you want to get an

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.659 
pushing this way you want to get an
enemy<00:04:15.959> team<00:04:16.109> spawn<00:04:16.410> run<00:04:17.039> around<00:04:17.310> this<00:04:17.400> corner

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
enemy team spawn run around this corner

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.250 
enemy team spawn run around this corner
and<00:04:17.910> usually<00:04:18.329> you<00:04:18.449> can<00:04:18.599> get<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.810> here<00:04:19.079> without

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
and usually you can get to here without

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.620 
and usually you can get to here without
being<00:04:19.650> seen<00:04:19.889> now<00:04:20.160> once<00:04:20.669> you're<00:04:20.849> here<00:04:21.150> rather

than running through this doorway which
is<00:04:23.400> very<00:04:23.640> obvious<00:04:23.849> where<00:04:24.180> everybody's<00:04:24.510> going

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
is very obvious where everybody's going

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.860 
is very obvious where everybody's going
to<00:04:24.719> see

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870

just as obvious what you can do is you

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.310 
just as obvious what you can do is you
can<00:04:29.940> hop<00:04:30.210> up<00:04:30.240> on<00:04:30.479> this<00:04:30.600> little<00:04:30.900> wall<00:04:31.080> right

and then finally we're back here over
towards<00:05:38.760> the<00:05:38.789> spawn<00:05:39.030> we<00:05:39.210> restarted<00:05:39.660> so<00:05:40.200> that

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
towards the spawn we restarted so that

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.050 
towards the spawn we restarted so that
completes<00:05:40.860> our<00:05:41.130> entire<00:05:41.400> loop<00:05:41.610> there's<00:05:41.789> one

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
completes our entire loop there's one

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.100 
completes our entire loop there's one
last<00:05:42.210> thing<00:05:42.389> we'll<00:05:42.599> show<00:05:42.720> you<00:05:42.750> guys<00:05:42.870> more

last thing we'll show you guys more

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.480 
last thing we'll show you guys more
towards<00:05:43.410> the<00:05:43.500> middle<00:05:43.680> the<00:05:43.800> map<00:05:43.919> that's<00:05:44.070> very

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
towards the middle the map that's very

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.980 
towards the middle the map that's very
useful<00:05:44.820> especially<00:05:45.120> at<00:05:45.479> the<00:05:45.570> start<00:05:45.630> of<00:05:45.900> the

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
useful especially at the start of the

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.690 
useful especially at the start of the
match<00:05:46.139> when<00:05:46.710> you're<00:05:46.830> first<00:05:47.039> rushing<00:05:47.550> you<00:05:47.610> know

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
match when you're first rushing you know

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.800 
match when you're first rushing you know
if<00:05:47.789> it's<00:05:47.910> search<00:05:48.120> and<00:05:48.210> destroy<00:05:48.330> or<00:05:48.570> something

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
if it's search and destroy or something

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.300 
if it's search and destroy or something
where<00:05:48.930> your<00:05:49.050> life<00:05:49.200> really<00:05:49.380> matters<00:05:49.770> what<00:05:50.190> you

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
where your life really matters what you

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.219 
where your life really matters what you
can<00:05:50.400> do<00:05:50.490> is<00:05:50.580> if<00:05:50.700> you<00:05:50.880> spawn<00:05:51.120> over<00:05:51.330> here<00:05:51.510> run

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
can do is if you spawn over here run

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.200 
can do is if you spawn over here run
through<00:05:52.560> here<00:05:52.889> and<00:05:53.070> get<00:05:53.580> to<00:05:53.699> this<00:05:53.820> area<00:05:54.090> and

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
through here and get to this area and

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.430 
through here and get to this area and
this<00:05:54.300> is<00:05:54.419> another<00:05:54.630> building<00:05:55.110> where<00:05:55.229> you<00:05:55.320> know

this is another building where you know
usually<00:05:55.650> they<00:05:55.949> won't<00:05:56.160> see<00:05:56.370> you<00:05:56.520> once<00:05:56.729> you<00:05:56.880> get

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
usually they won't see you once you get

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.879 
usually they won't see you once you get
to<00:05:57.090> this<00:05:57.270> point<00:05:57.539> and<00:05:57.780> rather<00:05:58.530> than<00:05:58.740> just
