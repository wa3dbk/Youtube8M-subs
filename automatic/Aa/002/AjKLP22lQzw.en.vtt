00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
it really to me I didn't really feel

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.270 
it really to me I didn't really feel
nothing<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.360> much<00:00:34.880> no<00:00:35.880> difference<00:00:36.360> really

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
nothing that much no difference really

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.270 
nothing that much no difference really
it's<00:00:38.280> made<00:00:38.899> from<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.960> good<00:00:40.200> material<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.950> mean

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
it's made from a good material I mean

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.100 
it's made from a good material I mean
they<00:00:41.520> don't<00:00:41.700> seem<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.030> they'll<00:00:42.210> rip<00:00:42.480> easy<00:00:42.719> so

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
they don't seem like they'll rip easy so

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.380 
they don't seem like they'll rip easy so
that's<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.350> good<00:00:43.500> benefit<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.280> really<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
that's a good benefit I really like the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.299 
that's a good benefit I really like the
Nike<00:00:45.570> symbol<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> top<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:49.190> they<00:00:50.190> have

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
Nike symbol up in the top and they have

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.880 
Nike symbol up in the top and they have
the<00:00:50.489> flat<00:00:50.700> downs<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.750> some<00:00:52.050> signature<00:00:52.649> stuff

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
the flat downs like some signature stuff

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.540 
the flat downs like some signature stuff
like<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.280> one<00:00:53.399> says<00:00:53.610> go<00:00:53.910> hard<00:00:55.250> speed<00:00:56.250> kills

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.439 
like that one says go hard speed kills
and<00:00:57.199> then<00:00:58.199> go<00:00:58.500> hard<00:00:58.770> again<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.250> they<00:01:00.210> also

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
and then go hard again and they also

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.149 
and then go hard again and they also
have<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.410> vapor<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.430> top<00:01:02.960> inside<00:01:04.159> they

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
have the vapor in the top inside they

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.940 
have the vapor in the top inside they
appear<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.299> two<00:01:06.780> layer<00:01:06.990> sock<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.740> they<00:01:07.890> are

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
appear as a two layer sock but they are

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.490 
appear as a two layer sock but they are
really<00:01:08.280> actually<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:09.000> one<00:01:09.420> layer<00:01:11.030> yeah<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:13.110> I

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
really actually a one layer yeah so I

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.320 
really actually a one layer yeah so I
guess<00:01:14.100> they<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:14.580> want<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> give<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.180> that

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
guess they just want to give you that

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.280 
guess they just want to give you that
look<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.840> it's<00:01:15.990> not<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.380> two<00:01:16.530> layer<00:01:17.030> now<00:01:18.290> they

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
look so it's not the two layer now they

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.260 
look so it's not the two layer now they
do<00:01:19.350> seem<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.890> get<00:01:20.159> dirty<00:01:20.549> really<00:01:20.820> easy<00:01:21.090> like

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
spots even though watching them a couple

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.069 
spots even though watching them a couple
times<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.820> still<00:01:27.000> doesn't<00:01:27.210> go<00:01:27.450> away<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079

most people do I just keep them folded
like<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.470> just<00:01:37.470> because<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:37.890> them<00:01:38.009> flat

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
sure what that is exactly for probably

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.360 
sure what that is exactly for probably
for<00:02:11.090> making<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.180> go

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
for making it go

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.850 
for making it go
making<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.150> laterally<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:14.900> I<00:02:15.260> could<00:02:15.500> Bend<00:02:15.680> that

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
making it laterally so I could Bend that

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.790 
making it laterally so I could Bend that
way<00:02:17.650> there's<00:02:18.650> very<00:02:19.430> little<00:02:19.730> cushioned<00:02:20.450> on<00:02:20.800> the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
way there's very little cushioned on the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.009 
way there's very little cushioned on the
foot<00:02:22.519> part<00:02:22.790> itself<00:02:25.030> what<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.060> did<00:02:26.390> notice<00:02:26.629> why

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
foot part itself what I did notice why

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.039 
foot part itself what I did notice why
these<00:02:27.440> are<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.680> first<00:02:27.920> pairs<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:28.340> got<00:02:28.519> and<00:02:29.049> the

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
these are the first pairs I got and the

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.229 
these are the first pairs I got and the
stitching<00:02:30.500> on<00:02:30.620> inside<00:02:31.040> was<00:02:31.310> horrible<00:02:31.760> like<00:02:32.060> my

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
stitching on inside was horrible like my

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.570 
stitching on inside was horrible like my
toes<00:02:32.480> kept<00:02:32.780> catching<00:02:32.989> on<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.430> was<00:02:34.549> very

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
toes kept catching on it so I was very

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.229 
toes kept catching on it so I was very
disappointed<00:02:35.000> with<00:02:35.629> that<00:02:35.920> but<00:02:36.920> on<00:02:37.129> the<00:02:37.239> two

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
disappointed with that but on the two

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.900 
disappointed with that but on the two
right<00:02:38.450> here<00:02:38.830> they<00:02:39.830> didn't<00:02:40.370> have<00:02:40.489> that<00:02:40.580> problem

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
right here they didn't have that problem

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.210 
right here they didn't have that problem
so<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.090> guess<00:02:41.269> they<00:02:41.450> fixed<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.220> another

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
so I guess they fixed that and another

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.839 
so I guess they fixed that and another
problem<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.849> have<00:02:44.060> is<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.380> stitching<00:02:46.010> or

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
problem I have is that the stitching or

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.580 
problem I have is that the stitching or
not<00:02:47.150> stitching<00:02:47.510> but<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.049> thing<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.410> makes

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
not stitching but the thing that makes

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.050 
not stitching but the thing that makes
is<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.769> sock<00:02:49.160> stretch<00:02:49.610> is<00:02:49.970> coming<00:02:50.900> out<00:02:51.110> and

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
is the sock stretch is coming out and

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.390 
is the sock stretch is coming out and
like<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:53.959> just<00:02:54.200> makes<00:02:54.410> it<00:02:54.530> look<00:02:54.680> bad<00:02:54.980> so

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
like that just makes it look bad so

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.949 
like that just makes it look bad so
these<00:02:56.030> ones<00:02:56.180> haven't<00:02:56.540> done<00:02:56.660> it<00:02:56.780> yet<00:02:56.930> because

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
these ones haven't done it yet because

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.000 
these ones haven't done it yet because
these<00:02:57.230> ones<00:02:57.410> are<00:02:57.620> newer<00:02:57.940> ones<00:02:58.940> but<00:02:59.890> yeah<00:03:00.890> this

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
these ones are newer ones but yeah this

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.699 
these ones are newer ones but yeah this
is<00:03:01.190> really<00:03:01.310> making<00:03:01.670> me<00:03:01.790> mad<00:03:03.970> these<00:03:04.970> are<00:03:05.209> not

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
is really making me mad these are not

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.960 
is really making me mad these are not
exactly<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.799> same<00:03:06.980> as<00:03:08.950> these<00:03:09.950> socks<00:03:10.310> I<00:03:10.700> don't

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
exactly the same as these socks I don't

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.460 
exactly the same as these socks I don't
remember<00:03:11.150> what<00:03:11.420> they're<00:03:11.599> called<00:03:11.959> I<00:03:12.230> think

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
remember what they're called I think

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.369 
remember what they're called I think
they're<00:03:12.680> just<00:03:13.060> not<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.269> vapors<00:03:14.750> but<00:03:15.079> they're

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
they're just not the vapors but they're

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.949 
they're just not the vapors but they're
that<00:03:15.560> just<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:15.950> football<00:03:16.190> eat<00:03:16.610> now<00:03:17.540> these<00:03:17.720> do

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
that just the football eat now these do

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.890 
that just the football eat now these do
not<00:03:18.200> have<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.590> Achilles<00:03:19.579> protection<00:03:20.269> but

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
not have the Achilles protection but

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.690 
not have the Achilles protection but
they<00:03:21.019> do<00:03:21.079> have<00:03:21.410> more<00:03:21.709> padding<00:03:22.160> on<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.459> foot

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
they do have more padding on the foot

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.839 
they do have more padding on the foot
area<00:03:23.230> it's<00:03:24.230> a<00:03:24.380> little<00:03:25.540> it's<00:03:26.540> more<00:03:27.849> compressed

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
area it's a little it's more compressed

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.250 
area it's a little it's more compressed
in<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.090> middle<00:03:29.450> here<00:03:29.769> than<00:03:30.769> these<00:03:31.160> socks<00:03:32.260> they

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
in the middle here than these socks they

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.319 
in the middle here than these socks they
are<00:03:33.410> a<00:03:33.440> lot<00:03:33.650> softer<00:03:33.940> they<00:03:34.940> have<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.150> same

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
are a lot softer they have the same

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.970 
are a lot softer they have the same
design<00:03:35.660> to<00:03:35.870> know<00:03:35.989> that<00:03:36.230> that's<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.739> football

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
design to know that that's the football

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.610 
design to know that that's the football
elite<00:03:37.609> symbol<00:03:39.880> another<00:03:40.880> some<00:03:41.239> thing<00:03:41.750> the

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
elite symbol another some thing the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.059 
elite symbol another some thing the
saying<00:03:43.280> on<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.579> front<00:03:44.260> beat<00:03:45.260> balances<00:03:45.769> beast

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
saying on the front beat balances beast

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.650 
saying on the front beat balances beast
and<00:03:46.370> I<00:03:46.760> think<00:03:47.060> there's<00:03:47.209> about<00:03:47.329> four<00:03:47.630> different

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
and I think there's about four different

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.530 
and I think there's about four different
sayings<00:03:48.310> correct<00:03:49.310> me<00:03:49.430> if<00:03:49.519> I'm<00:03:49.639> wrong<00:03:49.669> three<00:03:50.419> or

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
sayings correct me if I'm wrong three or

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.750 
sayings correct me if I'm wrong three or
four<00:03:50.720> or<00:03:50.870> something<00:03:51.200> like<00:03:51.290> that

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
four or something like that

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.280 
four or something like that
they're<00:03:52.760> both<00:03:52.940> dry<00:03:53.239> fit<00:03:53.480> socks<00:03:53.750> so<00:03:54.049> that's<00:03:54.200> a

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
they're both dry fit socks so that's a

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.520 
they're both dry fit socks so that's a
good<00:03:54.440> thing<00:03:54.500> and<00:03:55.060> these<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.900> white<00:03:57.079> ones<00:03:57.319> get

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
good thing and these the white ones get

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.000 
good thing and these the white ones get
really<00:03:57.950> dirty<00:03:58.190> easily<00:03:58.819> and<00:03:59.349> the<00:04:00.349> dirt<00:04:00.620> won't

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
really dirty easily and the dirt won't

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.300 
really dirty easily and the dirt won't
come<00:04:01.280> out<00:04:01.400> on<00:04:01.639> here<00:04:01.880> so<00:04:02.510> you<00:04:02.900> see<00:04:02.980> like<00:04:03.980> it's<00:04:04.190> a
