00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
quite a lot but I did the tutorial as

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.950 
quite a lot but I did the tutorial as
best<00:00:40.649> as<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.860> could<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.640> follow<00:00:41.940> along<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.480> it's

best as I could so follow along and it's
a<00:00:43.050> little<00:00:43.140> different<00:00:43.440> from<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.890> instructions

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340

for all you guys wondering you are going

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.690 
for all you guys wondering you are going
to<00:02:08.560> have<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:08.800> be<00:02:08.890> connected<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.429> Wi-Fi

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
to have to be connected to a Wi-Fi

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.670 
to have to be connected to a Wi-Fi
network<00:02:10.360> for<00:02:10.390> this<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.899> work<00:02:11.080> since<00:02:11.410> it<00:02:11.560> is

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
network for this to work since it is

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.660 
network for this to work since it is
downloading<00:02:12.220> packages<00:02:12.819> from<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.420> Cydia

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
downloading packages from the Cydia

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.550 
downloading packages from the Cydia
servers<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.880> stuff<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.720> if<00:02:17.020> you<00:02:17.140> don't<00:02:17.319> have

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
servers and stuff so if you don't have

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.740 
servers and stuff so if you don't have
Wi-Fi<00:02:18.069> connection<00:02:18.490> you<00:02:18.610> would<00:02:18.670> want<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.090> go<00:02:19.630> to

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
Wi-Fi connection you would want to go to

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.660 
Wi-Fi connection you would want to go to
a<00:02:19.870> place<00:02:20.140> that<00:02:20.170> has<00:02:20.560> Wi-Fi<00:02:21.010> before<00:02:21.069> you<00:02:21.370> start

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
a place that has Wi-Fi before you start

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.059 
a place that has Wi-Fi before you start
after<00:02:22.239> it's<00:02:22.690> done<00:02:22.900> reload<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.620> springboard

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
after it's done reload the springboard

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.710 
after it's done reload the springboard
it's<00:02:24.310> basically<00:02:24.580> going<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.880> reboot<00:02:25.630> your

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
it's basically going to reboot your

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:33.630 
it's basically going to reboot your
device

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
want to be unlock to and it should all

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:58.830 
want to be unlock to and it should all
work<00:04:55.660> out<00:04:57.389> now<00:04:58.389> the<00:04:58.449> other<00:04:58.690> way<00:04:58.810> that

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
work out now the other way that

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.320 
work out now the other way that
everyone's<00:04:59.410> have<00:05:00.340> on<00:05:00.669> the<00:05:00.789> blogs<00:05:01.060> and

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
everyone's have on the blogs and

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.850 
everyone's have on the blogs and
everything<00:05:01.690> they<00:05:01.810> have<00:05:01.990> it<00:05:02.199> so<00:05:02.380> you<00:05:02.410> connect

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
everything they have it so you connect

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.249 
everything they have it so you connect
it<00:05:03.039> to<00:05:03.070> your<00:05:03.460> phone<00:05:03.759> and<00:05:04.389> do<00:05:04.479> the<00:05:04.630> activation

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:05.259 
it to your phone and do the activation

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:08.700 
it to your phone and do the activation
through<00:05:05.590> there<00:05:06.360> to<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.479> computer<00:05:07.840> and<00:05:08.020> I

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
through there to the computer and I

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.890 
through there to the computer and I
guess<00:05:08.889> it<00:05:09.250> works<00:05:09.520> for<00:05:09.759> some<00:05:10.210> people<00:05:10.509> it<00:05:10.780> was

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
guess it works for some people it was

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.480 
guess it works for some people it was
just<00:05:11.020> not<00:05:11.199> working<00:05:11.500> for<00:05:11.680> me<00:05:11.740> so<00:05:12.039> I<00:05:12.070> try<00:05:12.310> this

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
just not working for me so I try this

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:25.610 
just not working for me so I try this
way<00:05:12.669> and<00:05:12.849> it<00:05:12.940> worked

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.330

and there you go so hopefully this works

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:05.320 
and there you go so hopefully this works
for<00:06:04.249> you<00:06:04.369> guys<00:06:04.430> if<00:06:04.639> it<00:06:04.759> doesn't<00:06:05.059> just<00:06:05.119> fool

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
for you guys if it doesn't just fool

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.659 
for you guys if it doesn't just fool
around<00:06:05.449> with<00:06:05.719> it<00:06:05.869> try<00:06:06.199> it<00:06:06.229> out<00:06:06.409> and<00:06:07.129> if<00:06:07.460> it

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
around with it try it out and if it

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:08.980 
around with it try it out and if it
doesn't<00:06:07.699> work<00:06:07.999> you<00:06:08.150> can<00:06:08.300> ultimately<00:06:08.719> just

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
doesn't work you can ultimately just

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.839 
doesn't work you can ultimately just
restore<00:06:09.409> your<00:06:09.559> device<00:06:10.930> to<00:06:11.930> whatever<00:06:12.199> it<00:06:12.379> was

00:06:15.489 --> 00:06:15.499 
that's basically afterwards you can

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:19.329 
that's basically afterwards you can
disable<00:06:16.279> the<00:06:16.819> Sam<00:06:17.479> module<00:06:18.080> and<00:06:18.229> I<00:06:18.409> Sam<00:06:19.039> preps

on and then just give your device a

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:25.749 
on and then just give your device a
reboot<00:06:23.539> and<00:06:23.569> it'll<00:06:23.899> go<00:06:24.080> away<00:06:24.669> but<00:06:25.669> that's

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759
