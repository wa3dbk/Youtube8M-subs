a bit wobbly and but I'm replacing those

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.760 
a bit wobbly and but I'm replacing those
on<00:01:16.040> Tuesday<00:01:16.460> when<00:01:16.610> my<00:01:16.729> parts<00:01:17.030> arrive<00:01:19.510> so<00:01:20.770> let's

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
on Tuesday when my parts arrive so let's

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.219 
on Tuesday when my parts arrive so let's
fire<00:01:22.130> it<00:01:22.159> up<00:01:22.460> this<00:01:23.030> is<00:01:23.150> a<00:01:23.180> cold<00:01:23.479> day<00:01:23.570> it's<00:01:23.930> about

fire it up this is a cold day it's about

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.020 
fire it up this is a cold day it's about
minus<00:01:24.799> two<00:01:25.100> I<00:01:25.130> think<00:01:27.549> so<00:01:28.549> as<00:01:28.610> you<00:01:28.729> can<00:01:28.820> see<00:01:28.939> all

minus two I think so as you can see all

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.960 
minus two I think so as you can see all
the<00:01:29.150> warning<00:01:29.450> lights<00:01:29.600> come<00:01:29.869> up<00:01:30.610> since<00:01:31.610> we<00:01:31.729> fire

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
the warning lights come up since we fire

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.200 
the warning lights come up since we fire
it<00:01:32.090> up

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
it up

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:53.740 
it up
start<00:01:35.210> absolutely<00:01:35.930> perfectly

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.900 

then<00:01:54.410> it's<00:01:54.590> in<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:55.630> bowl<00:01:56.630> meter<00:01:56.930> doesn't<00:01:57.290> read

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
then it's in the bowl meter doesn't read

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.210 
then it's in the bowl meter doesn't read
accurately<00:01:59.350> and<00:02:00.350> it<00:02:00.440> takes<00:02:00.680> a<00:02:00.770> while<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:00.980> get

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
accurately and it takes a while to get

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.460 
accurately and it takes a while to get
back<00:02:01.400> up<00:02:01.750> but<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.870> voltage<00:02:03.020> is<00:02:03.320> actually

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
back up but the voltage is actually

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.100 
back up but the voltage is actually
correct<00:02:03.920> but<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:05.150> wouldn't<00:02:05.390> be<00:02:05.510> a<00:02:05.540> British<00:02:05.870> car

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
correct but it wouldn't be a British car

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.370 
correct but it wouldn't be a British car
without<00:02:06.740> a<00:02:06.920> few<00:02:07.690> little<00:02:08.690> gremlins<00:02:09.140> in<00:02:09.259> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.240 
machine with it a single wiper and it
drives<00:02:13.910> so<00:02:14.270> so<00:02:14.630> nicely<00:02:15.170> it's<00:02:15.350> so<00:02:15.560> smooth<00:02:15.980> and

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
drives so so nicely it's so smooth and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.030 
drives so so nicely it's so smooth and
quiet<00:02:16.780> plenty<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:17.870> power<00:02:18.020> but<00:02:18.770> I'm<00:02:18.860> going<00:02:18.980> to

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
quiet plenty of power but I'm going to

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.250 
quiet plenty of power but I'm going to
do<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.490> video<00:02:20.270> on<00:02:20.450> how<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.780> replace<00:02:21.140> the

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
it's a very common fault with them so it

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.310
