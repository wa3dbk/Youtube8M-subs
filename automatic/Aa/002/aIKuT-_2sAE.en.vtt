if we could get 10,000 we could change
Legos<00:01:51.329> mind<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.020> know<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:53.130> hard<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.399> believe

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
Legos mind I know it's hard to believe

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.060 
Legos mind I know it's hard to believe
but<00:01:54.240> we<00:01:54.420> could<00:01:54.630> do<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.990> people<00:01:55.649> have<00:01:55.770> done<00:01:55.920> it

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
but we could do it people have done it

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.179 
but we could do it people have done it
before<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.640> we<00:01:57.149> can<00:01:57.180> make<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.750> difference<00:01:58.189> this

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
before and we can make a difference this

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.980 
before and we can make a difference this
is<00:01:59.369> something<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.909> truly<00:02:00.329> think<00:02:00.630> we<00:02:00.810> could

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
is something that I truly think we could

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.469 
is something that I truly think we could
try<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.619> doesn't<00:02:01.860> work<00:02:02.219> well<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:03.030> was<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.270> good

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479
