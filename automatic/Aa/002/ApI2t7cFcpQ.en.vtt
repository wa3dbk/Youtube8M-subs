Freddy can fly in today's video I wanted
to<00:00:17.820> do<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> review<00:00:18.720> on<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.320> edge<00:00:19.560> brand<00:00:20.520> of

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
to do a review on the edge brand of

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.980 
to do a review on the edge brand of
rotor<00:00:21.480> blades<00:00:21.750> now<00:00:22.939> edged<00:00:23.939> blades<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.840> is

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
rotor blades now edged blades this is

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.839 
rotor blades now edged blades this is
going<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.199> be<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> 600<00:00:26.070> set<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.369> edged<00:00:26.490> blades

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
going to be a 600 set of edged blades

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.189 
going to be a 600 set of edged blades
and<00:00:27.119> they<00:00:27.180> are<00:00:27.330> 60<00:00:27.840> three<00:00:28.760> millimeter<00:00:29.760> blades

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
and they are 60 three millimeter blades

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.080 
and they are 60 three millimeter blades
as<00:00:31.199> compared<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.160> your<00:00:32.309> standard<00:00:32.730> stock<00:00:32.969> I

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
as compared to your standard stock I

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.139 
as compared to your standard stock I
think<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> lines<00:00:33.660> are<00:00:33.809> just<00:00:33.989> six<00:00:34.559> hundreds

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
think the lines are just six hundreds

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.190 
think the lines are just six hundreds
radix<00:00:36.149> blades<00:00:36.390> they<00:00:36.540> also<00:00:36.660> make<00:00:36.930> them<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
radix blades they also make them in a

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.580 
radix blades they also make them in a
600<00:00:37.969> sighs<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.390> 603<00:00:40.079> they've<00:00:40.230> got<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> little

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
600 sighs so 603 they've got a little

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.160 
600 sighs so 603 they've got a little
bit<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.890> extra<00:00:41.040> length<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.820> them<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:43.020> is

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
bit of extra length to them and this is

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.660 
bit of extra length to them and this is
my<00:00:43.320> first<00:00:43.620> try<00:00:43.860> out<00:00:43.980> with<00:00:44.129> edged<00:00:44.309> blades

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
my first try out with edged blades

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.200 
my first try out with edged blades
usually<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.180> been<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> pretty<00:00:45.629> big<00:00:45.809> radix<00:00:46.230> fan

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
usually have been a pretty big radix fan

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.580 
usually have been a pretty big radix fan
but<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.480> will<00:00:48.629> tell<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:48.899> guy's<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.410> am

but I will tell you this guy's I am

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.380 
but I will tell you this guy's I am
impressed<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.219> these<00:00:50.340> blades<00:00:50.670> they<00:00:50.940> really

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
impressed with these blades they really

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.770 
impressed with these blades they really
fly<00:00:51.660> great<00:00:52.079> they've<00:00:52.710> got<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> really<00:00:53.219> great<00:00:53.780> 3d

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
fly great they've got a really great 3d

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.119 
fly great they've got a really great 3d
characteristic<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.739> them<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.980> auto

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
characteristic to them the auto

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.920 
characteristic to them the auto
rotations<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:56.910> pretty<00:00:57.120> damn<00:00:57.300> decent<00:00:57.600> with

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
rotations are pretty damn decent with

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.380 
rotations are pretty damn decent with
them<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.829> what<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.100> wanted<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.399> do<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.730> we<00:01:00.210> gotta

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
them so what I wanted to do is we gotta

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.689 
them so what I wanted to do is we gotta
gotta<00:01:00.870> set<00:01:01.140> here<00:01:01.379> out<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> package<00:01:02.190> first

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
gotta set here out of the package first

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.060 
gotta set here out of the package first
off<00:01:02.910> they<00:01:03.120> did<00:01:03.300> come<00:01:03.570> really<00:01:04.379> well<00:01:04.530> packaged

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
segregated within the box there was no

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.750 
segregated within the box there was no
damage<00:01:07.110> Nick's<00:01:07.560> or<00:01:07.830> cuts<00:01:07.860> or<00:01:08.369> chips<00:01:08.610> or

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
damage Nick's or cuts or chips or

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.420 
damage Nick's or cuts or chips or
anything<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.830> very<00:01:10.830> impressed

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
anything like that so very impressed

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.740 
anything like that so very impressed
with<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.640> they're<00:01:12.000> they're<00:01:12.270> pretty<00:01:12.510> basic

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
with that they're they're pretty basic

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.359 
with that they're they're pretty basic
looking<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.320> mean<00:01:13.470> there's<00:01:13.619> nothing<00:01:13.740> too<00:01:14.070> fancy

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
looking I mean there's nothing too fancy

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.060 
looking I mean there's nothing too fancy
looking<00:01:14.760> about<00:01:15.119> them<00:01:15.330> they<00:01:15.810> look<00:01:16.009> you<00:01:17.009> know

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
looking about them they look you know

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.679 
looking about them they look you know
like<00:01:17.430> i<00:01:17.460> said<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:18.000> normal<00:01:18.270> blades<00:01:18.509> with

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
like i said of just normal blades with

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.450 
like i said of just normal blades with
the<00:01:18.810> word<00:01:18.960> edge<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.439> them<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.159> would<00:01:20.340> be

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
the word edge on them so it would be

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.830 
the word edge on them so it would be
nice<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:20.640> they<00:01:20.909> were<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.210> more<00:01:21.420> flashy

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
nice if they were a little more flashy

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.560 
nice if they were a little more flashy
but<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:23.250> guess<00:01:23.580> performance<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.360> more

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
but I guess performance is more

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.020 
but I guess performance is more
important<00:01:24.960> than<00:01:25.080> look<00:01:25.350> obviously<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.759> what<00:01:27.000> I

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
important than look obviously so what I

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.520 
important than look obviously so what I
wanted<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.360> do<00:01:27.540> real<00:01:27.750> quick<00:01:27.930> guys<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.290> do<00:01:28.350> this

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
wanted to do real quick guys I do this

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.230 
wanted to do real quick guys I do this
with<00:01:28.680> every<00:01:28.979> blade<00:01:29.369> test<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.939> we're<00:01:30.060> going<00:01:30.150> to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
with every blade test is we're going to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.700 
with every blade test is we're going to
go<00:01:30.299> ahead<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.509> get<00:01:30.570> our<00:01:30.630> scale<00:01:31.049> out<00:01:31.229> here<00:01:31.530> our

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
go ahead and get our scale out here our

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.499 
go ahead and get our scale out here our
digital<00:01:32.159> scale<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.610> we're<00:01:33.119> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.299> weigh

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
digital scale and we're going to weigh

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.270 
digital scale and we're going to weigh
each<00:01:33.540> blade<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.500> we're<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.860> see<00:01:35.100> how

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
each blade and we're going to see how

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.880 
each blade and we're going to see how
well<00:01:35.490> they<00:01:35.700> came<00:01:35.939> prepackaged<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.930> how

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
well they came prepackaged and how

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.980 
well they came prepackaged and how
weighted<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.460> balanced<00:01:38.790> they<00:01:39.000> were<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.509> let's

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
weighted and balanced they were so let's

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.340 
weighted and balanced they were so let's
jump<00:01:40.229> into<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.710> let's<00:01:40.860> check<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.220> out<00:01:42.350> ok

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
jump into that and let's check it out ok

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.170 
jump into that and let's check it out ok
guys<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.009> I've<00:01:44.100> got<00:01:44.250> my<00:01:44.280> scale<00:01:44.640> here<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.000> can

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
guys so I've got my scale here you can

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.789 
guys so I've got my scale here you can
see<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.570> verify<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:46.200> I've<00:01:46.290> got<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.560> set<00:01:46.740> to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
see and verify that I've got it set to

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.069 
see and verify that I've got it set to
zero<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.520> it's<00:01:47.790> not<00:01:47.939> measuring<00:01:48.659> any<00:01:48.810> sort<00:01:49.049> of

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
zero so it's not measuring any sort of

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.719 
zero so it's not measuring any sort of
weight<00:01:49.229> right<00:01:49.409> now<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.399> what<00:01:50.520> we'll<00:01:50.610> do<00:01:50.700> is

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
weight right now so what we'll do is

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.060 
weight right now so what we'll do is
we'll<00:01:50.850> take<00:01:50.909> our<00:01:51.060> first<00:01:51.390> blade<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.009> try<00:01:53.009> to

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
we'll take our first blade and try to

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.800 
we'll take our first blade and try to
Center<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.520> here<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:53.880> much<00:01:54.060> as<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.329> can<00:01:54.540> so

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
Center it on here as much as we can so

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.389 
Center it on here as much as we can so
bear<00:01:54.960> with<00:01:54.990> me<00:01:55.140> here<00:01:55.320> get<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.189> nice<00:01:56.340> and

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
bear with me here get it nice and

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.600 
bear with me here get it nice and
balanced<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.149> there<00:01:57.420> ok<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.369> let's<00:01:59.369> see<00:01:59.520> what

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
balanced on there ok and let's see what

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.819 
balanced on there ok and let's see what
kind<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.939> readout<00:02:00.210> we're<00:02:00.329> getting<00:02:00.600> here<00:02:00.829> so

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
kind of a readout we're getting here so

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.319 
kind of a readout we're getting here so
far<00:02:02.040> our<00:02:02.189> first<00:02:02.399> blade<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.880> weighing<00:02:03.119> a

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
far our first blade is weighing a

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.120 
far our first blade is weighing a
hundred<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.810> forty<00:02:04.110> four<00:02:04.320> point<00:02:04.649> two<00:02:04.860> and

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
hundred and forty four point two and

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.990 
hundred and forty four point two and
this<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:05.939> grams<00:02:06.469> so<00:02:07.469> 144<00:02:08.429> point2

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
this is a this is grams so 144 point2

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.940 
this is a this is grams so 144 point2
not<00:02:09.239> bad<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:10.229> let's<00:02:10.410> go<00:02:10.530> ahead<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.709> see<00:02:10.830> what

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
not bad so let's go ahead and see what

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.460 
not bad so let's go ahead and see what
that<00:02:11.190> compares<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.209> other<00:02:12.330> blade

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
that compares to the other blade

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.980 
that compares to the other blade
remember<00:02:14.070> we're<00:02:14.220> shooting<00:02:14.490> for<00:02:14.520> 144<00:02:15.480> point2

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
remember we're shooting for 144 point2

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.270 
remember we're shooting for 144 point2
we<00:02:16.140> want<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.380> try<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.530> get<00:02:16.710> our<00:02:16.830> blade<00:02:17.070> in<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
we want to try to get our blade in the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.950 
we want to try to get our blade in the
same<00:02:17.550> exact<00:02:17.880> position<00:02:18.330> as<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.600> other<00:02:18.720> one

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
same exact position as the other one

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.070 
same exact position as the other one
okay<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:21.060> one<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:22.820> 144<00:02:23.820> point<00:02:24.150> for<00:02:24.690> a

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
okay and this one is a 144 point for a

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.400 
okay and this one is a 144 point for a
little<00:02:26.040> bit<00:02:26.340> off<00:02:26.550> but<00:02:27.120> I'm<00:02:27.900> sure<00:02:28.140> if<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.350> shift

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
little bit off but I'm sure if I shift

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.440 
little bit off but I'm sure if I shift
the<00:02:28.800> blade<00:02:29.070> around<00:02:29.220> just<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.700> little<00:02:29.730> bit<00:02:30.150> let's

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
the blade around just a little bit let's

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.780 
the blade around just a little bit let's
see<00:02:30.630> if<00:02:30.690> we<00:02:30.840> can<00:02:31.080> get<00:02:31.800> that<00:02:31.980> number<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.490> a<00:02:32.520> 2<00:02:34.790> and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
see if we can get that number to a 2 and

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.760 
see if we can get that number to a 2 and
this<00:02:35.910> one<00:02:36.120> seems<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.480> want<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.690> stay<00:02:36.870> at<00:02:36.930> 140

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
this one seems to want to stay at 140

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.760 
this one seems to want to stay at 140
4.4<00:02:38.460> so<00:02:38.940> we're<00:02:39.120> point<00:02:39.450> two<00:02:39.750> grams<00:02:40.110> off<00:02:40.470> out<00:02:40.740> of

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
4.4 so we're point two grams off out of

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.800 
4.4 so we're point two grams off out of
the<00:02:40.950> box<00:02:41.190> guys<00:02:41.520> that's<00:02:41.790> that's<00:02:42.120> absolutely

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
the box guys that's that's absolutely

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.900 
the box guys that's that's absolutely
nothing<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.920> know<00:02:44.010> I've<00:02:44.130> really<00:02:44.460> never<00:02:44.610> had<00:02:44.760> a

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
nothing you know I've really never had a

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.610 
nothing you know I've really never had a
set<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.300> blades<00:02:45.450> that's<00:02:45.780> absolutely

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
set of blades that's absolutely

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.330 
set of blades that's absolutely
absolutely<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.760> know<00:02:47.880> 142<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:48.810> 142<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:50.310> I

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
absolutely you know 142 and 142 so I

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.130 
absolutely you know 142 and 142 so I
would<00:02:50.700> actually<00:02:50.850> say<00:02:51.150> these<00:02:51.630> things<00:02:51.959> are

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
would actually say these things are

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.800 
would actually say these things are
pretty<00:02:52.380> damn<00:02:52.680> perfect<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.459> they<00:02:53.970> fly<00:02:54.270> just<00:02:54.330> as

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
pretty damn perfect and they fly just as

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.560 
pretty damn perfect and they fly just as
good<00:02:55.050> so<00:02:55.440> let's<00:02:56.070> go<00:02:56.280> ahead<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.490> do<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.880> Freddie

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
good so let's go ahead and do a Freddie

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.390 
good so let's go ahead and do a Freddie
can<00:02:57.750> fly<00:02:57.930> star<00:02:58.260> rating<00:02:58.620> i<00:02:58.770> would<00:02:58.950> give<00:02:59.130> edged

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
can fly star rating i would give edged

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.449 
can fly star rating i would give edged
blades<00:02:59.820> from<00:03:00.300> a<00:03:00.660> 1<00:03:00.900> out<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.170> 10<00:03:01.530> stars<00:03:01.890> i'm

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
blades from a 1 out of 10 stars i'm

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.740

going<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.670> go<00:03:02.760> ahead<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:02.910> give<00:03:03.090> them<00:03:03.240> give

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
going to go ahead and give them give

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.480 
going to go ahead and give them give
them<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:03.900> nine<00:03:04.110> point<00:03:04.320> five<00:03:04.590> stars<00:03:04.950> obviously

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.070 
them a nine point five stars obviously
it's<00:03:05.880> pretty<00:03:06.180> hard<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.450> get<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:06.660> 10<00:03:06.900> because

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
it's pretty hard to get a 10 because

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.710 
it's pretty hard to get a 10 because
nothing<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.680> this<00:03:07.770> world<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.160> perfect<00:03:08.610> so<00:03:09.360> I'm
