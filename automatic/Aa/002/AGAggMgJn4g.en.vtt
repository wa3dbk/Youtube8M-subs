 hello everyone and everyone again one day 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.910

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.440

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.040
 I have decided to repeat since you liked it 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.040
 so much that they are my August favorites 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.580
 Well, although we are already in 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.360
 September I am here today enjoying 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.150
 of this fall that we are having and 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.860
 well decided to make the video out in the 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.410
 street so that you too can 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.360
 Enjoy these last days of good 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.520
 time and the autumn that I like for 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.070
 just like last month today I'm going to 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.590
 start with a book a book that has 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.340
 delighted I read it this August and 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.739
 it's like a virgin of richter bands the 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.370
 Richard Brandson you will know all or 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.800
 almost everyone is the owner of the empire 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.350
 virgin and well then all the brand all 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:03.430
 the bersin brands that exist virgin 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:05.960
 atlantic virgin mobile virgin trains 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.369
 So much so that I even had to 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.890
 I remember that but it came to have a 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.140
 cage version that was a version of 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.600
 coca-cola but from berlin but that's good 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.790
 that did not succeed and precisely from 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.890
 all these things speaks to us what 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.930
 Write Richard Branson and what we 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.090
 account more than this is a book of 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.530
 business and how to do things what 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.010
 that tells us laugh 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.770
 here are your stories your stories 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.979
 real that failures has had of how 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.380
 He started as he did to get attention 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.940
 when I was starting and good all 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.380
 those things that are so important to you 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.149
 I highly recommend it because everyone 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.649
 we know that from stories it is what 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.229
 the more you learn, I will continue with my 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.409
 August favorites for hair and good 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:52.310
 I have 21 of them that is already an old 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.899
 favorite but it is the batiste dry shampoo 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.380
 What I like about this one is that they have 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.330
 removed the version for brown hair 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.399
 I use it I wash my hair in days 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.659
 Indian, the day I do not wash it 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.000
 he threw it in the roots so that it does not 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.619
 see fat and the normal version of this 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.060
 Spanish where a white residue leaves you 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.310
 how good can you take it off but it 's a 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.440
 little like I do not like but this is 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.850
 has a brown color cited then it 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.190
 mixes perfectly with brown hair 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.110
 and it does not leave any problem I love it and 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.360
 it also smells great and my other 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.030
 favorite hair is a mask 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.250
 that is not expensive and I was surprised 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.090
 very much when I saw her at my house 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.760
 mother in madrid and is this le petit max 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.220
 scheler 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.620
 what is this here is so you go 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.599
 to find in Spain and possibly in 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.610
 the foreigner I have never seen them in 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.709
 the united kingdom and my mother had it in 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.250
 I decided to try it and the truth is that 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:48.080
 I got an amazing surprise because 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.319
 Moisturizes and nourishes hair a lot 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.450
 but does not leave any residue and does not leave 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.799
 heavy hair which is quite 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.730
 difficult in masks that are very 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:01.519
 nutritious so well it also smells 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.850
 very very well is like a texture a little 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.800
 gel a gel cream texture 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.660
 it is a marvel of jal besides the 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.310
 thick hair I love myself 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.200
 I love love in makeup os 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.180
 I bring three favorite things from this 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.880
 August and one already know if you have 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.300
 seen my makeup videos back 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.650
 to the cole and is the one of tempted cicla that is in 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.200
 the new one 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.010
 the new makeup that he has taken out and they are 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.430
 they manage to go to game build famous 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.590
 Toxic him and that I'm here and me 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.520
 you have seen in other videos and I am so 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.010
 I'm delighted that I do not know if I'm going to use 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.420
 another one also smells very well another basis of 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.160
 good makeup I always like to try 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.690
 new things but this one I think is going to 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.030
 always be forever forever in my 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.940
 drawer because I already liked the pencil 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.850
 of keys what is makeup what 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.800
 you have seen already in 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.170
 in my makeup tutorial back to 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.160
 cole that left a luminosity 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.530
 awesome another that I liked 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.480
 very much this summer has been the super 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.710
 state and our thing those that also 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.410
 you saw using my video back to 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:12.700
 cole and I like it so much because it has a 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.819
 texture that although it is one is a dye of 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.100
 lips 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.220
 It is not 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.410
 excessively dry has a little bit of 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.390
 hydration because of not mind the 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.640
 Tints do not usually leave the lips 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.860
 quite dry and as soon as you put it 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.690
 so let it dry a bit and after 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.150
 that you put a blog if you want over and 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.470
 lasts a lot and another discovery that 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.600
 yes they have has become 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.050
 my favorite are the loose powders of 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.300
 make up forever and it's these here that 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.140
 they are called age the high definition 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.540
 paula what is this and it's like a micro 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.150
 dust does not become a coarse powder 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.400
 but it's really like a very dust 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.350
 filtering it is more that are a 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.390
 very tiny particles and alight 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.950
 over your face they only come in this 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.110
 color that although you see it white does not leave 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.910
 for nothing thematic white veil 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.950
 perfectly face and leave nothing 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.540
 of residue because in addition to me I do not 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.400
 they like powder makeup in the 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.920
 mineral makeup because they tend to 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.050
 leave a coat a mask that looks 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.480
 horrible looks artificial I do not like 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.490
 nothing and it is with these does not happen so 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.590
 I am very happy have become my 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.000
 favorites along with the body shop that 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.400
 go and aysÃ©n 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.760
 in my video back to school and good 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.070
 These are there on par with them I 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.260
 I forgot the makeup a shadow that I've 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.540
 been using a lot all summer 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.200
 It was one that came as a gift to me 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:39.330
 last order I made to sigma and it's this 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.159
 from here it came as a gift 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.740
 you know that without more he always makes gifts 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:46.590
 when you spend more than $ 30 on your 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.930
 store I leave the link if you want 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.729
 visit in the sigma store so that 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.289
 you see everything they have, you know what 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.430
 distinctions are there and good if 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:59.460
 you want to visit her and this is the gift that 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.670
 I came when I made my last order and 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.510
 it's the grass color 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:07.630
 It is a spectacular color 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:10.870
 you can appreciate it here is a little 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:13.920
 iridescent and is like a coral and curly and what 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.820
 is using as a basis in almost all 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.620
 eye makeup that I'm wearing 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.780
 all summer and finally in 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.900
 September favorites I want to talk to you 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:26.770
 of my favorite fragrance in this month that 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:29.470

 fifth avenue that is east of here the 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.090
 I discovered by chance in a visit to 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.830
 zara and you can see everything I 've used 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.830
 because the truth is that it is a fragrance 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.349
 delicious and it lasts long but it's 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:46.500
 what else is very cool and whenever I 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:47.819

 how well you fly you are wearing a 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.970
 fragrance that is a little sweet but without 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:59.039
 to be too powerful let's say is 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.949
 pretty cool you're going to like this 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:03.720

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:09.509
