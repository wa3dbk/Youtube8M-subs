hello<00:00:00.570> guys<00:00:00.780> today<00:00:00.810> I<00:00:01.199> wanted<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.530> talk<00:00:01.770> about

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
hello guys today I wanted to talk about

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.439 
hello guys today I wanted to talk about
the<00:00:02.159> techniques<00:00:02.520> we<00:00:02.760> found<00:00:02.970> in<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.179> splatoon

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
the techniques we found in the splatoon

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.710 
the techniques we found in the splatoon
test-fire<00:00:04.110> beta<00:00:04.529> here<00:00:05.220> we<00:00:05.339> go<00:00:05.520> first<00:00:06.359> off<00:00:06.540> we

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
test-fire beta here we go first off we

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.000 
test-fire beta here we go first off we
have<00:00:06.750> splatter<00:00:07.109> jumping<00:00:07.529> or<00:00:07.680> splatter

hopping<00:00:08.519> it's<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.150> most<00:00:09.330> important<00:00:09.780> and

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
hopping it's the most important and

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.230 
hopping it's the most important and
strongest<00:00:10.380> moves<00:00:10.679> we<00:00:10.830> found<00:00:11.099> so<00:00:11.280> far<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.820> it's

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
strongest moves we found so far and it's

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.759 
strongest moves we found so far and it's
believed<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.690> be<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.960> fastest<00:00:13.380> way<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.620> travel

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
believed to be the fastest way to travel

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.490 
believed to be the fastest way to travel
on<00:00:14.130> new<00:00:14.340> or<00:00:14.639> enemy<00:00:15.000> ground<00:00:15.210> they<00:00:15.929> consist<00:00:16.350> of

on new or enemy ground they consist of
hopping<00:00:16.890> from<00:00:17.039> puddle<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.550> pedal<00:00:17.880> while

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
hopping from puddle of the pedal while

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.820 
hopping from puddle of the pedal while
creating<00:00:18.359> those<00:00:18.570> puddles<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.439> air

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
creating those puddles in the air

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.710 
creating those puddles in the air
I<00:00:19.859> found<00:00:20.609> spider<00:00:20.910> hopping<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.390> be<00:00:21.510> most

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
I found spider hopping to be most

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.150 
I found spider hopping to be most

swimming underneath the ink he can swim

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.160 
swimming underneath the ink he can swim
faster<00:01:14.580> than<00:01:14.610> walking<00:01:15.240> without<00:01:15.540> making<00:01:15.990> any

to<00:01:53.729> capture<00:01:53.970> any<00:01:54.240> footage<00:01:54.570> but<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.079> throw

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
to capture any footage but you can throw

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.109 
to capture any footage but you can throw
a<00:01:55.290> grenade<00:01:55.590> at<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.829> floor<00:01:56.100> at<00:01:56.340> an<00:01:56.670> angle<00:01:56.969> to

a grenade at the floor at an angle to

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.039 
a grenade at the floor at an angle to
have<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.390> roll<00:01:57.600> forward

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
have it roll forward
