00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:17.250
 motto, we'll be up for it soon 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.820
 do after our last to review 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.359
 to what else in grin yes one more 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.010
 medium long island ice tea the worm 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.740
 Recommended by a shop owner 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.369
 apparently enthusiastic and the smoke 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.750
 today exactly 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:38.250
 and while little chorus burned on it 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.440
 and four times Wholly owned the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.940
 100% smoke development 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:49.399
 phase start-up phase january phase select 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.399
 on it and we pull 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.500
 with vinzenz small own service 5 minute 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.710
 attack 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:18.700
 Now I would say they are 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:20.860
 stones in the end stage you can see how the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:26.770
 taste of the taste comes too 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:28.719
 slowly over and first statement was 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.709
 actually that he just after only 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.709
 Sweet mostly here tastes 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:57.369
 the most good we come to 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:01.600
 next day tobacco substitutes also stones so 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:05.170
 long island ice tea with it once before 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.090
 smoked what is important before just fine 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.040
 shake that down with me in exchange 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:24.790
 the stones do not daughter and then 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:34.230
 just the stones friend and may already 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:34.230
 be full portfolio two days 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.769
 we just do it for a very short time 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:03:01.109
 in between a big update 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:03:03.629
 so not difficult somehow fruit 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:12.389
 Punch I just think promises 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:18.150
 However , he points to sweetness at the same time 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:22.379
 no matter where I'm from now just show 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.060
 short time the vp water on it is so 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:28.430
 here on as the vp on it one sees just 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.400
 a small cocktail glass with lemon 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.959
 knock the church and next to the bed 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.579
 and in the whole cocktail is yes 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:42.449
 actually a huge punch from 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:44.579
 any funny alcoholic 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:47.989
 ingredients in it what I have times 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:51.209
 looked what he was talking about vodka gin 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.620
 among other things cola and which is decorated 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:59.400
 it usually just with the shown here 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:02.090
 but fear to taste right out 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.849
 the high and also I think I'm coming to 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.269
 little it smells of sea first that 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.269
 is it 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:21.489
 true but not true to mainz 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.630
 to the x-th bed to mix from baba to 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:29.280
 record 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:31.570
 that's not true, it is with first 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.060
 why maybe because of that 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.810
 cola and no idea 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:41.740
 In any case judge even more 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:43.660
 at first okay so welcome to 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.060
 the end of video almost us today 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.340
 shorter the video is not so long 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.530
 if you have any questions about the ship 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:55.770
 how it works steams moderately 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.770
 just look at the state so kilian 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.460
 taste is the same in every case 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.920
 markus gail definitely found the 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:07.050
 better is just sweeter somehow 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:10.390
 and more intense 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.669
 and yes who really buy 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.770
 otherwise there's soon we determined soon 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:19.919
 Again , we will move in the direction of Cetera 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.919
 I would say 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:38.580
 my husband is my long a achievements
