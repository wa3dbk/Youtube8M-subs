00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.560 
checking my cut speed I'm putting it
down<00:01:24.110> to<00:01:24.409> one<00:01:24.619> cut<00:01:25.340> pressure<00:01:25.670> up<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:26.270> five

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
down to one cut pressure up to five

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.150 
down to one cut pressure up to five
because<00:01:26.900> this<00:01:27.050> is<00:01:27.200> kind<00:01:27.410> of<00:01:27.470> thick<00:01:27.710> stuff<00:01:27.950> that

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
here how one side of it right the 1/2 is

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.780 
here how one side of it right the 1/2 is
tied<00:03:45.440> and<00:03:45.680> twisted<00:03:45.860> all<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.340> way<00:03:46.430> around<00:03:46.700> the

and to attach the fish hook it's even

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.640 
and to attach the fish hook it's even
easier<00:03:52.700> ok<00:03:53.000> all<00:03:53.240> you<00:03:53.270> need<00:03:53.540> to<00:03:53.660> do<00:03:53.840> is<00:03:54.050> open<00:03:54.560> up
