 monoi road and this time to 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.420
 stop number 16 a very stop 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:16.590
 important since we are here in 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:18.390
 this new factory on the lands of the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.090
 Tahiti monoÃ¯ producers of 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.910
 most important French zip committee 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.810
 the cosmetology laboratory of the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.810
 south pacific 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.400
 where is realized the monoi of the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.590
 counter brand models you 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.140

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.470
 we are in this magnificent 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.150
 coconut grove to papara if it covered 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.830
 as often here because it's a 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:46.040
 rainy rainy region but so 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:48.170
 very generous in tiare flower and 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.879
 other ingredients to 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.120
 realize the little wonders that are 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.070
 finds like for example the under its 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.430
 dryers where there are tiare flowers in 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.829
 drying train and tamanu nuts and 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.030
 we are already working it is 7:30 am 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.490
 I show you the backyard that has 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.170
 successful happening very things 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.259
 interesting 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.990
 we will meet later 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.070
 olive touboul who will explain us 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.840
 what he does here 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.640
 so that's what it's called 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.140
 in Tahitian Croatian he has notament to 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.970
 we are harvested in the islands 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.729
 and mainly the coral islands 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.770
 the product is growing well there so it's 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.680
 the current stock is missing there are two projects 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.080
 ati is treated approximately equivalent 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.810
 any case of 40 tons for the 6 per year 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.820
 here the origin so we start from this nut 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.340
 which contains a fine so much in 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.740
 this one feels good alone 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.929
 lamanda inside so seven months she 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.149
 must be picked up in 2 sec state 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.770
 in any case to have skin without skin 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.520
 which could have different aspects 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.380
 more or less smooth ok so she can 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.429
 have different aspects that's the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.729
 drive in a machine that is a 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:01.570
 crusher so there we do any one 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.210
 little call for massive 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.310
 and too much effort I'm very scared at 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.070
 hammer if not so inside the 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.190
 delannoy one is fined and fined 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.709
 cool incidentally precisely this 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.600
 fine fine fine as the wine rooster 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.320
 as long as we do not know of one we do not have 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.540
 running 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.900
 inside the triba falloir it's 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.850
 the one fine to get from him so we 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.770
 will dry in two stages 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.020
 so my part she does not have the reputation 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.940
 to have a lot of sun we have the 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:37.390
 luck and afternoon only one there but when 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:39.850
 we do not have what my baker so in 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.700
 1 time and join in which one puts 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.550
 of a our fines begins to brown a 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.190
 little bit idc to eliminate so 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:55.630
 surplus the agglo that inside 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:57.400
 to edit that almond to live and so 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.110
 it powered by fuel then 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:05.019
 fuel very often waste 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:07.810
 so it's seed powder 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.700
 that we recover and or awesome genial 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.470
 use it as fuels did 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.459
 also call to play the classic 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:18.700
 we must continue the presentation of the 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.060
 channel where ben ali on the driers 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.060
 you will discover 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.599
 Reindeer 2 German tab a beautiful 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.650
 once it has passed in the shot 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.650
 Ben Ali 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.629
 so here you go 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.000
 the main activities because in 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:41.080
 head how to know from him their 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 just form on the surface here 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.530
 so as soon as we start to see this 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.780
 oil or this resin wander that 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:51.180
 means that we are not far from having 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.180
 completed the drying work
