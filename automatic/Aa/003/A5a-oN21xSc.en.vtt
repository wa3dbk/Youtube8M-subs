is a little bit lesson see the end the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.339 
is a little bit lesson see the end the
way<00:00:19.829> we<00:00:19.860> wanted<00:00:19.950> attend<00:00:20.520> but<00:00:20.840> for<00:00:21.840> us<00:00:21.930> we

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:22.349 
way we wanted attend but for us we

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.710 
way we wanted attend but for us we
learned<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.680> lot<00:00:23.180> gained<00:00:24.180> valuable<00:00:24.450> experience

physical way yeah that's just you know
what<00:01:14.610> I've<00:01:14.729> heard<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.450> we'll<00:01:16.170> find<00:01:16.770> out<00:01:20.900> this

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
what I've heard so we'll find out this

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.290 
what I've heard so we'll find out this
is<00:01:22.080> very

Mikey<00:01:31.790> my<00:01:31.940> rhythm<00:01:32.300> we<00:01:32.570> made<00:01:34.900> some<00:01:35.900> trash

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
Mikey my rhythm we made some trash

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.860 
Mikey my rhythm we made some trash
expect<00:01:36.800> to<00:01:36.920> come<00:01:39.250> yeah<00:01:40.250> I<00:01:40.370> mean<00:01:40.640> first<00:01:41.330> we're

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
expect to come yeah I mean first we're

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.080 
expect to come yeah I mean first we're
going<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.110> have<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.430> apply<00:01:43.430> ways<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:43.970> know

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
going to have to apply ways you know

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.510 
going to have to apply ways you know
when<00:01:44.270> when<00:01:44.660> we<00:01:44.930> get<00:01:45.320> slowed<00:01:45.560> down<00:01:45.800> it's<00:01:46.340> a

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
when when we get slowed down it's a

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.160 
when when we get slowed down it's a
fugly<00:01:48.010> the<00:01:49.010> nitty<00:01:49.490> gritty<00:01:49.580> physical<00:01:50.480> type<00:01:51.020> of

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
fugly the nitty gritty physical type of

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.780 
fugly the nitty gritty physical type of
game<00:01:51.320> we<00:01:51.560> got<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:51.770> find<00:01:52.190> a<00:01:52.280> way<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.430> pull<00:01:52.700> these

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
game we got to find a way to pull these

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.750 
game we got to find a way to pull these
things<00:01:52.850> out<00:01:53.150> and<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:54.410> know<00:01:54.470> we<00:01:54.650> can't<00:01:54.890> when

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
things out and so you know we can't when

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.140 
things out and so you know we can't when
I<00:01:55.820> can<00:01:55.970> go<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.150> just<00:01:56.480> get<00:01:57.230> a<00:01:57.260> hundred<00:01:57.410> under<00:01:58.280> 520

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
I can go to just get a hundred under 520

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.040 
I can go to just get a hundred under 520
points<00:01:59.330> a<00:01:59.510> game<00:01:59.660> I'm<00:02:00.020> in<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.290> playoffs<00:02:00.650> and<00:02:00.860> so

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
points a game I'm in the playoffs and so

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.780 
points a game I'm in the playoffs and so
must<00:02:03.050> continue<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.560> build<00:02:03.740> on<00:02:03.920> something<00:02:04.460> good

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
must continue to build on something good

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.270 
must continue to build on something good
thing<00:02:04.940> that<00:02:05.090> we<00:02:05.150> did
