00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello everyone i'm a lamb and i'm finally 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.970
 I received my phantom visa I am the first 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.820
 Russian Ukrainian speaking owner 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.040
 devices now i will spend it 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.570
 unpacking but first we will focus on 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.210
 that looks like a box box 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.980
 stylish 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:25.760
 it has become a bit wider compared to 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:29.970
 the first phantom I show you now 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.160
 You could consider it in this box. 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.399
 indicated the main new feature which 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.149
 has a device built-in camera 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.640
 implementation with mobile devices 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.010
 gears it in beer on mobile screen 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.520
 phone increased battery and so on 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.690
 there is a suggestion for iphone and 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.670
 android devices 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.850
 the application can be put very easily 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.309
 just scanned this code on 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.309
 box and so we open the box 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:09.630
 We get up what lies there so we see 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:17.610
 such a little black box in 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:19.800
 it contains instructions for the device 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.030
 In the first phantom, the instruction is most often 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.400
 not included 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.050
 it was a huge minus because it was not 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.110
 was not possible immediately 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.030
 man understand this device 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.399
 that is, he needed to lie down 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.320
 Internet and download instructions and with 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.690
 stickers for the device they allow 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.710
 change the look of your phantom 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.830
 externally color labels and other instructions 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:49.970
 by mma chinese and all sorts of schemes 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:53.910
 connect so on here he himself 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.539
 phantom visa plus this box is that 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.100
 she is wider 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.600
 and due to the fact that it is wider 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.520
 opportunity to combine these two legs 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.280
 that is, they do not need to be screwed now 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.720
 actually ready to fly right from 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.310
 phantom vision boxes appeared camera 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.530
 it is possible to adjust the camera 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.140
 up down and protective cap for 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.150
 cameras which allows you to protect 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.420
 camera lens during transport 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.830
 devices have a built-in damper 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.010
 which cleans up 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:28.230
 jelly effect there are little lining for 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:32.819
 phantom legs so that they do not scratch 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:36.390
 when landing they are such an Inca name here's a new one 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.160
 battery compartment now there 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.940
 opportunity to see the level 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.830
 battery charge just by pressing the button 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.750
 the batteries are a little tight 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.160
 because u better insert it 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.620
 keep here i'll take out the batteries battery 5 200 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.770
 milliamp hours of the prototype which were 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.650
 on youtube and she was 4,400 now 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.560
 the manufacturer stated that the flight time 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.790
 the copter will increase to 25 minutes already 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.129
 posted the official video really 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.780
 it flies 25 minutes but we will check 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.500
 how much does he fly in real conditions in 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.500
 next video 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:18.210
 closes very simply snaps 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.980
 This is how a remote device looks like it 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.490
 especially not changed compared to the first 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.100
 remote phantom vision 1 here 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.410
 added only mount for 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.850
 receiver wi-fi it receives a signal to 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.030
 distance up to 300 meters 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.460
 also included is mounting 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.230
 for a mobile phone that is 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.910
 mobile phone fix like this 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.800
 that's the way we set here on 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.960
 this lock and attached to the console 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.370
 that is, while controlling the copter, you 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.670
 can see what the camera sees 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.670
 Copter is very, very convenient, this is all 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.950
 goes right out of the box also bundled 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:04:00.150
 there are two sets of propellers 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:02.340
 these are eight pieces and not the very slow 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.920
 propeller then there is a thread you 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.080
 just a separate propeller and spun 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.400
 him that is nothing else to do 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.830
 no tools needed 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.050
 no longer need to spin 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.490
 propellers and in flight not exactly not 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.170
 unwind it is a very reliable system 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:26.960
 new company keep also included 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:29.720
 micro usb cable in 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:34.100
 it is necessary for flashing the device 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.100
 is inserted here right here this stub 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:42.210
 Next is charging the charging unit is it 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.630
 increased significantly compared to 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.460
 basic charging and here's a connector 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.430
 connects the battery in order for it 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.980
 charge everyone completely different done 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.510
 more already at a serious level not that 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.390
 he needs some kind of cat 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:01.430
 connect as it was in the first phantom 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:03.990
 here's the power cable and what's important is 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.570
 Adapters to different sockets that is 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.590
 if you live but not in China 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.220

 or and serve in china and russia great 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.960
 food you have all these adapters are and 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.960
 corrected can use in charge 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.210
 it's very good ok but we did 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.490
 unpacking this device in the second 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.289
 video i did a detailed review of this 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.570
