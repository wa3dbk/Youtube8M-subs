investigation was focusing really on on

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.779 
investigation was focusing really on on
perhaps<00:00:48.780> some<00:00:49.050> sort<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.320> an<00:00:49.410> accident<00:00:49.860> perhaps

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
perhaps some sort of an accident perhaps

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.420 
perhaps some sort of an accident perhaps
an<00:00:51.539> explosion<00:00:52.260> midair<00:00:52.649> which<00:00:52.920> would<00:00:53.129> explain

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
an explosion midair which would explain

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.840 
an explosion midair which would explain
why<00:00:53.760> there's<00:00:54.449> been<00:00:54.629> no<00:00:55.100> wreckage<00:00:56.100> found<00:00:56.430> but

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
why there's been no wreckage found but

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.170 
why there's been no wreckage found but
now<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.820> report<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.940> suggesting

now as this report is suggesting

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.540 
now as this report is suggesting
Malaysian<00:01:00.930> government<00:01:01.079> believe<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:02.430> the

plane was hijacked the question of

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.480 
plane was hijacked the question of
course<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.270> what<00:01:06.330> happened<00:01:07.320> then<00:01:07.590> was<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
course is what happened then was the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.789 
course is what happened then was the
plane<00:01:08.670> hijacked<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.479> then<00:01:09.600> crashed<00:01:10.020> into<00:01:10.380> the

use at a later date of course both those

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.060 
use at a later date of course both those
scenarios<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.240> horrendous<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.590> scenario

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
scenarios a horrendous the scenario

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.440 
scenarios a horrendous the scenario
which<00:01:23.280> would<00:01:23.490> suggest<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> plane<00:01:24.420> was

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
which would suggest that the plane was

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.020 
which would suggest that the plane was
hijacked<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.259> then<00:01:25.409> crashed<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:26.070> entirely
