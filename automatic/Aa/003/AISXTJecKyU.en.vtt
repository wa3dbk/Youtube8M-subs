as<00:00:11.010> I'm<00:00:11.250> sure<00:00:11.429> most<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:11.940> aware<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:12.360> some<00:00:12.540> of

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
as I'm sure most of you aware in some of

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.600 
as I'm sure most of you aware in some of
the<00:00:12.690> latest<00:00:12.870> snapshots<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.980> can<00:00:14.190> now<00:00:14.340> change

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
the latest snapshots you can now change

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.430 
the latest snapshots you can now change
the<00:00:14.820> color<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.269> beacon<00:00:15.599> beam<00:00:15.809> using

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
the color of the beacon beam using

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.859 
the color of the beacon beam using
stained<00:00:16.920> glass<00:00:17.250> now<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:17.940> have<00:00:18.180> seen<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> ton<00:00:18.840> of

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
stained glass now I have seen a ton of

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.750 
stained glass now I have seen a ton of
really<00:00:19.350> amazing<00:00:19.890> inventions<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.520> do<00:00:20.609> with

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
really amazing inventions to do with

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.330 
really amazing inventions to do with
this<00:00:20.910> for<00:00:21.359> example<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> disco<00:00:22.320> beacon<00:00:22.740> crazy

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
this for example the disco beacon crazy

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.310 
this for example the disco beacon crazy
laser<00:00:23.760> beams<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.420> all<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.750> sort<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.109> thing

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
laser beams and all that sort of thing

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.170 
laser beams and all that sort of thing
but<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.099> thought<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.430> would<00:00:26.580> do<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.000> create

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
but what I thought I would do is create

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.060 
but what I thought I would do is create
this<00:00:27.449> little<00:00:27.720> mechanism<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.529> allows<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.949> to

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
this little mechanism that allows you to

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.890 
this little mechanism that allows you to
change<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.400> color<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.910> beacon<00:00:30.240> beam<00:00:30.420> to

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
change the color of the beacon beam to

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.420 
change the color of the beacon beam to
the<00:00:31.050> one<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.470> want<00:00:31.710> now<00:00:32.160> there<00:00:32.309> are

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
the one that you want now there are

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.100 
the one that you want now there are
eight<00:00:32.579> different<00:00:32.610> colors<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.300> choose<00:00:33.329> from<00:00:33.780> it

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
eight different colors to choose from it

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.350 
eight different colors to choose from it
all<00:00:34.260> works<00:00:34.500> very<00:00:34.739> nicely<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.700> let's<00:00:35.940> take<00:00:36.210> a

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
all works very nicely so let's take a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.810 
all works very nicely so let's take a
closer<00:00:36.660> look<00:00:36.780> at<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.460> down<00:00:38.460> at<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.640> bottom

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
closer look at it down at the bottom

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.190 
closer look at it down at the bottom
here<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.360> see<00:00:39.510> we've<00:00:39.660> got<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:39.899> little

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
here you can see we've got this little

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.049 
here you can see we've got this little
beacon<00:00:40.590> color<00:00:40.890> wheel<00:00:41.129> which<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.579> essentially

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
beacon color wheel which is essentially

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.100 
beacon color wheel which is essentially
all<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.450> colors<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.930> can<00:00:43.079> choose

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
all of the colors that you can choose

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.729 
all of the colors that you can choose
from

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
from

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.410 
from
currently<00:00:44.309> white<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> one<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.300> is

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
currently white is the one that is

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.630 
currently white is the one that is
selected<00:00:45.570> which<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.410> default<00:00:46.710> color<00:00:47.190> but

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
selected which is the default color but

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.010 
selected which is the default color but
if<00:00:47.789> we<00:00:47.879> wanted<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.180> turn<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.480> yellow<00:00:48.629> then<00:00:48.930> all

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
if we wanted to turn to yellow then all

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.270 
if we wanted to turn to yellow then all
we<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.350> do<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.620> hold<00:00:49.800> down<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> right

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
we have to do is hold down the right

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.100 
we have to do is hold down the right
click<00:00:50.520> until<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.120> arrow<00:00:51.300> points<00:00:51.750> towards<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
click until the arrow points towards the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.080 
click until the arrow points towards the
yellow<00:00:52.289> wool<00:00:52.590> block<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.980> as<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.760> see<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
yellow wool block and as you can see the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.090 
yellow wool block and as you can see the
beacon<00:00:54.420> has<00:00:54.600> now<00:00:54.809> changed<00:00:55.050> color<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.890> if<00:00:56.010> you

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
beacon has now changed color so if you

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.560 
beacon has now changed color so if you
want<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.370> be<00:00:56.460> pink<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:57.090> hold<00:00:57.210> down<00:00:57.270> right

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
want it to be pink just hold down right

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.060 
want it to be pink just hold down right
click<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.840> little<00:00:58.020> bit<00:00:58.109> more<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:58.920> see

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
click a little bit more and you can see

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.610 
click a little bit more and you can see
it's<00:00:59.190> gone<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.460> pink<00:00:59.670> blue<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.469> want

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
it's gone to pink blue and if you want

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.319 
it's gone to pink blue and if you want
to<00:01:01.680> go<00:01:01.770> all<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.219> way<00:01:02.250> around<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.670> green<00:01:02.910> you

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
to go all the way around to green you

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.179 
to go all the way around to green you
can<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.899> works<00:01:04.080> as<00:01:04.350> well<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.920> pretty

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
can see that works as well it's pretty

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.160 
can see that works as well it's pretty
versatile<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.270> reacts<00:01:06.540> fairly<00:01:06.930> quickly

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
versatile and it reacts fairly quickly

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.450 
versatile and it reacts fairly quickly
which<00:01:07.619> means<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:08.010> quite<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> nice<00:01:08.430> little

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
which means it's quite a nice little

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.450 
which means it's quite a nice little
system<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.150> use<00:01:09.770> now<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.830> way<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.280> one

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
system to use now the way that this one

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.399 
system to use now the way that this one
works<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.970> actually<00:01:12.210> fairly<00:01:12.630> simple<00:01:12.960> this

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
works is actually fairly simple this

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.050 
works is actually fairly simple this
comparator<00:01:13.950> here<00:01:14.130> takes<00:01:14.400> an<00:01:14.520> output<00:01:14.880> from

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
comparator here takes an output from

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.789 
comparator here takes an output from
this<00:01:15.240> item<00:01:15.659> frame<00:01:15.869> now<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.470> those<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.710> you

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
this item frame now for those of you

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.530 
this item frame now for those of you
don't<00:01:16.979> know<00:01:17.100> item<00:01:17.610> frames<00:01:17.850> actually<00:01:18.000> give<00:01:18.420> off

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
don't know item frames actually give off

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.420 
don't know item frames actually give off
signal<00:01:18.930> strength<00:01:19.229> depending<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.070> where<00:01:20.340> the

that<00:01:26.909> little<00:01:27.119> signal<00:01:27.509> travels<00:01:27.869> up<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.259> top

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
that little signal travels up to the top

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.319 
that little signal travels up to the top
here<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.829> goes<00:01:29.340> into<00:01:29.520> one<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.119> many

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
here and goes into one of the many

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.420 
here and goes into one of the many
Pistons<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.869> we<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.229> up<00:01:31.470> at<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> top<00:01:31.920> now

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
Pistons that we have up at the top now

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.800 
Pistons that we have up at the top now
obviously<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.090> these<00:01:33.360> Pistons

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
obviously all of these Pistons

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.359 
obviously all of these Pistons
correspond<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.350> various<00:01:34.799> different<00:01:34.950> colors

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
correspond to various different colors

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.069 
correspond to various different colors
and<00:01:35.490> they<00:01:35.820> are<00:01:35.909> all<00:01:36.090> triggered<00:01:36.479> at<00:01:36.659> different

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
and they are all triggered at different

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.170 
and they are all triggered at different
times<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.500> different<00:01:38.009> rotations<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:39.060> what

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
times and different rotations but what

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.940 
times and different rotations but what
it<00:01:39.299> means<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.140> get<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> very<00:01:40.710> easy

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
it means is is you get a very easy

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.310 
it means is is you get a very easy
selecting<00:01:41.579> system<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.119> also<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> pretty

and gentlemen I'm not going to be doing
a<00:01:47.909> tutorial<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.600> one<00:01:48.810> simply<00:01:49.200> because

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
a tutorial on this one simply because

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.530 
a tutorial on this one simply because
there<00:01:49.740> are<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> few<00:01:50.399> issues<00:01:50.610> with<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.090> for

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
there are a few issues with it for

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.480 
there are a few issues with it for
example<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.290> only<00:01:52.530> use<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.130> smallest

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
example you can only use the smallest

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.460 
example you can only use the smallest
size<00:01:53.820> beacon<00:01:54.329> if<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.750> want<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.020> go<00:01:55.110> any<00:01:55.259> bigger

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
size beacon if you want to go any bigger

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.420 
size beacon if you want to go any bigger
than<00:01:55.619> you're<00:01:55.770> gonna<00:01:55.860> have<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.159> completely

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
than you're gonna have to completely

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.550 
than you're gonna have to completely
rewire<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.210> whole<00:01:57.360> thing<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.290> seems

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
rewire the whole thing and that seems

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.499 
rewire the whole thing and that seems
like<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.950> boatload<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.399> effort<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.880> top<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.450> that

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
like a boatload of effort on top of that

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.149 
like a boatload of effort on top of that
you<00:02:00.689> can<00:02:00.719> see<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.200> mechanism<00:02:01.649> itself<00:02:01.920> is

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
you can see that the mechanism itself is

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.730 
you can see that the mechanism itself is
pretty<00:02:02.700> big<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.270> pretty<00:02:03.750> bulky<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.500> can't

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
pretty big and pretty bulky and I can't

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.410 
pretty big and pretty bulky and I can't
imagine<00:02:04.860> many<00:02:05.280> people<00:02:05.610> wanting<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:05.969> build<00:02:06.180> it

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
imagine many people wanting to build it

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.419 
imagine many people wanting to build it
but<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.170> course<00:02:07.229> there<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> well<00:02:08.220> download
