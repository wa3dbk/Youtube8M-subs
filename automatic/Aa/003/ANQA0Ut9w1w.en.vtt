and they rode bicycles and they say this
kid<00:03:39.519> comes<00:03:39.790> home<00:03:39.970> from<00:03:40.090> school<00:03:40.180> but

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
kid comes home from school but

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.170 
kid comes home from school but
five-year-old<00:03:41.650> kitty<00:03:41.889> each<00:03:42.310> and<00:03:42.609> Apple<00:03:42.940> and

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
five-year-old kitty each and Apple and

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.969 
five-year-old kitty each and Apple and
his<00:03:43.659> blood<00:03:43.959> sugar<00:03:44.290> goes<00:03:44.470> up<00:03:44.650> just<00:03:44.680> a<00:03:44.949> little

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:44.979 
his blood sugar goes up just a little

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:46.439 
his blood sugar goes up just a little
bit<00:03:45.220> because<00:03:45.459> that's<00:03:45.729> what<00:03:45.909> happens<00:03:46.239> when<00:03:46.359> you

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
bit because that's what happens when you

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:47.879 
bit because that's what happens when you
eat<00:03:46.479> food<00:03:46.629> goes<00:03:46.989> up<00:03:47.169> just<00:03:47.379> a<00:03:47.440> little<00:03:47.500> bit<00:03:47.680> so

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
eat food goes up just a little bit so

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.680 
eat food goes up just a little bit so
the<00:03:47.979> pancreas<00:03:48.250> look<00:03:48.819> step<00:03:49.120> blood<00:03:49.329> sugar<00:03:49.599> and

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
the pancreas look step blood sugar and

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.509 
the pancreas look step blood sugar and
says<00:03:49.840> but<00:03:50.620> you're<00:03:50.859> going<00:03:51.040> up<00:03:51.159> a<00:03:51.250> little<00:03:51.400> I'm

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
says but you're going up a little I'm

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.830 
says but you're going up a little I'm
going<00:03:51.699> to<00:03:51.790> squirt<00:03:52.030> just<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.329> little<00:03:52.569> bit<00:03:52.659> of<00:03:52.750> an

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
going to squirt just a little bit of an

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.080 
going to squirt just a little bit of an
eyedropper<00:03:53.049> of<00:03:53.590> insulin<00:03:54.250> into<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:54.819> blood

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
eyedropper of insulin into the blood

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.149 
eyedropper of insulin into the blood
stream<00:03:55.239> so<00:03:55.419> it<00:03:55.810> can<00:03:56.049> kind<00:03:56.199> of<00:03:56.319> act<00:03:56.560> as<00:03:56.769> a<00:03:56.799> sugar

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
stream so it can kind of act as a sugar

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.729 
stream so it can kind of act as a sugar
Wrangler<00:03:57.879> it'll<00:03:58.419> take<00:03:58.599> that<00:03:58.780> sugar<00:03:59.109> and<00:03:59.379> it'll

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
Wrangler it'll take that sugar and it'll

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.199 
Wrangler it'll take that sugar and it'll
take<00:03:59.889> it<00:03:59.919> to<00:04:00.129> the<00:04:00.250> muscle<00:04:00.579> cells<00:04:00.819> because

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
take it to the muscle cells because

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.670 
take it to the muscle cells because
which<00:04:01.540> is<00:04:01.659> a<00:04:01.689> good<00:04:01.930> thing<00:04:02.079> because<00:04:02.199> they<00:04:02.439> need

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
which is a good thing because they need

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.439 
which is a good thing because they need
it<00:04:02.829> because<00:04:03.189> this<00:04:03.489> kid's<00:04:03.729> gonna<00:04:03.849> ride<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.150> bike

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:04.449 
it because this kid's gonna ride a bike

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.030 
it because this kid's gonna ride a bike
and<00:04:04.900> he's<00:04:05.079> going<00:04:05.260> to<00:04:05.349> play<00:04:05.470> some<00:04:05.650> football

and he's going to play some football
and<00:04:06.280> then<00:04:06.669> as<00:04:06.930> insulin<00:04:07.930> delivers<00:04:08.470> that<00:04:08.680> sugar

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
and then as insulin delivers that sugar

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.520 
and then as insulin delivers that sugar
to<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.370> muscle<00:04:09.729> cells<00:04:09.970> gets<00:04:10.299> used<00:04:10.629> up<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.079> the

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
to the muscle cells gets used up and the

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.559 
to the muscle cells gets used up and the
blood<00:04:11.769> sugar<00:04:12.129> drops<00:04:12.489> a<00:04:12.699> little<00:04:13.060> bit<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.359> kids

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
blood sugar drops a little bit and kids

cells<00:05:06.120> don't<00:05:06.300> you<00:05:06.449> worry<00:05:06.689> we're<00:05:07.110> going<00:05:07.229> to<00:05:07.319> get

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:07.379 
cells don't you worry we're going to get

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:09.140 
cells don't you worry we're going to get
the<00:05:07.529> blood<00:05:07.620> sugar<00:05:07.949> down<00:05:08.099> accept<00:05:08.789> it<00:05:08.909> start

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
the blood sugar down accept it start

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.820 
the blood sugar down accept it start
shoveling<00:05:09.659> it<00:05:09.750> into<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.080> muscle<00:05:10.379> cells<00:05:10.620> and

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
shoveling it into the muscle cells and

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.830 
shoveling it into the muscle cells and
the<00:05:11.400> muscle<00:05:11.699> cells<00:05:11.909> say<00:05:12.090> dude<00:05:12.300> we<00:05:12.509> don't<00:05:12.719> need

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
the muscle cells say dude we don't need

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.300 
the muscle cells say dude we don't need
this<00:05:13.050> stuff<00:05:13.319> when<00:05:13.500> you<00:05:13.590> bring<00:05:13.740> it<00:05:13.860> in<00:05:13.979> here<00:05:14.159> for

computer all day and when he gets home
he's<00:05:16.979> going<00:05:17.069> to<00:05:17.159> play<00:05:17.279> with<00:05:17.400> the<00:05:17.490> clicker<00:05:17.729> we

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
he's going to play with the clicker we

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.909 
he's going to play with the clicker we
don't<00:05:18.419> need<00:05:18.569> any<00:05:18.779> energy<00:05:19.199> take<00:05:19.439> that<00:05:19.680> stuff

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
don't need any energy take that stuff

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.010 
don't need any energy take that stuff
somewhere<00:05:20.189> else<00:05:20.550> now<00:05:21.120> insulin<00:05:21.629> doesn't<00:05:21.960> know

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
somewhere else now insulin doesn't know

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.170 
somewhere else now insulin doesn't know
what<00:05:22.169> to<00:05:22.199> do<00:05:22.439> so<00:05:22.919> it<00:05:23.069> takes<00:05:23.279> it<00:05:23.430> to<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.669> fat<00:05:23.909> so

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
what to do so it takes it to the fat so

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.079 
what to do so it takes it to the fat so
that's<00:05:24.539> all<00:05:24.810> say<00:05:24.990> come<00:05:25.319> on<00:05:25.349> in<00:05:25.589> and<00:05:26.219> they<00:05:26.759> start

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:27.089 
that's all say come on in and they start

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:28.760 
that's all say come on in and they start
to<00:05:27.210> fill<00:05:27.419> up<00:05:27.569> and<00:05:27.839> now<00:05:28.199> you<00:05:28.259> have<00:05:28.560> abdominal

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
to fill up and now you have abdominal

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.100 
to fill up and now you have abdominal
obesity<00:05:29.520> and<00:05:30.210> now<00:05:30.389> you<00:05:30.449> have<00:05:30.750> inflammation

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
obesity and now you have inflammation

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.309 
obesity and now you have inflammation
and<00:05:31.680> now<00:05:32.159> you<00:05:32.219> have<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.580> whole<00:05:33.300> hormone<00:05:33.659> of

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 
and now you have a whole hormone of

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.769 
and now you have a whole hormone of
hormonal<00:05:34.710> universe<00:05:35.219> designed<00:05:35.969> to<00:05:36.180> holding<00:05:36.599> on

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:36.779 
hormonal universe designed to holding on

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:39.409 
hormonal universe designed to holding on
to<00:05:36.990> that<00:05:37.139> weight<00:05:37.379> and<00:05:37.529> not<00:05:37.979> releasing<00:05:38.699> what's

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
to that weight and not releasing what's

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.159 
to that weight and not releasing what's
in<00:05:39.539> the<00:05:39.689> fat<00:05:39.870> cells<00:05:40.169> and<00:05:40.819> worse<00:05:41.819> if<00:05:42.810> this

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
in the fat cells and worse if this

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.579 
in the fat cells and worse if this
situation<00:05:43.520> continues<00:05:44.520> as<00:05:44.729> it<00:05:44.969> usually<00:05:45.210> does

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:45.589 
situation continues as it usually does

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:48.200 
situation continues as it usually does
you<00:05:46.589> continue<00:05:47.129> to<00:05:47.279> have<00:05:47.460> high<00:05:47.639> blood<00:05:47.879> sugar

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
you continue to have high blood sugar

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.839 
you continue to have high blood sugar
and<00:05:48.240> high<00:05:48.629> insulin<00:05:49.289> levels<00:05:49.680> at<00:05:49.889> some<00:05:50.550> point

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
and high insulin levels at some point

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.029 
and high insulin levels at some point
the<00:05:51.270> fat<00:05:51.539> cells<00:05:51.930> are<00:05:52.169> saying<00:05:52.409> hey<00:05:52.620> slow<00:05:52.949> down

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
the fat cells are saying hey slow down

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.860 
the fat cells are saying hey slow down
here<00:05:53.490> we<00:05:53.699> don't<00:05:53.849> need<00:05:54.029> any<00:05:54.210> more<00:05:54.419> and<00:05:54.659> this

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
here we don't need any more and this

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.990 
here we don't need any more and this
that<00:05:55.199> blood<00:05:55.469> sugars<00:05:55.800> got<00:05:55.979> nowhere<00:05:56.339> to<00:05:56.370> go<00:05:56.610> and

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
that blood sugars got nowhere to go and

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.420 
that blood sugars got nowhere to go and
now<00:05:57.419> you're<00:05:57.629> looking<00:05:58.020> at<00:05:58.110> diabetes<00:05:58.430> heart

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
now you're looking at diabetes heart

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.029 
now you're looking at diabetes heart
disease<00:05:59.550> metabolic<00:06:00.389> syndrome<00:06:01.169> and<00:06:01.349> a<00:06:01.740> whole

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
disease metabolic syndrome and a whole

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:03.589 
disease metabolic syndrome and a whole
bunch<00:06:02.069> of<00:06:02.339> stuff<00:06:02.550> you<00:06:02.580> really<00:06:03.000> don't<00:06:03.300> want<00:06:03.479> to

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
bunch of stuff you really don't want to

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:06.490 
bunch of stuff you really don't want to
have<00:06:03.750> and<00:06:03.990> it<00:06:04.409> all<00:06:04.680> really<00:06:05.460> comes<00:06:05.939> down<00:06:06.029> to

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
have and it all really comes down to

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.050 
have and it all really comes down to
elevated<00:06:07.500> blood<00:06:07.649> sugar<00:06:08.009> and<00:06:08.219> elevated

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
elevated blood sugar and elevated

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.479 
elevated blood sugar and elevated
insulin
