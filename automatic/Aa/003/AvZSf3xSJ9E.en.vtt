00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.850
 w3 arena net point and well it's very 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.800
 simple is above all a website but 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.340
 also a ladder parallel to that of 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.779
 battle net 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.910
 under a lot more active in the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.219
 so-called competitive parties ie the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.870
 gone in one against one and so if she 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.579
 wanted to finally progress in your 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.550
 game well I invite you to join 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.890
 this ladder 6 so we are on the site a 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.010
 of course with so the link that is here 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.030
 to avoid point w3 reina points is so 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.920
 of course do not hesitate to go over 1 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.289
 at the same time as you look at this 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.960
 video so what is it rather 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.809
 how to join this ladder and well 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.430
 it's very simple you so there we on the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.260
 home page of the site with so the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.050
 last replay the ladder they bossent 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.640
 on kept updated constantly and then 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.610
 so stream that are available 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.890
 to amaze your taste buds and 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.890
 wards earlier and so today we 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.000
 just going to install it so you have on 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.100
 this little quoditian finally 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.600
 dornach customers' tanks of the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.820
 customers of course you click on it 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.979
 simply download 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.119
 launch and then re able to install it 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.590
 quietly ramage and install there 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.500
 so I will not be able to go until 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.580
 end of the installation but it's like 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.950
 a software installation 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.630
 anyway so that's quite very 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.090
 very simple nex of course and so here 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.790
 there I can just modified repair or 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.479
 we move or remove it so I'm going 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.369
 especially not doing it 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.619
 so here we do a little bit 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.299
 understood the principle you ass there 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.200
 above our client and then you 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.240
 install it quietly on your 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.530
 computer so quite intuitive it 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.990
 is not there is no need to be a 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.520
 computer role hatches for for 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.430
 to be able to do that so no worries for 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.130
 where I think and suddenly then as soon as 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.170
 it's done and well do not hesitate too 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.729
 of course to cauchy put an icon on 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.329
 the office because we will need it 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.790
 this 6w iii arena icon where you go 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.810
 then click on it and so that 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.110
 it's a small patch of hours 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.850
 launch to and so the lines or c 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.980
 when global and the updates that 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.630
 are instantly installed and 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.580
 blow we get here on to then one 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.640
 So we have two servers from Europe and 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.050
 americans so here we see that everything is 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.090
 ok sorry then we will be able to play 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.720
 quietly we tick of course the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.860
 frozen throne 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.750
 apart if you want to play at the stop 9 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.850
 ko it's also possible then can 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.500
 also checked this small option succeeds 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.840
 so there it is for the game in mode 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.110
 windowed rcba you have quietly 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.240
 let them lings say the options 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.160
 but that I'll let you discover that 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.760
 by yourself and so we just have to 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.680
 click on john this boat join 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.090
 of course the battle is here so we get 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.560
 found on a windowed mode a small 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.000
 unusual because we can not 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.810
 remove the mouse a little bit like 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.959
 in league of legend 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.360
 it is necessary to do this way there 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.920
 So here we can quietly 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.180
 so reposition his frame and suddenly 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.440
 we are good we are good we are good 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.180
 So here I commit wish 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.470
 will be able to see the mouse here and suddenly 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.340
 so me it was going well it's very 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.800
 simple you're just going to join 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.150
 finally net battle and provide 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.830
 confirmation you then click on the 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.840
 selection of the portal is there in fact you 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.170
 can see we are on good w3 arena 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.450
 and no longer on their strain europe 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.549
 so we joined the ladder of w3 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.410
 arena ahead to ensure at click what 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.760
 on a leash and then it's like you 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.970
 join battle is simply 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.280
 you click on the bat net icon and you 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.030
 can you then create an account 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:35.120
 very very easily since it resumes 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.350
 the same the same mechanics as that 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.959
 Battle is no pitch 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.090
 big worries on it we will make a 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.010
 very simple tale that's just for 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.920
 you make a small corridor 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.200
 this is how it goes click ok 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.430
 so that's my account was created and so 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.170
 we just have to join w3 reda so 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:59.840
 the kids e-mail was less but it takes 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:01.010
 that m an e-mail address also to these 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.310
 threats but if he wanted to send me 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.750
 replays do not hesitate eh well I 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.560
 will be of course 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.570
 contactables available here is the picture 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.800
 the cup he was associated with the accounts and 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.470
 So we end up here 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.970
 on the ladder welcome to double 3 here 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.980
 so there we see when there 57 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.840
 users they are in 13 parts 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.610
 but if you have to know, they are 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.340
 all in the parts constrained so 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.260
 finally there are 57 who play eh 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.820
 Well, it's not bad 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.290
 it was not bad estimate you join 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.550
 there we feel even more so it's great 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.080
 and suddenly you have to play a game 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.930
 but it's very simple you put yourself 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.370
 play quietly and suddenly 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.370
 wanting to fight there is like when 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.590
 the boat nationally as the ladder 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.750
 basic ladder you select your 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.370
 bins that you want etc and then you 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.320
 can play one against one against 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.090
 guys and that's great style so here it is 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.130
 I hope this tutorial so we were 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.180
 clear enough for you huh but it was 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.380
 not make myself ask questions 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.680
 in the comments if it was not 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.480
 the case 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.430
 and then add the next for a 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.200
 video of warcraft iii commented on 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.360
 French but it's all then followed 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.160
 I plan to do ee there he goes on w3 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.169
 arena since my body yesterday my cursor 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.340
 does not look beyond windowed mode 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.910
 and so I can calmly 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.860
 navigate between the game and the different 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.080
 the different components of the live stream 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.520
 so it's going to be super super simple and 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.560
 blow me I tell you the next 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.360
 finally wear yourself well and then one 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.890
 Thank you all for having followed 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.340
 since big up 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.340
 ciao
