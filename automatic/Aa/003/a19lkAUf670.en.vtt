I'm<00:00:00.750> going<00:00:00.870> to<00:00:00.960> string<00:00:01.230> this<00:00:01.350> rocket<00:00:01.800> go<00:00:01.949> rack

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
I'm going to string this rocket go rack

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.329 
I'm going to string this rocket go rack
it<00:00:02.550> up<00:00:02.760> with<00:00:02.939> two<00:00:03.090> pieces<00:00:03.480> of<00:00:03.510> string<00:00:04.339> first

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
it up with two pieces of string first

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.039 
it up with two pieces of string first
thing<00:00:05.580> I'm<00:00:05.730> going<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:05.940> do<00:00:06.120> is<00:00:06.299> try<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.509> find<00:00:06.870> the

thing I'm going to do is try to find the

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.080 
thing I'm going to do is try to find the
center<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.379> my<00:00:07.649> string<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.429> divide<00:00:08.849> this

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
center of my string and divide this

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.189 
center of my string and divide this
string<00:00:09.420> in<00:00:09.570> half<00:00:14.299> I'm<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:15.480> putting<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.900> two

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
string in half I'm just putting the two

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.290 
string in half I'm just putting the two
ends<00:00:16.410> together<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:17.100> I'm<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:17.400> going<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.730> pull

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
ends together and I'm just going to pull

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.090 
ends together and I'm just going to pull
on<00:00:18.510> them<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.840> five<00:00:19.050> try<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.350> find<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.830> center

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
on them to five try to find the center

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.450 
on them to five try to find the center
of<00:00:20.160> my<00:00:20.400> string<00:00:24.320> okay<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.680> 40<00:00:26.039> feet<00:00:26.250> of

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
of my string okay this is 40 feet of

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.269 
of my string okay this is 40 feet of
string<00:00:26.810> right<00:00:27.810> here<00:00:27.869> would<00:00:28.470> be<00:00:28.500> 20<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.250> each

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
string right here would be 20 on each

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.389 
string right here would be 20 on each
side<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.179> right<00:00:30.420> here<00:00:30.660> would<00:00:30.960> be<00:00:31.070> if<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.160> had<00:00:32.189> a

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
side so right here would be if I had a

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.819 
side so right here would be if I had a
foot<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.540> has<00:00:33.750> been<00:00:33.780> 21<00:00:34.350> foot<00:00:34.530> for<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
foot to it this has been 21 foot for the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.549 
foot to it this has been 21 foot for the
mains<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.600> other<00:00:36.719> piece<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.350> got

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
mains and the other piece that I got

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.590 
mains and the other piece that I got
laying<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> floor<00:00:38.129> would<00:00:38.640> be<00:00:38.700> 19<00:00:39.300> feet

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
laying on the floor would be 19 feet

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.770 
laying on the floor would be 19 feet
long<00:00:40.489> so<00:00:41.489> I'm<00:00:41.610> just<00:00:41.850> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> begin<00:00:42.600> by

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
long so I'm just going to begin by

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.930 
long so I'm just going to begin by
pulling<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.350> two<00:00:43.649> center<00:00:44.040> main<00:00:44.250> displays<00:00:44.760> at

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
pulling the two center main displays at

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.529 
pulling the two center main displays at
the<00:00:45.090> same<00:00:45.329> time<00:00:47.570> i'm<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.870> set<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> clamp

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
the same time i'm going to set a clamp

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.970 
the same time i'm going to set a clamp
inside<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.750> frame<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.469> bottom<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.949> my

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
inside the frame on the bottom of my

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.400 
inside the frame on the bottom of my
rocket<00:00:53.579> away<00:00:53.910> from<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> tension<00:00:54.660> head<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.260> on

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
rocket away from the tension head and on

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.229 
rocket away from the tension head and on
that<00:00:55.559> same<00:00:55.949> string<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.610> i've<00:00:56.760> got<00:00:56.940> tension

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
that same string that i've got tension

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.799 
that same string that i've got tension
there<00:00:57.660> i'm<00:00:58.109> going<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.559> put<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.510> starting<00:01:00.510> clamp

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
there i'm going to put a starting clamp

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.959 
there i'm going to put a starting clamp
up<00:01:01.079> against<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.770> frame<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:02.340> tight<00:01:02.579> as<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.910> can

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
up against the frame as tight as I can

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.070 
up against the frame as tight as I can
get<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:04.339> that<00:01:05.339> keeps<00:01:05.640> tension<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.750> string

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
get it that keeps tension on this string

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.990 
get it that keeps tension on this string
right<00:01:07.110> here<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.189> when<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.369> pulled<00:01:08.790> this

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
right here so that when I pulled this

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.780 
right here so that when I pulled this
next<00:01:09.450> string<00:01:09.780> I'm<00:01:10.049> not<00:01:10.650> pulling<00:01:10.920> directly<00:01:11.610> on

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
next string I'm not pulling directly on

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.600 
next string I'm not pulling directly on
this<00:01:11.970> clamp<00:01:12.360> right<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.890> clamp<00:01:14.310> is

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
this clamp right here this clamp is

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.950 
this clamp right here this clamp is
backed<00:01:15.090> up<00:01:15.270> by<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.840> clamp<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.960> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
backed up by this clamp so that the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.469 
backed up by this clamp so that the
string<00:01:19.200> has<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.680> gold<00:01:20.159> less<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.970> chance<00:01:21.240> of

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
string has a gold less of a chance of

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.100 
string has a gold less of a chance of
sliding<00:01:21.869> through<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:23.570> I'm<00:01:24.570> now<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
sliding through that I'm now going to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.810 
sliding through that I'm now going to
pull<00:01:25.350> tension<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:27.020> top<00:01:28.020> two<00:01:28.290> strings<00:01:28.820> and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
pull tension on the top two strings and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.960 
pull tension on the top two strings and
start<00:01:30.180> my<00:01:30.360> crosses<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.409> method<00:01:32.250> similar<00:01:32.280> to

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
start my crosses in a method similar to

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.440 
start my crosses in a method similar to
what<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.180> used<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:34.220> starting<00:01:35.220> my<00:01:35.250> mains<00:01:35.640> I'm

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
what I used for starting my mains I'm

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
what I used for starting my mains I'm
going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.020> clamp<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.680> top<00:01:38.640> cross<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.450> far<00:01:39.960> from

quick<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:55.200> string<00:01:55.590> right<00:01:55.649> here<00:01:55.950> goes<00:01:56.729> into

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
quick this string right here goes into

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.899 
quick this string right here goes into
that<00:01:57.240> frame<00:01:58.170> just<00:01:58.560> about<00:01:58.860> perpendicular<00:01:59.700> to

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
that frame just about perpendicular to

the arc but this string right here has

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.300 
the arc but this string right here has
got<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.399> much<00:02:02.729> greater<00:02:03.090> angle<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.560> if<00:02:04.680> i<00:02:04.829> were<00:02:05.009> to

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
got a much greater angle so if i were to

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.280 
got a much greater angle so if i were to
clamp<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.939> string<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.570> put<00:02:06.719> my<00:02:06.869> starting

clamp this string and put my starting

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.010 
clamp this string and put my starting
clamp<00:02:07.530> here<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.950> would<00:02:08.099> be<00:02:08.250> angled<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:08.970> as<00:02:09.840> soon

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
clamp here it would be angled in as soon

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.080 
clamp here it would be angled in as soon
as<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.259> remove<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.770> tensioner<00:02:11.310> it's<00:02:11.580> going<00:02:11.879> to

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
as I remove the tensioner it's going to

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.030 
as I remove the tensioner it's going to
twist<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.080> slide<00:02:13.379> back<00:02:13.410> in

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
twist and slide back in

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.699 
twist and slide back in
like<00:02:14.129> that<00:02:14.370> where<00:02:15.239> this<00:02:15.450> one<00:02:15.719> will<00:02:15.959> slide<00:02:16.260> less

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
like that where this one will slide less

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.550 
like that where this one will slide less
I<00:02:17.069> can<00:02:17.939> pull<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.359> handle<00:02:18.810> just<00:02:19.049> a<00:02:19.170> little<00:02:19.409> bit

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
I can pull the handle just a little bit

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.890 
I can pull the handle just a little bit
to<00:02:19.769> get<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.099> angle<00:02:20.609> right<00:02:20.900> exactly

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
to get that angle right exactly

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.259 
to get that angle right exactly
perpendicular<00:02:22.459> but<00:02:23.459> I<00:02:23.489> just<00:02:23.730> want<00:02:23.939> to<00:02:24.000> get<00:02:24.120> it

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
perpendicular but I just want to get it

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.229 
perpendicular but I just want to get it
up<00:02:24.390> against<00:02:24.810> there<00:02:25.019> as<00:02:25.140> snug<00:02:25.439> as<00:02:25.469> I<00:02:25.739> can

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
up against there as snug as I can

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.059 
up against there as snug as I can
they'll<00:02:27.239> keep<00:02:27.540> tension<00:02:27.900> on<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.409> top<00:02:28.680> cross

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
they'll keep tension on this top cross

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.550 
they'll keep tension on this top cross
now<00:02:29.790> when<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.120> pull<00:02:30.390> tension<00:02:30.659> on<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.079> second

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
now when I pull tension on the second

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.280 
now when I pull tension on the second
cross<00:02:31.829> I'm<00:02:32.250> not<00:02:32.970> pulling<00:02:33.269> directly<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:33.989> this

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
cross I'm not pulling directly on this

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.170 
cross I'm not pulling directly on this
clamp<00:02:34.680> because<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.280> starting<00:02:35.700> clamp<00:02:35.970> is

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
clamp because the starting clamp is

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.039 
clamp because the starting clamp is
backing<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.750> up<00:02:37.849> so<00:02:38.849> now<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.030> miracle<00:02:39.569> tension

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
backing it up so now a miracle tension

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.709 
backing it up so now a miracle tension
on<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.799> second<00:02:41.280> cross<00:02:41.579> and<00:02:42.060> I'll<00:02:43.019> clamp<00:02:43.349> it

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:44.719 
on the second cross and I'll clamp it

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.289 
on the second cross and I'll clamp it
now<00:02:45.719> that<00:02:45.900> I've<00:02:46.019> got<00:02:46.230> dick<00:02:46.590> front<00:02:47.010> row<00:02:47.299> because

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
now that I've got dick front row because

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.240 
now that I've got dick front row because
I<00:02:48.480> pulled<00:02:48.750> both<00:02:48.989> of<00:02:49.230> these<00:02:49.319> strings<00:02:49.799> at<00:02:50.099> the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
I pulled both of these strings at the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.170 
I pulled both of these strings at the
same<00:02:50.519> time<00:02:51.230> this<00:02:52.230> string<00:02:52.889> has<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.669> reference

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
same time this string has the reference

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.360 
same time this string has the reference
tension<00:02:54.750> but<00:02:54.930> this<00:02:55.200> string<00:02:55.530> only<00:02:55.859> has<00:02:56.069> half

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
tension but this string only has half

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.050 
tension but this string only has half
that<00:02:56.700> reference<00:02:57.180> tension<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:58.560> before<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.340> move

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
that reference tension so before I move

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.869 
that reference tension so before I move
this<00:03:00.359> clamp<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:01.230> want<00:03:01.799> to<00:03:01.889> get<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.250> string<00:03:02.609> up

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
this clamp I want to get this string up

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.210 
this clamp I want to get this string up
to<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.329> reference<00:03:03.659> tension<00:03:04.260> when<00:03:04.829> I<00:03:04.889> pull

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
to the reference tension when I pull

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.179 
to the reference tension when I pull
tension<00:03:05.489> again<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.720> clamp<00:03:07.290> should<00:03:07.620> separate

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
tension again this clamp should separate

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.670 
tension again this clamp should separate
away<00:03:09.000> from<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.359> frame<00:03:09.659> let<00:03:09.959> me<00:03:10.109> get<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.290> little

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
away from the frame let me get a little

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.390 
away from the frame let me get a little
close<00:03:11.040> up<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.489> that<00:03:12.799> okay<00:03:13.799> I'm<00:03:13.980> going<00:03:14.099> to<00:03:14.189> pull

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
close up of that okay I'm going to pull

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.220 
close up of that okay I'm going to pull
tension<00:03:14.700> now<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.329> watch<00:03:15.480> this<00:03:15.720> clamp<00:03:16.019> move

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
tension now and watch this clamp move

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.800 
tension now and watch this clamp move
away<00:03:16.379> from<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.739> frame<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.389> the<00:03:18.389> reason<00:03:18.780> for

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
away from the frame and the reason for

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.740 
away from the frame and the reason for
that<00:03:19.019> is<00:03:19.409> because<00:03:19.760> this<00:03:20.760> string<00:03:21.479> wasn't

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
that is because this string wasn't

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.110 
that is because this string wasn't
tensioned<00:03:22.379> at<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.620> reference<00:03:22.979> tension<00:03:23.459> I'm

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
tensioned at the reference tension I'm

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.030 
tensioned at the reference tension I'm
going<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.359> slide<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.930> clamp<00:03:25.079> all<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.919> way

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
going to slide the clamp all the way

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.000 
going to slide the clamp all the way
into<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.549> frame<00:03:26.819> and<00:03:27.319> release<00:03:28.319> it<00:03:28.560> i<00:03:28.709> also

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
into the frame and release it i also

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.180 
into the frame and release it i also
want<00:03:29.579> this<00:03:29.699> clamp<00:03:30.060> down<00:03:30.449> in<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:30.930> position<00:03:31.530> so

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
want this clamp down in this position so

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.759 
want this clamp down in this position so
it<00:03:32.310> doesn't<00:03:32.609> get<00:03:32.669> hung<00:03:32.879> up<00:03:33.000> on<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.359> string<00:03:33.769> now

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
it doesn't get hung up on the string now

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.740 
it doesn't get hung up on the string now
i'm<00:03:34.949> going<00:03:35.099> to<00:03:35.159> go<00:03:35.310> through<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:36.180> string<00:03:36.540> all

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
i'm going to go through and string all

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.440 
i'm going to go through and string all
my<00:03:36.959> crosses
