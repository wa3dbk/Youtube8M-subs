00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530 
problem with this game is the opening

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.470 
problem with this game is the opening
screen<00:00:26.740> I'm<00:00:27.220> looking<00:00:27.520> for<00:00:27.880> something<00:00:28.240> fairly

screen I'm looking for something fairly
serious<00:00:29.140> to<00:00:29.350> learn<00:00:29.529> with<00:00:29.770> how<00:00:30.160> serious<00:00:30.670> does

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
serious to learn with how serious does

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.689 
serious to learn with how serious does
this<00:00:31.150> look<00:00:31.390> my<00:00:32.140> second<00:00:32.559> problem<00:00:32.739> is<00:00:33.039> with<00:00:33.399> Ed

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
this look my second problem is with Ed

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.180 
this look my second problem is with Ed
the<00:00:33.940> driving<00:00:34.329> instructor<00:00:34.649> not<00:00:35.649> only<00:00:35.800> does<00:00:36.010> he

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
the driving instructor not only does he

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.950 
the driving instructor not only does he
look<00:00:36.340> ridiculous<00:00:36.969> but<00:00:37.269> would<00:00:37.629> you<00:00:37.780> really

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
look ridiculous but would you really

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.630 
look ridiculous but would you really
trust<00:00:38.319> the<00:00:38.499> pair<00:00:38.710> of<00:00:38.800> eyes<00:00:38.949> like<00:00:39.219> that<00:00:39.399> to

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
trust the pair of eyes like that to

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.939 
trust the pair of eyes like that to
properly<00:00:40.059> judge<00:00:40.359> your<00:00:40.629> driving<00:00:41.079> I<00:00:41.260> don't

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
properly judge your driving I don't

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.119 
properly judge your driving I don't
think<00:00:42.010> so<00:00:42.219> the<00:00:43.120> game<00:00:43.300> has<00:00:43.600> two<00:00:43.899> modes<00:00:44.129> practice

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
think so the game has two modes practice

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.849 
think so the game has two modes practice
and<00:00:45.339> take<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:45.940> exam<00:00:46.389> before<00:00:47.139> you<00:00:47.350> torture

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
and take the exam before you torture

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:49.680 
and take the exam before you torture
yourself<00:00:48.010> with<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.579> exam<00:00:48.969> I'd<00:00:49.239> suggest

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
yourself with the exam I'd suggest

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.319 
yourself with the exam I'd suggest
practicing<00:00:50.549> controls<00:00:51.549> are<00:00:51.699> pretty<00:00:51.729> simple

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
practicing controls are pretty simple

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.539 
practicing controls are pretty simple
left<00:00:52.839> and<00:00:52.989> right<00:00:53.139> turn<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.530> wheel<00:00:53.679> forward<00:00:54.429> as

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:54.549 
left and right turn the wheel forward as

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:57.569 
left and right turn the wheel forward as
the<00:00:54.670> gas<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:55.179> back<00:00:55.600> is<00:00:55.839> reverse<00:00:56.459> notice<00:00:57.459> a

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
the gas and back is reverse notice a

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.729 
the gas and back is reverse notice a
problem<00:00:57.729> with<00:00:58.059> this<00:00:58.209> setup<00:00:58.479> how<00:00:59.409> about<00:00:59.589> the

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
problem with this setup how about the

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:06.180 
problem with this setup how about the
lack<00:00:59.949> of<00:00:59.979> a<00:01:00.219> break<00:01:00.519> button<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:05.530> order<00:01:05.710> to<00:01:05.920> come
