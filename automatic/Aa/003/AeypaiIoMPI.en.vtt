in the fall all the time you have a

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.500 
in the fall all the time you have a
perfect<00:02:35.860> combination<00:02:36.160> of<00:02:36.700> an<00:02:36.970> intense

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
development of orange coloration you may

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.039 
development of orange coloration you may
wonder<00:02:42.100> why<00:02:42.310> some<00:02:42.670> years<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.330> fall<00:02:43.569> color<00:02:43.840> is

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
wonder why some years the fall color is

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.420 
wonder why some years the fall color is
just<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.319> little<00:02:44.560> bit<00:02:44.680> more<00:02:44.860> intense<00:02:45.190> than

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
just a little bit more intense than

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.009 
just a little bit more intense than
other<00:02:45.670> years<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.090> that's<00:02:46.360> because<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:46.930> the

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
other years and that's because of the

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.710 
other years and that's because of the
development<00:02:47.230> those<00:02:47.590> anthocyanins

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720
