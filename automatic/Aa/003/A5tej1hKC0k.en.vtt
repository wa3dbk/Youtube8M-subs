yet<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.880> also<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.680> my<00:01:19.680> computer<00:01:20.220> now<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.400> just

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
yet and also it's my computer now I just

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.550 
yet and also it's my computer now I just
I<00:01:20.880> can't<00:01:21.150> even<00:01:21.240> work<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.990> mean<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.470> just

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
I can't even work on it I mean it's just

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.440 
I can't even work on it I mean it's just
that<00:01:22.890> everything<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.790> slow<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.299> takes

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
that everything is so slow it takes

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.149 
that everything is so slow it takes
forever<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.200> takes<00:01:25.409> like<00:01:25.590> three<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.920> four

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
forever it takes like three to four

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.120 
forever it takes like three to four
times<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.700> length<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.030> time<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.330> do<00:01:27.450> anything

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
times the length of time to do anything

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.280 
times the length of time to do anything
so<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.280> hurting<00:01:29.520> my<00:01:29.579> work<00:01:29.820> my<00:01:30.540> real<00:01:30.750> work<00:01:30.990> so

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
so it's hurting my work my real work so

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.990 
so it's hurting my work my real work so
that's<00:01:31.470> why<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.680> finally<00:01:32.369> decided<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.820> upgrade

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
that's why I finally decided to upgrade

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.840 
that's why I finally decided to upgrade
and<00:01:33.920> like<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.070> video<00:01:35.250> right<00:01:35.549> here<00:01:35.610> is

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
and like this video right here is

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.460 
and like this video right here is
probably<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.299> take<00:01:36.450> me<00:01:36.659> close<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.140> two

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
probably going to take me close to two

not saying that I'm any good at it

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.960 
not saying that I'm any good at it
because<00:03:24.200> I've<00:03:24.470> never<00:03:24.650> really<00:03:25.310> played<00:03:25.550> a<00:03:25.610> lot

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
because I've never really played a lot

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.729 
because I've never really played a lot
of<00:03:26.000> competitive<00:03:26.720> matches<00:03:26.930> so<00:03:27.260> I<00:03:27.290> have<00:03:27.410> no<00:03:27.590> idea

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
of competitive matches so I have no idea

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.710 
of competitive matches so I have no idea
how<00:03:28.160> I<00:03:28.190> will<00:03:28.520> do<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:28.970> don't<00:03:29.300> even<00:03:29.360> know<00:03:29.540> if<00:03:29.630> I

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
how I will do I don't even know if I

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.690 
how I will do I don't even know if I
will<00:03:29.870> do<00:03:30.080> well<00:03:30.290> but<00:03:31.900> I'd<00:03:32.900> like<00:03:33.080> to<00:03:33.260> try<00:03:33.380> it<00:03:33.470> out

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
will do well but I'd like to try it out

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.890 
will do well but I'd like to try it out

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
be competitive just because I wouldn't

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.800 
be competitive just because I wouldn't
have<00:03:46.130> teammates<00:03:46.370> or<00:03:46.700> anything<00:03:46.940> like<00:03:47.000> that<00:03:47.120> but
