overall<00:00:50.300> unfortunately<00:00:51.300> though<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.840> only

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
overall unfortunately though it's only

available<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.829> black<00:00:53.160> cover<00:00:53.969> here<00:00:54.239> at

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
available in this black cover here at

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.049 
available in this black cover here at
the<00:00:54.420> rear<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.930> no<00:00:55.500> white<00:00:55.829> or<00:00:56.100> pebble<00:00:56.730> blue<00:00:56.850> to

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
the rear of no white or pebble blue to

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.910 
the rear of no white or pebble blue to
match<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.449> existing<00:00:57.629> color<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> handset

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
match the existing color so the handset

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.650 
match the existing color so the handset
so<00:00:59.190> it's<00:00:59.399> not<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> most<00:00:59.789> attractive<00:00:59.940> thing

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
so it's not the most attractive thing

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.180 
so it's not the most attractive thing
especially<00:01:01.170> when<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.710> three<00:01:01.890> colors

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
especially when you have three colors

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.460 
especially when you have three colors
going<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> white<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.989> silver

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
going on you have the white the silver

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.289 
going on you have the white the silver
trim<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.010> course<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> black<00:01:05.610> but<00:01:06.150> luckily

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
trim and of course the black but luckily

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.830 
trim and of course the black but luckily
it<00:01:06.720> has<00:01:07.049> soft<00:01:07.350> touch<00:01:07.619> up<00:01:08.150> coating<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.659> it

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
it has soft touch up coating on it so it

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.830 
it has soft touch up coating on it so it
maintains<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.350> clean<00:01:10.619> appearance<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:12.150> just

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
maintains a clean appearance so just

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.060 
maintains a clean appearance so just
removing<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.500> same<00:01:13.650> way<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:13.979> with

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
removing it the same way you do with

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.010 
removing it the same way you do with
normal<00:01:14.549> casing<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.330> gotta<00:01:15.509> pry<00:01:15.780> up<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
normal casing you just gotta pry up the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.450 
normal casing you just gotta pry up the
top<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> little<00:01:16.830> bit<00:01:16.950> difficult<00:01:17.130> to

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
top it's a little bit difficult to

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.270 
top it's a little bit difficult to
remove<00:01:18.240> but<00:01:19.170> once<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.100> have

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
remove but once you have it you have

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.609 
remove but once you have it you have
your<00:01:20.700> gain<00:01:20.880> access<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.570> battery<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.080> you

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
your gain access to the battery and you

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.350 
your gain access to the battery and you
can<00:01:22.770> see<00:01:22.920> there<00:01:23.159> how<00:01:23.430> big<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.820> battery<00:01:24.240> is

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
can see there how big the battery is

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.530 
can see there how big the battery is
it's<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:25.290> really<00:01:25.619> sticks<00:01:25.890> out<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:27.060> there<00:01:27.330> but

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
it's it really sticks out on there but

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.969 
it's it really sticks out on there but
