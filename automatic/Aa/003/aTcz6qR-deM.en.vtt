 to search for cali / colombia 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.490
 and this already added me let's put the city 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.510
 for example right now we go to the network 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.120
 world 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.470
 for the fair 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:22.620
 It is not worth looking for a follow to Brazil 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.690
 he immediately has me shows the the 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.950
 weather brasilia we wet him suddenly that 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.950
 let's go to Paris 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.940
 paris france we already have the weather in 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.860
 france and let's put a climate that 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.340
 it's very cold with that of for example 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.340
 toronto 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.740
 Toronto Canada 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.720
 as you will see are new grades and 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.460
 I can immediately select each 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.280
 city of these and I want to see the climate of 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.680
 Bogota I give him to make a new 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.610
 speaker or by the calling of brasilia 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.430
 paris toronto we go to the configuration 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.360
 If you want to eliminate some this city 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.310
 just what and selected it by giving it 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.770
 clicking or sliding your finger towards the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.650
 left we will include from brasilia let's go 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.080
 to eliminate seems to eliminate everything delete 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.850
 and we give the one from BogotÃ¡ and I call now 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.890
 this application suddenly we do not like 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.230
 Well, we can simply download more 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.420
 weather widgets from the app store me 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.580
 I call the app store here 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.770
 let's read widgets i already wrote widgets 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.210
 then we can be more specific and 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.630
 give them weather widgets 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.300
 We give you a good look for the weather that 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.690
 I'll take it out, I'm wrong, it'll take me out 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:49.010
 one just for free and the other payments 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.450
 here we have one worth 0 99 dollars this 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.370
 It is the only one that appears as free 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.370
 super meteo then let's download it 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.370
 install 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.200
 one hour the key is standing again 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.970
 massa I will not look for the form that does not give 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.210
 so much the key because the truth is 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.210
 What is it 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.940
 how to enter the car is this 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.940
 key 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.590
 I will look for the form of energy both 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:23.290
 key and I will teach them 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:26.409
 Avn should have already started the download 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.079
 I'm not bad, we can configure that we 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.969
 ask for the fingerprint instead of the 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.189
 key is a much more procedure 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:34.900
 fast power of suddenly making 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:37.209
 application downloads simply 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.069
 we put the footprint and ready without error to 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.430
 suddenly make a mistake on a key in 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.430
 the key 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.110
 next video I showed you how it's done
