hey everybody welcome back today we're
going<00:00:12.629> to<00:00:12.780> talk<00:00:12.990> about<00:00:13.170> our<00:00:13.469> raised<00:00:13.709> garden

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
going to talk about our raised garden

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.400 
going to talk about our raised garden
beds<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:15.000> can<00:00:15.150> see<00:00:15.330> them<00:00:15.510> over<00:00:15.809> my<00:00:15.959> shoulder

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
beds you can see them over my shoulder

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.010 
beds you can see them over my shoulder
behind<00:00:16.560> me<00:00:16.920> we<00:00:17.789> have<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.210> use<00:00:18.359> raised<00:00:18.660> garden

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
behind me we have to use raised garden

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.140 
behind me we have to use raised garden
beds<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.529> Colorado<00:00:20.070> Springs<00:00:20.250> because<00:00:20.789> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
beds in Colorado Springs because the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.300 
beds in Colorado Springs because the
soil<00:00:21.390> here<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.590> bad

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
soil here is so so bad

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.400 
soil here is so so bad
most<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.849> our<00:00:23.970> soil<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.449> like<00:00:24.630> gravel<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.289> it's

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
most of our soil is like gravel and it's

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.560 
most of our soil is like gravel and it's
just<00:00:25.619> tough<00:00:25.829> to<00:00:25.859> grow<00:00:26.159> anything<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.999> so<00:00:27.390> we

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
just tough to grow anything in it so we

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.259 
just tough to grow anything in it so we
do<00:00:27.779> use<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.289> raised<00:00:28.499> beds<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:29.699> build<00:00:29.939> deep

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
do use the raised beds we build deep

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.720 
do use the raised beds we build deep
beds<00:00:30.630> with<00:00:31.019> really<00:00:31.349> good<00:00:31.499> soil<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.489> build

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
beds with really good soil and we build

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.180 
beds with really good soil and we build
the<00:00:32.880> soil<00:00:33.090> on-site<00:00:33.720> we<00:00:33.900> don't<00:00:34.140> bring<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.470> in<00:00:34.650> so

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
the soil on-site we don't bring it in so

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.880 
the soil on-site we don't bring it in so
we<00:00:35.220> use<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.880> lasagna<00:00:36.540> layering<00:00:37.260> method<00:00:37.620> of

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
we use the lasagna layering method of

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.080 
we use the lasagna layering method of
soil<00:00:38.430> building<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:39.270> use<00:00:39.480> straw<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:40.470> use

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
soil building we use straw we use

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.460 
soil building we use straw we use
composted<00:00:42.090> chicken<00:00:42.120> manure<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:43.290> use

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
composted chicken manure we use

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.110 
composted chicken manure we use
composted<00:00:44.100> rabbit<00:00:44.430> manure<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.880> those<00:00:44.970> are

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
composted rabbit manure and those are

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.700 
composted rabbit manure and those are
from<00:00:45.240> our<00:00:45.480> chickens<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.050> our<00:00:46.170> rabbits<00:00:46.530> and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
from our chickens and our rabbits and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.470 
from our chickens and our rabbits and
we've<00:00:47.220> been<00:00:47.370> building<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.760> soil<00:00:47.940> these<00:00:48.210> beds

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
we've been building the soil these beds

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.480 
we've been building the soil these beds
now<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:48.900> about<00:00:49.080> two<00:00:49.350> or<00:00:49.380> three<00:00:49.560> years<00:00:49.770> depends

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
now for about two or three years depends

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.920 
now for about two or three years depends
on<00:00:50.580> the<00:00:50.700> bed<00:00:50.880> some<00:00:51.150> are<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> little<00:00:51.420> older<00:00:51.810> than

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
on the bed some are a little older than

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.370 
on the bed some are a little older than
others<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:54.000> soil<00:00:54.360> when<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.840> get<00:00:54.990> down<00:00:55.140> in

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
others and the soil when you get down in

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.280 
others and the soil when you get down in
it<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.680> beautiful<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.700> black<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.600> holds<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.080> lot

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
it is beautiful and black it holds a lot

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.560 
it is beautiful and black it holds a lot
of<00:00:58.350> water<00:00:58.650> has<00:00:59.310> a<00:00:59.340> ton<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.700> nutrients<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.450> it

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
of water has a ton of nutrients in it

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.970 
of water has a ton of nutrients in it
and<00:01:00.720> the<00:01:00.780> plants<00:01:01.110> are<00:01:01.200> pretty<00:01:01.380> happy<00:01:01.650> in<00:01:01.860> that

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and the plants are pretty happy in that

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.090 
and the plants are pretty happy in that
soil<00:01:02.310> now<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:02.970> may<00:01:03.240> ask<00:01:03.420> why<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
soil now you may ask why we have the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.240 
soil now you may ask why we have the
raised<00:01:05.369> beds<00:01:05.820> if<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.659> have<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.140> greenhouse<00:01:07.979> in

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
raised beds if we have a greenhouse in

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.010 
raised beds if we have a greenhouse in
an<00:01:08.340> aquaponic<00:01:08.939> system<00:01:09.329> that<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.810> grow<00:01:09.990> in

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
an aquaponic system that we can grow in

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.340 
an aquaponic system that we can grow in
the<00:01:10.860> raised<00:01:11.130> beds<00:01:11.550> are<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.210> our<00:01:12.420> more<00:01:12.870> deeply

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the raised beds are for our more deeply

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.560 
the raised beds are for our more deeply
rooted<00:01:13.380> plants<00:01:14.130> they<00:01:14.250> do<00:01:14.310> better<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
rooted plants they do better in the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.930 
rooted plants they do better in the
raised<00:01:15.750> beds<00:01:16.080> for<00:01:16.770> instance<00:01:17.070> our<00:01:17.190> Swiss<00:01:17.550> chard

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
raised beds for instance our Swiss chard

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.990 
raised beds for instance our Swiss chard
seems<00:01:18.690> to<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.080> better<00:01:19.110> with<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.100> deep<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
seems to do better with the deep the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.969 
seems to do better with the deep the
beetroot<00:01:21.720> they're<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> member<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> beet

beetroot they're a member of the beet

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.890 
beetroot they're a member of the beet
family<00:01:23.400> they<00:01:23.760> have<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> deep<00:01:24.150> taproot<00:01:24.479> they<00:01:24.840> do

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
family they have a deep taproot they do

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.740 
family they have a deep taproot they do
really<00:01:25.229> well<00:01:25.380> as<00:01:25.740> do<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.070> onions<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:27.030> carrots

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
really well as do the onions the carrots

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.620 
really well as do the onions the carrots
we<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:28.170> leeks<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.710> these<00:01:28.860> beds<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.909> some<00:01:30.510> of

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
we have leeks in these beds and some of

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.630 
we have leeks in these beds and some of
the<00:01:30.690> plants<00:01:31.050> that<00:01:31.110> spread<00:01:31.470> out<00:01:31.620> a<00:01:31.860> little<00:01:32.370> bit

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
the plants that spread out a little bit

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.460 
the plants that spread out a little bit
more<00:01:32.909> than<00:01:33.150> we<00:01:33.330> are<00:01:33.450> comfortable<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:33.900> inside

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
more than we are comfortable with inside

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.710 
more than we are comfortable with inside
the<00:01:34.620> greenhouse<00:01:34.830> so<00:01:35.190> these<00:01:35.370> are<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.909> secondary

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the greenhouse so these are a secondary

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.530 
the greenhouse so these are a secondary
growing<00:01:37.170> system<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.920> are<00:01:37.950> able<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.790> grow<00:01:39.240> in

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
growing system we are able to grow in

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.870 
growing system we are able to grow in
these<00:01:39.720> beds<00:01:39.960> year-round<00:01:40.320> we<00:01:41.040> can<00:01:41.220> put<00:01:41.400> plastic

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
these beds year-round we can put plastic

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.330 
these beds year-round we can put plastic
on<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.270> beds<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.530> fall<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.310> winter

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
on the beds for the fall and the winter

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.130 
on the beds for the fall and the winter
and<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.909> spring<00:01:45.060> we<00:01:45.720> actually<00:01:45.990> put

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
and the spring we actually put

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.320 
and the spring we actually put
greenhouse<00:01:46.590> glazing<00:01:47.130> over<00:01:47.340> these<00:01:47.670> hoops<00:01:48.000> and

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
greenhouse glazing over these hoops and

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.690 
greenhouse glazing over these hoops and
we<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.140> actually<00:01:49.530> grow<00:01:49.710> four<00:01:50.040> seasons<00:01:50.549> here

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
we can actually grow four seasons here

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.789 
we can actually grow four seasons here
which<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> pretty<00:01:51.270> nice<00:01:51.479> trick<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.080> Colorado

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
which is a pretty nice trick in Colorado

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
this whole thing collapses so you've got

what<00:02:43.819> that<00:02:43.850> does<00:02:44.360> is<00:02:44.810> it<00:02:44.959> creates<00:02:45.080> a<00:02:45.410> space<00:02:45.680> in

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
what that does is it creates a space in

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.070 
what that does is it creates a space in
between<00:02:46.600> that<00:02:47.600> holds<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.980> material<00:02:49.610> in<00:02:50.080> a

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
between that holds the material in a

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.440 
between that holds the material in a
semi-rigid<00:02:51.620> fashion<00:02:52.280> so<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:52.730> can<00:02:53.060> move<00:02:53.300> them

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
semi-rigid fashion so you can move them

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.780 
semi-rigid fashion so you can move them
up<00:02:53.630> just<00:02:54.200> like<00:02:54.319> a<00:02:54.440> shade<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:55.370> can<00:02:55.400> move<00:02:55.670> them

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
up just like a shade you can move them

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.809 
up just like a shade you can move them
right<00:02:56.000> back<00:02:56.209> down<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:57.380> in<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.650> winter<00:02:58.400> when<00:02:58.700> we

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
right back down so in the winter when we

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.150 
right back down so in the winter when we
have<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.239> greenhouse<00:02:59.630> glazing<00:03:00.170> on<00:03:00.290> we<00:03:00.980> have

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
have the greenhouse glazing on we have

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.120 
have the greenhouse glazing on we have
it<00:03:01.190> all<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.489> way<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.420> boards<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.230> we<00:03:03.620> put

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
it all the way to the boards and we put

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.070 
it all the way to the boards and we put

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
it all the way down and it seals just

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.840 
it all the way down and it seals just
like<00:03:06.260> a<00:03:06.290> little<00:03:06.500> greenhouse<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.250> then<00:03:07.610> if<00:03:07.730> we

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
like a little greenhouse and then if we

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.240 
like a little greenhouse and then if we
get<00:03:07.970> a<00:03:08.000> hot<00:03:08.299> day<00:03:08.600> which<00:03:09.170> we<00:03:09.380> sometimes<00:03:09.620> do<00:03:10.100> in

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
get a hot day which we sometimes do in

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.250 
get a hot day which we sometimes do in
Colorado<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.910> winter<00:03:11.150> temperatures<00:03:11.810> can<00:03:12.110> be

Colorado the winter temperatures can be

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.500 
Colorado the winter temperatures can be
in<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.560> 60s<00:03:13.040> we<00:03:13.549> can<00:03:13.730> raise<00:03:13.970> these<00:03:14.239> back<00:03:14.480> up

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
in the 60s we can raise these back up
