using<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.540> USCS<00:02:51.019> 12<00:02:51.349> that's<00:02:51.620> fine<00:02:51.860> you<00:02:52.099> can<00:02:52.129> go

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
using the USCS 12 that's fine you can go

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.369 
using the USCS 12 that's fine you can go
ahead<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.550> do<00:02:52.700> so<00:02:52.730> but<00:02:53.450> in<00:02:53.569> my<00:02:53.599> opinion<00:02:53.870> I

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
ahead and do so but in my opinion I

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.259 
ahead and do so but in my opinion I
think<00:02:54.410> it<00:02:54.769> would<00:02:54.920> take<00:02:55.160> more<00:02:55.459> skills<00:02:55.849> to<00:02:56.030> use<00:02:56.060> a

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
think it would take more skills to use a

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.540 
think it would take more skills to use a
shotgun<00:02:56.690> after<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.590> patch<00:02:57.830> rather<00:02:58.280> than

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
shotgun after the patch rather than

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.360 
shotgun after the patch rather than
prior<00:02:59.239> to<00:02:59.629> so<00:03:00.260> really<00:03:00.500> when<00:03:00.769> they're<00:03:00.950> calling

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
prior to so really when they're calling

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.309 
prior to so really when they're calling
people<00:03:01.700> noobs<00:03:02.000> for<00:03:02.360> using<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:02.810> weapon<00:03:03.049> I

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
people noobs for using this weapon I

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.839 
people noobs for using this weapon I
think<00:03:03.620> it's<00:03:03.830> kind<00:03:04.069> of<00:03:04.129> incorrect<00:03:04.610> because

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
think it's kind of incorrect because

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.289 
think it's kind of incorrect because
obviously<00:03:05.629> it's<00:03:06.140> nerve<00:03:06.349> down<00:03:06.590> so<00:03:06.920> much<00:03:07.190> that

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
obviously it's nerve down so much that

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.360 
obviously it's nerve down so much that
out<00:03:08.299> of<00:03:08.569> all<00:03:08.660> things<00:03:09.019> it<00:03:09.410> probably<00:03:09.860> takes<00:03:10.040> more

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
out of all things it probably takes more

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.130 
out of all things it probably takes more
skill<00:03:10.519> to<00:03:10.760> use<00:03:10.840> hopefully<00:03:11.840> I<00:03:11.870> didn't<00:03:12.110> confuse

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
skill to use hopefully I didn't confuse

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.860 
skill to use hopefully I didn't confuse
you<00:03:12.560> there<00:03:12.860> let<00:03:13.489> me<00:03:13.580> explain<00:03:13.700> okay<00:03:14.510> if<00:03:14.690> you're
