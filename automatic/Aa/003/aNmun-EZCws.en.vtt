00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:14.299
 very good friends and support friends and 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.390
 My name is Pablo MartÃ­nez and I've 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.720
 seen in the application making a video 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:23.060
 with so much catastrophism and with so much 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.009
 conspiracy theory well then that 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.339
 I was around since windows came out 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.589
 a second that I have here the band the 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.890
 band of the yard that the 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.890
 Wifi 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.780
 sorry I could not make a quick video 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.690
 from home via windows 10 it is 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.129
 everyone 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.890
 feeling / what is usually said to me 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.629
 is euphoria me such a theory of 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.710
 conspiracy not as I was commenting 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.739
 the both the world worried but for 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.050
 what because windows 10 d is that sends your 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.350
 data to microsoft 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.860
 okay your data is not my 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.020
 kisses and noses so that they do 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.020
 the operating system better not take it 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.610
 doing from office 2007 but if I do not 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.290
 I'm wrong collecting a little bit that is 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.850
 what the user does and listening to 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.409
 requests from users and such 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.530
 to be able to improve their systems 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.119
 they support to a large extent because it is going to 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.340
 based on the collection of data for 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.800
 self improve what then I think that 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.899
 this is pretty good but good xxi 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.940
 without going into detail for those who are 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.450
 the data and everyone is very 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.250
 worried is everything a wagon is that 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.970
 windows god sends data for out already 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.070
 clear and the Trojans also 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.950
 maybe you have 15 Trojans in your 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.650
 machine or you do not have windows 7 windows 7 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.110
 and you have 50 Trojans tucked in that are 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.610
 sending out information to be 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.460
 I could give the case 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.150
 it could be the case pay attention to 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.150
 what I am going to say 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.360
 you know, imagine 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.159
 close your eyes and think this one page 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.520
 Web 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.470
 in which you enter 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.800
 and you register and when you register 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.920
 you accept a license agreement and in 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.110
 this contract you are accepting that 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.010
 use your data for practically everything 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.680
 what do you want 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.990
 imagine a web 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.580
 let's put wire imagine that 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.430
 will call facebook 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.920
 there does not worry us there is not how we are 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.040
 with the gossip there goes people counting 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.080
 his life telling his movies 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.760
 oh and no we are not worried about data 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.310
 we are worried about the microsoft windows 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:51.640
 but facebook and the Trojans do not 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:54.040
 the phising I do not say no because they are not 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.890
 of windows is the only operating system 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.110
 of the world that has Trojans now we're going 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.230
 well and there's the phishing is also just 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.940
 exclusive windows and on facebook only 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.280
 it works on windows and on twitter too 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.790
 and all these web moves to see 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.129
 friends friends please 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.739
 relaxed a bit away a bit because 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:17.400
 at the end of the day the truth that we're going 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.720
 giving away our information 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.090
 for example when you have a 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.400
 conversation on facebook chat texts 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.010
 those are also keeping out there and 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.879
 we do not care so much about it 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.590
 private conversations we have with 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.510
 people are saving 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.019
 There is a concern that worries that 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.470
 microsoft extract data from the use of 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.000
 systems we install that yes it is 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.800
 worrying 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.020
 but it goes with a little more 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.470
 of calm, let's be a little more objective 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:50.470
 and if we are so worried if we are so 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.670
 I'm worried about privacy 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.380
 first thing we would have to do is 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.890
 close all accounts networks 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.500
 social sell the team 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.709
 go and live in the mountains in plan 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.100
 half and there does not have the problem that 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.540
 you are going to have enough privacy 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.519
 enough more so 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.840
 a little bit of blacks of you do 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.359
 comments that you think this I'm 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.280
 saying I think if it costs too bad 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:19.820
 well what microsoft does 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.240
 great but sometimes it seems a bit 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:27.100
 absurd as people turn both 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.100
 put your hands to your head 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.210
 for the things of microsoft when it does 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.980
 years that we are suffering from this type 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.690
 from problems 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.690
 and there is no commotion every day 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.370
 let's think a little 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.150
 see you in the next video friends 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.150
 then
