00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
could see plastic on mines pretty clear

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
never completely clear but they always

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.459 
never completely clear but they always
had<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> problem<00:00:36.570> especially<00:00:36.780> if<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.200> let<00:00:37.380> them

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
had a problem especially if you let them

in the sunlight it faded into a really
awful<00:00:42.379> yellowy<00:00:44.300> because<00:00:45.300> if<00:00:45.420> 70<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.050> almost

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
awful yellowy because if 70 is almost

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.180 
awful yellowy because if 70 is almost
looking<00:00:47.120> yellow<00:00:48.410> but<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.590> came<00:00:49.770> with<00:00:49.920> all<00:00:50.010> the

attachment compartment I try and be
careful<00:01:03.510> with<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.140> not<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.439> strongest

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
careful with it it's not the strongest

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.470 
careful with it it's not the strongest
plastic<00:01:05.549> unlike<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.380 

thing<00:01:11.110> actually<00:01:11.500> says<00:01:11.680> it<00:01:11.830> is<00:01:11.950> not<00:01:12.310> EVs<00:01:12.970> as<00:01:13.150> far

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
thing actually says it is not EVs as far

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.200 
thing actually says it is not EVs as far
as<00:01:13.510> I<00:01:13.659> know<00:01:13.720> it<00:01:14.050> was<00:01:14.170> actually<00:01:14.620> acrylic<00:01:15.310> which

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
as I know it was actually acrylic which

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.980 
as I know it was actually acrylic which
is<00:01:16.240> not<00:01:16.570> nearly<00:01:16.840> as<00:01:17.080> strong<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:19.090> it<00:01:19.690> came<00:01:19.930> with

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
is not nearly as strong and it came with

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.180 
is not nearly as strong and it came with
this<00:01:20.470> hose<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.960> wand<00:01:22.960> and<00:01:23.260> floor<00:01:23.560> tool<00:01:23.830> did

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
this hose and wand and floor tool did

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.670 
this hose and wand and floor tool did
not<00:01:24.340> come<00:01:24.640> with<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:24.850> power<00:01:25.119> nozzle<00:01:25.690> but<00:01:26.320> it<00:01:26.440> does

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
not come with a power nozzle but it does

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.420 
not come with a power nozzle but it does
have<00:01:27.130> all<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.670> wiring<00:01:27.940> for<00:01:28.540> it<00:01:29.880> inside<00:01:32.430> but

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
have all the wiring for it inside but

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.510 
have all the wiring for it inside but
you<00:01:33.610> can<00:01:33.759> see<00:01:33.970> when<00:01:34.119> I<00:01:34.150> open<00:01:34.600> this<00:01:34.750> up<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:36.400> can

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
you can see when I open this up you can

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.340 
you can see when I open this up you can
actually<00:01:36.700> see<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.300> wires<00:01:37.540> in<00:01:37.930> there<00:01:38.110> so<00:01:38.259> you

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
actually see the wires in there so you

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.020 
actually see the wires in there so you
can<00:01:38.380> use<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:38.890> power<00:01:39.190> nozzle<00:01:39.580> with<00:01:39.700> it<00:01:39.820> if<00:01:39.910> you

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
can use a power nozzle with it if you

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.650 
can use a power nozzle with it if you
want<00:01:40.270> to

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
want to

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.180

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
see the way they designed it inside you

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.440 
see the way they designed it inside you
can<00:01:52.210> see<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.660> cord<00:01:53.350> winder<00:01:53.920> oh<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:55.210> good

light<00:01:56.140> here<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:57.640> can<00:01:57.789> see<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.090> cord<00:01:58.420> winder

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
light here you can see the cord winder

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:59.520 
light here you can see the cord winder
in<00:01:59.080> there

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
in there

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.100 
in there
this<00:02:00.430> little<00:02:00.640> vent<00:02:01.030> tube<00:02:01.330> that<00:02:01.570> goes<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:01.990> the

this little vent tube that goes to the
bag<00:02:02.320> chamber<00:02:02.920> so<00:02:03.430> it<00:02:03.550> sucks<00:02:03.850> in<00:02:04.090> air<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:10.660> side

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
bag chamber so it sucks in air this side

you<00:02:12.850> can<00:02:12.880> see<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.450> motor<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:15.480> what<00:02:16.480> they<00:02:16.630> were

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
you can see the motor and what they were

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.570 
you can see the motor and what they were
really<00:02:17.260> showing<00:02:17.530> off<00:02:17.799> by<00:02:18.070> this<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.430> the

completely sealed vacuum cleaner this

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.530 
completely sealed vacuum cleaner this
one<00:02:26.620> was<00:02:26.799> the<00:02:26.829> first<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.820> first<00:02:28.180> officially
