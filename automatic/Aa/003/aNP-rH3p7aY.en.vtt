 welcome plus a golden rose boot 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.289
 all viewers 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.150
 we start with the zilda question 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.189
 She wants to know the following. 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.440
 the minimum age for the child to 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.140
 choose who to stay when parents 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.040
 if they separate, there is no such age 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.809
 but children are consulted 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.340
 especially when you are 12 years old 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.370
 during adolescence 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:53.399
 according to the eca nÃ© and therefore is 12 years is 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.050
 more or less the age that you consult more 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.070
 there is no consultation in the law 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.649
 specific 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.989
 asked thais oliveira 18 was married 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.449
 For two years I separated. 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.000
 child under one year of age was 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.430
 16 weeks after the birth of 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.260
 second son, the first one lived with the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.720
 with my maternal grandmother because I'm 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.000
 unemployed I wanted to know if only the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.340
 second, the child is entitled to a pension 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.090
 or if I also have already I am 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.549
 unemployed 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.659
 see the pension is due for two reasons 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.909
 for paternity and is for the relationship is 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.829
 family is established by marriage 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.110
 by the union state and by a third party 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.600
 reason for the relationship of kinship 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.320
 at first only the child would have 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.869
 right 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.570
 but if you prove the necessity of this 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.540
 pension and have not been unable to 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.210
 subsistence it is possible to require 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.829
 also to the pension but I find it difficult to judge 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.420
 deferred will be restricted to the child 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.240
 guilherme's question and says I have one 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.040
 stepfather who has been with 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.310
 My mother bought a property 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.049
 recently a stepfather has some 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.590
 right over the property that my mother 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.479
 has actually got when there is a 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.520
 coexistence here in the form of union 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.879
 stable and even if it has not 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.740
 contributed financially the stf 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.840
 supreme federal court already has 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.760
 Diego has a summary in this sense that 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.730
 there is moral aid 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.250
 spiritual support then support the 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.960
 truth is confused this issue very 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.190
 there is only one of the spouses or cohabitants 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.740
 contributed to the acquisition of the property 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.760
 not if they live together they have a 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.460
 construction of joint life and the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.140
 moral support to be together is 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.360
 significant he is entitled to 50% 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.280
 ask is for a viewer who does not 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.230
 if he identifies he says I do not get along 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.200
 with my father only with my mother 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.460
 I'm an only child, my name is a car. 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.320
 and an apartment 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.150
 What can I do to ensure that 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.250
 If anything happens to me, case 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.150
 I die only, my mother is entitled to 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.120
 my goods 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.210
 you can make a will and leave the 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.070
 your mother the available part because there 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.770
 necessary heirs beyond the 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.170
 necessary children are descendants 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.540
 grandchildren and ascendants grandparents 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.970
 then you can actually leave the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.460
 available part of the inheritance 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.060
 for you, your mother, through a 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.770
 testament question from luciane my father 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.320
 only assumed me as a daughter when I did 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.930
 41 years never gave me any kind of 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.820
 pension aid and do not even contact me 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.350
 just registered me because I joined with a 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.360
 Related searches 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.100
 I can come up with another action to 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.630
 ask for compensation some help 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.060
 due to this lack of 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.610
 contribution to the organization you do not 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.100
 can and does not require what is no longer 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.190
 paid as a child support until then 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.560
 but from now on if you prove the 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.600
 your need and the possibility of your 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.330
 father to pay for food you can 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.310
 to apply to the courts for the 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.920
 if the judge understands that you 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.110
 has need he has possibility is 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.720
 that these foods will be paid but not 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.150
 It's retroactive, it's not already, it's not, it's not 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.620
 even retroactive because recognition 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.240
 of paternity occurred only at 41 years 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.100
 question of Maria Ferreira she says I 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.440
 I live in a stable marriage with a man 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.570
 who is still married on paper but is already 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.850
 separate long we 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.500
 buying a house i would like to know 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.590
 if his ex- wife is entitled to this 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.660
 You have no right it is possible to 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.270
 coexistence in the form of non- stable 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.940
 a person only separated from fact that 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.520
 is the case of your cohabiting partner and this property 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.670
 acquired by you is by an effort 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.620
 so only you and he has 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.510
 right to this property and any 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.310
 descendants of the future 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.710
 a question that Ana Claudia has arrived 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.510
 now it's similar to her says good morning 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.030
 together with my husband for eight years 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.400
 has a daughter of seven years but my 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.150
 husband still legally married to another 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.640
 woman 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.770
 I have the same rights as she or 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.740
 not what I should do 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.650
 you have the same rights as those who 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.770
 assets were 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.169
 acquired during the coexistence with him 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.490
 so now there is a situation here that has 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.090
 that was not clear 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:22.120
 I do not know if it 's this coexistence with 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.980
 man though married is indeed separated he is 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.280
 a coexistence with the man who still 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.950
 maintains a marriage relationship if it is a 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.630
 man who maintains a marriage relationship 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.520
 It becomes more complicated for you to prove the union 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.979
 stable and require some right 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.740
 now if you are a married person but 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:41.740
 separated from everything that you 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.020
 have been built in equity terms and 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.419
 you during this union was in 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.490
 relation to his son 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:52.479
 he is entitled to any 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.890
 another son who was conceived roberto 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.090
 thank you very much for the presence plus one 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.490
 time at the weekend 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.530
 Thank you a big hug from you all 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.760
 our viewers until the next 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.760
 God willing, until
