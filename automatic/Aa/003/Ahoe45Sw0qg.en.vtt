00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:02.500
 Hello everyone. 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.440
 I am Serizawa, an afterbeat music school guitar instructor. 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.990
 This time, I think that I will try to explain the knobs attached to this guitar to everyone. 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.629
 If you bought a guitar for the first time, I do not particularly understand the meaning of the switches in this area. 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.930
 "What role do you have, what functions do you have, and how do you know?" 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.870
 I think that you are quite likely, so it is a kind of plum blossom that you would like to refer to such people. 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:35.280
 First of all, there are some types, but basically, in the case of this strat type. 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.499
 I got a little knob, but volume, tone, tone. 

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:42.260
 And the combination called a selector is common. 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.640
 Volume is simply the volume. 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.120
 If this is fully opened, the output of the guitar comes out at max. 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.879
 If you turn it counterclockwise, the output of the guitar becomes 0. 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.699
 It feels like there is no sound. 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.379
 For this tone, think of it as a crisp sound switch. 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.230
 It is good even with sound moko moco switch. 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.290
 When I squeeze this tone, the sound becomes mokomoko, 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.620
 I feel that the sound becomes crispy when the tone is fully open. 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.170
 Basically, while you are not particular about the sound quality, or you do not understand the difference well 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.660
 I think that both the tone and the volume should be max. 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.070
 As this selector is also ... Strato has many 5 way switches, so there are 5 stages, but 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.780
 When there are three pickups, it is often a 5-way switch. 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.160
 Conversely, when there are only two pickups, there are many 3-way switches. 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.860
 What role does this have? When the selector is here 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.460
 I'm just picking up the rear pickup. 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.310
 These two are not working. 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.660
 Only here. Only this microphone is alive. 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.270
 So, if I do it one step here, there are two. 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.800
 Although I say it here and rear, I say rear and center 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.930
 You pick up the sound with these two mics. 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.770
 So, here is not working. This two. 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.490
 If I do one more step, this time I only get sound only at the center. 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.450
 One more step, two here. 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.250
 Finally here. When only this is taking a sound. 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.679
 So, there are five stages of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in a 5-way switch. 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.339
 Although this does not change the tone at all, but I think at first I do not understand the difference at all 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:17.430
 I always think that I do not mind in the rear. 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.749
 So, as a basic setting, put the knob in the rear, 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:26.669
 I think that both the volume and the tone are all open. 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:30.439
 So, the guitar I use is similar, 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.680
 There are only two pickups for this guitar 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.260
 Even though the switch is 3 way, so there is only one tone. 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.309
 Do you feel like volume or tone? 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.969
 If you do not know this well, let both the volume and the tone be max, 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.779
 You should set the selector also to the rear. 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:55.159
 So, what does the sound change with? 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:02.159
 First of all, the volume is a good volume. 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.429
 When I narrow down all the tones 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:10.099
 In this way 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.319
 The sound is muddy. 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.790
 So it's best to listen to the selectors with your ears, but 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.710
 When I play in the rear ... 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.399
 It feels a little sloppy or sloppy. 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:28.840
 Play at the front desk 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.510
 It's a little sweet tone. Conversely speaking, it sounds like an unclear tone. 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.849
 So, "Gibson" or Les Paul. 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.540
 In the case of a guitar like a Les Paul type. 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.040
 I do not have a Les Paul, so I'm going to be this full acoustic, but 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.499
 In this case, four knobs are attached. 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:59.619
 The volume and tone for this pickup, and why four are attached 

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:03.249
 It's like the volume and tone for this pickup. 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:07.269
 So you can make each sound with each pickup. 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.309
 The type with these four knobs. 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:18.019
 So this "TREBLE" is the rear, and "RHYTHM" is the front. 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.469
 So, the middle is salt plume that I will make a sound with both. 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.619
 So, for the time being, this is completely open at all. 

00:04:23.619 --> 00:04:30.590
 Let's go full open. 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.930
 So, although it is a little bonus story, those who use this array like Les Paul type 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.700
 Let's remember the switching technique. 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.180
 Here and there, but it doesn't matter. 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.389
 It's fine if you set the front volume to 0 or the rear volume to 0, though 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.580
 Set either volume to 0. 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.049
 So when you're playing properly 

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:01.970
 Switch 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.220
 When you move it. 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.940
 It feels like 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.530
 I can not do with the guitar I always use 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.180
 The effect is 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.960
 It will appear. 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.519
 Ticks are annoying. 

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:37.069
 Something like this .... 

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:44.810
 "I missed it!" 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.760
 Please be careful as there are also cases. 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.519
 I wonder if it was broken. 

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:54.510
 Please do not break it. 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.689
 I don't think it will break, but I'm sure it's a burden 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:01.139
 It feels like it's light and light and it's best to give it loose. 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:02.530
 No, I was surprised. 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.960
 So I would like to continue talking a little more, but 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:13.860
 It is a salt like plum blossom that I will try to explain lightly what kind of time to use a tone and so on. 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.080
 At first, you don't have to worry about it at all, so it's fine to open it, 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.080
 When playing with clean tones 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:28.530
 I think there are times when I think the sound is too heavy, 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.970
 For example, this 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:36.849
 At the front, both volume and tone are max 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:46.789
・ ・ ・, And to play, squeeze the tone a little .... 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:51.240
 Do you feel like you can get rid of the noise? 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.430
 Especially, around this one string and two strings. 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.430
 So, when I squeeze 

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:11.060
 It's like that. 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.050
 But if I squeeze everything 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:25.120
 I can't hear everything, so I can't stop everything, but 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.099
 Do you often use this kind of tone? 

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:33.120
 When I'm playing at the front 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.250
 When the front sound is too tight when you give it a jerky sound. 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.620
 At that time 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.610
 I often use tones in a sense of roundness. 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.919
 There are many other things, though. 

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:50.389
 For the time being, is it more than what I wanted to tell from this time? 

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:53.159
 We hope you find it helpful. 

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:55.530
 The second half may not have been helpful. 

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.729
 For now, don't break the switch. Please be careful. 

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:01.810
 Then again next week? 

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.099
 Next time ... next time. 

00:08:04.099 --> 00:08:06.150
 Then again, until we have the opportunity to meet you 

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.860
 Goodbye. 

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.290
 It is not next week. Goodbye.
