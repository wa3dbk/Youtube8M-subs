this year than it did last year and it's

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.169 
this year than it did last year and it's
probably<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.929> just<00:01:58.110> probably<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.709> weather

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
probably it's just probably the weather

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.589 
probably it's just probably the weather
you<00:02:00.179> know<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:01.140> gotten<00:02:01.470> a<00:02:01.530> little<00:02:01.649> bigger
