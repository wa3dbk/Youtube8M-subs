meant to protect endangered species we

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.700 
meant to protect endangered species we
have<00:00:20.039> seen<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.430> since<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:20.910> Jaguar<00:00:21.240> died

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
have seen that since this Jaguar died

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.259 
have seen that since this Jaguar died
now<00:00:22.710> it's<00:00:22.920> very<00:00:23.100> clear<00:00:23.340> how<00:00:23.519> many<00:00:23.760> things<00:00:24.090> were

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
now it's very clear how many things were

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.750 
now it's very clear how many things were
not<00:00:24.480> planned<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.289> think<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:25.920> was<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.070> very<00:00:26.279> rushed

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
not planned I think it was a very rushed

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.359 
not planned I think it was a very rushed
decision<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:28.500> think<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.890> was<00:00:29.070> not

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
decision and I think it was not

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.510 
decision and I think it was not
completely<00:00:29.939> rational<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.830> think<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.250> lost

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
completely rational and I think we lost

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.650 
completely rational and I think we lost
