have insight of the dirty car i have a
little<00:01:18.450> thermometer<00:01:18.870> set<00:01:19.320> up<00:01:19.470> with<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
little thermometer set up with the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.350 
little thermometer set up with the
remote<00:01:20.280> temperature<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.090> it's<00:01:21.210> actually

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
remote temperature on it it's actually

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.600 
remote temperature on it it's actually
jumped<00:01:21.869> up<00:01:21.990> about<00:01:22.260> four<00:01:22.710> degrees<00:01:22.890> over<00:01:23.490> the

jumped up about four degrees over the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.440 
jumped up about four degrees over the
last<00:01:23.930> 10<00:01:24.930> minutes<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:28.580> cooling<00:01:29.580> is<00:01:29.880> definitely

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
last 10 minutes so cooling is definitely

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.900 
last 10 minutes so cooling is definitely
going<00:01:30.660> to<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.810> an<00:01:31.200> issue<00:01:34.220> as<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.520> see<00:01:35.729> that

going to be an issue as you can see that

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.430 
going to be an issue as you can see that
temperature<00:01:36.479> must<00:01:36.660> have<00:01:36.780> started<00:01:37.140> working

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
temperature must have started working

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.040 
temperature must have started working
its<00:01:37.530> way<00:01:37.680> through<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:38.040> PVC<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.840> heat<00:01:42.050> yeah

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
its way through that PVC the heat yeah

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.410 
its way through that PVC the heat yeah
