00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
and there's only one the screen I

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.190 
and there's only one the screen I
believe<00:01:39.760> is<00:01:40.030> just<00:01:40.090> let<00:01:40.600> me<00:01:40.660> just<00:01:40.840> check<00:01:41.020> this

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
believe is just let me just check this

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.980 
believe is just let me just check this
out<00:01:41.410> yeah<00:01:41.560> we<00:01:41.710> won<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.010> screen<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.490> but<00:01:43.120> that

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
out yeah we won the screen and but that

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.330 
out yeah we won the screen and but that
isn't<00:01:44.260> the<00:01:44.290> only<00:01:44.350> club<00:01:44.680> but<00:01:44.890> I<00:01:44.920> think<00:01:45.280> that

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.330 
isn't the only club but I think that
that<00:01:45.750> 10<00:01:46.750> Madrid<00:01:47.050> and<00:01:47.170> they're<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.010> only<00:01:48.160> ones

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
that 10 Madrid and they're the only ones

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.190 
that 10 Madrid and they're the only ones

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
in some kind of partnership as well so

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.170 
in some kind of partnership as well so

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
that could that could spring some deal

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.450 
that could that could spring some deal
