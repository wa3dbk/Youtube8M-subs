so<00:00:48.190> this<00:00:48.400> is<00:00:49.260> metolius<00:00:50.260> Springs<00:00:51.360> we're<00:00:52.360> more

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
so this is metolius Springs we're more

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.060 
so this is metolius Springs we're more
or<00:00:52.750> less<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:54.190> math<00:00:54.430> of<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:54.670> metolius<00:00:55.950> so<00:00:56.950> this

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
or less the math of the metolius so this

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.670 
or less the math of the metolius so this
is<00:00:57.190> a<00:00:57.220> mighty<00:00:57.550> metolius<00:00:58.180> river<00:00:58.270> in<00:00:58.960> central

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
is a mighty metolius river in central

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.810 
is a mighty metolius river in central
oregon<00:01:00.060> what<00:01:01.060> makes<00:01:01.270> this<00:01:02.070> river<00:01:03.070> very<00:01:03.460> unique

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
oregon what makes this river very unique

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.000 
oregon what makes this river very unique
is<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.300> actually<00:01:04.690> comes<00:01:05.620> right<00:01:05.830> out<00:01:05.860> of

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
is that it actually comes right out of

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.850 
is that it actually comes right out of
the<00:01:06.190> ground<00:01:06.460> at<00:01:06.700> its<00:01:06.880> at<00:01:07.840> its<00:01:07.870> headwaters<00:01:08.230> and

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
the ground at its at its headwaters and

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.310 
the ground at its at its headwaters and
it's<00:01:09.700> actually<00:01:10.060> consists<00:01:10.570> of<00:01:10.630> two<00:01:10.690> Springs

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
it's actually consists of two Springs

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.219 
it's actually consists of two Springs
that<00:01:11.560> are<00:01:11.680> about<00:01:11.830> 300<00:01:12.310> feet<00:01:12.460> apart<00:01:12.850> and<00:01:13.600> the

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
that are about 300 feet apart and the

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.770 
that are about 300 feet apart and the
second<00:01:14.650> spring<00:01:14.950> is<00:01:15.190> probably<00:01:15.520> right<00:01:16.510> on<00:01:16.660> the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
second spring is probably right on the

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.460 
second spring is probably right on the
other<00:01:16.930> side<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.350> this<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:18.840> molehill<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:20.050> of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
other side of this this molehill of of

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.290 
other side of this this molehill of of
things<00:01:20.800> with<00:01:21.040> this<00:01:21.160> is<00:01:21.340> kind<00:01:21.940> of<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.090> main

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
things with this is kind of the main

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.730 
things with this is kind of the main
head<00:01:22.570> and<00:01:22.720> it<00:01:22.780> just<00:01:22.960> comes<00:01:23.140> right<00:01:23.380> out<00:01:23.410> of<00:01:23.590> the

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
head and it just comes right out of the

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.770 
head and it just comes right out of the
ground<00:01:24.780> right<00:01:25.780> there

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
ground right there

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.200 
ground right there
what<00:01:28.780> makes<00:01:28.960> this<00:01:29.140> river<00:01:29.830> super<00:01:30.729> unique<00:01:31.000> is

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
what makes this river super unique is

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.550 
what makes this river super unique is
because<00:01:31.240> of<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.660> way<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.869> headwaters<00:01:32.320> are

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
because of the way the headwaters are

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.290 
because of the way the headwaters are
it's<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.550> runoff<00:01:33.940> of<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:35.110> Black<00:01:35.590> Butte<00:01:36.300> Basin

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
it's the runoff of the Black Butte Basin

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.080 
it's the runoff of the Black Butte Basin
and<00:01:37.830> so<00:01:38.830> it<00:01:38.979> keeps<00:01:39.190> a<00:01:39.340> constant<00:01:39.520> temperature

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
and so it keeps a constant temperature

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.530 
and so it keeps a constant temperature
about<00:01:40.570> 48<00:01:41.020> degrees<00:01:41.050> year-round<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:43.390> the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
about 48 degrees year-round and the

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.680 
about 48 degrees year-round and the
other<00:01:43.660> thing<00:01:43.900> too<00:01:44.110> is<00:01:44.140> it<00:01:44.440> it<00:01:44.800> is<00:01:45.340> always<00:01:45.850> they

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
other thing too is it it is always they

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.660 
other thing too is it it is always they
call<00:01:46.869> it<00:01:46.960> stand<00:01:47.229> pot<00:01:47.470> like<00:01:47.740> a<00:01:47.770> stand<00:01:48.100> pipe<00:01:48.310> flow

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
call it stand pot like a stand pipe flow

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.570 
call it stand pot like a stand pipe flow
and<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:50.500> that<00:01:50.649> means<00:01:50.890> is<00:01:51.069> that<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.369> river

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
and what that means is that the river

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.580 
and what that means is that the river
will<00:01:51.819> always<00:01:52.090> constant<00:01:52.539> keep<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.110> constant

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
will always constant keep a constant

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.300 
will always constant keep a constant
flow<00:01:53.890> it<00:01:54.310> never<00:01:54.580> drops<00:01:54.910> and<00:01:55.690> it's<00:01:56.289> a<00:01:56.530> naturally

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
flow it never drops and it's a naturally

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.270 
flow it never drops and it's a naturally
ran<00:01:58.300> river<00:01:58.960> so<00:01:59.259> there's<00:01:59.440> no<00:01:59.590> dams<00:01:59.860> or<00:02:00.100> anything

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
ran river so there's no dams or anything

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.350 
ran river so there's no dams or anything
involved<00:02:01.619> there's<00:02:02.619> quite<00:02:03.039> a<00:02:03.069> few<00:02:03.160> species<00:02:03.910> of

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
involved there's quite a few species of

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.260 
involved there's quite a few species of
fish<00:02:04.600> in<00:02:04.630> here<00:02:04.810> there's<00:02:05.229> bull<00:02:05.950> trout<00:02:06.270> rainbow

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
fish in here there's bull trout rainbow

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.490 
fish in here there's bull trout rainbow
trout<00:02:09.330> standard<00:02:10.330> white<00:02:10.509> fish<00:02:10.780> things<00:02:11.319> like

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
trout standard white fish things like

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.280 
trout standard white fish things like
that<00:02:12.120> what<00:02:13.120> was<00:02:13.209> really<00:02:13.450> interesting<00:02:13.600> is<00:02:14.080> when

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
that what was really interesting is when

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.870 
that what was really interesting is when
I<00:02:14.410> was<00:02:14.590> in<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.370> youth<00:02:15.520> Conservation<00:02:16.180> Corps<00:02:16.209> Oh

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
I was in the youth Conservation Corps Oh

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.750 
I was in the youth Conservation Corps Oh
like<00:02:18.880> around<00:02:19.000> 96<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.860> quite<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.250> few<00:02:21.430> years<00:02:21.580> ago

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
like around 96 so quite a few years ago

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.650 
like around 96 so quite a few years ago
I<00:02:23.490> you<00:02:24.490> know<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.610> did<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.090> bull<00:02:25.510> trout

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
I you know I did the bull trout

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.809 
I you know I did the bull trout
conservation<00:02:26.410> count<00:02:26.680> on<00:02:26.980> this<00:02:27.160> River<00:02:27.430> because

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
conservation count on this River because

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.280 
conservation count on this River because
originally<00:02:28.240> they<00:02:28.600> thought<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.959> bull<00:02:29.080> trout

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
originally they thought the bull trout

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.820 
originally they thought the bull trout
was<00:02:29.790> endangered<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:32.020> apparently<00:02:32.590> it's<00:02:32.740> not

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
was endangered and apparently it's not

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.949 
was endangered and apparently it's not
because<00:02:33.610> now<00:02:33.850> people<00:02:34.090> fish<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.690> living

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
because now people fish the living

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.470 
because now people fish the living
daylights<00:02:35.170> out<00:02:35.560> of<00:02:35.590> them<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:37.180> one<00:02:37.330> thing

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
daylights out of them and the one thing

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.199 
daylights out of them and the one thing
about<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.990> metolius<00:02:38.410> that's<00:02:39.209> very

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
about the metolius that's very

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.690 
about the metolius that's very
interesting<00:02:40.510> is<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:40.930> it's<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.349> it's<00:02:41.740> a<00:02:41.890> one<00:02:42.670> of

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
interesting is that it's a it's a one of

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.820 
interesting is that it's a it's a one of
the<00:02:42.790> number<00:02:43.090> one<00:02:43.120> sought-after<00:02:43.830> fishing

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
the number one sought-after fishing

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.270 
the number one sought-after fishing
waters<00:02:45.190> in<00:02:45.730> Central<00:02:46.480> Oregon<00:02:46.830> it's<00:02:47.830> actually

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
waters in Central Oregon it's actually

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.160 
waters in Central Oregon it's actually
really<00:02:48.550> difficult<00:02:48.790> waters<00:02:49.270> to<00:02:49.599> fish<00:02:49.780> as<00:02:49.959> well

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
really difficult waters to fish as well

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.500 
really difficult waters to fish as well
because<00:02:50.530> of<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:50.830> way<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.160> river<00:02:51.400> since<00:02:52.360> it's

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
because of the way the river since it's

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.960 
because of the way the river since it's
so<00:02:52.720> cold<00:02:53.020> it<00:02:53.710> doesn't<00:02:54.070> get<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.280> lot<00:02:54.460> of<00:02:54.580> time<00:02:54.760> to

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
so cold it doesn't get a lot of time to

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.740 
so cold it doesn't get a lot of time to
build<00:02:55.240> up<00:02:55.360> like<00:02:55.600> algae

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
build up like algae

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.300 
build up like algae
or<00:02:56.870> any<00:02:56.990> kind<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.350> microbe<00:02:59.560> you<00:03:00.560> know<00:03:00.680> microbes

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
or any kind of microbe you know microbes

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.280 
or any kind of microbe you know microbes
of<00:03:01.520> any<00:03:01.670> sort<00:03:01.970> so<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.330> water<00:03:02.510> stays<00:03:02.840> super

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
of any sort so the water stays super

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.580 
of any sort so the water stays super
super<00:03:03.590> clear<00:03:03.890> in<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:05.210> fish<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:06.500> know

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
super clear in the fish you know

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.650 
super clear in the fish you know
obviously<00:03:06.920> can<00:03:07.070> see<00:03:07.280> 360<00:03:08.060> degrees<00:03:08.090> above

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
obviously can see 360 degrees above

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.870 
obviously can see 360 degrees above
their<00:03:08.840> head<00:03:09.070> so<00:03:10.070> that<00:03:10.250> it's<00:03:10.370> very<00:03:10.610> hard<00:03:10.850> to

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
their head so that it's very hard to

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.130 
their head so that it's very hard to
sneak<00:03:11.150> up<00:03:11.270> on<00:03:11.390> them<00:03:11.570> and<00:03:11.690> then<00:03:11.780> what's<00:03:11.990> really

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
sneak up on them and then what's really

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.640 
sneak up on them and then what's really
cool<00:03:12.440> about<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.459> river<00:03:13.640> is<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:13.970> it<00:03:14.470> on<00:03:15.470> the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
cool about the river is that it on the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.130 
cool about the river is that it on the
banks<00:03:16.040> its<00:03:16.310> undercut<00:03:17.000> so<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.570> water<00:03:17.780> actually

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
banks its undercut so the water actually

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.630 
banks its undercut so the water actually
goes<00:03:18.260> up<00:03:18.440> underneath<00:03:18.740> the<00:03:18.950> banks<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.400> so<00:03:19.520> the

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
goes up underneath the banks and so the

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.120 
goes up underneath the banks and so the
fish<00:03:19.820> can<00:03:19.850> hear<00:03:20.209> you<00:03:20.330> coming<00:03:20.770> so<00:03:21.770> it<00:03:21.860> makes<00:03:22.010> it

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
fish can hear you coming so it makes it

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.160 
fish can hear you coming so it makes it
really<00:03:22.310> difficult<00:03:22.580> to<00:03:22.850> fish<00:03:23.120> these<00:03:24.110> waters

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
really difficult to fish these waters

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.970 
really difficult to fish these waters
the<00:03:25.570> other<00:03:26.570> thing<00:03:26.810> too<00:03:27.020> is<00:03:27.050> it's<00:03:27.380> it's<00:03:27.680> catch

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
the other thing too is it's it's catch

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.520 
the other thing too is it's it's catch
and<00:03:28.160> release<00:03:28.280> only<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:29.030> it's<00:03:29.300> fly<00:03:30.080> fishing

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
and release only and it's fly fishing

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.550 
and release only and it's fly fishing
and<00:03:30.709> barbless<00:03:31.250> hook<00:03:31.690> so<00:03:32.690> you<00:03:32.750> can't<00:03:33.050> fish<00:03:33.350> with

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
and barbless hook so you can't fish with

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.949 
and barbless hook so you can't fish with
bait<00:03:33.800> or<00:03:34.040> spinning<00:03:34.850> gear<00:03:35.060> of<00:03:35.239> any<00:03:35.360> sort<00:03:35.690> so<00:03:35.870> you

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
bait or spinning gear of any sort so you

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.930 
bait or spinning gear of any sort so you
got<00:03:36.080> a<00:03:36.110> you<00:03:36.620> got<00:03:36.770> to<00:03:36.860> be<00:03:36.950> one<00:03:37.100> of<00:03:37.220> those<00:03:37.310> purists

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
got a you got to be one of those purists

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.570 
got a you got to be one of those purists
