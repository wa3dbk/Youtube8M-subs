00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
watching the puppet but I guess in the

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.520 
watching the puppet but I guess in the
industry<00:02:55.600> he<00:02:55.780> said<00:02:56.020> it's<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.260> matter<00:02:56.410> of

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
industry he said it's a matter of

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
eye contact with the puppet instead of

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.470 
eye contact with the puppet instead of
the<00:03:02.340> person<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.700> don't<00:03:03.730> feel<00:03:04.000> bad<00:03:04.090> about<00:03:04.150> that
