00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.870
 hi how about my name is dance and this 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.870
 it's the supernova we start 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.460
 good and the theme that I chose because 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.680
 you asked for it was how I started 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.920
 watch good anime and it all started as the 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.439
 13 or 14 years old I do not remember well the 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.720
 thing is that at that age I went to 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.520
 vaccinate against cancer yes against 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.800
 cancer they hear it well there was already vaccine 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.720
 back then for cancer and then I 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.430
 I went to vaccinate I arrived at the clinic 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.470
 active marched perfectly until 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.000
 that the nurse told me to get off patalÃ³n 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:43.820
 I need to see it I stayed and with face 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.800
 cupid with this rock the truth of 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.960
 after the time as it is assimilated 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.610
 the truth I did not even know for what 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.650
 they are going to vaccinate me but the nurse stops 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.720
 entertain me he began to tell me about 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.329
 a caricature of a child who has a 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.879
 fox inside his body this called me 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.830
 a lot of attention and truth that neither 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.720
 I even felt when Betic in those 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.519
 moments I did not even know that that series 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.500
 would start my taste for the year 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.500
 This series is called Naruto 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.610
 I 've been watching this for quite some time 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.560
 series or I keep seeing it rather without 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.870
 know that I was unanimous I have a problem 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.210
 very strong with this that is the anime 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.190
 I have become a vice 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.390
 I have come to my things these two people 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.340
 I have killed more people 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.670
 and the truth is you also have the mother 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.670
 seriously I can not stand it I'm going to kill 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.520
 a kilos nothing happens I'm very good 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.230
 Naruto is and will be my favorite anime 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.740
 although they have already ruined it with so many 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.720
 filling really and every week that 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.570
 I entered injured 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.760
 every week enter intro try I'm not going to 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.070
 see Naruto I 'm not going to see Naruto and 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.340
 it is always the same pure filler but 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.050
 but since I 'll have to put up with it 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.209
 then you know how he started to see 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.940
 anime then by means of a nurse 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.730
 who told me about a caricature that I 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.110
 the truth before I was not familiar 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.330
 with him I did not even even 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.300
 they liked those caricatures cartoons 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.280
 Japanese I did not even like them but 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.050
 after this nurse told me 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.630
 the review so to speak as it was me 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.120
 it was like I was passionate about this and I started 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.950
 to search to look for more series and 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.520
 more series until I found it already 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.590
 that what anime is the meaning of 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.040
 the good cne I will tell you a little about 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.230
 this series so that those who do not 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.840
 they have seen it good basically 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.709
 about a young ninja 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.739
 wants to convert and will reach the rank 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.530
 highest of children that is the being 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.660
 jocay to be recognized for all his 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.150
 village and in order to achieve it you will have to 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.099
 go through many fights and missions to 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.780
 achieve your goal and be recognized the 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.519
 truth is my humble opinion I think that 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.310
 this anime would have reached the height 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.030
 of dragon ball z but for questions of 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.580
 filling and who knows who and what 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.440
 kishimoto chingaderas for even 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.959
 I think it comes to the heels of what 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.329
 that was dragon ball seriously but still 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.540
 well it 's a very good series them 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:55.430
 I recommend that you see the truth I think 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.620
 that the best season was the first 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.840
 where were children I think that was the 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.239
 better from naruto shippuden as per 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.640
 now cats that was then what 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.240
 all good friends culminated this was all 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.490
