but no log on it you can still start it

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.620 
but no log on it you can still start it
though<00:01:14.460> by<00:01:14.610> kind<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.880> wedging<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.509> between

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
though by kind of wedging it in between

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.109 
though by kind of wedging it in between
there<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.250> I'll<00:01:17.250> start<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.000> a

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
there and I'll start it up in just a

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.630 
there and I'll start it up in just a
minute<00:01:18.320> air<00:01:19.320> filters<00:01:19.740> pretty<00:01:19.950> nice<00:01:20.130> this

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
minute air filters pretty nice this

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.370 
minute air filters pretty nice this
thing<00:01:20.820> actually<00:01:20.850> has<00:01:21.210> two<00:01:21.390> carburetors<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:22.200> it

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
thing actually has two carburetors on it

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.649 
thing actually has two carburetors on it
I<00:01:25.850> don't<00:01:26.850> know<00:01:26.909> how<00:01:27.030> well<00:01:27.210> you're<00:01:27.390> going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.570> be

two carbs on it yeah like I said it
needs<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.040> chain<00:01:32.280> tension<00:01:33.210> adjustment<00:01:33.829> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
needs a chain tension adjustment the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.390 
needs a chain tension adjustment the
alignment<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.460> front<00:01:35.790> needs<00:01:36.000> help

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
on it I've been working on taking the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.920 
on it I've been working on taking the
warning<00:01:43.320> labels<00:01:43.710> off<00:01:44.210> as<00:01:45.210> they<00:01:45.360> look<00:01:45.540> stupid

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
warning labels off as they look stupid

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.569

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
so yeah it's actually not too bad it

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.130 
so yeah it's actually not too bad it
doesn't<00:01:50.670> really<00:01:50.970> feel<00:01:51.090> like<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.600> four-wheeler

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140

doesn't really it looks like it's you
got<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:56.430> cheaper<00:01:56.850> but<00:01:57.119> hey<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.869> doesn't

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
got it for cheaper but hey it doesn't

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.670 
got it for cheaper but hey it doesn't
look<00:01:58.200> too<00:01:58.409> bad<00:01:58.439> really<00:01:58.890> and<00:02:00.110> it<00:02:01.110> runs<00:02:01.350> nicely

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
look too bad really and it runs nicely

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.389 
look too bad really and it runs nicely
ously<00:02:02.630> yeah<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.810> might<00:02:04.140> need<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> clutch<00:02:04.680> job

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
ously yeah it might need a clutch job

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.360 
ously yeah it might need a clutch job
possibly<00:02:06.299> not<00:02:07.140> sure<00:02:07.170> about<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.560> yet<00:02:07.920> and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
so i'm going to figure

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:21.920 
so i'm going to figure
out<00:02:13.739> something<00:02:14.099> for<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:20.329> it<00:02:21.329> also<00:02:21.480> needs<00:02:21.810> the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
out something for that it also needs the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.530 
out something for that it also needs the
heel<00:02:22.200> guards<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:23.760> did<00:02:23.939> come<00:02:24.090> with<00:02:24.239> a<00:02:24.269> set<00:02:24.420> of
