00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.350
 Hi there, this is a rubric correct 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.250
 positions today will be considered 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:19.540
 map of south coast on the example of a tank from 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.390
 obse 41 or so called hamster 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:27.280
 this is the top rep ie rest where 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.510
 Slide on this spawn I prefer 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.329
 regardless of the type of technology stand on 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.480
 grief here in this position since 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.030
 the enemy always comes either to the left or to 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.660
 right here everything is very simple and here 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:47.060
 see how at the very beginning reckless 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.890
 breaks enemy Firefly T21 and judging 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.920
 because he wrote in the chat 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:56.690
 you see him very notably bombed by 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:00.320
 the picture is the first frag in general the first 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:04.159
 frag among the two teams he has there just 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.890
 tears up a bunch but nonetheless very 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.289
 good start of the fight and proof of that 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.560
 that I am not in vain standing here at least 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:14.959
 tank and a good overview 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.850
 charging for 33 seconds go highlight 

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:19.700
 the village that's right here 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.359
 absolutely meaningless reckless and 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.619
 You see, break into 2 psy fours 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:28.189
 enemy ones unfortunately 1 different 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.340
 problems and i'm all four very him 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.109
 successfully cram 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.840
 three shells from the drum go away with damage 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.349
 I already have 1,700 damage that's very, very 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.349
 OK 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:46.660
 12t here but unfortunately I did not have time for 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:49.930
 charging him get and we are with my co 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:53.920
 angry here we stand as you can see 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:58.290
 specific victory 61 none at all 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:02.820
 hints of defeat but by 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:06.540
 in general, shores from the sea 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:11.260
 there is some enemy 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.420
 Well, I do not even know what to call it sluggish 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.230
 offensive let's say so sluggish offensive 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.800
 observed and here goes there from 8 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:25.890
 enemy Fri- shka t30 sur le nil Lorraine 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:29.260
 do not have time to get in general 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.350
 teammates get I go to charge 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.510
 I understand that it seems to be in some city 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.760
 the mix is going on but for now I still have 24 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.100
 seconds charge charge charge and 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.250
 I'm waiting maybe someone from the age of twenties 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.019
 come out well here 1 vanshota evident principle 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.690
 you could have gotten him, but I still 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.690
 I did not have time to charge again for a very long time 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.049
 charging on this tank is not always me 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.680
 always happy here throwing a stick cooks 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:04.590
 don't get well there my 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:10.150
 sovzvodnye his get down and 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:14.440
 I decide to go to point a1 because there 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:19.030
 our merged and from the shore should 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:22.209
 come the same t30 and out of 8 I have 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.239
 not a complete safety factor but it is not 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.150
 less what happens next i'm still 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.090
 Since then I am proud of this moment and believe that 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.130
 what happens next at all 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.350
 comments are unnecessarily so 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.650
 we continue to special music 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.650

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.699
