the<00:00:08.790> first<00:00:09.000> video<00:00:09.240> I<00:00:09.660> uploaded<00:00:10.500> on<00:00:11.309> this

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
the first video I uploaded on this

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.179 
the first video I uploaded on this
account<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:15.800> this<00:00:16.800> loading<00:00:17.279> screen<00:00:17.310> takes

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
account and this loading screen takes

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.160 
account and this loading screen takes
oddly<00:00:20.189> long<00:00:20.430> amount<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.880> time<00:00:21.320> there<00:00:22.320> we<00:00:22.410> go

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
oddly long amount of time there we go

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.160 
oddly long amount of time there we go
here<00:00:25.170> we<00:00:25.199> are<00:00:26.150> at<00:00:27.150> beautiful<00:00:28.050> Mount<00:00:28.410> Rushmore

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
here we are at beautiful Mount Rushmore

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.000 
here we are at beautiful Mount Rushmore
and<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.619> realized<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:33.230> this<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.469> not<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.860> best

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
and I realized that this is not the best

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.770 
and I realized that this is not the best
Rushmore<00:00:35.700> they<00:00:35.910> made<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:37.110> Minecraft<00:00:37.739> but<00:00:38.100> I

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
Rushmore they made on Minecraft but I

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.030 
Rushmore they made on Minecraft but I
particularly<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:40.200> mine<00:00:40.590> because<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:42.950> put<00:00:43.950> a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
particularly like mine because I put a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.369 
particularly like mine because I put a
little<00:00:44.250> bass<00:00:44.460> inside<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:48.260> figured<00:00:49.260> I'd

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
little bass inside of it I figured I'd

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.720 
little bass inside of it I figured I'd
show<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.800> off<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.600> don't<00:00:51.600> think<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
show it off I don't think that it is the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.160 
show it off I don't think that it is the
best<00:00:55.190> piece<00:00:56.190> I've<00:00:56.489> ever<00:00:56.789> made<00:00:59.539> but<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.780> thought

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
best piece I've ever made but I thought

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.290 
best piece I've ever made but I thought
that<00:01:01.500> it'd<00:01:02.340> be<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> good<00:01:02.640> way<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.969> introduce

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
that it'd be a good way to introduce

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.080 
that it'd be a good way to introduce

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
what they used to be because I have them

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.750

minecraft I love minecraft but it is
very<00:01:21.450> time<00:01:21.900> consuming<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.799> don't<00:01:23.189> know<00:01:23.310> if

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
very time consuming I don't know if

that's<00:01:23.610> just<00:01:23.729> me<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:25.040> seems<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:28.009> like<00:01:29.009> it

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
that's just me but it seems like like it

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.890 
that's just me but it seems like like it
just<00:01:29.310> takes<00:01:29.460> hours<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.299> things<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.750> took

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
just takes hours to do things it took

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.840 
just takes hours to do things it took
about<00:01:31.170> two<00:01:31.470> or<00:01:31.680> three<00:01:31.710> hours<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.460> clear<00:01:32.759> out

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
about two or three hours to clear out

about two or three hours to clear out
all<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.860> dirt<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.369> everything<00:01:35.430> to

each I I thought that originally I was
not<00:02:01.439> planning<00:02:01.649> on<00:02:01.860> having<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.159> base<00:02:02.369> inside<00:02:02.820> of

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
the eyes and I made a little

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.540 
the eyes and I made a little
little<00:02:11.880> cavern<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.330> went<00:02:12.630> down<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.280> here<00:02:14.280> is

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550
