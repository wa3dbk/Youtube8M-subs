00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
else to do and I actually predicted that

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.149

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
this fight I didn't think that it would

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.280 
this fight I didn't think that it would
be<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.430> one-sided<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.540> mean<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.869> looked<00:01:31.049> at
