superstars portable actually looks
pretty<00:00:37.020> impressive<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.710> far<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:38.040> haven't<00:00:38.280> even

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
pretty impressive so far I haven't even

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.970 
pretty impressive so far I haven't even
I<00:00:38.790> haven't<00:00:39.090> even<00:00:39.180> done<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.480> yet<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:39.860> is<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
I haven't even done this yet so is the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.139 
I haven't even done this yet so is the
first<00:00:41.190> time<00:00:41.309> I'm<00:00:41.489> seeing<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.850> let's<00:00:42.000> try<00:00:42.030> to

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
first time I'm seeing it let's try to

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.940 
first time I'm seeing it let's try to
get<00:00:42.270> some<00:00:42.420> volume<00:00:42.719> out<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:44.270> and<00:00:45.890> go<00:00:46.890> ahead

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
get some volume out of this and go ahead

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.889 
get some volume out of this and go ahead
and<00:00:47.070> press<00:00:47.190> start<00:00:47.370> actually<00:00:48.360> something<00:00:48.719> else

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
and press start actually something else

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.590 
and press start actually something else
I<00:00:48.960> want<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.140> try<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.739> want<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.950> map<00:00:50.600> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
I want to try it is I want to map the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.880 
I want to try it is I want to map the
right<00:00:51.989> analog<00:00:53.449> to<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.480> face<00:00:55.020> buttons<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.739> that

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
right analog to the face buttons so that

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.350 
right analog to the face buttons so that
we<00:00:56.039> could<00:00:56.160> play<00:00:56.340> with<00:00:56.460> dual<00:00:56.699> analog<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.270> I'll

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
we could play with dual analog so I'll

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.450 
we could play with dual analog so I'll
let<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.570> guys<00:00:57.719> know<00:00:57.899> how<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.199> works<00:00:58.379> out<00:00:58.530> and

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
let you guys know how that works out and

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.279 
let you guys know how that works out and
we'll<00:00:59.579> keep<00:00:59.730> bilinear<00:01:00.090> filtering<00:01:00.420> off<00:01:00.870> for

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
we'll keep bilinear filtering off for

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.109 
we'll keep bilinear filtering off for
just<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.530> second<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:03.920> whoops<00:01:04.920> we'll<00:01:05.820> see<00:01:05.970> what

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
just a second as whoops we'll see what

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.160 
just a second as whoops we'll see what
actually<00:01:06.510> works<00:01:06.600> better<00:01:07.880> with<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.060> game

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.440 

so<00:01:12.770> here<00:01:12.920> we<00:01:13.009> are<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:13.340> looks<00:01:13.460> pretty<00:01:13.729> good<00:01:13.909> not

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
so here we are it looks pretty good not

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.240 
so here we are it looks pretty good not
as<00:01:14.750> Christmas<00:01:15.560> could<00:01:15.740> be<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:15.890> little<00:01:16.040> bit

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
as Christmas could be a little bit

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.010 
as Christmas could be a little bit
pixelated<00:01:16.640> but<00:01:17.030> uh<00:01:17.060> I<00:01:17.509> don't<00:01:17.720> know<00:01:17.840> if<00:01:17.900> that's

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
pixelated but uh I don't know if that's

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.109 
pixelated but uh I don't know if that's
going<00:01:18.140> to<00:01:18.229> translate<00:01:18.350> on<00:01:18.770> camera<00:01:21.820> so<00:01:22.820> let's<00:01:23.000> go

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
going to translate on camera so let's go

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.300 
going to translate on camera so let's go
to<00:01:23.180> arcade<00:01:24.729> and<00:01:26.470> oh<00:01:27.470> this<00:01:28.009> is<00:01:28.159> interesting

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
to arcade and oh this is interesting

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.469 
to arcade and oh this is interesting
because<00:01:30.490> actually<00:01:31.490> shoot<00:01:31.759> with<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.000> triangle

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
because actually shoot with the triangle

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.570 
because actually shoot with the triangle
button<00:01:32.659> so<00:01:33.140> mapping<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.799> analog<00:01:34.159> isn't<00:01:34.460> going

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
button so mapping the analog isn't going

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.320 
button so mapping the analog isn't going
to<00:01:34.640> work<00:01:34.789> too<00:01:35.060> well<00:01:36.670> okay<00:01:38.200> all<00:01:39.200> right<00:01:40.330> let's

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
to work too well okay all right let's

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.490 
to work too well okay all right let's
see<00:01:41.450> if<00:01:41.509> there<00:01:41.630> are<00:01:41.659> any<00:01:41.750> control<00:01:42.170> options

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
see if there are any control options

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.370 
see if there are any control options
real<00:01:42.649> quick<00:01:42.830> to<00:01:43.310> change<00:01:43.490> that

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.630 

shooting<00:01:50.380> action<00:01:51.159> buttons<00:01:51.759> all<00:01:52.060> right<00:01:52.409> okay

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
shooting action buttons all right okay

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.130 
shooting action buttons all right okay
that's<00:01:54.640> right<00:01:54.819> actually<00:01:55.060> that's<00:01:55.329> right<00:01:55.509> I'm

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
that's right actually that's right I'm

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.230 
that's right actually that's right I'm
not<00:01:56.289> thinking

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.840 

taps<00:02:02.110> we're<00:02:02.290> okay<00:02:02.530> so<00:02:03.490> we'll<00:02:03.640> see<00:02:03.729> how<00:02:03.759> it

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
taps we're okay so we'll see how it

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.460 
taps we're okay so we'll see how it
works<00:02:03.939> out

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.380 

and<00:02:09.470> already<00:02:11.020> actually<00:02:12.020> works<00:02:12.170> pretty<00:02:12.260> well

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
and already actually works pretty well

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.140 
and already actually works pretty well
it's<00:02:14.390> not<00:02:14.510> true<00:02:15.490> analog<00:02:16.490> because<00:02:17.000> it's

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
it's not true analog because it's

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.360 
it's not true analog because it's
emulating<00:02:17.600> face<00:02:17.780> buttons<00:02:18.110> but<00:02:18.350> uh<00:02:18.380> actually

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
emulating face buttons but uh actually

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.720 
emulating face buttons but uh actually
works<00:02:19.640> pretty<00:02:19.700> well<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:22.250> promise<00:02:22.520> you<00:02:22.580> guys

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
works pretty well and I promise you guys

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.980 
works pretty well and I promise you guys
I<00:02:22.820> don't<00:02:22.970> suck<00:02:23.150> this<00:02:23.300> bad<00:02:23.450> at<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.690> game<00:02:23.720> you

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
I don't suck this bad at the game you

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:31.390 
I don't suck this bad at the game you
can<00:02:24.140> check<00:02:24.290> my<00:02:25.930> PSN<00:02:26.930> trophies<00:02:27.290> proof<00:02:27.680> but<00:02:30.400> hey

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
can check my PSN trophies proof but hey

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.520 
can check my PSN trophies proof but hey
it<00:02:31.520> looks<00:02:31.610> pretty<00:02:31.760> good<00:02:32.290> it's<00:02:33.290> very

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
it looks pretty good it's very

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.870 
it looks pretty good it's very
responsive<00:02:34.450> feels<00:02:35.450> good<00:02:36.460> and<00:02:37.460> I<00:02:37.550> actually<00:02:37.670> try

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
responsive feels good and I actually try

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.670 
responsive feels good and I actually try
to<00:02:37.910> play<00:02:38.120> through<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.540> camera<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.170> through

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
to play through the camera and through

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.740 
to play through the camera and through
the<00:02:39.800> Vita<00:02:39.980> at<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.220> same<00:02:40.400> time<00:02:40.640> just<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.600> make

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
the Vita at the same time just to make

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.970 
the Vita at the same time just to make
sure<00:02:41.780> I'm<00:02:41.960> not<00:02:42.050> moving<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.440> Vita<00:02:42.620> too<00:02:42.830> much

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
sure I'm not moving the Vita too much

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.670 
sure I'm not moving the Vita too much
out<00:02:43.130> of<00:02:43.190> kind<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.940> but<00:02:44.410> yeah<00:02:45.410> let's<00:02:45.440> go

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
out of kind of you but yeah let's go

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.280 
out of kind of you but yeah let's go
ahead<00:02:45.740> and<00:02:46.540> pause<00:02:47.540> this<00:02:47.660> real<00:02:47.900> quick<00:02:48.080> and

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
ahead and pause this real quick and

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.550 
ahead and pause this real quick and
we'll<00:02:49.100> check<00:02:49.280> out<00:02:49.430> by<00:02:49.580> linear<00:02:49.880> filtering<00:02:50.560> see

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
we'll check out by linear filtering see

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.840 
we'll check out by linear filtering see
how<00:02:51.650> it<00:02:51.710> looks<00:02:51.860> in<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.070> game

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.460 

so<00:02:57.450> as<00:02:57.660> he<00:02:57.810> as<00:02:57.960> you<00:02:58.170> can<00:02:58.410> hopefully<00:02:58.590> see<00:02:58.860> it's<00:02:59.220> a

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
so as he as you can hopefully see it's a

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.490 
so as he as you can hopefully see it's a
slow<00:03:01.470> more<00:03:01.680> blurry<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:05.780> you<00:03:06.780> know<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.320> doesn't

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
slow more blurry and you know it doesn't

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.590 
slow more blurry and you know it doesn't
change<00:03:07.800> I<00:03:08.370> should<00:03:08.580> have<00:03:08.640> loose<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:08.910> there<00:03:09.060> it

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
change I should have loose it there it

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.710 
change I should have loose it there it
doesn't<00:03:10.140> change<00:03:10.290> it<00:03:11.220> doesn't<00:03:11.580> change<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:12.060> the

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
doesn't change it doesn't change you the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.940 
doesn't change it doesn't change you the
way<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.960> game<00:03:12.990> play<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.590> know<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.800> doesn't

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
way the game play you know it doesn't

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.280 
way the game play you know it doesn't
add<00:03:14.250> any<00:03:14.430> lag<00:03:14.640> or<00:03:14.760> anything<00:03:15.030> like<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.630> you

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
add any lag or anything like that so you

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.120 
add any lag or anything like that so you
know<00:03:16.380> fairly<00:03:16.740> uh<00:03:20.870> fairly<00:03:21.870> good<00:03:22.170> only<00:03:22.890> thing<00:03:23.040> it

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
know fairly uh fairly good only thing it

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.040 
know fairly uh fairly good only thing it
does<00:03:23.250> add<00:03:23.520> some<00:03:23.730> blur<00:03:23.910> just<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.300> to<00:03:24.750> get<00:03:24.870> rid<00:03:25.020> of

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
does add some blur just to to get rid of

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.270 
does add some blur just to to get rid of
the<00:03:25.140> pixelation<00:03:25.620> so<00:03:25.770> I'll<00:03:25.860> go<00:03:25.980> ahead<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.130> play

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
the pixelation so I'll go ahead and play

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.940 
the pixelation so I'll go ahead and play
again<00:03:26.550> real<00:03:27.360> quick<00:03:27.390> I<00:03:27.870> see<00:03:28.320> my<00:03:28.440> camera<00:03:28.800> is

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
again real quick I see my camera is

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.040 
again real quick I see my camera is
having<00:03:29.610> trouble<00:03:29.820> focusing<00:03:29.940> hopefully<00:03:30.900> it's

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
having trouble focusing hopefully it's

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:38.480 
having trouble focusing hopefully it's
better<00:03:31.230> now<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:36.150> yeah<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:37.400> mapping<00:03:38.400> the

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
better now and yeah the mapping the

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.620 
better now and yeah the mapping the
right<00:03:38.610> analog<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.150> face<00:03:39.330> buttons

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
right analog to the face buttons

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:46.010 
right analog to the face buttons
actually<00:03:39.870> works<00:03:40.020> really<00:03:40.080> well<00:03:40.290> so<00:03:44.600> that<00:03:45.600> it

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
actually works really well so that it

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.080 
actually works really well so that it
feels<00:03:46.170> feels<00:03:46.800> pretty<00:03:47.070> normal<00:03:47.250> as<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:47.850> can<00:03:47.970> see

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
feels feels pretty normal as you can see

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.840 
feels feels pretty normal as you can see
you<00:03:48.420> can't<00:03:48.920> can't<00:03:49.920> really<00:03:50.100> spread<00:03:50.460> too<00:03:50.700> well

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
you can't can't really spread too well

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.330 
you can't can't really spread too well
and<00:03:51.090> I'm<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:52.290> can't<00:03:52.560> see<00:03:52.770> it<00:03:52.860> but<00:03:52.980> I'm<00:03:53.100> going

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
and I'm you can't see it but I'm going

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.130 
and I'm you can't see it but I'm going
between<00:03:53.490> like<00:03:53.850> left<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.390> down<00:03:54.510> right<00:03:54.780> now<00:03:54.930> and

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
between like left and down right now and

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.190 
between like left and down right now and
it's<00:03:56.130> it's<00:03:56.460> this<00:03:57.360> spread<00:03:57.660> isn't<00:03:57.930> too<00:03:58.020> great

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
it's it's this spread isn't too great

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.220 
it's it's this spread isn't too great
it's<00:03:59.010> not<00:03:59.100> true<00:03:59.310> analog<00:03:59.670> but<00:04:00.090> it's<00:04:00.990> pretty

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
it's not true analog but it's pretty

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.830 
it's not true analog but it's pretty
good

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.280 

so<00:04:06.440> yeah<00:04:06.590> that's<00:04:06.769> that<00:04:06.890> we<00:04:07.819> move<00:04:07.970> on<00:04:11.230> we'll<00:04:12.230> go

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
so yeah that's that we move on we'll go

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.259 
so yeah that's that we move on we'll go
ahead<00:04:12.379> and<00:04:12.560> exit<00:04:12.800> this<00:04:12.950> and<00:04:13.220> we'll<00:04:13.760> go<00:04:13.849> over<00:04:13.879> to

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
ahead and exit this and we'll go over to

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.420 
ahead and exit this and we'll go over to
Super<00:04:14.720> Stardust<00:04:14.900> Delta<00:04:16.479> and<00:04:18.070> let's<00:04:19.070> see<00:04:19.220> if<00:04:19.310> we

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
Super Stardust Delta and let's see if we

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.530 
Super Stardust Delta and let's see if we
can<00:04:20.440> what<00:04:21.440> kind<00:04:21.590> of<00:04:21.620> difference<00:04:21.889> we<00:04:22.070> see<00:04:22.220> here

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.210 

so<00:04:26.540> I<00:04:26.570> already<00:04:26.840> it<00:04:27.290> looks<00:04:27.350> a<00:04:27.620> lot<00:04:27.740> more<00:04:27.800> crisp

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
so I already it looks a lot more crisp

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.659 
so I already it looks a lot more crisp
even<00:04:28.610> from<00:04:29.300> this<00:04:29.449> screen<00:04:29.660> but<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:31.580> know

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
even from this screen but you know

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:47.679 
even from this screen but you know
that's<00:04:32.120> expected

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:47.689 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:49.899 

and<00:04:47.779> the<00:04:48.499> online<00:04:48.919> connectivity<00:04:49.369> for<00:04:49.759> this

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:49.909 
and the online connectivity for this

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:51.579 
and the online connectivity for this
game<00:04:50.089> is<00:04:50.269> a<00:04:50.299> little<00:04:50.839> bit<00:04:50.959> weird<00:04:51.289> sometimes

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:51.589 
game is a little bit weird sometimes

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:53.889 
game is a little bit weird sometimes
sometimes<00:04:52.099> it<00:04:52.249> kicks<00:04:52.399> me<00:04:52.549> out<00:04:52.659> actually<00:04:53.659> the

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:53.899 
sometimes it kicks me out actually the

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:55.600 
sometimes it kicks me out actually the
first<00:04:54.169> day<00:04:54.349> I<00:04:54.379> got<00:04:54.529> the<00:04:54.559> beat<00:04:54.769> of<00:04:54.889> the<00:04:54.979> 15th<00:04:55.339> it

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
first day I got the beat of the 15th it

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.919 
first day I got the beat of the 15th it
was<00:04:55.759> kicking<00:04:56.059> me<00:04:56.149> out<00:04:56.179> I<00:04:56.329> think<00:04:56.569> ever<00:04:56.839> since

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:56.929 
was kicking me out I think ever since

00:04:56.929 --> 00:05:01.179 
was kicking me out I think ever since
then<00:04:57.229> it's<00:04:57.379> been<00:04:57.439> okay<00:04:57.799> it's<00:04:58.459> probably<00:05:00.189> just

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:01.189 
then it's been okay it's probably just

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:03.609 
then it's been okay it's probably just
the<00:05:01.279> server's<00:05:01.699> not<00:05:01.849> being<00:05:02.119> ready<00:05:02.299> on<00:05:02.619> their

00:05:03.609 --> 00:05:03.619 
the server's not being ready on their

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:10.750 
the server's not being ready on their
end

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.600 

so<00:05:11.390> here<00:05:11.540> we<00:05:11.630> go

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:36.129 
starts really cool though they got a

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:40.320 
starts really cool though they got a
black<00:05:36.610> hole<00:05:36.849> sucks<00:05:37.750> everything<00:05:37.990> in<00:05:38.259> and<00:05:39.330> what

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
black hole sucks everything in and what

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.420 
black hole sucks everything in and what
to<00:05:40.419> get<00:05:40.509> one<00:05:40.719> missiles<00:05:41.469> which<00:05:42.009> is<00:05:42.129> pretty<00:05:42.219> cool

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
to get one missiles which is pretty cool

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.929 
to get one missiles which is pretty cool
too<00:05:42.490> so<00:05:42.870> yeah<00:05:43.870> I<00:05:44.319> can<00:05:44.620> already<00:05:44.770> tell<00:05:44.979> a<00:05:45.159> big

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:45.939 
too so yeah I can already tell a big

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:46.920 
too so yeah I can already tell a big
difference<00:05:45.969> with<00:05:46.330> the<00:05:46.419> right<00:05:46.569> analog<00:05:46.810> stick

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
difference with the right analog stick

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.399 
difference with the right analog stick
with<00:05:47.620> it<00:05:47.650> being<00:05:47.979> a<00:05:48.069> true<00:05:49.060> analog<00:05:49.389> feels<00:05:50.169> really

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:50.409 
with it being a true analog feels really

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:52.589 
with it being a true analog feels really
good<00:05:50.620> as<00:05:50.860> you<00:05:50.949> can<00:05:51.099> see<00:05:51.219> with<00:05:51.370> this<00:05:51.599> fire

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
good as you can see with this fire

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.540 
good as you can see with this fire
weapon<00:05:52.960> I<00:05:53.050> can<00:05:53.229> go<00:05:53.949> ahead<00:05:54.009> and<00:05:54.099> do<00:05:54.219> this<00:05:54.370> you

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
weapon I can go ahead and do this you

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.390 
weapon I can go ahead and do this you
can't<00:05:54.729> really<00:05:54.819> do<00:05:55.029> that<00:05:55.060> in<00:05:55.620> the<00:05:56.620> PSP<00:05:57.039> version

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
can't really do that in the PSP version

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.600 
can't really do that in the PSP version
because<00:05:57.879> not<00:05:58.060> true<00:05:58.240> analog<00:05:58.509> and<00:05:59.250> the<00:06:00.250> visuals

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
because not true analog and the visuals

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.080 
because not true analog and the visuals
of<00:06:00.759> course<00:06:01.029> are<00:06:01.240> a<00:06:01.270> lot<00:06:01.539> more<00:06:01.569> crisp<00:06:02.939> so<00:06:03.939> yeah

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
of course are a lot more crisp so yeah

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.640 
of course are a lot more crisp so yeah
if<00:06:04.240> you<00:06:04.389> just<00:06:04.750> want<00:06:04.900> to<00:06:04.960> see<00:06:05.139> a<00:06:05.169> difference

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
if you just want to see a difference

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.080 
if you just want to see a difference
between<00:06:05.949> the<00:06:06.159> power<00:06:06.279> of<00:06:06.490> the<00:06:06.550> Vita<00:06:06.759> and<00:06:06.969> the

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
between the power of the Vita and the

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.959 
between the power of the Vita and the
power<00:06:07.270> of<00:06:07.389> the<00:06:07.419> PSP<00:06:07.930> I<00:06:08.490> guess<00:06:09.490> this<00:06:09.610> isn't<00:06:09.669> the

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:09.969 
power of the PSP I guess this isn't the

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:11.909 
power of the PSP I guess this isn't the
greatest<00:06:10.090> example<00:06:10.750> but<00:06:10.960> it's<00:06:11.229> definitely<00:06:11.710> a

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
greatest example but it's definitely a

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.240 
greatest example but it's definitely a
close<00:06:12.550> a<00:06:13.330> good<00:06:14.139> comparison<00:06:14.439> since<00:06:14.949> it<00:06:15.099> is

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
close a good comparison since it is

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:22.320 
close a good comparison since it is
pretty<00:06:15.669> much<00:06:15.819> same<00:06:16.180> game<00:06:21.029> so<00:06:22.029> i'll<00:06:22.120> just<00:06:22.150> go

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
pretty much same game so i'll just go

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.879 
pretty much same game so i'll just go
ahead<00:06:22.419> and<00:06:22.539> play<00:06:22.719> real<00:06:22.990> quick<00:06:23.229> a<00:06:23.529> little<00:06:23.800> bit

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889 
ahead and play real quick a little bit

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:29.070 
ahead and play real quick a little bit
more<00:06:24.039> show<00:06:24.849> you<00:06:24.909> guys<00:06:25.000> the<00:06:25.150> ice<00:06:25.300> weapon<00:06:28.080> since

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
more show you guys the ice weapon since

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.140 
more show you guys the ice weapon since
it's<00:06:29.229> closer<00:06:29.469> to<00:06:29.589> the<00:06:29.800> rock<00:06:30.490> weapon<00:06:30.849> from<00:06:31.029> the

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
it's closer to the rock weapon from the

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:38.420 
it's closer to the rock weapon from the
previous<00:06:31.479> game

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.100 

and<00:06:38.970> I<00:06:39.180> guess<00:06:39.330> it's<00:06:39.360> really<00:06:39.750> hard<00:06:39.900> to<00:06:39.990> play

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
and I guess it's really hard to play

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.620 
and I guess it's really hard to play
through<00:06:40.290> a<00:06:40.380> camera<00:06:40.820> with<00:06:41.820> the<00:06:41.970> Vita<00:06:42.210> on<00:06:42.480> the

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630 
through a camera with the Vita on the

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:51.440 
through a camera with the Vita on the
desk<00:06:42.870> so<00:06:49.520> so<00:06:50.520> yeah<00:06:50.610> that's<00:06:50.700> it<00:06:50.940> this<00:06:51.360> is<00:06:51.420> a

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450 
desk so so yeah that's it this is a

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.240 
desk so so yeah that's it this is a
quick<00:06:51.630> comparison<00:06:51.810> between<00:06:52.290> the<00:06:52.710> Super

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
quick comparison between the Super

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.750 
quick comparison between the Super
Stardust<00:06:53.460> Delta<00:06:53.940> and<00:06:55.430> super<00:06:56.430> starters

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:56.760 
Stardust Delta and super starters

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.640 
Stardust Delta and super starters
portable<00:06:57.240> and<00:06:57.480> hopefully<00:06:58.080> my<00:06:58.200> camera<00:06:58.500> wasn't

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
portable and hopefully my camera wasn't

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.900 
portable and hopefully my camera wasn't
blurry<00:06:58.890> the<00:06:59.010> whole<00:06:59.130> time<00:06:59.340> I'm<00:06:59.520> gonna<00:06:59.640> go<00:06:59.820> ahead

00:06:59.900 --> 00:06:59.910 
blurry the whole time I'm gonna go ahead

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.190 
blurry the whole time I'm gonna go ahead
