00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.110 
adjust a parameter with the built-in
accelerometer<00:02:01.740> oh<00:02:02.310> wow<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.850> by<00:02:02.970> moving

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
accelerometer oh wow just by moving

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.590 
accelerometer oh wow just by moving
around<00:02:03.450> right<00:02:03.780> now<00:02:05.150> you<00:02:06.150> can<00:02:06.270> shake<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.480> a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
around right now you can shake it a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.510 
around right now you can shake it a
little<00:02:06.630> bit<00:02:06.870> go<00:02:07.260> very<00:02:07.590> unique<00:02:07.890> about<00:02:08.130> leaving

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
little bit go very unique about leaving

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.760 
little bit go very unique about leaving
are<00:02:08.670> doing<00:02:08.880> things<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.210> yeah<00:02:09.450> right<00:02:09.770> over

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
are doing things like yeah right over

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.170 
are doing things like yeah right over
here<00:02:10.950> we<00:02:11.070> have<00:02:11.100> some<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.610> beat<00:02:11.760> slicing

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
here we have some of the beat slicing

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.060 
here we have some of the beat slicing
effects<00:02:12.600> so<00:02:13.320> I'm<00:02:13.440> gonna<00:02:13.560> be<00:02:13.650> able<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.830> hit<00:02:13.920> that

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
effects so I'm gonna be able to hit that

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.940 
effects so I'm gonna be able to hit that
right<00:02:14.220> there<00:02:17.840> look<00:02:18.840> at<00:02:18.960> just<00:02:19.170> all<00:02:19.320> that<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.740> can

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
right there look at just all that I can

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.410 
right there look at just all that I can
even<00:02:20.190> do<00:02:20.400> multiple<00:02:20.820> effects<00:02:21.060> at<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.240> same

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
even do multiple effects at the same

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.000 
even do multiple effects at the same
time<00:02:22.850> brilliant

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
time brilliant

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.259 
time brilliant
all<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.579> can<00:02:26.730> do<00:02:26.969> right<00:02:27.180> here<00:02:29.269> right

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
all that I can do right here right

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.300 
all that I can do right here right
inside<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.629> controller<00:02:30.930> itself<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.650> can<00:02:32.159> also

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
inside the controller itself I can also

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.319 
inside the controller itself I can also
adjust<00:02:32.519> things<00:02:32.879> like<00:02:33.120> oh<00:02:34.549> let's<00:02:35.549> go<00:02:35.730> let's<00:02:36.209> go

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
adjust things like oh let's go let's go

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:37.309 
adjust things like oh let's go let's go
back<00:02:36.450> for<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.629> key<00:02:36.780> point<00:02:36.930> here<00:02:37.049> which<00:02:37.170> I

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
back for a key point here which I

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.890 
back for a key point here which I
actually<00:02:37.469> have<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:38.129> beam<00:02:38.609> set<00:02:38.819> up<00:02:38.939> in<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.150> and

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
actually have a beam set up in it and

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.990 
actually have a beam set up in it and
they<00:02:39.989> can<00:02:40.170> go<00:02:40.290> over<00:02:40.379> here<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:40.920> again<00:02:41.700> just<00:02:41.909> the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
they can go over here and again just the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000 
they can go over here and again just the
parameters<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.719> as<00:02:42.870> well<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.409> right<00:02:43.859> now

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
parameters of that as well and right now

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.679 
parameters of that as well and right now
I<00:02:44.040> have<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.310> feedback<00:02:44.609> so<00:02:44.909> there<00:02:45.060> we<00:02:45.120> go<00:02:45.150> okay<00:02:50.689> so

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
I have a feedback so there we go okay so

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.119 
I have a feedback so there we go okay so
i<00:02:51.750> can<00:02:51.930> hit<00:02:52.230> multiple<00:02:52.590> paths<00:02:52.799> you're<00:02:52.980> the

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
i can hit multiple paths you're the

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.970 
i can hit multiple paths you're the
other<00:02:53.189> thing<00:02:53.430> it's<00:02:53.579> RGB<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.319> all<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.650> RGB

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
other thing it's RGB so so all the RGB

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.339 
other thing it's RGB so so all the RGB
pads<00:02:56.250> here<00:02:56.489> can<00:02:56.639> be<00:02:56.670> setup<00:02:57.169> works<00:02:58.169> with

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
pads here can be setup works with

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.409 
pads here can be setup works with
bidirectional<00:02:59.010> midi<00:02:59.159> so<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.849> computer<00:03:00.150> can

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
bidirectional midi so the computer can

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.360 
bidirectional midi so the computer can
tell<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:01.139> mini<00:03:01.349> controller<00:03:01.739> what<00:03:02.159> color

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
tell the mini controller what color

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.429 
tell the mini controller what color
wants<00:03:02.639> the<00:03:02.730> LED<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.180> be<00:03:03.329> or<00:03:03.870> i<00:03:03.900> can<00:03:04.019> set<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.349> up

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 
wants the LED to be or i can set it up

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:05.990 
wants the LED to be or i can set it up
so<00:03:04.560> it's<00:03:04.680> fixed<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.489> if<00:03:05.579> i<00:03:05.700> don't<00:03:05.879> have

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
so it's fixed so if i don't have

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.729 
so it's fixed so if i don't have
feedback<00:03:06.239> inside<00:03:06.750> my<00:03:06.870> software<00:03:07.260> i<00:03:07.349> can<00:03:07.500> set<00:03:07.650> it

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
feedback inside my software i can set it

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.229 
feedback inside my software i can set it
up<00:03:07.799> in<00:03:07.980> chinese<00:03:08.340> any<00:03:08.519> color<00:03:08.760> i<00:03:08.819> want<00:03:09.060> them<00:03:09.150> to

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
up in chinese any color i want them to

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.270 
up in chinese any color i want them to
be<00:03:09.359> okay<00:03:10.019> so<00:03:10.379> this<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.859> a<00:03:10.889> full-fledged

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
it put in a sleep mode what's this here

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:40.819 
it put in a sleep mode what's this here
for<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.870> couple<00:03:39.959> minutes<00:03:40.169> it<00:03:40.409> goes<00:03:40.500> into<00:03:40.680> sleep
