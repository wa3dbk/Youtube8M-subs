00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
thing that the sri lankan should perhaps

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.910 
thing that the sri lankan should perhaps
put<00:00:18.240> up<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.449> bigger<00:00:18.660> fight<00:00:18.779> because<00:00:19.500> both<00:00:19.740> these

OD<00:00:20.160> eyes<00:00:20.340> have<00:00:20.520> ended<00:00:20.730> up<00:00:20.789> being<00:00:21.060> very

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
OD eyes have ended up being very

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.730 
OD eyes have ended up being very
one-sided<00:00:21.750> contest<00:00:24.380> yes<00:00:25.380> all<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.680> time

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
one-sided contest yes all the time

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.060 
one-sided contest yes all the time
actually<00:00:26.070> after<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.300> partnership<00:00:27.810> between

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
actually after that partnership between

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.669 
actually after that partnership between
chicken<00:00:29.070> divan<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.490> ma<00:00:30.269> tier<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.599> do<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:31.500> looked

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
chicken divan and ma tier I do it looked

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.250 
chicken divan and ma tier I do it looked
so<00:00:31.830> easy<00:00:32.040> for<00:00:33.030> India<00:00:33.660> because<00:00:33.750> there<00:00:34.020> simply

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
so easy for India because there simply

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.190 
so easy for India because there simply
was<00:00:34.500> no<00:00:34.530> pressure<00:00:34.980> put<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.630> Indian

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
was no pressure put on the on the Indian

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.069 
was no pressure put on the on the Indian
batsman<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.829> fielding<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.570> see<00:00:39.719> Lankans

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
batsman the fielding of the see Lankans

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.780 
batsman the fielding of the see Lankans
wasn't<00:00:40.500> quite<00:00:40.680> up<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.370> mark

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
wasn't quite up to the mark

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.970 
wasn't quite up to the mark
the<00:00:42.450> bowling<00:00:42.629> looked<00:00:42.930> pretty<00:00:43.200> innocuous<00:00:43.500> and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the bowling looked pretty innocuous and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.619 
the bowling looked pretty innocuous and
so<00:00:44.399> there<00:00:44.550> really<00:00:44.700> wasn't<00:00:45.000> much<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.390> a

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
so there really wasn't much of a

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.029 
so there really wasn't much of a
challenge<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:46.200> think<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.440> was<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> question<00:00:46.920> of

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
challenge I think it was a question of

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.610 
challenge I think it was a question of
the<00:00:47.550> batsman<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.510> crease<00:00:49.050> keeping<00:00:49.500> their

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the batsman at the crease keeping their

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.470 
the batsman at the crease keeping their
concentration<00:00:50.309> going<00:00:50.489> keeping<00:00:50.940> their<00:00:51.059> focus

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
concentration going keeping their focus

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.150 
concentration going keeping their focus
and<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.230> they<00:00:52.350> don't<00:00:52.559> get<00:00:52.739> out<00:00:52.770> and

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
and so they don't get out and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.069 
and so they don't get out and
unfortunately<00:00:53.969> she<00:00:54.420> could<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.719> missed<00:00:54.960> out

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
unfortunately she could have missed out

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.869 
unfortunately she could have missed out
on<00:00:55.110> hundred<00:00:55.530> because<00:00:55.800> he<00:00:55.890> lost<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.340> little<00:00:56.699> bit

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
on hundred because he lost a little bit

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.760 
on hundred because he lost a little bit
of<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> concentration<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.989> played<00:00:58.590> that

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
of the concentration and played that

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.080 
of the concentration and played that
shot<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.190> God<00:00:59.370> or<00:00:59.489> otherwise<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.910> would<00:01:00.000> have

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
shot in God or otherwise you would have

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.959 
shot in God or otherwise you would have
had<00:01:00.180> another<00:01:00.420> hundred<00:01:00.980> against<00:01:01.980> his<00:01:02.100> name<00:01:02.309> but

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
had another hundred against his name but

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.460 
had another hundred against his name but
that's<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> way<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> game<00:01:03.719> goes<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.019> think<00:01:04.199> you

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
that's the way the game goes I think you

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.300 
that's the way the game goes I think you
know<00:01:04.559> sometimes<00:01:05.250> when<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.150> becomes<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.630> easy

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
know sometimes when it becomes so easy

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.920 
know sometimes when it becomes so easy

the team but full credit to him because
as<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.509> as<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.869> said<00:01:52.110> he's<00:01:52.320> been<00:01:52.500> shuffled<00:01:52.890> up

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
as you as you said he's been shuffled up

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.130 
as you as you said he's been shuffled up
and<00:01:53.130> down<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> order<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.939> obviously<00:01:54.810> all<00:01:54.990> in

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
and down the order and obviously all in

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.870 
and down the order and obviously all in
the<00:01:55.229> team's<00:01:55.439> interest<00:01:55.860> because<00:01:56.430> there<00:01:56.759> was

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
the team's interest because there was

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.149 
the team's interest because there was
the<00:01:57.540> time<00:01:57.719> when<00:01:57.930> Murat<00:01:58.200> was<00:01:58.409> struggling<00:01:58.950> for

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
the time when Murat was struggling for

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.249 
the time when Murat was struggling for
runs<00:01:59.340> so<00:02:00.060> he<00:02:00.210> was<00:02:00.360> sent<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.689> at<00:02:00.810> number<00:02:01.079> three

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
runs so he was sent in at number three

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.200 
runs so he was sent in at number three
and<00:02:01.469> verrat<00:02:02.070> was<00:02:02.280> kept<00:02:02.490> down<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.820> order<00:02:03.060> while

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and verrat was kept down the order while

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.300 
and verrat was kept down the order while
the<00:02:03.420> ball<00:02:03.600> became<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> little<00:02:04.229> bit<00:02:04.409> holder<00:02:04.860> so

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
the ball became a little bit holder so

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.490 
the ball became a little bit holder so
that<00:02:05.340> Vera<00:02:06.119> didn't<00:02:06.390> have<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.719> come<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
that Vera didn't have to come to the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.800 
that Vera didn't have to come to the
moving<00:02:08.069> ball<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.910> yes<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.270> think<00:02:09.300> he's<00:02:09.599> been

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
moving ball so yes I think he's been

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.180 
moving ball so yes I think he's been
shuffled<00:02:10.560> up<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.800> down<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.099> order<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.940> is

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
shuffled up and down the order and it is

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.830 
shuffled up and down the order and it is
difficult<00:02:12.610> when<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.120> shuffled<00:02:13.480> up<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.720> down

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
difficult when you shuffled up and down

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.720 
difficult when you shuffled up and down
the<00:02:13.990> order<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.770> be<00:02:15.160> able<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.340> maintain<00:02:15.520> your

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
the order to be able to maintain your

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.850 
the order to be able to maintain your
focus<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:16.300> be<00:02:16.570> able<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.870> say<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.230> yourself<00:02:17.680> what

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
focus to be able to say to yourself what

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.850 
focus to be able to say to yourself what
exactly<00:02:18.100> is<00:02:19.000> expected<00:02:19.690> of<00:02:19.900> him<00:02:20.140> but<00:02:20.710> I<00:02:20.740> think

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
exactly is expected of him but I think

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.470 
exactly is expected of him but I think
that's<00:02:21.100> what<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:21.760> new<00:02:21.880> support<00:02:22.270> staff

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
that's what the the new support staff

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.060 
that's what the the new support staff
would<00:02:22.630> have<00:02:22.750> done<00:02:22.960> they<00:02:23.470> would<00:02:23.560> have<00:02:23.680> told<00:02:23.830> him

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
would have done they would have told him

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.800 
would have done they would have told him
that<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:24.370> know<00:02:24.460> you<00:02:24.520> are<00:02:24.820> an<00:02:25.120> integral<00:02:25.420> part

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
that you know you are an integral part

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.260 
that you know you are an integral part
of<00:02:25.990> our<00:02:26.470> plants<00:02:26.950> going<00:02:27.430> on<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.880> world<00:02:28.090> cup

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
of our plants going on to the world cup

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.420 
of our plants going on to the world cup
and<00:02:28.480> don't<00:02:29.410> worry<00:02:29.620> about<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.920> fact<00:02:30.130> that<00:02:30.190> you

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
and don't worry about the fact that you

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.370 
and don't worry about the fact that you
are<00:02:30.460> being<00:02:30.850> moved<00:02:31.360> up<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.750> down<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.020> order<00:02:32.170> so

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
are being moved up and down the order so

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.930 
are being moved up and down the order so
I<00:02:32.440> think<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:33.190> is<00:02:33.310> what<00:02:33.490> would<00:02:33.610> have<00:02:33.730> given

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
I think that is what would have given

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.280 
I think that is what would have given
the<00:02:34.060> young<00:02:34.180> man<00:02:34.360> confidence<00:02:34.900> because<00:02:35.020> he<00:02:35.170> came

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
the young man confidence because he came

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.740 
the young man confidence because he came
out<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.620> played<00:02:35.800> beautifully<00:02:36.370> these<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.630> way

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
out and played beautifully these the way

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.650 
out and played beautifully these the way
he<00:02:37.900> played<00:02:38.410> himself<00:02:38.590> in<00:02:38.980> when<00:02:39.640> he<00:02:40.180> just<00:02:40.480> just

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
he played himself in when he just just

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.720 
he played himself in when he just just
came<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.410> even<00:02:41.650> Shikhar<00:02:42.070> Dhawan<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.580> way

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
came in and even Shikhar Dhawan the way

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.640 
came in and even Shikhar Dhawan the way
he<00:02:42.910> gave<00:02:43.270> himself<00:02:43.450> time<00:02:43.900> out<00:02:44.140> in<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.350> middle

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
he gave himself time out in the middle

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.190 
he gave himself time out in the middle
that<00:02:45.400> is<00:02:45.520> so<00:02:45.700> important<00:02:46.270> spend<00:02:46.600> time<00:02:46.840> out<00:02:47.020> in

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
that is so important spend time out in

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.870 
that is so important spend time out in
the<00:02:47.230> mini<00:02:47.440> even<00:02:48.040> if<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.250> attack<00:02:48.520> is<00:02:48.550> not<00:02:48.700> a

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
the mini even if the attack is not a

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.400 
the mini even if the attack is not a
very<00:02:49.060> challenging<00:02:49.570> and<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.780> can<00:02:49.960> that's<00:02:50.200> what

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
very challenging and I can that's what

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.770 
very challenging and I can that's what
pistou<00:02:50.800> did<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.280> even<00:02:51.640> without<00:02:51.820> getting<00:02:52.540> to

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
pistou did and even without getting to

hundred<00:03:07.000> out<00:03:07.180> of<00:03:07.210> the<00:03:07.390> out<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.440> World<00:03:08.590> Cup

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
hundred out of the out of the World Cup

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.860 
hundred out of the out of the World Cup
squad<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.490> big<00:03:09.670> plus<00:03:09.880> of<00:03:10.000> course<00:03:10.060> also<00:03:10.600> is<00:03:10.750> the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
squad the big plus of course also is the

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.150 
squad the big plus of course also is the
fact<00:03:10.990> that<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.230> buddy<00:03:11.470> right<00:03:11.710> who<00:03:11.830> can<00:03:11.980> also

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
fact that a buddy right who can also

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.350 
fact that a buddy right who can also
keep<00:03:12.430> wickets<00:03:12.820> if<00:03:12.940> needed

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
keep wickets if needed

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.870 
keep wickets if needed
so<00:03:13.990> if<00:03:14.170> India<00:03:14.710> are<00:03:14.920> going<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.490> go<00:03:15.580> in<00:03:15.700> with<00:03:15.820> just

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
so if India are going to go in with just

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.170 
so if India are going to go in with just
my<00:03:16.510> ASD<00:03:16.840> as<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.590> wicket<00:03:17.950> keeper<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.670> need<00:03:18.970> a

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
my ASD as a wicket keeper you need a

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.220 
my ASD as a wicket keeper you need a
reserve<00:03:19.570> wicket<00:03:19.870> keeper<00:03:20.110> because

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
reserve wicket keeper because

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.140 
reserve wicket keeper because
Australia's<00:03:20.830> far<00:03:21.040> away<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.730> won't<00:03:21.880> be<00:03:22.090> able

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
Australia's far away you won't be able

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.300 
Australia's far away you won't be able
to<00:03:22.300> fly<00:03:22.660> in<00:03:22.720> anybody<00:03:23.230> who<00:03:23.800> will<00:03:24.010> be<00:03:24.160> in<00:03:24.250> a

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
to fly in anybody who will be in a

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.240 
to fly in anybody who will be in a
position<00:03:24.520> to<00:03:24.880> play<00:03:25.630> immediately<00:03:25.959> because<00:03:26.530> the

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
position to play immediately because the

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.790 
position to play immediately because the
the<00:03:27.550> time<00:03:27.790> difference<00:03:28.270> the<00:03:28.480> body<00:03:28.690> clock<00:03:28.989> does

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
the time difference the body clock does

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.520 
the time difference the body clock does
take<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.040> lot<00:03:30.430> of<00:03:30.459> time<00:03:30.760> -<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.390> lot<00:03:31.750> of<00:03:31.780> days<00:03:32.020> as<00:03:32.260> a

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
take a lot of time - a lot of days as a

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.350 
take a lot of time - a lot of days as a
matter<00:03:32.770> of<00:03:32.920> fact<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.220> get<00:03:33.400> used<00:03:33.640> to<00:03:33.820> -<00:03:34.270> the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
matter of fact to get used to - the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.120 
matter of fact to get used to - the
difference<00:03:34.720> in<00:03:34.870> time<00:03:35.020> so<00:03:35.560> having<00:03:35.800> somebody

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
difference in time so having somebody

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.620 
difference in time so having somebody
who<00:03:36.370> can<00:03:36.580> keep<00:03:36.730> wickets<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.239> ride<00:03:37.390> West

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
who can keep wickets and ride West

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.960 
who can keep wickets and ride West
Africa's<00:03:38.050> from<00:03:38.200> Mumbai<00:03:38.470> Indians<00:03:38.800> in<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.489> IPL

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
Africa's from Mumbai Indians in the IPL

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.150 
Africa's from Mumbai Indians in the IPL
so<00:03:40.450> there<00:03:40.840> it<00:03:40.959> is<00:03:41.140> that<00:03:41.560> he<00:03:41.709> would<00:03:41.950> probably

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
so there it is that he would probably

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.920 
so there it is that he would probably
make<00:03:42.850> make<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.360> cut

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
make make the cut

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.600 
make make the cut
mainly<00:03:44.500> because<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.860> fact<00:03:45.040> that<00:03:45.100> he<00:03:45.250> can<00:03:45.430> keep

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
mainly because the fact that he can keep

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.570 
mainly because the fact that he can keep
Ricketts<00:03:46.000> it's<00:03:46.390> got<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.600> be<00:03:46.660> hard<00:03:46.810> lines<00:03:47.080> on

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
Ricketts it's got to be hard lines on

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.580 
Ricketts it's got to be hard lines on
demand<00:03:48.580> Saha<00:03:49.000> because<00:03:49.780> he's<00:03:49.959> handy<00:03:50.260> better<00:03:50.440> as

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
demand Saha because he's handy better as

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.020 
demand Saha because he's handy better as
well<00:03:50.709> maybe<00:03:50.980> if<00:03:51.130> he<00:03:51.220> had<00:03:51.250> been<00:03:51.489> given<00:03:51.760> number

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
well maybe if he had been given number

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.340 
well maybe if he had been given number
three<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.330> bat<00:03:52.450> maybe<00:03:52.690> you<00:03:52.900> would<00:03:52.989> have<00:03:53.019> scored

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
three to bat maybe you would have scored

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.990 
three to bat maybe you would have scored
runs<00:03:53.560> because<00:03:54.040> there's<00:03:54.370> no<00:03:54.489> question<00:03:54.820> he<00:03:54.940> is

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
runs because there's no question he is

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.970 
runs because there's no question he is
probably<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.510> best<00:03:55.660> keeper<00:03:56.019> in<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.620> country

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
probably the best keeper in the country

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.190 
probably the best keeper in the country
but<00:03:57.510> sometimes<00:03:58.510> you've<00:03:58.690> got<00:03:58.810> to<00:03:58.840> look<00:03:59.019> at<00:03:59.110> the

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
but sometimes you've got to look at the

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.560 
but sometimes you've got to look at the
balance<00:03:59.380> of<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.709> team<00:03:59.890> and<00:04:00.160> and<00:04:00.580> the<00:04:00.970> form<00:04:01.300> of

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
balance of the team and and the form of

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.080 
balance of the team and and the form of
the<00:04:02.050> players<00:04:02.320> that<00:04:02.500> you<00:04:02.620> pick<00:04:02.830> and<00:04:03.040> on<00:04:03.580> that

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
the players that you pick and on that

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.750 
the players that you pick and on that
form<00:04:04.330> I<00:04:04.450> think<00:04:04.480> raidu<00:04:05.170> and<00:04:05.650> makes<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.160> cut<00:04:06.340> -

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
form I think raidu and makes the cut -

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.790 
form I think raidu and makes the cut -
to<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.239> World<00:04:07.420> Cup<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:07.810> as<00:04:08.290> far<00:04:08.380> as<00:04:08.440> riders

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.770 
to the World Cup and as far as riders
form<00:04:09.400> now<00:04:09.610> is<00:04:09.790> concerned<00:04:10.209> is<00:04:10.360> of<00:04:10.450> course<00:04:10.630> what

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
form now is concerned is of course what

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.170 
form now is concerned is of course what
is<00:04:10.870> made<00:04:11.019> in<00:04:11.140> ODI<00:04:11.410> century<00:04:11.890> now<00:04:12.130> going<00:04:12.880> forward

is made in ODI century now going forward

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.150 
is made in ODI century now going forward
when<00:04:13.480> druid<00:04:13.840> Sharma<00:04:14.230> makes<00:04:14.440> it<00:04:14.590> back<00:04:14.769> into<00:04:14.950> the

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
when druid Sharma makes it back into the

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.590 
when druid Sharma makes it back into the
team<00:04:15.340> that<00:04:15.730> is<00:04:15.910> going<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.180> be<00:04:16.269> a<00:04:16.299> bit<00:04:16.450> of<00:04:16.540> a

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
team that is going to be a bit of a

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.390 
team that is going to be a bit of a
happy<00:04:16.810> headache<00:04:17.290> for<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.590> selectors<00:04:18.100> perhaps

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
happy headache for the selectors perhaps

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.570 
happy headache for the selectors perhaps
who<00:04:18.880> does<00:04:19.120> Rohit<00:04:19.419> replacing<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.049> team

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.710 

absolutely<00:04:23.120> I<00:04:23.150> think<00:04:23.210> that's<00:04:23.539> always

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
absolutely I think that's always

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.629 
absolutely I think that's always
something<00:04:24.440> that<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.800> selectors<00:04:25.220> want<00:04:25.490> a

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
something that the selectors want a

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.369 
something that the selectors want a
headache<00:04:25.940> where<00:04:26.180> there's<00:04:26.659> a<00:04:26.750> problem<00:04:27.110> of

00:04:27.369 --> 00:04:27.379 
headache where there's a problem of

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:29.020 
headache where there's a problem of
plenty<00:04:27.800> rather<00:04:27.979> than<00:04:28.220> you<00:04:28.460> know<00:04:28.490> not<00:04:28.759> having

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
plenty rather than you know not having

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.180 
plenty rather than you know not having
people<00:04:29.629> to<00:04:29.750> choose<00:04:29.960> from<00:04:30.229> and<00:04:30.470> I<00:04:30.830> think<00:04:30.860> that's

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
people to choose from and I think that's

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.159 
people to choose from and I think that's
that's<00:04:31.370> actually<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.330> situation<00:04:32.780> even<00:04:32.960> with

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
that's actually the situation even with

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.809 
that's actually the situation even with
the<00:04:33.259> new<00:04:33.379> ball<00:04:33.560> attack<00:04:33.860> is<00:04:34.220> a<00:04:34.280> problem<00:04:34.729> of

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:34.819 
the new ball attack is a problem of

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:37.600 
the new ball attack is a problem of
plenty<00:04:35.240> at<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.479> moment<00:04:35.810> then<00:04:36.319> the<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.949> the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
plenty at the moment then the the the

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.820 
plenty at the moment then the the the
opening<00:04:38.030> batting<00:04:38.360> you've<00:04:38.479> got<00:04:38.720> guys<00:04:39.530> like

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
opening batting you've got guys like

final word on india's bowling now in

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.409 
final word on india's bowling now in
this<00:05:00.979> match<00:05:01.190> five<00:05:01.520> bowlers<00:05:01.969> used<00:05:02.210> and

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
this match five bowlers used and

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.300 
this match five bowlers used and
whenever<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:03.020> team<00:05:03.259> uses<00:05:03.620> five<00:05:03.830> bonus<00:05:04.190> is

whenever a team uses five bonus is

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.070 
whenever a team uses five bonus is
always<00:05:04.550> a<00:05:04.580> very<00:05:04.759> good<00:05:04.969> sign<00:05:05.210> isn't<00:05:05.419> it<00:05:05.599> remains

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
then the captain doesn't have to really

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.430 
then the captain doesn't have to really
look<00:05:07.849> at<00:05:08.030> where<00:05:08.509> he's<00:05:08.719> going<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:09.110> throw<00:05:09.289> the

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
tired and that the the bowler could come

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.040 
tired and that the the bowler could come
back<00:05:30.830> for<00:05:31.039> a<00:05:31.099> second<00:05:31.520> spell<00:05:31.699> so<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.509> the<00:05:32.930> way
