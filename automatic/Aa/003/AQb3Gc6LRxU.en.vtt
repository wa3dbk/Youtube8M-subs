reason why this product responds so well

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.660 
reason why this product responds so well
and<00:06:13.510> you<00:06:14.050> really<00:06:14.380> feel<00:06:14.650> the<00:06:14.860> performance<00:06:15.490> in

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.670 
and you really feel the performance in

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.910 
and you really feel the performance in
them<00:06:15.820> is<00:06:16.270> because<00:06:16.540> of<00:06:16.720> the<00:06:16.960> custom<00:06:17.410> silicon

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
them is because of the custom silicon

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.400 
them is because of the custom silicon
then<00:06:18.640> design<00:06:19.300> for<00:06:19.600> this<00:06:19.690> product<00:06:20.260> that

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
then design for this product that

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.930 
then design for this product that
silicon<00:06:21.370> is<00:06:21.460> called<00:06:21.790> a<00:06:22.090> fool

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
silicon is called a fool

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.970 
silicon is called a fool
and<00:06:23.300> it's<00:06:23.570> really<00:06:23.690> built<00:06:24.200> by<00:06:24.440> our<00:06:24.560> hardware

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:24.980 
and it's really built by our hardware

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.790 
and it's really built by our hardware
team<00:06:25.220> in<00:06:25.430> concert<00:06:25.850> of<00:06:26.120> software<00:06:26.630> and<00:06:26.990> what

team in concert of software and what

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.320 
team in concert of software and what
that<00:06:27.980> gives<00:06:28.250> you<00:06:28.370> as<00:06:28.490> a<00:06:28.520> level<00:06:28.880> of<00:06:28.940> performance

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
that gives you as a level of performance

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.230 
that gives you as a level of performance
that<00:06:29.690> you<00:06:29.810> can<00:06:30.050> achieve<00:06:30.200> any<00:06:30.620> other<00:06:30.830> way<00:06:31.240> it

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
that you can achieve any other way it

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.080 
that you can achieve any other way it
also<00:06:32.450> gives<00:06:32.630> you<00:06:33.020> the<00:06:33.200> efficiency<00:06:33.920> to<00:06:34.760> achieve

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
also gives you the efficiency to achieve
