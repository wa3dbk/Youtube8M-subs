 ten command planes for you and 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.590

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.509
 quite well 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.220
 you can get here and with about 2 off two 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.150
 Players start thinking until 10 or 8 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.710
 players can definitely be 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.720
 gamble together and it really is 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.430

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.869

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.760

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.619
 Playstation 4 100 percent and on the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.289
 playstation 3 100 percent he should 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.759
 also supposedly on the xbox 360 xbox one 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.320

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.300
 publish the links for everyone 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.530
 but I can not console for the xbox 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.100
 promise as he is, yes, too 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.989
 on-line 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.239
 then he goes to jobs but goes jobs 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.450
 play goes on marked then goes up 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.820
 top matches exactly and then instead of 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.950
 jumbo blah blah blah blah and then says 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.329
 salad helicopter helicopter 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.789
 And there are other vehicles 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.780
 Just start and and and it does 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.879
 really fun here you can with 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.190
 helicopter flying around and also with 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.100
 plane and with whole vehicles the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.480
 down here it works 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.840
 really cool it is really right 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.220
 nice and and people i still have you 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.659
 ask for it but you have to do that 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.220
 really know yourself is yours 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.140
 opinion and I say my opinion is 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.840
 that is supported by the rockstar 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.479
 not in the future and for gta 6 or 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.340
 Anything else let that be then the a6 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.810
 really should have it on 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.369
 the snout fall but as I said 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.570
 it is only up to everyone 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.220
 my own opinion 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.979
 There have been so many subscribers they 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.689
 complaining to me and also baroque tango 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.979
 first of all a proper respect to the 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.540
 that they even care for the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.700
 youtuber try to insert but 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.159
 Unfortunately, unfortunately we do not have the large 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.470
 do it but I think rockstar will 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.299
 remember that at some point if really 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.610
 this case comes that the people themselves 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.990
 the games will not pick up in the future 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.700
 But as I said it is yours 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.229
 I will not be asexual 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.759
 windworks expand with the opinion 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.020
 stay that glitches or against 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.549
 youtuber want to proceed but you 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.180
 themselves should know themselves in the 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.040
 shoot leg 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.540
 it is their opinion but it does not matter 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.310
 I have not annoyed enough I have to 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.229
 quite frankly , I had last one 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.869
 week right chaos so me that 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.329
 get out if gta 5 glitches should 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.860
 It will be forbidden for us to continue the rest 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.989
 Report that rockstar vs youtuber 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.730
 goes on and trikes and distributes that 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.650
 our youtube-channel will be deleted 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.480
 the youtube 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.549
 then her child probably took that 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.560
 had 450,000 subscribers that got me 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.989
 on my facebook page facebook.de / 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.540
 uncle gamblers are posted youtube 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.060
 channel has been blocked forever 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.700
 deleted for life he can not anymore 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.379
 he had over 450,000 attacks 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.819
 subscribers so far is rockstar 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.480
 proceeded and youtube is with it 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.370
 Agreed 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.170
 i can on youtube i can youtube 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.819
 again, you have to understand that you otherwise 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.439
 get the problems with rockstar 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.780
 So do not be angry on youtube 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:44.090
 but on rockstar youtube can do it 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.730
 I am not completely honest with people 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.340
 annoyed because ultimately said 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.780
 Last week I was so mad where 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.280
 I realized that I was real 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.720
 disappointed by rockstar and then it came 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.069
 moreover has my mirror one takes 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.930
 full post kicked off 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.389
 but my vehicle damaged the game 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.739
 and then the guy fled that too 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.480
 was one hundred percent intentional though 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.709
 also shit I want my 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.930
 do not break weekend this time 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.299
 It is now a holiday tomorrow 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.159

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.980
