00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the ionix so we've seen you know we've

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.330 
the ionix so we've seen you know we've
been<00:00:57.539> doing<00:00:57.809> demos<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.410> ionic<00:00:58.920> vortex

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
been doing demos of the ionic vortex

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.970 
been doing demos of the ionic vortex
this<00:00:59.520> giant<00:00:59.969> hurricane<00:01:00.350> like<00:01:01.350> power<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.890> he

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
this giant hurricane like power that he

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.700 
this giant hurricane like power that he
can<00:01:02.129> unleash<00:01:02.489> electric<00:01:03.180> storm<00:01:03.710> another

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
can unleash electric storm another

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.289 
can unleash electric storm another
example<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.339> when<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:05.820> revealed<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.240> week

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
example is when we revealed this week

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.330 
example is when we revealed this week
which<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> ionic<00:01:07.290> drain<00:01:09.110> on<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.340> karmically

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
which is the ionic drain on a karmically

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.630 
which is the ionic drain on a karmically
evil<00:01:11.880> path<00:01:12.200> Cole<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.500> start<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.100> draw<00:01:14.369> power

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
evil path Cole can start to draw power

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.340 
evil path Cole can start to draw power
from<00:01:14.820> all<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.509> pedestrians<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.140> all<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
enemies nearby into himself and these

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.170 
enemies nearby into himself and these
are<00:01:18.900> really<00:01:19.140> heavy<00:01:19.259> spectacular<00:01:20.189> powers<00:01:20.580> that

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
are really heavy spectacular powers that

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.640 
are really heavy spectacular powers that
really<00:01:21.570> change<00:01:21.840> kind<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.229> feel<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
bad guy right yeah you know I we think

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.760 
bad guy right yeah you know I we think
that<00:01:33.460> really<00:01:33.730> central<00:01:34.180> to<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.840> experience<00:01:35.440> of

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
that really central to the experience of

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.530 
that really central to the experience of
a<00:01:35.950> sandbox<00:01:36.580> superhero<00:01:37.150> game<00:01:37.330> you<00:01:37.450> know

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
a sandbox superhero game you know

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.300 
a sandbox superhero game you know
sandbox<00:01:37.990> games<00:01:38.230> are<00:01:38.350> about<00:01:38.440> doing<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:39.100> going

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
sandbox games are about doing and going

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.860 
sandbox games are about doing and going
where<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:39.520> want<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.760> go<00:01:39.850> and<00:01:40.120> we<00:01:40.540> think<00:01:40.750> that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
where you want to go and we think that

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.230 
where you want to go and we think that
central<00:01:41.530> to<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.860> superhero<00:01:42.370> mythology<00:01:43.090> is

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
central to the superhero mythology is

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.480 
central to the superhero mythology is
that<00:01:43.450> if<00:01:43.690> we<00:01:44.170> give<00:01:44.320> you<00:01:44.440> powers<00:01:44.860> will<00:01:45.310> it

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
that if we give you powers will it

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.390 
that if we give you powers will it
corrupt<00:01:46.210> you<00:01:46.480> or<00:01:46.750> will<00:01:47.050> you<00:01:47.200> be<00:01:47.230> come<00:01:47.890> heroic

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
corrupt you or will you be come heroic

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.100 
corrupt you or will you be come heroic
and<00:01:48.610> so<00:01:49.120> that's<00:01:49.270> always<00:01:49.510> been<00:01:49.750> a<00:01:49.780> central

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
and so that's always been a central

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.850 
and so that's always been a central
tenet<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:51.070> infamous<00:01:51.340> series<00:01:52.860> really

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860
