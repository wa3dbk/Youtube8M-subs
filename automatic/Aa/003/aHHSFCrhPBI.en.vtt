scroll up or down the URL bar comes up

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.490 
scroll up or down the URL bar comes up
then<00:01:37.229> after<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> few<00:01:37.650> seconds<00:01:38.869> it'll<00:01:39.869> disappear

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
then after a few seconds it'll disappear

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.240 
then after a few seconds it'll disappear
