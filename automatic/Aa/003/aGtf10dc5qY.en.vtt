one of their product experts and we're
going<00:00:21.189> to<00:00:21.250> talk<00:00:21.400> about<00:00:21.550> the<00:00:21.760> via<00:00:21.939> connect

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
going to talk about the via connect

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.690 
going to talk about the via connect
indeed<00:00:22.990> tell<00:00:23.410> me<00:00:23.529> a<00:00:23.560> little<00:00:23.619> bit<00:00:23.800> about<00:00:24.009> it<00:00:24.070> ok

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
indeed tell me a little bit about it ok

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.029 
indeed tell me a little bit about it ok
so<00:00:24.970> the<00:00:25.150> via<00:00:25.330> connect<00:00:25.750> via<00:00:26.289> is<00:00:26.500> a<00:00:26.529> new<00:00:26.770> category

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
so the via connect via is a new category

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.010 
so the via connect via is a new category
of<00:00:27.340> products<00:00:27.759> for<00:00:28.029> Kramer<00:00:28.270> we<00:00:28.570> have<00:00:28.750> the<00:00:28.840> via

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
of products for Kramer we have the via

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.839 
of products for Kramer we have the via

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
it perfectly also with the via connect

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.770 
it perfectly also with the via connect
there's<00:01:17.649> security<00:01:18.100> you<00:01:18.729> get<00:01:18.940> 1024<00:01:19.630> bit

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
there's security you get 1024 bit

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.780 
there's security you get 1024 bit

higher education environment security is
everything<00:01:28.420> they<00:01:28.900> want<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.350> know<00:01:29.560> that<00:01:29.860> you're

everything they want to know that you're

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.249 
everything they want to know that you're
going<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.119> put<00:01:31.270> that<00:01:31.299> on<00:01:31.450> my<00:01:31.720> network<00:01:31.960> well

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
going to put that on my network well

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.319 
going to put that on my network well
then<00:01:32.380> it<00:01:32.470> better<00:01:32.590> be<00:01:32.799> secure<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:33.490> so<00:01:34.030> with<00:01:34.240> the

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
then it better be secure and so with the

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:35.999 
then it better be secure and so with the
via<00:01:34.479> connects<00:01:34.810> you<00:01:34.900> got<00:01:35.020> that<00:01:35.200> 1024<00:01:35.890> bit

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
via connects you got that 1024 bit

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.310 
via connects you got that 1024 bit
encryption<00:01:36.400> you<00:01:37.030> got<00:01:37.150> dynamic<00:01:37.750> room<00:01:37.990> codes

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
encryption you got dynamic room codes

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.770 
encryption you got dynamic room codes
that<00:01:38.799> give<00:01:39.520> you<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.700> ability<00:01:39.759> that<00:01:40.210> if<00:01:40.630> you

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
that give you the ability that if you

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.210 
that give you the ability that if you
were<00:01:40.960> logged<00:01:41.170> in<00:01:41.409> yesterday<00:01:41.860> you're<00:01:42.040> not

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
were logged in yesterday you're not

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.620 
were logged in yesterday you're not
going<00:01:42.400> to<00:01:42.490> be<00:01:42.610> interfering<00:01:43.270> with<00:01:43.299> today's

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
going to be interfering with today's

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.210 
going to be interfering with today's
meeting<00:01:44.020> if<00:01:44.140> you're<00:01:44.259> not<00:01:44.409> participating<00:01:44.680> in

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
meeting if you're not participating in

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.950 
meeting if you're not participating in
it<00:01:45.310> because<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.850> room<00:01:46.030> code<00:01:46.299> changes

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
it because the room code changes

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.380 
it because the room code changes
dynamically<00:01:47.680> so<00:01:48.399> the<00:01:48.520> via<00:01:48.670> connect<00:01:49.000> is<00:01:49.149> a<00:01:49.180> very

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
dynamically so the via connect is a very

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.280 
dynamically so the via connect is a very
