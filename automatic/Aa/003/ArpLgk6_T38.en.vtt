the ice bucket challenge is a great

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.330 
the ice bucket challenge is a great
initiative<00:00:15.870> because<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.770> raises<00:00:17.279> our

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
initiative because it raises our

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.920 
initiative because it raises our
awareness<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.940> another<00:00:18.270> illness<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.779> I

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
awareness of another illness that I

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.439 
awareness of another illness that I
didn't<00:00:19.260> even<00:00:19.350> know<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.619> existed<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.550> it

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
didn't even know that existed and it

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.090 
didn't even know that existed and it
also<00:00:21.630> gathered<00:00:22.109> quite<00:00:22.289> some<00:00:22.529> money<00:00:22.740> for<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
also gathered quite some money for the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.250 
also gathered quite some money for the
coast<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.609> hope<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.029> will<00:00:24.210> be<00:00:24.269> used<00:00:24.539> for

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
coast so I hope it will be used for

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.620 
coast so I hope it will be used for
those<00:00:25.380> patients<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.130> there<00:00:26.340> will<00:00:26.550> be<00:00:26.630> finally

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
those patients and there will be finally

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.259 
those patients and there will be finally
some<00:00:27.930> research<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.289> will<00:00:28.680> determine<00:00:29.250> how<00:00:30.240> to

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
some research that will determine how to

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.340 
some research that will determine how to
treat<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.920> illness<00:00:32.660> but<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.690> also<00:00:33.930> think<00:00:34.230> that

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350
