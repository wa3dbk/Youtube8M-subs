00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
and the next thing we need to do is set

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.889 
and the next thing we need to do is set
up<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.240> first<00:00:03.780> part<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:05.720> modeling<00:00:06.720> and

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
up the first part of the modeling and

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.049 
up the first part of the modeling and
want<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.560> start<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.250> modeling<00:00:08.610> around<00:00:08.910> the

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
want to start the modeling around the

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.430 
want to start the modeling around the
eye<00:00:09.120> we're<00:00:09.540> actually<00:00:09.719> going<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.170> be<00:00:10.230> only

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
eye we're actually going to be only

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.620 
eye we're actually going to be only
modeling<00:00:10.860> half<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.550> face<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.090> then

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
modeling half of the face and then

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.690 
modeling half of the face and then
mirroring<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.200> other<00:00:13.440> half<00:00:13.710> with<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.460> mirror

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
mirroring the other half with the mirror

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.990 
mirroring the other half with the mirror
modifier<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.509> we've<00:00:15.780> used<00:00:15.990> before<00:00:16.520> okay<00:00:17.520> so

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
modifier that we've used before okay so

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.470 
modifier that we've used before okay so
to<00:00:18.090> start<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.510> modeling<00:00:18.960> we<00:00:19.650> need<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.039> click

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
to start the modeling we need to click

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.970 
to start the modeling we need to click
with<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.630> cursor<00:00:23.029> to<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.539> eye<00:00:24.750> here<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.859> then

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
with the cursor to the eye here and then

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.210 
with the cursor to the eye here and then
press<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.310> spacebar<00:00:27.019> mesh<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.380> then<00:00:28.769> plane

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
press the spacebar mesh and then plane

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.020 
press the spacebar mesh and then plane
ok<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.779> now<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:31.949> see<00:00:31.980> here<00:00:32.430> here<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
ok so now you can see here here is the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.610 
ok so now you can see here here is the
plane<00:00:33.329> here<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:34.020> don't<00:00:34.170> see<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.500> this

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
plane here but we don't see it in this

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.139 
plane here but we don't see it in this
view<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.010> let's<00:00:35.160> zoom<00:00:35.370> out<00:00:35.520> there<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.120> right

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
view so let's zoom out there it is right

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.840 
view so let's zoom out there it is right
there<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.719> let's<00:00:36.930> drag<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.530> over<00:00:37.850> while

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
there so let's drag it over while

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.190 
there so let's drag it over while
wearing<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.180> three<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.809> just<00:00:39.840> press

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the G key drag it over alright so the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.750 
the G key drag it over alright so the
center<00:00:45.570> parts<00:00:45.840> right<00:00:46.020> around<00:00:46.289> at<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.770> eye<00:00:46.800> ok

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
center parts right around at the eye ok

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.160 
center parts right around at the eye ok
if<00:00:47.969> yours<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> little<00:00:48.690> different<00:00:49.020> just

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
if yours is a little different just

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.150 
if yours is a little different just
position<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:51.629> about<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.860> this

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
position it so it's it's about in this

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.979 
position it so it's it's about in this
view<00:00:53.430> ok<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.059> then<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.510> want<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
view ok and then we want to have the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.900 
view ok and then we want to have the
front<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:56.160> see<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.579> full<00:00:57.050> plane

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
front so we can see the full plane

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.220 
front so we can see the full plane
viewable<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:00.359> view<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:00.899> need<00:01:01.109> to

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
viewable in the one view so we need to

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:09.469 
viewable in the one view so we need to
just<00:01:01.410> rotate<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.129> three<00:01:02.730> view<00:01:03.049> the<00:01:06.680> plane<00:01:08.479> get

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
just rotate in three view the plane get

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.200 
just rotate in three view the plane get
that<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.110> vertical<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.549> let's<00:01:11.760> zoom<00:01:12.030> in

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
that so it's vertical and let's zoom in

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.480 
that so it's vertical and let's zoom in
on<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:13.380> face<00:01:13.650> there<00:01:13.979> ok<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.210> now<00:01:15.390> we<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:16.490> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
on the face there ok so now we have the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.170 
on the face there ok so now we have the
plane<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:18.380> this<00:01:19.380> view<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.950> then<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.340> view<00:01:20.580> ok

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
plane on this view and then this view ok

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.240 
plane on this view and then this view ok
i<00:01:21.390> want<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.990> make<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.290> plane<00:01:22.500> transparent<00:01:23.159> so

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
i want to make the plane transparent so

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.560 
i want to make the plane transparent so
we<00:01:23.310> don't<00:01:23.549> have<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> surface<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.299> there<00:01:24.450> so

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
we don't have the surface in there so

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.270 
we don't have the surface in there so
you<00:01:24.659> can<00:01:24.810> see<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> eye<00:01:25.140> underneath<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:26.040> press

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
you can see the eye underneath you press

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.969 
you can see the eye underneath you press
the<00:01:26.460> Z<00:01:26.640> key<00:01:26.880> without<00:01:27.689> any<00:01:28.020> other<00:01:28.229> modifier

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the Z key without any other modifier

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.130 
the Z key without any other modifier
keys<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.520> dizzy<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.360> now<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
keys just dizzy and now we have just the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.859 
keys just dizzy and now we have just the
outline<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:33.810> plane<00:01:35.299> now<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.360> next<00:01:36.540> thing<00:01:36.689> we

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
outline the plane now the next thing we

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.219 
outline the plane now the next thing we
want<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.560> go<00:01:37.860> into<00:01:38.040> edit<00:01:38.340> mode<00:01:39.229> so

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
want to do is go into edit mode so

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.600 
want to do is go into edit mode so
everything<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.829> highlighted<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.369> then<00:01:41.520> we

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
everything is highlighted and then we

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.120 
everything is highlighted and then we
can<00:01:41.759> press<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.150> S<00:01:42.479> key<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.200> scale<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
can press this S key to scale it and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.649 
can press this S key to scale it and
let's<00:01:44.280> scale<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.729> down<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:47.450> left<00:01:48.450> and

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
let's scale it down so the left and

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.429 
let's scale it down so the left and
right<00:01:48.720> edges<00:01:49.049> are<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:50.310> around<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.810> left

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
right edges are just around this left

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.230 
right edges are just around this left
and<00:01:52.619> right<00:01:52.740> size<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.280> eye<00:01:53.310> ok<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.149> then

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and right size of the eye ok and then

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.330 
and right size of the eye ok and then
click<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:55.500> now<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:55.770> are<00:01:55.890> kind<00:01:56.280> of

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
click so now we are kind of

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.080 
click so now we are kind of
encapsulating<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.450> around<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> eye

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
encapsulating that around the eye

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.969 
encapsulating that around the eye
alright<00:02:00.090> next<00:02:00.810> thing<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.259> do<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.439> we<00:02:01.710> want<00:02:01.740> to

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
we need to do a little bit of centering

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.539 
we need to do a little bit of centering
of<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.530> eye<00:02:04.560> here<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.369> good

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
of the eye here and this is a good

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.350 
of the eye here and this is a good
practice<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:07.039> kind<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:09.000> we<00:02:09.179> are

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
practice is just to kind of so we are

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.440 
practice is just to kind of so we are
sure<00:02:09.390> where<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.410> center<00:02:10.619> point<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.220> ok<00:02:11.849> press

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
sure where the center point is ok press

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.730 
sure where the center point is ok press
the<00:02:12.629> W<00:02:12.989> key

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
the W key

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.650 
the W key
and<00:02:13.970> then<00:02:14.970> press<00:02:15.570> subdivide<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.440> now<00:02:16.860> we<00:02:16.920> can

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
and then press subdivide and now we can

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.040 
and then press subdivide and now we can
use<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:19.050> Center<00:02:19.830> vertex<00:02:20.400> there<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.050> press

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
use that Center vertex there and press

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.900 
use that Center vertex there and press
the<00:02:22.230> G<00:02:22.410> key<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.920> we<00:02:23.040> can<00:02:23.190> kind<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.520> move<00:02:23.730> this

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
the G key and we can kind of move this

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.540 
the G key and we can kind of move this
around<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.720> get<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.800> where<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.310> center

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
around and get it to where the center

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.580 
around and get it to where the center
might<00:02:26.970> be<00:02:27.270> we<00:02:27.780> were<00:02:27.870> pretty<00:02:27.990> good<00:02:28.140> where<00:02:28.470> we

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
might be we were pretty good where we

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.010 
might be we were pretty good where we
were<00:02:28.800> but<00:02:29.520> we<00:02:29.580> can<00:02:29.880> kind<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.180> adjust<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.810> if<00:02:30.870> we

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
were but we can kind of adjust it if we

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.280 
were but we can kind of adjust it if we
need<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.490> all<00:02:32.490> right<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.880> then<00:02:33.690> press<00:02:33.990> click

need to all right and then press click
now<00:02:35.150> deselect<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.420> we<00:02:37.290> only<00:02:37.410> needed<00:02:37.710> that

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
now deselect and we only needed that

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.040 
now deselect and we only needed that
Center<00:02:38.430> vertex<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.180> kind<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.510> Judge<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.810> eye

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
Center vertex to kind of Judge the eye

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.600 
Center vertex to kind of Judge the eye
part<00:02:40.410> so<00:02:40.710> we're<00:02:40.860> going<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.070> take<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.490> away

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.350 
all right so now this is going to be how
we<00:02:55.350> form<00:02:55.800> our<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:57.080> ok<00:02:58.080> so<00:02:58.680> now<00:02:59.090> what<00:03:00.090> we<00:03:00.180> need<00:03:00.210> to

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
we form our I ok so now what we need to

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.400 
we form our I ok so now what we need to
do<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:01.460> move<00:03:02.460> vertex<00:03:03.120> points<00:03:03.480> okay<00:03:03.960> so<00:03:04.020> we<00:03:04.230> can

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
do is move vertex points okay so we can

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:15.460 
do is move vertex points okay so we can
right<00:03:05.190> click<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.760> grab<00:03:09.620> click

really useful inside of you because we
can<00:03:24.620> select<00:03:24.980> all<00:03:25.550> of<00:03:25.790> these<00:03:26.510> vertices<00:03:27.410> at<00:03:27.830> one

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
can select all of these vertices at one

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.000 
can select all of these vertices at one
point<00:03:28.520> because<00:03:29.000> they<00:03:29.270> are<00:03:29.530> in<00:03:30.530> this<00:03:30.770> view

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
point because they are in this view

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.890 
point because they are in this view
they're<00:03:31.250> all<00:03:31.460> behind<00:03:31.850> themselves<00:03:32.540> okay

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
they're all behind themselves okay

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.080 
they're all behind themselves okay
there's<00:03:33.140> one<00:03:33.440> two<00:03:33.800> three<00:03:34.250> like<00:03:34.520> this<00:03:34.790> we're

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
seeing all these in one instance in a

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.350 
seeing all these in one instance in a
way<00:03:38.630> here<00:03:39.080> okay<00:03:39.530> all<00:03:40.280> right<00:03:40.400> so<00:03:40.850> what<00:03:41.120> we<00:03:41.210> need

way here okay all right so what we need
to<00:03:41.540> do<00:03:42.040> here<00:03:43.040> is<00:03:43.430> we're<00:03:43.880> going<00:03:43.970> to<00:03:44.030> press<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.540> B

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
to do here is we're going to press the B

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.990 
to do here is we're going to press the B
key<00:03:44.750> hold<00:03:45.560> it<00:03:45.680> down<00:03:45.830> and<00:03:46.160> then<00:03:46.670> we<00:03:46.820> need<00:03:46.940> to

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
key hold it down and then we need to

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.240 
key hold it down and then we need to
resize<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:48.140> brush<00:03:48.410> here<00:03:48.770> this<00:03:48.920> is<00:03:49.010> kind<00:03:49.220> of

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
resize the brush here this is kind of

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.730 
resize the brush here this is kind of
like<00:03:49.340> brush<00:03:49.640> in<00:03:49.790> photoshop<00:03:49.959> but<00:03:50.959> we<00:03:51.200> have<00:03:51.380> the

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
like brush in photoshop but we have the

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.490 
like brush in photoshop but we have the
the<00:03:52.070> circle<00:03:52.490> here<00:03:52.700> and<00:03:53.000> we<00:03:53.330> need<00:03:53.540> to<00:03:53.570> change

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
the circle here and we need to change

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.040 
the circle here and we need to change
the<00:03:54.680> silence<00:03:55.040> we<00:03:55.190> move<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.640> mouse<00:03:55.850> button<00:03:56.330> the

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
the silence we move the mouse button the

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.920 
the silence we move the mouse button the
center<00:03:57.530> mouse<00:03:57.709> wheel<00:03:58.190> forward<00:03:58.850> so<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.300> gets<00:03:59.420> to

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
center mouse wheel forward so it gets to

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.130 
center mouse wheel forward so it gets to
be<00:03:59.959> about<00:04:00.440> you<00:04:00.980> know<00:04:01.070> a<00:04:01.100> small<00:04:01.550> size<00:04:01.970> and<00:04:02.390> then

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
be about you know a small size and then

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.300 
be about you know a small size and then
you<00:04:03.830> can<00:04:04.010> select<00:04:04.270> the<00:04:05.270> center<00:04:05.720> part<00:04:05.990> of<00:04:06.670> the

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
you can select the center part of the

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.280 
you can select the center part of the
vertices<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.760> you<00:04:10.910> see<00:04:11.090> it<00:04:11.270> selected<00:04:11.870> both<00:04:12.080> of

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
vertices and you see it selected both of

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.960 
vertices and you see it selected both of
these<00:04:12.350> vertices<00:04:12.709> with<00:04:12.980> one<00:04:13.280> click<00:04:13.610> that's

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
these vertices with one click that's

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.430 
these vertices with one click that's
really<00:04:14.209> handy<00:04:14.450> especially<00:04:14.870> for<00:04:15.230> what<00:04:15.320> we're

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
really handy especially for what we're

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.810 
really handy especially for what we're
going<00:04:15.530> to<00:04:15.620> do<00:04:15.709> now<00:04:15.860> because<00:04:16.459> what<00:04:16.579> we<00:04:16.640> can<00:04:16.760> do

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
going to do now because what we can do

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.580 
going to do now because what we can do
now<00:04:17.030> is<00:04:18.340> grab<00:04:19.340> them<00:04:19.549> and<00:04:19.669> pull<00:04:19.790> them<00:04:19.940> back<00:04:20.590> but

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
now is grab them and pull them back but

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.920 
now is grab them and pull them back but
since<00:04:22.340> we're<00:04:22.520> in<00:04:22.550> this<00:04:22.880> be<00:04:23.120> selection<00:04:23.660> mode<00:04:23.810> we

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
since we're in this be selection mode we

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.080 
since we're in this be selection mode we
need<00:04:24.050> to<00:04:24.140> click<00:04:24.410> out<00:04:24.590> of<00:04:24.620> it<00:04:24.860> okay<00:04:25.370> so<00:04:25.850> we<00:04:25.940> need

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
need to click out of it okay so we need

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.600 
need to click out of it okay so we need
to<00:04:26.180> do<00:04:26.270> a<00:04:26.300> right<00:04:26.630> click<00:04:27.040> so<00:04:28.040> now<00:04:28.190> we're<00:04:28.430> out<00:04:28.460> of

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
to do a right click so now we're out of

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.930 
to do a right click so now we're out of
that<00:04:28.910> and<00:04:29.180> now<00:04:29.330> we<00:04:29.390> can<00:04:29.600> press<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:30.050> G<00:04:30.350> key<00:04:30.620> and

that and now we can press the G key and

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.650 
that and now we can press the G key and
pull<00:04:31.940> those<00:04:32.120> back<00:04:32.479> to<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.350> corner<00:04:33.680> of<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.800> eye

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
pull those back to the corner of the eye

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.950 
pull those back to the corner of the eye
and<00:04:35.660> then<00:04:35.840> click<00:04:36.350> alright<00:04:37.310> so<00:04:38.060> that's<00:04:38.690> the

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
beginning of our eye and out what we can

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.360 
beginning of our eye and out what we can
we<00:04:41.210> can<00:04:41.360> actually<00:04:41.630> look<00:04:41.840> at<00:04:42.080> it<00:04:42.290> and<00:04:42.740> we<00:04:43.190> can

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
we can actually look at it and we can

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.950 
we can actually look at it and we can
kind<00:04:43.520> of<00:04:43.640> see<00:04:43.880> what's<00:04:44.210> happening<00:04:44.600> that<00:04:44.750> we

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
kind of see what's happening that we

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
back to that view one of the techniques

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.300 
back to that view one of the techniques
we<00:04:52.400> could<00:04:52.610> use<00:04:52.760> is<00:04:52.910> using<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.270> B<00:04:53.450> key<00:04:53.720> to<00:04:54.310> pull

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
we could use is using the B key to pull

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.190 
we could use is using the B key to pull
back<00:04:55.520> and<00:04:55.700> you<00:04:55.790> can<00:04:55.910> see<00:04:56.120> here<00:04:56.479> one<00:04:57.020> of<00:04:57.110> the

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
things that we can we have a few

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.260 
things that we can we have a few
different<00:05:00.520> vertex<00:05:01.520> points<00:05:01.760> that<00:05:01.850> we<00:05:01.940> can<00:05:02.090> move

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
different vertex points that we can move

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.200 
different vertex points that we can move
back<00:05:02.450> and<00:05:02.510> forth<00:05:02.990> okay<00:05:03.410> so<00:05:03.950> in<00:05:04.250> doing<00:05:04.790> this<00:05:05.000> we
