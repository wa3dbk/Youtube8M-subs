00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
like these I was thinking about grabbing

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.120 
like these I was thinking about grabbing
these<00:00:12.599> actually<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.259> different<00:00:13.679> color<00:00:13.830> yeah

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
these actually in different color yeah

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.080 
these actually in different color yeah
so<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:15.080> hyper<00:00:16.080> fuse<00:00:16.789> 2014<00:00:17.789> what

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
so this is the hyper fuse 2014 what

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.450 
so this is the hyper fuse 2014 what
material<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.109> per<00:00:19.260> month<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.070> upper

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
material is that per month so the upper

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.099 
material is that per month so the upper
is<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:21.420> hyper<00:00:21.630> fuse<00:00:24.500> full<00:00:25.500> green<00:00:25.949> hyper<00:00:26.609> fuse

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
is the hyper fuse full green hyper fuse

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.859 
is the hyper fuse full green hyper fuse
for<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.199> upper<00:00:28.760> but<00:00:29.760> then<00:00:29.939> it's<00:00:30.240> got<00:00:30.449> kind<00:00:30.750> of

with a private that little window in

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.020 
with a private that little window in
there<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> thing<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.820> most

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
there but the thing that I like most

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.049 
there but the thing that I like most
about<00:00:57.480> these<00:00:57.899> besides<00:00:58.469> I've<00:00:58.770> had<00:00:59.250> three<00:00:59.879> pairs

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
about these besides I've had three pairs

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.990 
about these besides I've had three pairs
of<00:01:00.210> hyper<00:01:01.050> fuses<00:01:01.530> before<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.070> really<00:01:02.730> really

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
of hyper fuses before I really really

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.310 
of hyper fuses before I really really
liked<00:01:03.180> them<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> only<00:01:03.539> thing<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.899> didn't

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
liked them the only thing that I didn't

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.039 
liked them the only thing that I didn't
like<00:01:04.470> about<00:01:04.799> previous<00:01:05.519> ones<00:01:05.820> um<00:01:06.060> was<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
like about previous ones um was the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.870 
like about previous ones um was the
width<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.560> thought<00:01:07.979> they<00:01:08.100> were<00:01:08.159> very<00:01:08.220> very

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
width I thought they were very very

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.120 
width I thought they were very very
narrow<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:09.810> these<00:01:10.049> ones<00:01:10.260> are<00:01:10.409> definitely<00:01:11.100> a

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
narrow but these ones are definitely a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.020 
narrow but these ones are definitely a
little<00:01:11.250> bit<00:01:11.490> wider

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
little bit wider

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.570 
little bit wider
Nikes<00:01:12.630> are<00:01:12.810> generally<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.560> narrow<00:01:14.010> shoe<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.520> if

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
Nikes are generally a narrow shoe so if

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
Nikes are generally a narrow shoe so if
you're<00:01:14.670> going<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:14.909> Nikes<00:01:15.270> II<00:01:15.299> kind<00:01:15.570> of

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
you're going with Nikes II kind of

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.230 
you're going with Nikes II kind of
expect<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.130> anyways<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.790> I'm<00:01:18.060> not

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
expect that as it is anyways and I'm not

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.840 
expect that as it is anyways and I'm not
one<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.450> ties<00:01:18.990> my<00:01:19.170> shoes<00:01:19.350> super<00:01:19.619> tight<00:01:20.009> so

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
one that ties my shoes super tight so

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.700 
one that ties my shoes super tight so
maybe<00:01:21.060> that's<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.540> didn't<00:01:21.840> notice<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:22.590> it

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
maybe that's I didn't notice it but it

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.100 
maybe that's I didn't notice it but it
just<00:01:22.860> feels<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.549> spreads<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.000> out<00:01:24.110> really

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
just feels like it spreads it out really

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.960 
just feels like it spreads it out really
really<00:01:25.259> nice<00:01:25.650> because<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.310> my<00:01:26.490> other<00:01:26.640> ones<00:01:26.880> I

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
really nice because I on my other ones I

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.359 
really nice because I on my other ones I
have<00:01:27.000> felt<00:01:27.720> kind<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.049> snug<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:29.040> these<00:01:29.189> ones

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
have felt kind of snug but these ones

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.069 
have felt kind of snug but these ones
definitely<00:01:29.909> did<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.180> trick<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.570> me<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.840> fit

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
definitely did the trick for me to fit

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.289 
definitely did the trick for me to fit
lock<00:01:31.590> down<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.979> really<00:01:32.280> good<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.150> back

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
lock down is really good in the back

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.810 
lock down is really good in the back
heel<00:01:33.540> huh<00:01:33.840> got<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> nice<00:01:34.350> stable<00:01:34.590> base<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.729> I

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
heel huh got a nice stable base on it I

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.510 
heel huh got a nice stable base on it I
like<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.420> almost<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.840> whole<00:01:37.049> thing<00:01:37.439> kind<00:01:38.400> of

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
like that almost the whole thing kind of

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.580 
like that almost the whole thing kind of
protrudes<00:01:39.090> out<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.509> little<00:01:39.960> bit<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.110> think<00:01:40.380> that

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
protrudes out a little bit I think that

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.160 
protrudes out a little bit I think that
makes<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.310> good<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.610> kind<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.570> stability

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
makes it good for kind of the stability

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.240 
makes it good for kind of the stability
of<00:01:43.409> it

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
of it

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.120 
of it
attraction<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.630> solid<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.619> would<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.860> would<00:01:46.979> say

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
attraction is solid I would I would say

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.609 
attraction is solid I would I would say
fast<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.970> would<00:01:48.030> probably<00:01:48.210> say<00:01:48.450> 8<00:01:49.140> out<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.380> 10

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
fast I would probably say 8 out of 10

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.690 
fast I would probably say 8 out of 10
for<00:01:49.920> traction<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.090> got<00:01:51.240> kind<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.570> deep

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
for traction it's got kind of a deep

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.520 
for traction it's got kind of a deep
herringbone<00:01:53.700> which<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:55.049> kind<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.380> hit-or-miss

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
herringbone which is kind of hit-or-miss

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.800 
herringbone which is kind of hit-or-miss
it<00:01:55.920> seems<00:01:56.159> like<00:01:56.369> seems<00:01:57.000> like<00:01:57.180> it's<00:01:57.479> got<00:01:57.659> like

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
it seems like seems like it's got like

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.440 
it seems like seems like it's got like
flexible<00:01:58.619> yeah<00:01:59.189> it's<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.490> flexible<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.390> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
flexible yeah it's like flexible on the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.630 
flexible yeah it's like flexible on the
bottom<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.649> could<00:02:01.860> see<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.250> know<00:02:02.340> after<00:02:02.610> a

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
bottom so I could see you know after a

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.889 
bottom so I could see you know after a
while<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.850> probably<00:02:03.149> have<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.450> wipe<00:02:03.600> them<00:02:03.780> off

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
while you probably have to wipe them off

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.870 
while you probably have to wipe them off
a<00:02:04.140> little<00:02:04.590> bit<00:02:04.710> more<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.100> more<00:02:05.310> especially<00:02:05.820> on

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
a little bit more and more especially on

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.280 
a little bit more and more especially on
indoor<00:02:06.180> courts<00:02:06.540> outdoor<00:02:06.719> would<00:02:06.990> probably

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
indoor courts outdoor would probably

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.290 
indoor courts outdoor would probably
work<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.619> little<00:02:08.099> bit<00:02:08.220> they<00:02:08.520> wear<00:02:08.789> out<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:09.000> little

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
work a little bit they wear out a little

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.449 
work a little bit they wear out a little
bit<00:02:09.420> more<00:02:09.629> but<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.590> do<00:02:10.709> really<00:02:11.069> like<00:02:11.310> this

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
bit more but I do really like this

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.350 
bit more but I do really like this
Phylon<00:02:11.849> midsole

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
Phylon midsole

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.780 
Phylon midsole
because<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.170> feel<00:02:13.470> like<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:14.069> really<00:02:14.459> locks

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
because I feel like it it really locks

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.420 
because I feel like it it really locks
you<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.270> there<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.720> lot<00:02:16.170> more<00:02:16.379> I'm<00:02:16.739> a<00:02:16.800> big<00:02:18.260> mid

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
you in there a lot more I'm a big mid

you in there a lot more I'm a big mid

shoe buyer I don't dabble too much into

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.760 
shoe buyer I don't dabble too much into
the<00:02:22.920> lows<00:02:23.129> but<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:24.000> like<00:02:24.239> I<00:02:24.420> like<00:02:24.629> this<00:02:24.989> this<00:02:25.530> up

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
the lows but I like I like this this up

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.050 
the lows but I like I like this this up
or<00:02:25.980> how<00:02:26.129> it<00:02:26.220> gives<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.550> little<00:02:26.700> bit<00:02:26.849> more

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
or how it gives you a little bit more

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
on the design part of it but I like I

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.930 
on the design part of it but I like I
like<00:02:33.810> having<00:02:34.170> something<00:02:34.410> up<00:02:34.800> there<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.819> only

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
like having something up there the only

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.250 
like having something up there the only
thing<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.209> probably<00:02:36.510> could<00:02:36.810> have<00:02:36.840> done<00:02:37.080> without

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
thing I probably could have done without

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.920 
thing I probably could have done without
which<00:02:37.709> I<00:02:37.860> add<00:02:38.040> on<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.910> first<00:02:39.150> two<00:02:39.360> pairs<00:02:39.840> of

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
which I add on the first two pairs of

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.600 
which I add on the first two pairs of
hyper<00:02:40.080> views<00:02:40.349> that<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.590> got<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:41.190> tongue<00:02:41.430> was

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
hyper views that I got the tongue was

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.759 
hyper views that I got the tongue was
super<00:02:42.120> super<00:02:42.450> thin<00:02:42.690> where<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.319> almost<00:02:43.650> has

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
super super thin where this almost has

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.820 
super super thin where this almost has
like<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.099> hyper<00:02:44.280> done<00:02:44.550> 2013<00:02:45.590> chunk<00:02:46.590> where

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
like the hyper done 2013 chunk where

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.009 
like the hyper done 2013 chunk where
it's<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.010> little<00:02:47.250> bit<00:02:47.340> more<00:02:47.489> bulky<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.209> also

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
it's a little bit more bulky and also

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.530 
it's a little bit more bulky and also
has<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.379> kind<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.709> protruded<00:02:50.250> out<00:02:50.400> this<00:02:51.180> to

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
has that kind of protruded out this to

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.630 
has that kind of protruded out this to
it<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.739> was<00:02:52.830> kind<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.069> a<00:02:53.129> little<00:02:53.340> bulky

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
it so that was kind of a little bulky

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.759 
it so that was kind of a little bulky
for<00:02:53.790> me<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.180> even<00:02:54.420> when<00:02:54.569> I<00:02:54.599> tie<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.410> still

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
for me and even when I tie it it still

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.619 
for me and even when I tie it it still
kind<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.069> bothers<00:02:56.580> me<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.790> little<00:02:57.030> bit<00:02:57.180> up<00:02:57.420> there

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
kind of bothers me a little bit up there

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.330 
kind of bothers me a little bit up there
but<00:02:57.930> everything<00:02:58.170> else<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.650> really<00:02:58.680> really

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
but everything else I really really

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.369 
but everything else I really really
liked<00:02:59.519> another<00:02:59.819> thing<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.180> liked<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.260> it

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
liked another thing I liked is that it

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.559 
liked another thing I liked is that it
sinks<00:03:01.709> in<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.220> it's<00:03:02.459> got<00:03:02.700> really<00:03:03.090> really<00:03:03.269> good

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
sinks in and it's got really really good

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.089 
sinks in and it's got really really good
arch<00:03:03.840> support<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:04.409> lot<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.650> times<00:03:04.830> we<00:03:05.040> don't

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
arch support a lot of times we don't

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.619 
arch support a lot of times we don't
drive<00:03:05.340> both<00:03:05.489> had<00:03:05.670> enough<00:03:05.730> enough<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.269> steeper

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
drive both had enough enough and steeper

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.750 
drive both had enough enough and steeper
views<00:03:06.870> but<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.680> arch<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:08.010> really<00:03:08.340> really<00:03:08.519> good

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
views but the arch is really really good

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.940 
views but the arch is really really good
on<00:03:08.879> this<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.239> seems<00:03:09.269> like<00:03:09.569> a<00:03:09.690> flat<00:03:10.530> shoe<00:03:10.739> I

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
on this it seems like a flat shoe I

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.559 
on this it seems like a flat shoe I
guess<00:03:11.190> really<00:03:11.610> when<00:03:11.970> you<00:03:12.060> look<00:03:12.090> at<00:03:12.330> it<00:03:12.450> like

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
guess really when you look at it like

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.869 
guess really when you look at it like
that<00:03:12.599> seems<00:03:13.290> really<00:03:13.560> flat<00:03:13.769> but<00:03:13.800> this<00:03:14.610> part

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
that seems really flat but this part

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.910 
that seems really flat but this part
really<00:03:15.180> dips<00:03:15.540> in<00:03:15.780> on<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.830> midsole<00:03:17.220> what<00:03:18.920> is

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
really dips in on the midsole what is

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.350 
really dips in on the midsole what is
the<00:03:20.129> ventilation<00:03:20.340> like<00:03:20.790> because<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.060> notice

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
the ventilation like because I notice

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.300 
the ventilation like because I notice
there's<00:03:21.540> some<00:03:21.690> good<00:03:21.870> yeah<00:03:22.409> holes<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.250> I

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
there's some good yeah holes it I

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.949 
there's some good yeah holes it I
probably<00:03:23.580> use<00:03:23.790> these<00:03:23.940> for<00:03:24.209> about<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.930> last

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
probably use these for about the last

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.399

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299

super sweaty feet vent ventilation is
awesome<00:03:33.599> not<00:03:33.750> only<00:03:33.780> because<00:03:34.379> the<00:03:34.530> hyper<00:03:34.680> fuse

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
awesome not only because the hyper fuse

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.339 
awesome not only because the hyper fuse
which<00:03:35.549> does<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.790> great<00:03:36.060> job<00:03:36.120> but<00:03:36.780> also<00:03:36.989> that

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
which does a great job but also that

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.759 
which does a great job but also that

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
mesh tongue is very very thin as you get

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.140

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
and whistles but what happens is a lot

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.869 
and whistles but what happens is a lot
of<00:03:55.290> people<00:03:55.560> maybe<00:03:55.920> for<00:03:56.129> the<00:03:56.220> teams<00:03:56.459> have<00:03:56.730> this

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
of people maybe for the teams have this

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.580 
of people maybe for the teams have this
shoe<00:03:57.060> so<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:57.510> think<00:03:57.629> if<00:03:58.019> you<00:03:58.080> get<00:03:58.290> this<00:03:58.409> says

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
shoe so I think if you get this says

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.140 
shoe so I think if you get this says
team<00:03:58.799> show<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.010> think<00:03:59.250> you'd<00:03:59.340> be<00:03:59.459> pretty<00:03:59.640> pretty

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
team show I think you'd be pretty pretty

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.759 
team show I think you'd be pretty pretty
happy<00:04:00.510> with<00:04:00.629> it<00:04:00.689> and<00:04:00.989> you<00:04:01.290> know<00:04:01.470> they're<00:04:01.650> only

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
happy with it and you know they're only

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.030 
happy with it and you know they're only
about<00:04:02.010> 110<00:04:02.610> 115<00:04:03.510> dollars<00:04:03.689> so<00:04:04.140> you<00:04:04.650> know<00:04:04.739> even

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
about 110 115 dollars so you know even

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.860 
about 110 115 dollars so you know even
for<00:04:05.069> a<00:04:05.250> regular<00:04:05.670> rotation<00:04:05.879> it's<00:04:06.480> probably<00:04:06.750> not

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
for a regular rotation it's probably not

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.710 
for a regular rotation it's probably not
in<00:04:07.409> my<00:04:07.590> top<00:04:07.830> 2<00:04:08.129> or<00:04:08.159> top<00:04:08.519> 3<00:04:08.849> for<00:04:09.120> rotation<00:04:09.540> but<00:04:09.689> I

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
in my top 2 or top 3 for rotation but I

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.030 
in my top 2 or top 3 for rotation but I
think<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:10.019> would<00:04:10.110> be<00:04:10.200> in<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.379> top<00:04:10.590> 5<00:04:10.830> for

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
think it would be in the top 5 for

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.830 
think it would be in the top 5 for
rotations<00:04:11.519> if<00:04:11.790> you're<00:04:12.090> looking<00:04:12.330> up<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:12.540> have<00:04:12.659> 5

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
rotations if you're looking up to have 5

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.350 
rotations if you're looking up to have 5
and<00:04:13.019> your<00:04:13.110> rotation<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:14.489> everything<00:04:15.180> but

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
and your rotation and everything but

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.420 
and your rotation and everything but
I've<00:04:15.870> always<00:04:16.290> liked<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.590> hyper<00:04:16.739> fuses<00:04:17.280> I

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
I've always liked the hyper fuses I

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.729 
I've always liked the hyper fuses I
definitely<00:04:18.180> like<00:04:18.389> the<00:04:18.540> hyper<00:04:18.720> fuse<00:04:19.109> better

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
stiffer webbing that I might like the

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.590 
stiffer webbing that I might like the
LeBrons<00:04:25.100> and<00:04:25.430> kind<00:04:25.640> of<00:04:25.670> the<00:04:25.760> hyper<00:04:25.970> dunks<00:04:26.360> kind
