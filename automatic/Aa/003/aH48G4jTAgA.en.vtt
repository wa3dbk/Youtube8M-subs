00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.110
 all dear and welcome to 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.840
 cinema jack my name is niklas im me 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.940
 was for you in the kingdom tor whether the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.220
 film now the hammer or rather one 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:23.680
 the classic second part is the experience 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:26.140
 her now after such a long time 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.500
 you get me now visiting brother I 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.370
 need your help 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.150
 but i wish i could you 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.710
 familiar 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.220
 you would be your for ich dich 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.220
 always stopped 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.520
 there was darkness before the universe 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.040
 and she survived 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.110
 yes in thor 2 it's about putin 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.350
 First of all, Tor has banned the earth 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.460
 to travel and see jane 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.620
 that actually makes it first time 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.420
 he is nothing but a tor in the whole 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.190
 Universe on the way on different 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.860
 battlefields for uprisings 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.560
 knock down and similar than then 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.320
 But Heimdall Jane is not on earth 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.360
 can see more travels tor against the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.440
 Pad of his father on the earth around 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.720
 to seek jane 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.750
 he finds her and thus notes that 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.610
 something is wrong with her and yes he does 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.630
 assumes that a strange power from her 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.149
 possession has seized 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.660
 that's why he brings her back with her 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:30.000
 asgard where the angry rudin is one 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.280
 Power actually recognizes that 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.330
 millennia would have been triggered 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.700
 should be 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.740
 how the whole thing goes out and about which 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.190
 it makes sense that you learn in the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.140
 Movie 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.570
 the focus should be on the second goal 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.310
 that's what the new world is all about 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.700
 Take a closer look 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.170
 to take 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.360
 that was actually in the apron of 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.549
 films already announced unfortunately 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.110
 the whole thing is a bit too short you see 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.900
 though the different worlds the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.380
 other universes from asgard and the 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.659
 earth 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.640
 but the film has such a 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.409
 speed that you like as well 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.729
 already mentioned again of battle 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.619
 to be drawn to battle 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.479
 Here comes the new world with theirs 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.040
 details and with theirs 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.440
 characteristic unfortunately a bit too short 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.620
 also is tried by the authors 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.820
 somehow like that again 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.650
 father-son relationship or such a father 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.700
 son problem as in the first part 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.950
 build 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.350
 in my opinion here completely wrong 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.459
 place because the second goal should be 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.690
 actually with a completely different one 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.060
 topic 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.640
 But of course, the plus point 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.709
 actor as in the first part too 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.070
 already a towering chris hemsworth 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.079
 the tour with his usual gags and 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.549
 his cunning once again great 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.890
 brought on the canvas 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:47.130
 Also natalie portman shines in her 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.340
 role as jane and yes over anthony 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.200
 You actually need hopkins 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.430
 the rain is a very routine and 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.780
 in my opinion also a very 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.580
 tower over the actor 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.560
 not to forget is also tom 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.330
 hiddleston who in his role as loki 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.209
 Also definitely a big Saturday 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.590
 has earned since yes just piling up 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.780
 the rumors or the 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.700
 Fan Community is running storm and wants one 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.040
 own movie about loki tom hiddleston 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.739
 what do you think about it ? 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.150
 us down into the comments 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.349
 It is also very nice that you can mix it 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.239
 the first part with in the second 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.480
 has taken because it is again a movie 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.970
 with a lot of action of course tension 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.049
 but also the usual humor everyone 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.450
 in the first part was so good because the gags 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.540
 from thor or from logi the little ones 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.099
 taunts do not stay out and that 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.329
 Wanted in between between the 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.220
 whole battles and between the 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.019
 all haudrauf times really beautiful again 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.310
 out and you can hearty again 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.090
 they have a nice laugh again 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.549
 made 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.319
 it all gets loud a bit 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.870
 thwarted by just that 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.910
 mentioned fact that the new worlds 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.280
 the other seven worlds that is, from 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.750
 asgard and earth are much too short 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.340
 everyone has believed me too 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.720
 a little bit more excited about it 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.579
 to experience the other worlds 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.600
 but by the speed of the film 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:03.489
 it all comes too short 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.870
 directors authors definitely more 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.060
 can elaborate on it and 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.519
 Maybe we'll say that one 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.920
 or other minute more footage in 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.329
 Can buy all this 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.130
 taken together , the film gets from 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.620
 I score 7 out of 10 he is a worthy one 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.209
 followers for the first part and 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.620
 therefore also a cinema movie film 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.330
 Of course we have one again 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.310
