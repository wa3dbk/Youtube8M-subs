have modified them before to where they

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.570 
have modified them before to where they
pull<00:01:37.570> out<00:01:37.600> his<00:01:37.930> quills<00:01:38.229> and<00:01:38.440> made<00:01:38.619> and<00:01:38.920> then

sure<00:01:42.100> how<00:01:42.280> they<00:01:42.430> did<00:01:42.610> that<00:01:42.729> my<00:01:42.910> guess<00:01:43.119> is<00:01:43.330> that

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
sure how they did that my guess is that

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.510 
sure how they did that my guess is that
they're<00:01:43.600> attached<00:01:43.930> to<00:01:44.200> something<00:01:44.520> inside

they're attached to something inside

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.490 
they're attached to something inside
where<00:01:45.820> you<00:01:45.910> can<00:01:45.940> snap<00:01:46.720> them<00:01:46.840> in<00:01:46.990> on<00:01:47.110> snapping

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
where you can snap them in on snapping

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.370 
where you can snap them in on snapping
by<00:01:47.619> one<00:01:47.800> attempt<00:01:48.160> that<00:01:48.810> probably<00:01:49.810> ask<00:01:50.200> the

that<00:02:56.550> breaking<00:02:57.000> as<00:02:57.120> much<00:02:57.300> as<00:02:57.600> his<00:02:57.840> legs<00:02:58.140> were

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440

yellow even the super shadow was a

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.470 
yellow even the super shadow was a
little<00:03:05.970> more<00:03:06.120> accurate<00:03:06.570> than<00:03:06.720> sonic<00:03:07.460> but

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
little more accurate than sonic but

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.780 
little more accurate than sonic but
that's<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.570> way<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:10.550> schools<00:03:11.550> are<00:03:11.610> the

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
barcode number on them but anyway could

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.300 
barcode number on them but anyway could
twist<00:03:19.490> issues<00:03:20.490> like<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:21.410> you<00:03:22.410> can<00:03:22.590> do<00:03:23.160> that

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
twist issues like that you can do that

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.790
