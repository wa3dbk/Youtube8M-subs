it's<00:00:11.830> a<00:00:11.950> compressed<00:00:12.490> air<00:00:12.730> turbine<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:14.620> I

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
it's a compressed air turbine that I

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.260 
it's a compressed air turbine that I
made<00:00:15.040> while<00:00:15.459> I<00:00:15.490> was<00:00:15.730> an<00:00:15.850> artist<00:00:16.119> in<00:00:16.209> residence

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270

at<00:00:16.840> Instructables<00:00:17.560> this<00:00:18.430> little<00:00:18.730> guy<00:00:18.880> is<00:00:19.240> made

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 
at Instructables this little guy is made

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.320 
at Instructables this little guy is made
of<00:00:19.900> acrylic<00:00:20.619> sheet<00:00:21.160> that<00:00:21.369> I<00:00:21.430> cut<00:00:21.820> on<00:00:21.940> one<00:00:22.300> of

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
of acrylic sheet that I cut on one of

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.790 
of acrylic sheet that I cut on one of
the<00:00:22.420> awesome<00:00:22.810> laser<00:00:22.990> cutters<00:00:23.440> they<00:00:23.650> have

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
the awesome laser cutters they have

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.909 
the awesome laser cutters they have
available<00:00:24.009> bolted<00:00:25.000> together<00:00:25.089> with<00:00:25.750> some<00:00:26.050> 1/16

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
available bolted together with some 1/16

available bolted together with some 1/16
inch<00:00:27.189> threaded<00:00:27.730> rod<00:00:28.060> I'm<00:00:28.749> really<00:00:29.080> happy<00:00:29.349> with

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
inch threaded rod I'm really happy with

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.380 
inch threaded rod I'm really happy with
how<00:00:29.560> this<00:00:29.740> little<00:00:29.859> guy<00:00:30.070> turned<00:00:30.369> out<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:30.939> angle

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
how this little guy turned out the angle

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.330 
how this little guy turned out the angle
that<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:31.660> air<00:00:31.839> comes<00:00:32.259> in<00:00:32.590> her<00:00:32.950> meshes

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
that the air comes in her meshes

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.430 
that the air comes in her meshes
perfectly<00:00:34.000> with<00:00:34.180> the<00:00:34.329> design<00:00:34.690> of<00:00:34.870> the<00:00:34.990> turbine

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
perfectly with the design of the turbine

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.860 
perfectly with the design of the turbine
I<00:00:35.470> made<00:00:35.829> and<00:00:36.370> I<00:00:36.430> was<00:00:36.520> able<00:00:36.730> to<00:00:36.940> run<00:00:37.210> this<00:00:37.360> guy<00:00:37.600> on

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
I made and I was able to run this guy on

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.390 
I made and I was able to run this guy on
up<00:00:38.079> to<00:00:38.200> 80<00:00:38.440> psi<00:00:38.860> which<00:00:39.400> isn't<00:00:39.730> bad<00:00:40.000> for<00:00:40.570> a<00:00:41.400> one

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
up to 80 psi which isn't bad for a one

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.570 
up to 80 psi which isn't bad for a one
and<00:00:42.550> a<00:00:42.610> half<00:00:42.850> inch<00:00:43.150> wide<00:00:43.950> turbine<00:00:44.950> made<00:00:45.460> of

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
and a half inch wide turbine made of

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.210 
and a half inch wide turbine made of
plastic<00:00:46.180> with<00:00:46.480> no<00:00:46.690> bearings<00:00:47.170> and<00:00:47.470> it<00:00:47.800> sounds

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
plastic with no bearings and it sounds

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.370 
plastic with no bearings and it sounds
awesome<00:00:48.460> when<00:00:48.820> it<00:00:48.910> really<00:00:49.150> gets<00:00:49.360> going<00:00:49.600> to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
awesome when it really gets going to

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.960 
awesome when it really gets going to
make<00:00:50.560> the<00:00:50.710> adapter<00:00:51.070> what<00:00:51.220> I<00:00:51.250> did<00:00:51.490> was<00:00:51.670> I<00:00:51.790> use<00:00:51.940> a

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
make the adapter what I did was I use a

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.470 
make the adapter what I did was I use a
small<00:00:52.360> piece<00:00:52.630> of<00:00:53.040> brass<00:00:54.040> tube<00:00:54.370> sock<00:00:54.700> then

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
is attached to a tire valve that way I

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.940 
is attached to a tire valve that way I
can<00:01:06.880> just<00:01:07.119> use<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.960> normal<00:01:08.170> tire<00:01:08.470> inflator

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
can just use the normal tire inflator

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.849 
can just use the normal tire inflator
from<00:01:09.520> my<00:01:10.119> air<00:01:10.299> compressor<00:01:10.540> to<00:01:11.110> actually<00:01:11.680> run
