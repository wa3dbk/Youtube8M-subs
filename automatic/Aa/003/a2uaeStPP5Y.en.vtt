ourselves out there and I think that was

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.990 
ourselves out there and I think that was
the<00:03:07.140> goal<00:03:07.350> but<00:03:07.890> even<00:03:08.250> through<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.610> Edit<00:03:08.880> and

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
the goal but even through the Edit and

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.490 
the goal but even through the Edit and
through<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.240> filtering<00:03:09.630> process<00:03:09.810> we<00:03:10.320> had<00:03:10.440> to

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
through the filtering process we had to

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.660 
through the filtering process we had to
be<00:03:10.590> conscious<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.070> like<00:03:11.310> what<00:03:11.460> we<00:03:11.580> were
