00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.460

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.460
 how 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.930
 that's why I have a new video for them 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:25.400
 in which I will show you the review of the 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.020
 minecraft request 0.8 the alpha wheel 6 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.599
 as always the link will be in the 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.250
 description to download a pepa and 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.570
 good that they added so they can be fixed 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.660
 here he puts alpha will 6 and good things that 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.270
 they added then 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.300
 sometimes but let's create a world 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.300
 new 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.860
 in the creative they added then 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.070
 in creative that they know added 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.400
 only as with what is said in 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.860
 English I do not know what is the spider that 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.500
 I do not know if the spiders will leave it but 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.510
 Well, they added it and things that are not 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.880
 they have arranged that I wanted them to 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.760
 among them is the tnt book that 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.290
 when you put a tenerte on the ground and 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.790
 mentions with the lighter it leaves 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.070
 fired as good also exploits a 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.990
 clip but next to you 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.360
 and of course I will show 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.640
 and nothing else that knows and I think that some 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.640
 devices have a book of what 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:32.049
 that when writing, when deleting, you do not know 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.049
 can we go look for the cob here 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.980
 here is taking here is 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.790
 good this and the tnt book 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.670
 that way they fix themselves because we put what would be 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.670
 the tea 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.400
 to see you get here 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:10.450
 and we ride over here about and 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:14.160
 prendemos him good all before me 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.740
 and they are fixed 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.210
 we are flying through the air they do not know 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.480
 Where are them 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:25.230
 morante and this happened to me that a crime 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.360
 mine exploded in my survival and then I 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.670
 they killed 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.950

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.360
