this goes pushed into the meat chilled
and<00:01:14.150> it<00:01:14.270> touch<00:01:14.510> three<00:01:14.869> different<00:01:15.320> kinds<00:01:15.590> of

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
and it touch three different kinds of

muscles<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:16.190> veins<00:01:16.240> that<00:01:17.240> you<00:01:17.570> don't

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
muscles and veins that you don't

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.300 
muscles and veins that you don't
eliminate<00:01:17.990> you<00:01:18.470> just<00:01:18.680> cut<00:01:18.860> them<00:01:18.920> up<00:01:19.070> a<00:01:19.160> little

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
eliminate you just cut them up a little

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.219 
eliminate you just cut them up a little
pieces<00:01:19.610> so<00:01:19.910> they're<00:01:20.030> easier<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.450> eat<00:01:20.690> leafy<00:01:20.869> to

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
pieces so they're easier to eat leafy to

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.859 
pieces so they're easier to eat leafy to
me<00:01:21.350> this<00:01:21.740> is<00:01:21.950> used<00:01:22.190> on<00:01:22.430> less<00:01:23.060> expensive<00:01:23.690> pieces

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
me this is used on less expensive pieces

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.850 
me this is used on less expensive pieces
of<00:01:24.050> meat<00:01:24.460> typically<00:01:25.460> not<00:01:25.850> using<00:01:26.560> strip<00:01:27.560> loins

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
series of holes will cause it the bleed

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.170 
series of holes will cause it the bleed
more<00:01:38.240> during<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:38.660> cooking

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
more during the cooking

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.380 
more during the cooking
okay<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.410> this<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.740> not<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> commonly<00:01:41.790> used<00:01:42.090> tool
