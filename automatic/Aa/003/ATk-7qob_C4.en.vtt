00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.990 
then you put in another disk just hold
it<00:04:54.930> in<00:04:55.020> like<00:04:55.200> right<00:04:55.440> on<00:04:55.470> the<00:04:55.620> outside<00:04:56.000> then

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
it in like right on the outside then

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.650 
it in like right on the outside then
take<00:04:57.300> that<00:04:57.810> out<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.290> then<00:04:58.680> I'll<00:04:58.830> show<00:04:59.070> and

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
take that out and then I'll show and

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.790 
take that out and then I'll show and
it's<00:05:00.660> hard<00:05:00.810> to<00:05:00.900> explain<00:05:01.110> right<00:05:01.200> now<00:05:01.470> because<00:05:01.650> I

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
it's hard to explain right now because I

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.440 
it's hard to explain right now because I
actually<00:05:02.100> do<00:05:02.520> ready<00:05:02.700> because<00:05:02.850> it's<00:05:03.180> showing

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
actually do ready because it's showing

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.860 
actually do ready because it's showing
it's<00:05:04.200> updating

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
it's updating

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.590 
it's updating
I<00:05:05.900> mean<00:05:06.139> it's<00:05:06.290> real<00:05:06.470> building<00:05:06.800> a<00:05:06.889> database<00:05:07.160> ole

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
I mean it's real building a database ole

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.970 
I mean it's real building a database ole
I'll<00:05:08.600> make<00:05:08.810> another<00:05:09.020> video<00:05:09.260> of<00:05:09.560> this<00:05:09.800> one

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
I'll make another video of this one

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.090 
I'll make another video of this one

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
cleaning the disk and like blowing into

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.520 
cleaning the disk and like blowing into
the<00:05:15.830> ps3<00:05:16.100> hole<00:05:16.690> this<00:05:17.690> is<00:05:17.900> getting<00:05:18.199> the<00:05:18.290> dust

out<00:05:18.770> and<00:05:19.100> stuff<00:05:19.699> you<00:05:19.910> could<00:05:20.060> try<00:05:20.270> wiping<00:05:21.050> the

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
out and stuff you could try wiping the

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:37.090 
out and stuff you could try wiping the
fingerprints<00:05:21.650> off<00:05:21.970> yes

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.600

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
okay so as you can see rebuilding

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.980 
okay so as you can see rebuilding
database<00:05:42.060> did<00:05:42.300> not<00:05:42.420> turn<00:05:42.570> off<00:05:42.690> the<00:05:42.810> system

Daniel hear a click sound and boom is

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.520 
Daniel hear a click sound and boom is
restarting<00:05:49.620> and<00:05:50.070> you<00:05:50.670> have<00:05:50.790> a<00:05:50.820> fresh<00:05:51.500> database

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:02.100 

basically<00:05:55.530> a<00:05:55.680> temp<00:05:55.980> folder<00:05:58.700> okay

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:10.589 

okay<00:06:05.849> and<00:06:07.169> let's<00:06:08.169> test<00:06:08.409> if<00:06:08.620> it<00:06:08.800> works<00:06:09.449> so<00:06:10.449> yeah

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 
okay and let's test if it works so yeah

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:21.020 
okay and let's test if it works so yeah
I<00:06:10.629> think<00:06:10.689> okay<00:06:11.680> just<00:06:11.860> log<00:06:12.039> in<00:06:12.250> there<00:06:19.139> okay<00:06:20.139> now

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
I think okay just log in there okay now

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.730 
I think okay just log in there okay now
see<00:06:22.030> if<00:06:22.180> it<00:06:22.330> worked<00:06:22.509> there<00:06:23.289> you<00:06:23.439> go<00:06:23.530> you<00:06:23.590> see

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
see if it worked there you go you see

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.740 
see if it worked there you go you see
your<00:06:24.009> desk<00:06:24.250> call<00:06:24.520> duty<00:06:24.729> modern<00:06:25.000> warfare<00:06:25.090> 3<00:06:25.360> and

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
your desk call duty modern warfare 3 and

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.619 
your desk call duty modern warfare 3 and
if<00:06:26.560> it<00:06:26.740> didn't<00:06:26.979> work<00:06:27.129> then<00:06:27.460> watch<00:06:28.449> my<00:06:28.599> other

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:28.629 
if it didn't work then watch my other

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:31.469 
if it didn't work then watch my other
video<00:06:29.199> on<00:06:29.259> how<00:06:29.530> to<00:06:29.560> fix<00:06:29.860> it<00:06:30.120> it's<00:06:31.120> going<00:06:31.270> to<00:06:31.330> say

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
video on how to fix it it's going to say

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:33.480 
video on how to fix it it's going to say
part<00:06:31.780> 2<00:06:31.990> but<00:06:32.319> it's<00:06:32.830> probably<00:06:33.159> not<00:06:33.219> going<00:06:33.340> to<00:06:33.400> be

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
part 2 but it's probably not going to be

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.050 
part 2 but it's probably not going to be
out<00:06:33.610> yet

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
out yet

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.719 
out yet
I'll<00:06:34.300> go<00:06:34.509> soon
