00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.250
 hi to all and axel tests mobile.fr 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.379
 honeywell doubled it's 2014 on the stand 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.540
 darcos and gillard cause 40b titanium 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:15.059
 in the hand so it's a device that 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.290
 has not exactly been unveiled for the n 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.720
 or did you know you a little 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.550
 shortly before but still interesting 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.359
 so I'm talking to you is a little bit of 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.519
 spectra quickly we had 4 inches 440 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:30.180
 480 bardon par 800 it's 2 103 233 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.580
 country we are in ip slcd a camera 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.930
 5 megapixel rear 0 3 megapixel to 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.340
 before we are on the media library 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.950
 dual-core 1.3 gigahertz 512 mo of ram 4 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.760
 gigas naiman internal and micro sd 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.980
 possibility of extending its memory 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.980
 via microsd we also have a battery 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.120
 of 1400 billion lost the case in 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.660
 crutches tania mme it's a device 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.640
 which should be available between 99 and 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.260
 109 euros it depends on the distributors and 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.000
 it depends on the veil at deals that 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.850
 would have been done but it will be the turn of 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.199
 200 euros 1 roughly so it's a 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.850
 small device that is nice to 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.619
 take in hand with the button the button 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.180
 we really rust gorillas etc 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.070
 and on the right what is still 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.400
 an optimal placement for for a 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.850
 screen size of this type there we have the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.960
 volume key jack jack forgiveness at the microphone 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.479
 usb 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.750
 nothing on the bottom at the back the device 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.310
 photo the led flash just below 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.750
 then loud speakers side you go to me 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.390
 to say but he is not he is not at 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.070
 the aria actually we have speakers 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.110
 in frontal what is still 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.000
 interesting is still better 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.950
 overall to listen to music 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 usually when especially when you 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.430
 put it on a table 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.540
 so after in the first interface 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.090
 thing to know is that it's dual 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.869
 sim it's something very very low 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.250
 it's something we find on 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.180
 almost all archos devices 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.399
 creissan except exception we have everything 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.350
 which is shortened fast to some 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.310
 parameters we have the main menu 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.869
 toc with one jada so after that it's 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.630
 android basic if you like 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.909
 android in its current state but I 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.680
 will be quite satisfied I want 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.640
 to say by a device like this after 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.540
 which is good with android as 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.710
 usually you can 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.110
 customize you 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.850
 m you still have some little ones 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.350
 additions like for example here I have 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.150
 archos music that is an application 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.650
 that can read steal your files 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.360
 musical with a slightly 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.260
 reworked that looks moreover rather 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.120
 stylish 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.170
 we also have video archos that's it 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.620
 rather nice too in the same 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.880
 spirit one here that I discover we'll see 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.830
 during a test to enter all 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.569
 details of course but it's good that 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.600
 that archos only offers some interface 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.489
 a little different email galleries 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.770
 it's all classic 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.180
 everything turns out to look pretty is enough 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.320
 fluid is no problem on it widgets 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.610
 we can but we can change the background 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.930
 of course of course I think we're going 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.989
 stop there it's really a 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.820
 device quite easy to use 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.970
 classic dual sim that's interesting 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.459
 and 3g I did not quote but it is so 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.200
 of the 3g that was it for my little 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.880
 getting started with this small terminal 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.470
 dual sim archos if you have any 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.860
 questions do not hesitate me I tell you 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.860
 see you
