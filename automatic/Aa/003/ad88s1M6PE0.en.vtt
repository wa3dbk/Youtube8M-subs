00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.219
 the world's most popular crossover clone 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.860
 to serv in a new body 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.049
 with a new motor on our test this 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.890
 fourth generation car with such 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.050
 by name 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.520
 first months to us country he 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.009
 only supplied with 2 liter 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.820
 gasoline engine then appeared 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:28.409
 2.4 liter version 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:35.790
 two-liter modification we are no longer 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:38.550
 supply however these machines are different 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.100
 not only do they have different front engines 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.590
 bumper and more powerful version better 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.989
 suitable for our conditions with weight less 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.000
 the angle of entry is greater that is much 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.149
 reduced chance of scratching 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.190
 bumper when traveling on our roads 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.800
 if we compare the new service model 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.339
 the third generation then kasavir became wider 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.550
 but at the same time lower and a little shorter and 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.140
 out of 30 millimeters diminishing height 15 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.330
 had to be on the ground clearance 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.370
 however the geometric indicators 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.590
 patency badly hurt and 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.590
 landing in the car while it became 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.600
 more convenient and more new server added 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.490
 solidity 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.740
 outside the car did not become big but 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.140
 the more our surprise was from 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.240
 familiarity with the interior how much more 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.369
 got a spacious cabin this 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.890
 crossover front seats got 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.990
 adjustment in 10 millimeters more 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.689
 range and in all directions 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.790
 the rear sofa cushion dropped almost 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.280
 at 40 millimeters and this immediately 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.770
 felt when you sit in the car 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.200
 or go out of it now do it 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.240
 much more comfortable from comfort for 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.670
 rear passengers only provided 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.250
 large armrest and separately and air 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.799
 water climate control well of course 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.689
 lack of a tunnel on the floor across the expanse 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.909
 you feel almost like you are here 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.430
 business sedan cabin only 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.640
 occasional visibility after landing more 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.680
 fourth generation high servo 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.520
 got a quick folding system 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.920
 rear seats 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.350
 just pull the trunk handle and 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.280
 not just a back and a pillow 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.610
 rear seat 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.260
 the trunk itself has become a bit bigger 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.040
 the maximum volume is now almost 1700 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.900
 liters 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.939
 but much more important in everyday 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:26.430
 the operation of what is loading height 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:28.799
 also reduced honda serv in our market 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.459
 It is available with only one engine is 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.079
 2.4 liter gasoline engine in it 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.599
 190 horsepower 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.950
 transmission, too, without options only 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.260
 five-speed automatic 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.390
 This tandem allows not small 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.500
 crossover start from place to first 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.500
 hundreds on the speedometer 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.980
 in 10.7 seconds to dial the maximum 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.090
 speed of 184 kilometers per hour and at the same time 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.909
 consume 8.4 liters of mixed gasoline 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.000
 cycle route city by the way in this tank 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:02.430
 contour can safely fill 92 gasoline 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.739
 additional savings it is clear that 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.450
 the most economical engine 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.209
 will behave when you press green 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.280
 buttons icons transfer will switch 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.230
 more smoothly and the box at the first 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.090
 opportunities to move to a higher 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.730
 transmission about what car 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.680
 really rides economically he will report 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.500
 driver green lights instrument 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.030
 panels 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.190
 sits in the salon new service has become 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.319
 more comfortable and the interior itself has added 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.479
 the level of finishing materials seat 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.489
 well profiled grievances and pleasant 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:34.799
 to the touch of the skin and securely hold 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.810
 cornering drivers with 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.400
 the adjustment range is so big 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.859
 that here you will be comfortable 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.549
 feel the lady of any height and any 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.739
 complexion 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.169
 2-zone climate control standard 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.889
 equipment as well as sounding good 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.599
 radio cassette player 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.389
 still a whole set of useful devices 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.489
 for example heated front seats cruise 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.739
 control and rear view camera 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.900
 the picture from it is transmitted to the top 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.030
 monitor but the bottom big screen 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.549
 relies only version with navigation 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.620
 systems in simpler modifications there 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.139
 radio control are located 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.760
 the overall impression of the cabin is comfortable 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.199
 comfortable and stylish 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.419
 and unlike most 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:15.150
 competitors in the cabin of this crossover 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.720
 its creators surprised a lot of attention 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.430
 little things 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.409
 of which by and large and 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.550
 one gets the impression of any 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:24.110
 the car 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.910
 the main thing that marks the movement is 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.160
 increased acoustic comfort 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.530
 everyone who drove a japanese car 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.170
 know that this is traditionally a weak point 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.810
 cars come from the land of the rising sun 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.820
 salon service is just as quiet as in 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.340
 big sedan well tuned 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.980
 almost no body vibration 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.050
 are transmitted even when significant 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.670
 road irregularities besides skill 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.830
 hold on to the side of the server 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.870
 truly funds ska twists and turns 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.450
 passes like on rails and honor to 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.760
 given trajectory and mountain road 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.750
 which we drove in half was 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.090
 covered with snow 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.170
 but never did this honda even hint 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.170
 she is able to skid 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.890
 such exemplary car behavior in 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.780
 difficult conditions 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.480
 the main role was played by the new system 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.730
 wheel drive real-time as opposed to 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.100
 car from the third generation in the new 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:19.130
 beauty to warm this system became electrons 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.200
 This allowed a 17 percent reduction in its 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.290
 weight and more than half less 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.900
 trainer but the most important thing is the new system 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.030
 much faster connects four-wheel drive 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.370
 and this is important because forced 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.530
 there is no lock by the way wheels 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.730
 the rear axle is sure to connect and 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.730
 when starting to climb 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.740
 locking center differential 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.930
 there is no however he is up to the server 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.380
 keeps moving even its decided 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.660
 wheel 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:56.340
 modern electronics with ease 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.340
 replaces mechanical interlocks 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.360
 appeared in the new server and the real 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.850
 jeeper sky down 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.130
 when it is turned on the car will not 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.810
 accelerate above a given speed 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.460
 allows the driver to completely 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.180
 concentrate on the process 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.730
 of management 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.560
 the presence of such a system is especially important for 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.960
 automatic cars 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.600
 because such a transmission does not allow 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.550
 slow down the engine and so stock serv 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.290
 fourth generation continued 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.970
 improve the best qualities 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.400
 inherent in honda cars 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.919
 This is a high-spirited crossover with perfect on 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.330
 manageability at the same time the car became 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:44.210
 quieter and more comfortable 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.310
 and the new all-wheel drive system will add 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.790
 confidence to any driver on our 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.880
 the roads 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.200
 honda service has become the most popular 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.680
 crossover world and now we understand 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.680
 why
