00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.490
 a classic cupcake on halloween is this 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.320
 of brains' for its simplicity and speed 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.269
 when it comes to doing it I recommend it 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.269
 to surprise at these parties 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.100
 Y 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.430
 and the elaboration is very simple because 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.820
 consists of an abbot the krim who is 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.250
 basically butter and sugar glas the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.230
 essence I leave it to your choice I have 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.589
 used essence of clouds but you can 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.890
 use vanilla lemon orange 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:38.930
 what you have 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.000
 to give it the perfect color we are going to 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.090
 leave a little pink but very very very 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.650
 little if we will not get the brains 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.900
 pink barbich and it's not what we want 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.300
 we put our cream in a sleeve 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.640
 pastry with a round mouthpiece like 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.590
 see must not be too large for 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.570
 we have a brain with volume we are going to 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.460
 make three layers the first one that does not 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.680
 You will see we do it in zig zag 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.230
 we must respect the two hemispheres of 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.290
 brain to make it more realistic 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.290
 i 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.100
 in the next serpent layer we will do 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.100
 randomly 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.409
 finally we make a third layer 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.560
 much closer 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.560
 and 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.700
 do not think I 'm blood is coloring 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.560
 red with a little water we will place it 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.640
 above the cupcake to give it a 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.640
 bloodier touch 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.180
 I hope you liked both 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.070
