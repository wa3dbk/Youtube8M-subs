00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.790
 well it him everyone is 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.680
 simple we meet to talk d eca 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.930
 flip those little cats who like to take 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.890
 a lot of risk going to ecaflip 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.810
 is playing face to face 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.580
 and that's really the type of game that 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.010
 fits them well especially on the a1 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.200
 for August 29 when the boom was great and 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.020
 random had to really have some 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.270
 luck a bluff it was 1 to 50 rekom 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.210
 it's typing when that smell could 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.220
 give up to 4 p at 4 pm it can also 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.780
 you get a lot of sherbet 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.050
 effects but only that one criticizes 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.690
 the worst was roulette I think that 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.980
 could do everything to recompose the towers 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.540
 oxen 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.160
 oh no it can not be praise finally it's 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.270
 normal at this time the year do not use 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.070
 not yet this kind of technique in 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.930
 finally fight the roulette is still 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.820
 stayed a little bit on the 2.0 at the beginning 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.380
 before being made mayor since we had 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.270
 saw some huge stuff at the 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:20.710
 goultarminator 2 I leave you 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:23.469
 then appreciate in our world to us 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.299
 we call it talent is also rip the 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:28.479
 blowjob of dofus 1 and his animation 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.469
 hyper class it was really huge to 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.490
 the time 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.069
 look, I did a little comparison 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.549
 with dofus 1 and since that 2 it's not the 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.549
 even when 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.549
 yahoo yahoo yahoo but you I am very 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.619
 the hague evening ago where there is and yahoo 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.670
 look at this theme 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.200
 now almost all their fate 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.210
 have been changed and class and a lot 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.189
 less random but it always roxx 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.790
 as much with the many abilities of 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.500
 care also 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.970
 by the way I think the states that 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.409
 are supposed to be a rock class either 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.270
 a limit more than the ignorant ipsa 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.490
 now what is the care class of 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.590
 game as another incoherence of the damage 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.979
 flipo is starting to be more and more 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.479
 numerous 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.120
 maybe one because they do not know 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:16.160
 that cats hate water m'enfin 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.569
 is that at the state nothing in pm is a 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.090
 a little less good than before and caftans 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.319
 lepic smell and annoys a lot of 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.390
 people were trying to record so many 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.040
 some mob without injury philippe case 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.830
 well cheap as before it's a lot 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.319
 harder but a little vp it's always 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.150
 a very powerful super class very 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.750
 complete with great abilities 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.250
 drug 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.750
 they have the opportunity to make a 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.519
 situation reversal no matter 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.989
 when with teams and it's for 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.819
 this reason that eclipses are done 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.230
 often treated as lucky old people or 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.890
 so we say that teams are your 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.340
 too much cat 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.470
 lol them and coffee for so a superb 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.390
 opportunity to move there they 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.130
 just use host will have to 3 leap 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.440
 feline is to have a little luck of 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.600
 grab the roulette pm but there the cat gets 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.340
 turns into real any blur it 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.340
 can do the whole map in two seconds 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.480
 it's really abused it is off again 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.950
 true that the next lap because of 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.140
 haye smell can no longer really moved 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.400

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.489

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.320
 of this video 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.209

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.739

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.480
