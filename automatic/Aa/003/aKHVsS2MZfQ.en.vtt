00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
thing we really wanted to do so we did

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.269

it<00:00:25.470> but<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:25.769> couldn't<00:00:26.010> take<00:00:26.130> ourselves

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
it but we couldn't take ourselves

seriously<00:00:26.580> enough<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.240> continue<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.840> we<00:00:28.019> just

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
seriously enough to continue so we just

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.290

then<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.599> think<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.080> was<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.349> early<00:00:31.619> 2010<00:00:32.369> when

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
then I think that was in early 2010 when

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.420 
then I think that was in early 2010 when
we<00:00:32.969> stopped<00:00:33.300> making<00:00:33.719> videos<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.890> really

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
we stopped making videos I have really

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.160 
we stopped making videos I have really

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
talent so I kind of used fashion as a

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.270 
talent so I kind of used fashion as a

might do some makeup videos and here and
there<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:32.100> i'd<00:01:32.579> rather<00:01:32.880> talk<00:01:33.240> about<00:01:33.450> clothes

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990

there but i'd rather talk about clothes
but<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.470> being<00:01:34.500> said<00:01:34.770> i<00:01:34.979> probably<00:01:35.340> won't<00:01:35.549> be

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
but that being said i probably won't be

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.370 
but that being said i probably won't be

giving ideas showing what's in the shops

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.550 
giving ideas showing what's in the shops
i<00:01:45.509> probably<00:01:45.689> won't<00:01:45.899> be<00:01:45.960> doing<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.229> lot<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.380> that

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
i probably won't be doing a lot of that

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.050 
i probably won't be doing a lot of that
because<00:01:46.770> i<00:01:46.829> don't<00:01:47.130> do<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> lot<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.460> shopping<00:01:47.700> I

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
because i don't do a lot of shopping I

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.569 
because i don't do a lot of shopping I
don't<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> lot<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.049> money<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.950> might<00:01:50.340> do<00:01:50.460> one

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
don't have a lot of money I might do one

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.710 
don't have a lot of money I might do one
from<00:01:50.759> time<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.030> time<00:01:51.060> because<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.479> like

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
from time to time because I like

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.929 
from time to time because I like
watching<00:01:51.899> them<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.680> think<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:53.009> be<00:01:53.130> fun<00:01:53.520> to

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
watching them and I think can be fun to

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.850 
watching them and I think can be fun to
show<00:01:54.360> those<00:01:54.720> sort<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.049> things<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.409> yeah<00:01:55.560> if

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
show those sort of things but yeah if

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.530 
show those sort of things but yeah if
you<00:01:56.280> don't<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:56.880> those<00:01:57.090> don't<00:01:57.360> worry<00:01:57.509> about

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
you don't like those don't worry about

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.999 
you don't like those don't worry about
that<00:01:57.810> i<00:01:57.840> prob<00:01:58.079> won't<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.380> doing<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.649> lot<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.829> them

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
that i prob won't be doing a lot of them

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.310 
that i prob won't be doing a lot of them
so<00:01:59.280> yeah<00:01:59.399> guess<00:01:59.790> that's<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.299> will<00:02:01.110> see<00:02:01.290> you
