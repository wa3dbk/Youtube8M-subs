i<00:00:22.380> really<00:00:22.769> don't<00:00:22.949> think<00:00:23.010> that'll<00:00:23.369> be

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
i really don't think that'll be

i really don't think that'll be
happening<00:00:23.820> full<00:00:24.090> metal<00:00:24.420> case<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:25.279> I<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:27.060> might

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
happening full metal case I I it might

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.810 
happening full metal case I I it might
happen<00:00:27.960> if<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.380> does<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.680> be<00:00:28.800> pretty<00:00:29.010> cool<00:00:29.250> I'm

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
happen if it does to be pretty cool I'm

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
happen if it does to be pretty cool I'm
not<00:00:29.970> sure<00:00:30.029> they're<00:00:30.330> going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.539> go<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.779> far

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
not sure they're going to go that far

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.979 
not sure they're going to go that far
touch<00:00:31.679> sensitive<00:00:32.189> case<00:00:32.399> however<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:33.570> may<00:00:33.960> be

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
touch sensitive case however that may be

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.860 
touch sensitive case however that may be
I've<00:00:34.579> no<00:00:35.579> clue<00:00:35.760> about<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.420> pretty<00:00:36.690> neutral

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
I've no clue about a pretty neutral

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.580 
I've no clue about a pretty neutral
fifty-fifty<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.680> guess<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.480> 5<00:00:39.480> megapixel<00:00:39.660> camera

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
fifty-fifty I guess a 5 megapixel camera

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.209 
fifty-fifty I guess a 5 megapixel camera
is<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.690> definite<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.809> think<00:00:43.079> LED<00:00:43.500> flash<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.829> I'm

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
is a definite I think LED flash and I'm

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.270 
is a definite I think LED flash and I'm
not<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.730> sure<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.969> though<00:00:45.920> front-facing<00:00:46.920> video

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
not so sure of though front-facing video

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.610 
not so sure of though front-facing video
camera<00:00:47.789> I'll<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.629> pretty<00:00:48.840> sure<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.440> but

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
camera I'll be pretty sure with that but

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.500 
camera I'll be pretty sure with that but
I<00:00:49.649> think<00:00:49.800> seventy<00:00:50.160> percent<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> good<00:00:50.879> chance

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
I think seventy percent is a good chance

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.119 
I think seventy percent is a good chance
contacts<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.260> home<00:00:52.440> screen<00:00:52.710> that's<00:00:52.920> more

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
contacts at home screen that's more

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.119 
contacts at home screen that's more
about<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.579> program<00:00:54.300> or<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.129> operating

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
about the program or the operating

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.580 
about the program or the operating
system<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.149> we'll<00:00:57.660> get<00:00:57.809> into<00:00:57.930> them<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> next

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
system so we'll get into them the next

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.939 
system so we'll get into them the next
part<00:00:59.270> 64<00:01:00.270> gigabyte<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.989> think<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.649> sixty

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
part 64 gigabyte I think in sixty

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.470 
part 64 gigabyte I think in sixty
presentiments<00:01:02.340> about<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> good<00:01:02.969> chance<00:01:03.359> for

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
presentiments about a good chance for

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.410 
presentiments about a good chance for
that<00:01:03.750> because<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:05.129> ipod<00:01:05.670> has<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.180> but<00:01:06.330> we're

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
that because the ipod has that but we're

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.580 
that because the ipod has that but we're
not<00:01:06.570> sure<00:01:06.600> they're<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.260> actually<00:01:07.350> do

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
not sure they're going to actually do

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.660 
not sure they're going to actually do
that<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.040> thought<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.400> might<00:01:08.520> be

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
that for that I thought it might be

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.730 
that for that I thought it might be
interesting<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.630> we'll<00:01:09.810> see<00:01:10.049> more<00:01:10.439> rare

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
interesting but we'll see more rare

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.210 
interesting but we'll see more rare

that<00:01:57.490> but<00:01:57.819> we're<00:01:57.970> getting<00:01:58.210> into<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.509> fourth

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
that but we're getting into the fourth

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.999 
that but we're getting into the fourth
four-point-oh<00:02:00.690> so<00:02:01.690> basically<00:02:02.380> there<00:02:02.740> will<00:02:02.860> be

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
four-point-oh so basically there will be

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.789 
four-point-oh so basically there will be
a<00:02:03.990> multi-touch<00:02:04.990> touch<00:02:05.560> gestures<00:02:06.190> OS<00:02:06.909> wide<00:02:07.179> and

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
a multi-touch touch gestures OS wide and

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.250 
a multi-touch touch gestures OS wide and
that<00:02:08.799> means<00:02:09.009> like<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:10.539> swipe<00:02:10.899> in<00:02:11.080> a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
that means like if you swipe in a

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.080 
that means like if you swipe in a
certain<00:02:11.440> way<00:02:11.560> anywhere<00:02:12.340> in<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.730> operating

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
certain way anywhere in the operating

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.120 
certain way anywhere in the operating
system<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.720> right<00:02:13.870> multi<00:02:14.260> task<00:02:14.500> or<00:02:14.799> something

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
system and right multi task or something

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.360 
system and right multi task or something
which<00:02:15.280> we<00:02:15.430> pretty<00:02:15.790> cool<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.410> if<00:02:17.410> Apple<00:02:18.160> built

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
which we pretty cool of if Apple built

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.830 
which we pretty cool of if Apple built
at<00:02:18.519> multitasking<00:02:18.850> because<00:02:19.450> it'd<00:02:19.569> be<00:02:19.600> more

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
at multitasking because it'd be more

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.370 
at multitasking because it'd be more
reliable<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:21.120> we<00:02:22.120> probably<00:02:22.630> a<00:02:22.780> little<00:02:22.900> nicer

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
reliable and we probably a little nicer

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.330 
reliable and we probably a little nicer
at<00:02:23.530> all<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:23.860> wouldn't<00:02:24.160> have<00:02:24.250> the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
at all so you wouldn't have the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.620 
at all so you wouldn't have the
jailbreak<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.970> get<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.239> and<00:02:26.310> also<00:02:27.310> be<00:02:27.940> possible

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
jailbreak to get it and also be possible

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.080 
jailbreak to get it and also be possible
that<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.160> tablet<00:02:30.160> would<00:02:30.250> be<00:02:30.400> using<00:02:30.579> that<00:02:30.820> to

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
that the tablet would be using that to

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.349 
that the tablet would be using that to
also<00:02:31.930> making<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.470> tablet<00:02:32.920> more<00:02:33.130> like<00:02:33.940> the

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
also making the tablet more like the

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:40.289 
also making the tablet more like the
iPhone<00:02:35.170> than<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.829> the<00:02:36.579> mac<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:39.640> next<00:02:39.850> we

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
iPhone than the the mac so the next we

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.539 
iPhone than the the mac so the next we
have<00:02:40.480> few<00:02:41.260> new<00:02:41.410> ways<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.829> art<00:02:42.010> applications

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
have few new ways to art applications

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.810 
have few new ways to art applications
and<00:02:42.730> background<00:02:43.150> royalty<00:02:43.810> tasking<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:44.829> many

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
and background royalty tasking and many

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.509

graphical<00:02:46.570> UI<00:02:46.810> changes<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.859> the<00:02:47.980> navigator

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
graphical UI changes to the navigator

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.699 
graphical UI changes to the navigator
which<00:02:49.329> we<00:02:49.510> kind<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:49.780> interesting<00:02:50.260> because<00:02:50.290> all

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
which we kind of interesting because all

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.160 
which we kind of interesting because all
the<00:02:51.040> main<00:02:51.459> UI<00:02:51.760> stuff<00:02:52.299> which<00:02:52.660> is<00:02:52.810> basically

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
the main UI stuff which is basically

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.699 
the main UI stuff which is basically
like<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:54.630> few<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.660> views<00:02:56.079> and<00:02:56.109> the<00:02:56.440> little

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
like the few the views and the little
