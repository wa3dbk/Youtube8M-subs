00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.770
 hello how about youtube friends today 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.190
 I bring this the game of the amazing 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.950
 spider-man 2 for your android phone 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.199
 good in the in the description of the video 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.260
 they will find what are the links of 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.210
 the plate and the data of cd 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.800
 in the cd data and on the board they go 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.650
 to download as I said from the 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.480
 description of the video but good the 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.689
 links now yes that the pages are a 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.830
 bit weird because good I do not know how in 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.830
 another language but he 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.820
 the game there is about forgiveness for that 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.100
 cut well yes delivered the one of my 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.989
 spider-man wants ok but good 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.220
 the extra pages a little weird already 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.930
 that they are a page of I do not know what is 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.600
 but even the links work 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.600
 they are downloaded and they only 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.960
 they're going to hit where in a little button where 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.400
 three I think the weight of the data and the 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.590
 Apec there will tell you the weight 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.800
 really the league and I want to start 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.300
 download what are the apk and also 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.410
 Well data yields when the 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.420
 that king and good then they go to the data 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.890
 Well they will put them in what is the 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:21.820
 that android directory and vb 11 I'm 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.550
 here that then in 1.14 and bytes as 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.820
 they are watching and well the game this one 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:32.670
 occupies what is android 4.0 and higher 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.670
 so that it can work also 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:41.170
 is version 1.0 point 1 jo something like that 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.650
 is the most current that I'm going to start 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.950
 I'll leave you get the video and well then 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:52.490
 also yesterday I think there is and yesterday I went up 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.890
 a video about a gameplay of more 4 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.430
 and well, I eliminated it because I did not 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.649
 was going well, well, two more 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.720
 of my subscribers subscribing me 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.060
 said 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.280
 what's wrong, so it's better to eliminate that 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.399
 video I think that I think it was that 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.500
 video but good you want more gameplays 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.640
 but only in the comments 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.030
 good if I'm going to be uploading a 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.750
 gameplay 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.830
 and I do not know once a week or two but 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.750
 good 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.180
 I have eliminated that example so good 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.980
 it's a small cut and let's go with what 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.770
 which is a small gameplay also from 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.710
 I play this one of my spider-man 2 so 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.510
 we came back in a moment and good friends 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.270
 of YouTube since we are still here with the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.430
 game and it 's a game that has very good 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.360
 graphics the mere truth has enough 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.480
 graphs 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.220
 designed by gameloft and good always 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.580
 we expect good graphics of these 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:52.220
 developers and good the game 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:56.280
 Only Android 4.0 needs it 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:00.800
 superior so that it can work and as 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.800
 I would say then to 1.14 gigabytes 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:09.970
 As you can see we have excellent graphics and 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.550
 good version 1.0 point 1 j is the most 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.130
 current that they what the description 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.100
