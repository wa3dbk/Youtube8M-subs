00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 there are video games that sell alone 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.330
 and others for which people pay months 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.580
 before they go on sale without 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.230
 However some managers came up with 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.809
 that their products needed a 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.059
 nudge and that's why this suit 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.570
 of the worst ads in 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.500
 video games ranked number 5 legend of 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.880
 zelda link's awakening rap the saga of 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.670
 zelda is a game that has harvested 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.070
 incalculable successes becoming 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.990
 a legend as its name indicates without 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.910
 But at some point someone believed 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.860
 that this adventure filled with dungeons 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.930
 enchanted forests and creatures 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.540
 mythological he needed a morocho 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.860
 with the cap turned around making a rap 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.930
 because clearly they understand zelda rap 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.050
 us either put number 4 do not 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.789
 the picachu in this advertising of a 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.010
 game where the well-known pokemon 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.930
 reacted to our voice commands 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.329
 a little boy tells us how he is 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.430
 terrific that picacho answer you since 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.680
 Nobody gives him a ball in his house 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.350
 immediately afterwards we are seeing how all his 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.549
 family systematically ignores it 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.659
 making us not know if we want 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.039
 go shopping 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.649
 long or call a social worker 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:15.929
 playstation baby the beloved and popular 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.299
 playstation3 will go down in history as 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.819
 one of the best consoles that there was without 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.979
 However, we can not say the same about their 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:25.049
 advertising this third place is 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.060
 busy where a toy baby 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.280
 begins to laugh with adult voice at 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.969
 time she cries and her eyes are 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.679
 red closes complicated the playstation 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:37.950
 apparently this first model came 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:41.250
 with a gift exorcism 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.079
 I go micro if there is an undisputed product 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.209
 in the history of video games is the 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.520
 game boy the portable console that knew 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:49.829
 change a thousand times its format but never 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.119
 its quality look if it will be good that this 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.579
 they came up with an advertisement 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.770
 where so cool that the console is 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.789
 a mouse can not stop mounting it 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.189
 frantically unfortunately not even the 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.090
 mouse or batteries came with the console 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.190
 put number one number sega saturn 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.470
 this commercial known as the theater 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.630
 of the eye shows us like a lot of 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.790
 extravagant costumed characters 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.680
 as something that would correspond to another 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.750
 body sector the videos of a 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.210
 biology class live in a cinema 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.610
 within one eye and when they exist by 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.560
 the graphics that the console are ground 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.750
 beaten by a group of fighters 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.090
 wrestling we are in next that the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.740
 games do not cause violence but you're
