if<00:00:00.240> you've<00:00:00.750> ever<00:00:00.900> used<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.350> map<00:00:01.560> on<00:00:01.740> your<00:00:01.890> cell

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
if you've ever used a map on your cell

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.860 
if you've ever used a map on your cell
phone<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.399> get<00:00:02.490> you<00:00:02.639> from<00:00:02.850> place<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.330> place<00:00:03.629> B

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
phone to get you from place a to place B

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.829 
phone to get you from place a to place B
you're<00:00:04.859> familiar<00:00:05.069> with<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.609> idea<00:00:05.640> that<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.509> map

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
you're familiar with the idea that a map

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.500 
you're familiar with the idea that a map
is<00:00:07.080> simply<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.500> representation<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.519> some<00:00:09.179> sort

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
is simply a representation of some sort

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.629 
is simply a representation of some sort
of<00:00:09.809> area<00:00:10.440> that<00:00:10.650> actually<00:00:10.800> exists<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.550> real

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
of area that actually exists in the real

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.509 
of area that actually exists in the real
world<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:13.139> map<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.889> your<00:00:13.920> cell<00:00:14.219> phone<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.490> a

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
world so a map on your cell phone is a

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.599 
world so a map on your cell phone is a
digital<00:00:14.969> map<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.450> an<00:00:15.870> actual<00:00:16.260> place<00:00:16.949> somewhere

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
digital map of an actual place somewhere

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.029 
digital map of an actual place somewhere
in<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.820> world<00:00:18.350> similar<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.619> digital

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
in the world similar to this digital

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.490 
in the world similar to this digital
road<00:00:20.279> map<00:00:20.460> your<00:00:20.789> brain<00:00:21.060> also<00:00:21.300> has<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.960> map<00:00:22.230> of

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
road map your brain also has a map of

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.950 
road map your brain also has a map of
your<00:00:22.680> body<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.820> map<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.269> something

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
your body and this map is something

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.910 
your body and this map is something
known<00:00:25.170> as<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.619> somatosensory<00:00:26.099> homunculus

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.260 

the<00:00:31.920> somatosensory<00:00:32.430> homunculus<00:00:32.730> is

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
the somatosensory homunculus is

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.959 
the somatosensory homunculus is
basically<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.780> map<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.410> your<00:00:34.500> body<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:35.070> your

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
basically a map of your body in your

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.470 
basically a map of your body in your
brain<00:00:37.370> and<00:00:38.370> let<00:00:38.550> me<00:00:38.640> go<00:00:38.760> into<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.149> because<00:00:39.360> it

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
brain and let me go into this because it

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.209 
brain and let me go into this because it
is<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> little<00:00:39.930> bit<00:00:40.050> confusing<00:00:40.469> conceptually

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
is a little bit confusing conceptually

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.340 
is a little bit confusing conceptually
at<00:00:41.340> first<00:00:44.030> so<00:00:45.030> what<00:00:45.149> I've<00:00:45.300> drawn<00:00:45.570> over<00:00:45.750> here<00:00:46.200> is

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
at first so what I've drawn over here is

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.209 
at first so what I've drawn over here is
a<00:00:46.829> picture<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:48.090> brain<00:00:48.860> let's<00:00:49.860> just<00:00:50.010> focus

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
a picture of the brain let's just focus

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.240 
a picture of the brain let's just focus
in<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:51.059> pink<00:00:51.690> area<00:00:51.840> over<00:00:52.230> here<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.980> pink

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
in on this pink area over here this pink

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.770 
in on this pink area over here this pink
area<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.579> something<00:00:53.730> known<00:00:54.059> as<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.329> cortex

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
area is something known as the cortex

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.810 
area is something known as the cortex
and<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.410> region<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:55.980> shaded<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
and this region that I shaded in and

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.110 
and this region that I shaded in and
orange<00:00:57.660> over<00:00:57.899> here<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:59.100> specialized<00:00:59.850> part

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
orange over here is a specialized part

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.880 
orange over here is a specialized part
of<00:01:00.149> your<00:01:00.270> brain<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.930> receives<00:01:01.379> sensory

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
of your brain that receives sensory

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.609 
of your brain that receives sensory
input<00:01:02.579> from<00:01:02.609> your<00:01:03.000> entire<00:01:03.300> body<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.439> whenever

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
input from your entire body so whenever

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.560 
input from your entire body so whenever
you<00:01:04.890> feel<00:01:05.100> pain<00:01:05.460> or<00:01:05.760> whenever<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.150> feel<00:01:06.330> some

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
you feel pain or whenever you feel some

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.179 
you feel pain or whenever you feel some
sort<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.840> heat<00:01:07.080> anywhere<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.530> your<00:01:07.619> body<00:01:07.680> all

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
sort of heat anywhere in your body all

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.950 
sort of heat anywhere in your body all
this<00:01:08.820> information<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.479> actually<00:01:09.630> sent

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
this information is actually sent

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.170 
this information is actually sent
through<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.439> spinal<00:01:10.830> cord<00:01:11.070> into<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> brain

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
through the spinal cord into the brain

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.600 
through the spinal cord into the brain
and<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.840> all<00:01:13.020> ends<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.409> over<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.280> one

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
and it all ends up over here in this one

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.280 
and it all ends up over here in this one
part<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.180> cortex<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.930> part<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
part of the cortex and this part of the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.370 
part of the cortex and this part of the
cortex<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:17.040> known<00:01:17.520> as<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.060> sensory<00:01:19.790> strip<00:01:21.380> so

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
cortex is known as the sensory strip so

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.600 
cortex is known as the sensory strip so
let<00:01:22.500> me<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.710> clean<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.009> up<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.280> little<00:01:23.460> bit

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
let me just clean this up a little bit

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.859 
let me just clean this up a little bit
so<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.240> were<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.420> actually<00:01:24.479> take<00:01:24.840> a

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
so if we were to actually take a

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.810 
so if we were to actually take a
cross-sectional<00:01:25.740> look<00:01:26.009> at<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.430> sensory

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
cross-sectional look at the sensory

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.399 
cross-sectional look at the sensory
strip<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.270> if<00:01:27.360> we<00:01:27.450> cut<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.720> brain<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.140> right

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
strip so if we cut the brain just right

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.440 
strip so if we cut the brain just right
down<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.680> middle<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.130> kind<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:29.970> looked<00:01:30.240> at<00:01:30.390> it

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
down the middle and kind of looked at it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.249 
down the middle and kind of looked at it
this<00:01:31.020> way<00:01:31.520> what<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.640> would<00:01:32.820> see<00:01:33.119> would<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.930> this

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
this way what we would see would be this

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.740 
this way what we would see would be this
large<00:01:35.130> orange<00:01:35.640> structure<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.240> drew<00:01:36.509> here

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
large orange structure that I drew here

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.270 
large orange structure that I drew here
so<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.049> orange<00:01:37.500> structure<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.920> basically

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
so this orange structure is basically

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.429 
so this orange structure is basically
just<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.850> sensory<00:01:39.240> strip<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.840> we're<00:01:40.170> looking

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
just the sensory strip and we're looking

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.170 
just the sensory strip and we're looking
at<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.860> way<00:01:41.070> if<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.400> cut<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.700> right<00:01:42.119> down

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
at it this way if we cut it right down

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.330 
at it this way if we cut it right down
the<00:01:42.540> middle<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.530> as<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.979> mentioned<00:01:44.310> before

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the middle and so as I mentioned before

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.789 
the middle and so as I mentioned before
this<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.390> century<00:01:45.780> strip<00:01:46.110> contains<00:01:46.290> a

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
this this century strip contains a

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.850 
this this century strip contains a
somatosensory<00:01:47.670> homunculus<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
somatosensory homunculus and the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.469 
somatosensory homunculus and the
somatosensory<00:01:50.250> homunculus<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:51.090> basically<00:01:51.360> a

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
somatosensory homunculus is basically a

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.990 
somatosensory homunculus is basically a
map<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> body<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.590> brain<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.850> what<00:01:53.970> I

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
map of the body in the brain and what I

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.520 
map of the body in the brain and what I
mean<00:01:54.180> by<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.659> information<00:01:55.140> that

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
mean by this is that information that

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.310 
mean by this is that information that
comes<00:01:55.829> from<00:01:56.159> your<00:01:56.340> hand<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.240> brain<00:01:57.540> will

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
comes from your hand to the brain will

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.380 
comes from your hand to the brain will
all<00:01:58.590> end<00:01:58.799> up<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.100> one<00:01:59.369> part<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.969> sensory

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
all end up in one part of the sensory

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.330 
all end up in one part of the sensory
strip<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.869> information<00:02:01.530> from<00:02:01.710> your<00:02:01.860> finger

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
strip so information from your finger

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.300 
strip so information from your finger
will<00:02:03.030> actually<00:02:03.479> come<00:02:03.719> over<00:02:03.750> here<00:02:04.560> information

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
will actually come over here information

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.100 
will actually come over here information
from<00:02:05.790> these<00:02:06.090> fingers<00:02:06.570> will<00:02:06.750> come<00:02:06.899> over<00:02:06.990> here

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
from these fingers will come over here

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.540 
from these fingers will come over here
information<00:02:07.500> from<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.009> palm<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.399> your<00:02:08.429> hand

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
information from the palm of your hand

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.210 
information from the palm of your hand
will<00:02:09.270> come<00:02:09.509> over<00:02:09.660> here<00:02:10.099> information<00:02:11.099> from

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
will come over here information from

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.610 
will come over here information from
your<00:02:11.370> wrist<00:02:11.700> will<00:02:12.270> actually<00:02:12.750> end<00:02:12.989> up

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
your wrist will actually end up

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.030 
your wrist will actually end up
over<00:02:13.890> here<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.610> century<00:02:14.970> strip<00:02:15.330> and

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
over here in the century strip and

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.780 
over here in the century strip and
similarly<00:02:17.040> if<00:02:17.190> we<00:02:17.340> were<00:02:17.430> getting<00:02:17.670> information

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
similarly if we were getting information

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.720 
similarly if we were getting information
from<00:02:18.420> your<00:02:18.599> foot<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.830> information<00:02:20.400> from<00:02:20.580> your

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
from your foot the information from your

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.479 
from your foot the information from your
foot<00:02:21.030> would<00:02:21.390> all<00:02:21.720> synapse<00:02:22.319> over<00:02:22.799> here<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.340> this

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
foot would all synapse over here in this

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.130 
foot would all synapse over here in this
part<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.849> cortex<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.540> information<00:02:25.049> from

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
part of the cortex and information from

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.589 
part of the cortex and information from
your<00:02:25.290> toes<00:02:25.530> would<00:02:25.769> synapse<00:02:26.159> over<00:02:26.430> here<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:27.480> you

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
your toes would synapse over here so you

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.750 
your toes would synapse over here so you
get<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.019> idea<00:02:28.049> basically<00:02:28.620> information<00:02:29.610> from

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
get the idea basically information from

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.059 
get the idea basically information from
various<00:02:30.150> parts<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.599> body<00:02:30.750> will<00:02:31.500> come<00:02:31.829> into

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
various parts of the body will come into

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.610 
various parts of the body will come into
the<00:02:32.280> brain<00:02:32.519> hit<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.690> sensory<00:02:34.079> strip<00:02:34.349> and

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
the brain hit the sensory strip and

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.160 
the brain hit the sensory strip and
it'll<00:02:35.190> always<00:02:35.430> go<00:02:35.879> to<00:02:35.940> one<00:02:36.420> part<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:37.019> that

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
it'll always go to one part of that

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.530 
it'll always go to one part of that
sensory<00:02:37.500> strip<00:02:37.769> so<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.129> is<00:02:38.340> your<00:02:38.849> face<00:02:39.209> over

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
sensory strip so this is your face over

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.449 
sensory strip so this is your face over
here<00:02:39.569> so<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.019> would<00:02:40.170> be<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.440> face<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:41.010> so

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
here so this would be the face and so

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.490 
here so this would be the face and so
information<00:02:42.030> from<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.540> lips<00:02:42.780> would<00:02:43.260> come

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
information from the lips would come

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.960 
information from the lips would come
right<00:02:43.680> here<00:02:43.920> information<00:02:44.220> from<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.790> eyes

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
right here information from the eyes

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.259 
right here information from the eyes
would<00:02:45.299> go<00:02:45.480> over<00:02:45.569> here<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:46.739> on<00:02:47.269> so

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
would go over here and so on so

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.319 
would go over here and so on so
basically<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:49.379> sensory<00:02:50.099> strip<00:02:50.640> always

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
basically the sensory strip always

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.990 
basically the sensory strip always
receives<00:02:51.780> information<00:02:52.049> from<00:02:53.000> different

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
receives information from different

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.280 
receives information from different
parts<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.390> body<00:02:54.569> and<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:54.900> information

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
parts of the body and that information

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.289 
parts of the body and that information
will<00:02:55.650> always<00:02:55.980> go<00:02:56.129> to<00:02:56.220> one<00:02:56.549> part<00:02:56.879> of<00:02:57.060> the

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
will always go to one part of the

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.420 
will always go to one part of the
sensory<00:02:57.750> strip<00:02:58.049> so<00:02:58.530> let<00:02:58.650> me<00:02:58.739> again<00:02:58.890> clean<00:02:59.280> this

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
sensory strip so let me again clean this

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.520 
sensory strip so let me again clean this
up<00:02:59.579> a<00:02:59.640> look<00:02:59.790> if<00:03:00.659> this<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:00.959> still<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.319> little

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
up a look if this is still a little

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.930 
up a look if this is still a little
confusing<00:03:01.920> let<00:03:02.129> me<00:03:02.190> try<00:03:02.370> explaining<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.879> a

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
confusing let me try explaining it a

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.559 
confusing let me try explaining it a
different<00:03:03.269> way

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
different way

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.449 
different way
so<00:03:04.140> let's<00:03:04.349> imagine<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.769> there<00:03:04.950> was<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.069> brain

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
so let's imagine that there was a brain

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.729 
so let's imagine that there was a brain
tumor<00:03:05.849> right<00:03:06.209> over<00:03:06.510> here<00:03:06.870> this<00:03:07.260> brain<00:03:07.560> tumor

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
tumor right over here this brain tumor

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.309 
tumor right over here this brain tumor
would<00:03:08.220> kind<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:09.090> look<00:03:09.329> like<00:03:09.569> this<00:03:10.049> it<00:03:10.230> would

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
would kind of look like this it would

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.199 
would kind of look like this it would
basically<00:03:10.500> be<00:03:10.769> in<00:03:11.099> this<00:03:11.310> region<00:03:11.819> of<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.000> brain

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
basically be in this region of the brain

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.770 
basically be in this region of the brain
and<00:03:12.629> so<00:03:13.440> in<00:03:13.769> order<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.250> figure<00:03:14.430> out<00:03:14.579> what<00:03:15.180> part

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
and so in order to figure out what part

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.390 
and so in order to figure out what part
of<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.989> brain<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.500> tumor<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.040> what<00:03:17.099> part<00:03:17.340> of

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
of the brain is tumor and what part of

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.190 
of the brain is tumor and what part of
the<00:03:17.489> brain<00:03:17.579> is<00:03:17.760> normal<00:03:18.120> neurosurgeons<00:03:19.019> can

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
the brain is normal neurosurgeons can

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.289 
the brain is normal neurosurgeons can
actually<00:03:19.500> go<00:03:19.739> in<00:03:19.919> with<00:03:20.430> an<00:03:20.549> electrode<00:03:21.090> and

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
actually go in with an electrode and

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.420 
actually go in with an electrode and
touch<00:03:21.959> different<00:03:22.290> parts<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:22.889> cortex<00:03:23.099> so

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
touch different parts of the cortex so

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.220 
touch different parts of the cortex so
they<00:03:23.549> can<00:03:23.669> actually<00:03:23.910> come<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.389> touch<00:03:24.930> this

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
they can actually come in and touch this

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.379 
they can actually come in and touch this
part<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.620> cortex<00:03:25.829> and<00:03:26.340> touch<00:03:26.940> this<00:03:27.150> part

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
part of the cortex and touch this part

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:28.520 
part of the cortex and touch this part
of<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.510> cortex<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:27.900> this<00:03:27.989> electrode<00:03:28.380> will

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
of the cortex and this electrode will

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.930 
of the cortex and this electrode will
actually<00:03:28.769> cause<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.220> cells<00:03:29.459> that<00:03:29.579> it<00:03:29.730> touches

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
actually cause the cells that it touches

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.140 
actually cause the cells that it touches
to<00:03:30.569> stimulate<00:03:31.079> and<00:03:31.290> so<00:03:32.010> in<00:03:32.190> some<00:03:32.489> cases<00:03:32.790> the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
to stimulate and so in some cases the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.640 
to stimulate and so in some cases the
surgery<00:03:33.450> can<00:03:33.629> actually<00:03:33.930> be<00:03:34.079> conducted<00:03:34.560> on

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
surgery can actually be conducted on

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.069 
surgery can actually be conducted on
patients<00:03:35.099> that<00:03:35.250> are<00:03:35.340> awake<00:03:35.609> and<00:03:35.819> so<00:03:36.510> if<00:03:36.870> a

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
patients that are awake and so if a

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.729 
patients that are awake and so if a
surgeon<00:03:37.319> touches<00:03:38.129> this<00:03:38.489> part<00:03:38.849> of<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.030> cortex

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
surgeon touches this part of the cortex

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.770 
surgeon touches this part of the cortex
patients<00:03:40.739> can<00:03:40.859> actually<00:03:41.220> say<00:03:41.400> oh<00:03:41.609> if<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:42.120> feel

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
patients can actually say oh if I feel

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.599 
patients can actually say oh if I feel
as<00:03:43.019> if<00:03:43.049> somebody<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.620> touching<00:03:43.980> my<00:03:44.069> wrist<00:03:44.340> and

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
as if somebody is touching my wrist and

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.849 
as if somebody is touching my wrist and
if<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.389> surgeon<00:03:45.900> touches<00:03:46.260> this<00:03:46.440> part<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.799> the

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
if the surgeon touches this part of the

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.800 
if the surgeon touches this part of the
cortex<00:03:47.310> people<00:03:48.030> might<00:03:48.239> say<00:03:48.449> oh<00:03:48.480> I<00:03:48.690> feel

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
cortex people might say oh I feel

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.650 
cortex people might say oh I feel
somebody<00:03:49.379> touching<00:03:49.949> my<00:03:50.459> forehead<00:03:51.209> or<00:03:51.239> my<00:03:51.629> eye

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
somebody touching my forehead or my eye

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.289 
somebody touching my forehead or my eye
so<00:03:52.590> depending<00:03:53.010> on<00:03:53.099> what<00:03:53.370> part<00:03:53.609> of<00:03:53.699> the<00:03:53.790> cortex

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
so depending on what part of the cortex

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.449 
so depending on what part of the cortex
the<00:03:54.449> surgeon<00:03:54.870> places<00:03:54.900> his<00:03:55.470> electrode<00:03:56.040> the

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
the surgeon places his electrode the

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.550 
the surgeon places his electrode the
patient<00:03:57.000> will<00:03:57.150> get<00:03:57.299> a<00:03:57.359> sensation<00:03:57.989> of<00:03:58.169> some

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
patient will get a sensation of some

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.119 
patient will get a sensation of some
part<00:03:58.769> of<00:03:58.829> his<00:03:59.040> or<00:03:59.220> her<00:03:59.340> body<00:03:59.639> being<00:04:00.150> touched

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
part of his or her body being touched

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.470 
part of his or her body being touched
the<00:04:02.129> reason<00:04:02.430> that<00:04:02.549> surgeons<00:04:02.940> do<00:04:03.060> this<00:04:03.239> is<00:04:03.359> to

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
the reason that surgeons do this is to

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.289 
the reason that surgeons do this is to
make<00:04:03.660> sure<00:04:03.690> that<00:04:03.930> they<00:04:04.410> are<00:04:04.799> removing<00:04:05.609> parts

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
make sure that they are removing parts

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.759 
make sure that they are removing parts
of<00:04:06.419> the<00:04:06.510> cortex<00:04:06.930> that<00:04:06.989> are<00:04:07.109> involved<00:04:07.650> in

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
of the cortex that are involved in

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.189 
of the cortex that are involved in
sensation<00:04:08.190> because<00:04:08.699> if<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.510> surgeon<00:04:09.840> were<00:04:09.989> to

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
sensation because if the surgeon were to

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.309 
sensation because if the surgeon were to
remove<00:04:10.500> this<00:04:11.099> part<00:04:11.370> of<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.549> cortex<00:04:12.030> the

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
remove this part of the cortex the

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.720 
remove this part of the cortex the
patient<00:04:13.319> would<00:04:13.410> no<00:04:13.560> longer<00:04:13.590> have<00:04:13.889> any<00:04:14.250> feeling

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
patient would no longer have any feeling

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.990 
patient would no longer have any feeling
in<00:04:14.819> the<00:04:15.000> wrist<00:04:15.299> or<00:04:15.569> in<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.410> forearm<00:04:16.829> so<00:04:17.669> they

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
in the wrist or in the forearm so they

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.310 
in the wrist or in the forearm so they
need<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.239> make<00:04:18.419> sure<00:04:18.599> that<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.989> part<00:04:19.199> of<00:04:19.229> the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
need to make sure that the part of the

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.539 
need to make sure that the part of the
cortex<00:04:19.650> that<00:04:19.680> they're<00:04:19.889> removing<00:04:20.280> is<00:04:20.370> not

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
cortex that they're removing is not

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.219 
cortex that they're removing is not
involved<00:04:20.849> in<00:04:21.030> sensation<00:04:21.449> otherwise<00:04:21.959> the

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
involved in sensation otherwise the

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.490 
involved in sensation otherwise the
patient<00:04:22.469> would<00:04:22.560> actually<00:04:22.830> lose<00:04:23.130> sensation

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
patient would actually lose sensation

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.260 
patient would actually lose sensation
similarly<00:04:25.500> if<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.830> surgeon<00:04:26.669> removed<00:04:26.969> this

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
similarly if the surgeon removed this

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.240 
similarly if the surgeon removed this
part<00:04:27.449> of<00:04:27.509> the<00:04:27.599> cortex<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.770> patient<00:04:29.129> would

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
part of the cortex the patient would

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.249 
part of the cortex the patient would
lose<00:04:29.460> sensation<00:04:29.639> in<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.300> lips<00:04:30.569> because<00:04:30.990> that

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
lose sensation in the lips because that

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.140 
lose sensation in the lips because that
this<00:04:31.530> part<00:04:31.800> of<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.919> cortex<00:04:32.160> actually

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
this part of the cortex actually

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.629 
this part of the cortex actually
receives<00:04:33.720> input<00:04:34.110> from<00:04:34.139> the<00:04:34.470> lips<00:04:34.680> so<00:04:35.400> let<00:04:35.550> me

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
receives input from the lips so let me

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:36.920 
receives input from the lips so let me
again<00:04:35.729> clean<00:04:36.120> this<00:04:36.240> up<00:04:36.419> just<00:04:36.479> to<00:04:36.720> go<00:04:36.900> over

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
again clean this up just to go over

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.830 
again clean this up just to go over
everything<00:04:37.440> one<00:04:37.710> last<00:04:37.919> time<00:04:38.129> so<00:04:38.509> the<00:04:39.509> sensory

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
everything one last time so the sensory

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.589 
everything one last time so the sensory
homunculus<00:04:40.430> basically<00:04:41.430> maps<00:04:41.819> out<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.150> body

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
homunculus basically maps out the body

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.100 
homunculus basically maps out the body
in<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:43.349> brain<00:04:43.759> so<00:04:44.759> as<00:04:44.940> information<00:04:45.569> comes<00:04:45.599> to

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
in the brain so as information comes to

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.749 
in the brain so as information comes to
the<00:04:46.379> brain<00:04:46.590> from<00:04:47.039> different<00:04:47.370> parts<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.669> the

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
the brain from different parts of the

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.300 
the brain from different parts of the
body<00:04:48.319> information<00:04:49.319> from<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.590> hand<00:04:49.889> will<00:04:50.069> all

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
body information from the hand will all

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.170 
body information from the hand will all
synapse<00:04:50.849> in<00:04:51.150> this<00:04:51.449> region<00:04:51.990> of<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.259> cortex

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
synapse in this region of the cortex

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.279 
synapse in this region of the cortex
information<00:04:54.180> from<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.509> face<00:04:54.720> will<00:04:54.960> synapse

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
information from the face will synapse

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.649 
information from the face will synapse
in<00:04:55.560> this<00:04:55.740> region<00:04:56.220> information<00:04:57.090> from<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.449> fee

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
in this region information from the fee

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:59.659 
in this region information from the fee
will<00:04:57.840> synapse<00:04:58.110> in<00:04:58.259> this<00:04:58.409> region<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.009> so<00:04:59.490> what

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
will synapse in this region and so what

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.249 
will synapse in this region and so what
this<00:04:59.819> effectively<00:05:00.000> creates<00:05:00.990> is<00:05:01.199> a
