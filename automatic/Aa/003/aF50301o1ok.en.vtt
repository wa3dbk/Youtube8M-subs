00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:05.406
 We will talk now about the LFP awards. 

00:00:05.406 --> 00:00:13.640
 Players of Real Madrid, who was third in the last season, were awarded the best goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, striker, marksman and footballer! 

00:00:14.204 --> 00:00:19.553
 On the other hand, from the team of the champion, Atlético, only the coach was chosen, I do not embrace it. 

00:00:19.553 --> 00:00:23.694
 We will talk about this hot topic with Sergio Ramos! 

00:00:27.373 --> 00:00:32.168
 But sweetheart. Good evening and a white evening! 

00:00:32.168 --> 00:00:36.568
 Sergio, do you think you've rightly won these LFP awards? 

00:00:36.568 --> 00:00:40.432
 And how would it be different? We are independent leaders! 

00:00:40.432 --> 00:00:43.885
 Not really clear, but these rewards are for the previous season. 

00:00:46.888 --> 00:00:51.516
 What a previous season ... We got them on Monday! 

00:00:51.516 --> 00:00:54.690
 That would be a time-space paradox. 

00:00:56.257 --> 00:01:00.279
 Oh, me! I did not expect! 

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:06.518
 For ... what's here ... too oreogonal ... I can not read it. 

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:12.198
 For her ... originality ... time-space ... Nobel in the field of astrophysics. 

00:01:18.348 --> 00:01:22.576
 You see? LFP stands out for the most deserving. 

00:01:25.305 --> 00:01:27.439
 Let's talk about Atlético ... 

00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:31.655
 Be silent, I'm quiet here with Atleti. 

00:01:32.083 --> 00:01:36.074
 Here is what I have to say about Atlético: you are covered! 

00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:40.090
 Oh, two more prizes! 

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:49.900
 For a nice poem, the Cervantes Literary Award and the prize for ... I can not ... 

00:01:49.896 --> 00:01:51.100
 Literary Prize Bertran Award. 

00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:54.760
 Priests Bertran! I did not expect this! 

00:01:56.122 --> 00:01:59.330
 Then they say that literary prizes are set up. 

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:02.820
 What are you talking about? 

00:02:02.823 --> 00:02:04.920
 You would not understand. 

00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:10.610
 It is obvious ... because I do not really understand. What did you say about the prizes? 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.520
 - I said that literary prizes, do you know what literary prizes are? - Well, here I have one. 

00:02:15.522 --> 00:02:19.390
 It is said that they are set, that they are granted earlier. 

00:02:19.387 --> 00:02:21.190
 Do you understand what I'm talking about? 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:24.760
 I'm trying, yes. 

00:02:25.832 --> 00:02:30.400
 The most important thing is that I try, but I do not understand what you're talking about. 

00:02:32.626 --> 00:02:34.380
 In Madrid you have been doing a lot lately. 

00:02:34.378 --> 00:02:37.760
 It's all right, we're rocking forward like a ball. 

00:02:37.763 --> 00:02:44.060
 And that's not! After all, Pepe kicked you off during the match. 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:55.980
 Well, this photo confirms, but I can be really grateful Pepe, because I got the ribs, and now I can bend down. 

00:02:57.242 --> 00:02:58.270
 Why bend over? 

00:02:58.268 --> 00:02:59.460
 Well, bend down. 

00:03:00.487 --> 00:03:01.600
 Look ... 

00:03:05.416 --> 00:03:10.360
 Bend to tie shoelaces! What did you think? 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.240
 Nothing nothing. Well done to Sergio Ramos, goodbye!
