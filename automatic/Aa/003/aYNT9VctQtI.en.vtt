00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
something there you just saw the

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.070 
something there you just saw the
Sapphire<00:02:06.250> staff<00:02:07.250> in<00:02:07.550> action<00:02:08.060> it<00:02:08.330> wherever<00:02:08.720> you

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
Sapphire staff in action it wherever you

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.190 
Sapphire staff in action it wherever you
click<00:02:10.120> within<00:02:11.120> your<00:02:11.690> range<00:02:11.930> obviously<00:02:14.200> it

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
click within your range obviously it

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.100 
click within your range obviously it
actually<00:02:15.620> creates<00:02:16.010> lightning<00:02:16.750> then<00:02:17.750> here

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
actually creates lightning then here

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.809 
actually creates lightning then here
I've<00:02:18.290> got<00:02:18.469> two<00:02:18.739> each

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
I've got two each

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.030 
I've got two each
pickaxe<00:02:20.950> ordered<00:02:21.950> from<00:02:22.340> best<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:23.030> worst

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
pickaxe ordered from best to worst

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.490 
pickaxe ordered from best to worst
starting<00:02:25.040> with<00:02:25.190> sapphire<00:02:25.790> which<00:02:26.209> is<00:02:26.500> 3000

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
starting with sapphire which is 3000

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.520 
starting with sapphire which is 3000
uses<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.220> better<00:02:28.459> than<00:02:28.700> diamond<00:02:29.239> and<00:02:29.510> then<00:02:30.470> I

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
uses and better than diamond and then I

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.250 
uses and better than diamond and then I
believe<00:02:30.950> emerald<00:02:31.760> is<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.180> same<00:02:32.480> as<00:02:32.720> diamond

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
believe emerald is the same as diamond

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.729 
believe emerald is the same as diamond
but<00:02:33.830> more<00:02:34.129> uses<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:35.000> then<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.989> just<00:02:36.170> goes<00:02:36.410> down

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
but more uses and then it just goes down

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.920 
but more uses and then it just goes down
from<00:02:37.069> there<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.280> think<00:02:37.870> topaz<00:02:38.870> also<00:02:39.560> has<00:02:40.930> either

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
from there I think topaz also has either

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.740 
from there I think topaz also has either
as<00:02:42.349> good<00:02:42.709> or<00:02:42.739> close<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.580> diamond<00:02:44.540> in

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
as good or close to diamond in

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.850 
as good or close to diamond in
performance<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:47.080> there<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.170> go<00:02:48.380> there's<00:02:48.769> the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
performance so there you go there's the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.570 
performance so there you go there's the
more<00:02:49.340> ores<00:02:49.610> mod<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.390> I<00:02:50.720> will<00:02:50.959> show<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.580> some

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
more ores mod and I will show you some

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.349 
more ores mod and I will show you some
