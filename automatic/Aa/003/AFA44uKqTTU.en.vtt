00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.890
 and that is it, it's okay, everyone arrived. 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.800
 here is my second nor the third 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.800
 submarine purchase which are five books 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.950
 and I was very anxious for the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.869
 meeting could not wait to get to 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.470
 always takes quite so constructed 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.360
 huh 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.240
 I 'm very nervous about this package because 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.760
 He has two books to the 25th that ask 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.260
 I wanted so much time so I wanted from 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.120
 The time I saw the movie 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.340
 are five hardcover books that 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.630
 Understand the pain was in promotion I 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.429
 I do not know if it develops in hardcover 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.879
 because I just wanted to tell the brochure 

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:38.370
 hard cover but I 'm very anxious to 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.920
 It was a match, I think. 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.339
 too small box for five books 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.339
 but we'll see, right? 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.469
 the first book here animals 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.719
 where a good book lives. 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.509
 cool that has the details - this is it here 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.509
 it's just the drawing of course to live well at last 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:15.990
 I did not believe that book 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.670
 really existed but I did not buy 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.170
 the other two did not buy the picture 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.789
 through centuries and even the tales of 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.820
 beedle the bard that I bought 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.680
 because it was on the promotion of 18 and 91 and 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.280
 offers were over $ 1 so I bought 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.570
 because I do not have 10 reais 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.189
 people I 'm seeing here through the package 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.570
 That 's hard cover, but I'm going. 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.619
 leave the last two books that the 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.840
 will remove the package 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.219
 the two are five then there are two of a 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.990
 number of other 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.299
 I will draw the inference that no hardcover 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.820
 I've been waiting for a long time but that 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.969
 are two of the series instruments 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.479
 mortals who are city of glass was 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:58.380
 on sale for $ 18 are very cheap 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.880
 free is the normal version rather 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.429
 series I bought the second and third 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.930
 book and because I had already bought 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:09.179
 benefit to the first 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:12.960
 in a first second third and another 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.940
 here I feel extremely mortal that 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.800
 was ripped package that the city of 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:27.390
 because the torn package is in the 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:30.620
 book is not winning are not much 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.620
 beautiful eyes shine 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:51.360
 At least I was hoping that I would 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.300
 I wanted lots of free time. 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.709
 I bought the third and fourth because the 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.200
 who also had a promotion 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.980
 for eighteen reais and eighteen reais 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.920
 of 91 and above 32 here each of the 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.130
 eight reais that are hardcover, which are the 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.549
 chronicles of spiderwick wanted very much 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.549
 time 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:44.269
 are 15 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:55.410
 he is a very well finished book and so 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.390
 as the American version the leaf cut 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.350
 totally different the leaves are all 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.570
 regular 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.930
 I saw it for the first time in this collection 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.480
 in a literary tamengo channel and I 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.739
 I found a lot but so did the 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.540
 American version that also has this 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.960
 detail here that I expected very much and 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.390
 also 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.850
 The hard one so I was very happy about it 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:26.240
 I 'll come here for the video because I 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:29.940

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.890
 back of the book with the title 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:50.550
 It's very nice to see that the relief is very 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:54.360
 more to win with the scissors show 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.980

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.400
 new 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.620
 despite the 42 new songs that 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.510
 I took the opportunity to buy the two real 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:35.000

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.520
 different texture

 Her spine looks pretty good to me like that. 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.090
 the theme 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:22.300
