00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.830
 hello everyone I'm sebas and this is 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.510
 minecraft bolivia before anything I would like 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.810
 apologize for not uploading videos 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:21.010
 in a month I did not have time for reasons of 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:24.310
 school and now I gave myself time and went up 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.890
 this tutorial and well today we are going to talk 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.890
 about the falklands that are the far land 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.289
 and so they did them first they are 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.979
 the skirts the skirts is the end of your 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:38.679
 world that is that well minecraft 

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:40.719
 Bosco as a player in my tutorial 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.999
 deschamps and expansions I showed you 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.190
 when you were going away for this side 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:48.069
 these were unloaded and those were loaded 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.449
 and that that made you not oversaturated 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:55.899
 the ram and the game would be and playable and if 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.600
 not like that, I did that well, because 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.789
 expansion are something similar could be 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.369
 say they do not have ram themes but what 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.830
 it happens is to fill the memory like they do 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:07.510
 generate your world one 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.520
 general every time you generate new 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.400
 world that happens your size of the of the 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.380
 survival in which you are generating the map 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.580
 it is growing little by little 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.350
 block by block well what happens 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.060
 you would get to such a point if they had not 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.810
 you are farland you will reach such a point 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.500
 that your rival or turn to map that you're 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.440
 generating therefore weigh more than tera and that's not 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.870
 it's fine so the demos have already created 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.300
 the far land which are the fringes that are 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.930
 the falklands the faults are the limit 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:44.360
 bus 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:46.790
 and the end is 30,000 for 30,000 both 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.700
 30 million for 30 million both 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.680
 negative the negative and positive sense 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.750
 as you can see here is in x and she 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.090
 we are in one of the corners of the end 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.479
 of this world well 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.219
 that is the summary and other some of the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.770
 weird things that happen in the skirts in 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:11.430
 the looks so they are far away 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:15.890
 well weird things you see many blocks 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:20.180
 how can the hoppers be exceeded 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:24.530
 also here the threads 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.659
 as they were called the pistons and also 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.409
 I discovered that you can put a 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:33.140
 static lava cube without needing 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:35.420
 nothing you just put it but always in the 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.510
 end of elche 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.200
 sorry for your fans the last line 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.019
 does not let you through and here are some 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.810
 samples to do some tests that 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.990
 it does not leave you as true the water is not going to 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.630
 it looks side 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.830
 let's try even with this I propose here and 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:59.750
 it goes out there is a boom 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.940
 there is also used on the main 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.560
 card and also here I'm going to show you 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:10.100
 another how is the end could be 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.590
 say the invisible wall very well cover 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.590
 press here and this is you but here 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.930
 as you can see this is indestructible and 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.810
 it's as if this is the world that 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.970
 you generate and that was a photograph 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.130
 I could say that an image will only be 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.940
 an image and it always will be that is not going to 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.290
 change since he could not break blocks and 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.760
 I'm trying to break 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.560
 I do not even grab the blocks I have 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.900
 that grab well other other tests that 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.370
 could show them would be here the cut 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.159
 of the trees 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.600
 also here I was experimenting with 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:56.020
 the Canon 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.650
 and as you see left a clear line of 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:02.819
 Separation of the Falklands 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.730
 around here I also discovered a bug 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:10.630
 what would be the portal look how it looks 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.450
 also the the animations 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.340
 as you can see when the fire ak and 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.829
 go out there 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.810
 it's super weird everything that happens here 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.810
 even in previous versions 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.110
 in girlfriend line and it was a triad because 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.360
 you could come 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.970
 you were running I do not know quietly and 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.250
 out of nowhere take a leap or if it's 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.280
 walking and out of nowhere you fall to the 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.280
 empty 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.980
 and I think that's also why they put this 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.170
 you are falling into emptiness and fear and it is 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.300
 obviously lost all these things and 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.800
 impossible to recover them well here I have 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.800
 Other ship's test 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.900
 well and having problems with entities 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.539
 what about the entities that you throw 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.150
 let's say i have kinder pels i say no 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:06.419
 I do not want to go to the networks of 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.419
 skirts 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.590
 even more 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:16.000
 as it is an image has no collision box 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.680
 Extending skin is an entity and as 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.940
 has box collision because it will continue 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.210
 and as you also see 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.810
 this is not normal if water is also 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.810
 very rare here 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.220
 and that the player again quite the 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:38.040
 minecraft and I have not seen it rain 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:41.130
 one of two good 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.230
 and that I think it was all I hope that you 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:47.100
 I liked it 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:50.240
 Well, I'm nothing sebas and this we see the 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.240
 next video chao
