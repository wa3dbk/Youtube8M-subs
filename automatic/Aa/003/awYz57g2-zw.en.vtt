against elation checking my windshield
wash<00:03:03.920> completely<00:03:04.220> that's<00:03:05.120> working

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.140 

let's<00:03:08.379> go<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.680> check<00:03:08.739> it

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
let's go and check it

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:30.449 
let's go and check it
turn<00:03:10.629> at<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.840> max<00:03:11.080> took<00:03:11.500> this<00:03:11.769> probe<00:03:12.129> switch

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.710 

that's<00:03:31.459> pretty<00:03:31.730> much<00:03:31.910> everything<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:32.480> can

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
that's pretty much everything you can

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.550 
that's pretty much everything you can
check<00:03:32.930> with<00:03:33.050> the<00:03:33.170> vehicle<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:34.430> vehicle

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
check with the vehicle the vehicle

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.550 
check with the vehicle the vehicle
integrity<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:38.510> first<00:03:38.780> thing<00:03:39.050> you<00:03:39.170> want<00:03:39.380> to<00:03:39.410> do

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
is make sure your pressures built in

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.640 
is make sure your pressures built in
these

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.250 

at<00:03:45.579> least<00:03:45.760> 200

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
at least 200

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.630 
at least 200
we're<00:03:47.560> gonna<00:03:47.739> wait<00:03:47.950> so<00:03:48.190> it<00:03:48.250> gets<00:03:48.400> a<00:03:48.489> little

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
we're gonna wait so it gets a little

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:56.059 
we're gonna wait so it gets a little
higher
