00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
had the air bag light showing on his BMW

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.269 
had the air bag light showing on his BMW
3-series<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.529> 90<00:00:17.180> just<00:00:18.180> as<00:00:18.359> we<00:00:18.510> have<00:00:18.690> here<00:00:19.279> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
3-series a 90 just as we have here and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.859 
3-series a 90 just as we have here and
what<00:00:20.490> he<00:00:20.580> really<00:00:21.029> wanted<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.359> know<00:00:21.480> was

what he really wanted to know was

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.109 
what he really wanted to know was
whether<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.619> could<00:00:22.740> use<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> diagnostic<00:00:23.910> tool

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
whether you could use a diagnostic tool

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.060 
whether you could use a diagnostic tool
to<00:00:24.390> actually<00:00:24.570> clear<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.199> air<00:00:25.470> bag<00:00:25.740> light

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
to actually clear the air bag light

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.700 
to actually clear the air bag light
without<00:00:26.939> actually<00:00:27.420> fixing<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.050> fault<00:00:28.410> that

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
without actually fixing the fault that

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.679 
without actually fixing the fault that
was<00:00:28.890> occurring<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.179> fault<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.570> was

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
was occurring and the fault that was

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.500 
was occurring and the fault that was
causing<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.230> air<00:00:31.349> bag<00:00:31.560> like<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.949> star<00:00:32.189> with

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
causing the air bag like the star with

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.040 
causing the air bag like the star with
and<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.570> just<00:00:33.600> want<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.020> sort<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:35.630> show<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.660> what

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and I just want to sort of show you what

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.450 
and I just want to sort of show you what
will<00:00:37.170> happen<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.620> try<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.070> do<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.399> here

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
will happen if we try and do that here

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.500 
will happen if we try and do that here
what<00:00:41.460> I'm<00:00:41.550> going<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.760> do<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.180> I'm<00:00:42.300> just<00:00:42.329> going

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
what I'm going to do is I'm just going

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.940 
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to<00:00:42.600> go<00:00:42.719> through<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.020> notions<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.559> actually

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
to go through the notions of actually

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.010 
to go through the notions of actually
resetting<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> air<00:00:44.820> bag<00:00:45.059> light<00:00:45.329> even<00:00:45.930> though

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
resetting the air bag light even though

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.540 
resetting the air bag light even though
we<00:00:46.140> haven't<00:00:46.350> actually<00:00:46.710> fixed<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.129> fall<00:00:47.399> on

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
we haven't actually fixed the fall on

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.970 
we haven't actually fixed the fall on
this<00:00:47.670> vehicle<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:49.320> got<00:00:49.440> three<00:00:49.739> one<00:00:49.950> eight

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
this vehicle so we got three one eight

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.709 
this vehicle so we got three one eight
and<00:00:50.460> forty<00:00:50.910> six<00:00:51.030> two<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.210> that's<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> vehicle

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
and forty six two and that's the vehicle

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.150 
and forty six two and that's the vehicle
at<00:00:51.989> winning<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.649> vehicle<00:00:52.860> out<00:00:53.010> the

at winning that is the vehicle out the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.540 
at winning that is the vehicle out the
customer<00:00:53.520> had<00:00:54.350> it's<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.469> European<00:00:55.680> right-hand

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
customer had it's a European right-hand

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.660 
customer had it's a European right-hand
drive<00:00:59.000> so<00:01:00.000> what<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.210> want<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.480> do<00:01:00.629> first<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.109> all

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
drive so what I want to do first of all

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.979 
drive so what I want to do first of all
I've<00:01:02.670> got<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.910> scan<00:01:03.149> tool<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.600> shot<00:01:03.809> here

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
I've got the scan tool in the shot here

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.750 
I've got the scan tool in the shot here
I've<00:01:04.229> got<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.559> airbag<00:01:04.920> light<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
I've got the airbag light and the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.910 
I've got the airbag light and the
dashboard<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.330> shot<00:01:06.540> here<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.860> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
dashboard in the shot here I'm going to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.280 
dashboard in the shot here I'm going to
go<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.460> diagnose<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:11.750> problem<00:01:12.750> with<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
go in and diagnose a problem with the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.850 
go in and diagnose a problem with the
airbag<00:01:13.650> system<00:01:18.110> it<00:01:19.110> should<00:01:19.320> give<00:01:19.560> us<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
airbag system it should give us the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.800 
airbag system it should give us the
reason<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.369> why<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.790> airbag<00:01:21.299> light<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.630> on

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
reason as to why the airbag light is on

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.440 
reason as to why the airbag light is on
so<00:01:21.840> mrs<00:01:22.770> multiple<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> strain<00:01:23.880> system<00:01:24.330> is

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
so mrs multiple the strain system is

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.300 
so mrs multiple the strain system is
what<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.840> here<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.290> i'm<00:01:25.950> going<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.130> all

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
what we have here so i'm going to all

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.539 
what we have here so i'm going to all
care<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:27.680> i'm<00:01:28.680> going<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.890> read<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.250> codes

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
care to that i'm going to read the codes

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.010 
care to that i'm going to read the codes
the<00:01:29.820> codes<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.479> are<00:01:30.600> probably<00:01:30.780> getting

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
the codes that you are probably getting

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.730 
the codes that you are probably getting
on<00:01:31.320> yours<00:01:32.000> is<00:01:33.000> probably<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.650> be

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
on yours is probably going to be

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.550 
on yours is probably going to be
different<00:01:35.329> we've<00:01:36.329> simulated<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:37.170> problem

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
different we've simulated this problem

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.920 
different we've simulated this problem
in<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:37.799> vehicle<00:01:38.009> here<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:39.270> we<00:01:39.420> know<00:01:39.659> where

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
in this vehicle here so we know where

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.550 
in this vehicle here so we know where
the<00:01:40.110> problem<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:41.780> put<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> codes<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.320> you

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
the problem is put the codes that you

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.120 
the problem is put the codes that you
get<00:01:43.799> will<00:01:43.979> be<00:01:44.009> different<00:01:45.649> all<00:01:46.649> right<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.009> these

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
get will be different all right so these

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.920 
get will be different all right so these
are<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.399> faults<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.729> we<00:01:47.939> have<00:01:48.060> here<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.720> what

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
are the faults that we have here so what

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.600 
are the faults that we have here so what
you're<00:01:49.079> basically<00:01:49.439> asking<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:50.040> if<00:01:50.189> we<00:01:50.340> go<00:01:50.490> in

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
you're basically asking is if we go in

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.840 
you're basically asking is if we go in
and<00:01:50.700> erase<00:01:51.030> codes<00:01:52.009> will<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.100> clear<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.520> airbag

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
and erase codes will it clear the airbag

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.109 
and erase codes will it clear the airbag
light<00:01:54.740> let's<00:01:55.740> find<00:01:56.040> out<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.460> already<00:01:56.880> know<00:01:56.969> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
light let's find out I already know the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.609 
light let's find out I already know the
answer<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:57.450> let's<00:01:57.840> find<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.590> show

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
answer but let's find out just to show

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.690 
answer but let's find out just to show
you

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
you

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.030 
you
so<00:02:00.060> DTC's<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.049> freeze<00:02:01.259> data<00:02:01.500> weight<00:02:01.680> loss<00:02:01.890> do

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
so DTC's and freeze data weight loss do

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.139 
so DTC's and freeze data weight loss do
you<00:02:02.100> wish<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.310> continue<00:02:02.759> okay<00:02:03.119> yes<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.540> that

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
you wish to continue okay yes to that

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.830 
you wish to continue okay yes to that
alright<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.450> there<00:02:06.600> we<00:02:06.630> go

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
alright so there we go

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.369 
alright so there we go
arrays<00:02:07.170> codes<00:02:07.640> commands<00:02:08.640> send<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:10.200> what's

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
arrays codes commands send so what's

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.960 
arrays codes commands send so what's
happened<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.830> we<00:02:11.069> haven't<00:02:11.400> raised<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.670> codes

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
happened is we haven't raised the codes

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.369 
happened is we haven't raised the codes
there<00:02:12.239> but<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> air<00:02:12.629> but<00:02:12.810> light<00:02:13.020> is<00:02:13.050> still

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
there but the air but light is still

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.670 
there but the air but light is still
sure

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
sure

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.240 
sure
and<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.640> goes<00:02:15.269> to<00:02:15.510> prove<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:16.079> the<00:02:16.829> fault

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
and that goes to prove that the fault

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.640 
and that goes to prove that the fault
must<00:02:17.519> be<00:02:17.730> fixed<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.930> connections<00:02:19.470> or

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
must be fixed the connections or

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.619 
must be fixed the connections or
whatever<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.099> is<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.549> causing<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.329> airbag

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
whatever it is the causing the airbag

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.780 
whatever it is the causing the airbag
light<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.500> does<00:02:22.739> need<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.069> be<00:02:23.189> fixed<00:02:23.670> before

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
light that does need to be fixed before

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.899 
light that does need to be fixed before
we<00:02:24.060> can<00:02:24.360> actually<00:02:25.010> remove<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.280> airbag<00:02:26.610> light

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
we can actually remove the airbag light

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.369 
we can actually remove the airbag light
from<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.420> dashboard<00:02:27.629> so<00:02:27.959> what<00:02:28.110> I'm<00:02:28.200> going<00:02:28.349> to

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
from the dashboard so what I'm going to

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.500 
from the dashboard so what I'm going to
do<00:02:28.560> now<00:02:28.799> is<00:02:29.269> quickly<00:02:30.269> go<00:02:30.659> out<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:32.510> connect

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
do now is quickly go out and connect

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.030 
do now is quickly go out and connect
everything<00:02:33.599> back<00:02:34.019> together<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.650> then<00:02:34.859> we'll

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
everything back together and then we'll

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.149 
everything back together and then we'll
try<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.430> function<00:02:36.150> again<00:02:36.239> in<00:02:36.540> fact<00:02:36.890> I'll<00:02:37.890> keep

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
try the function again in fact I'll keep

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:52.099 
try the function again in fact I'll keep
the<00:02:38.250> video<00:02:38.519> rolling<00:02:38.849> to<00:02:39.180> show<00:02:39.359> that<00:02:39.510> it's<00:02:51.109> just

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
the video rolling to show that it's just

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.300 
the video rolling to show that it's just
so<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.349> know<00:02:52.530> exactly<00:02:52.680> what<00:02:53.099> we're<00:02:53.220> doing

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
so you know exactly what we're doing

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.440 
so you know exactly what we're doing
here<00:02:53.720> right<00:02:54.920> everyone<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.370> this<00:02:57.180> is<00:02:57.299> the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
here right everyone so this is the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.509 
here right everyone so this is the
connector<00:02:58.019> which<00:02:58.170> we've<00:02:58.409> unplugged<00:02:59.040> just<00:02:59.400> to

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
connector which we've unplugged just to

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.009 
connector which we've unplugged just to
simulate<00:02:59.760> the<00:03:02.180> problem<00:03:03.180> for<00:03:03.359> the<00:03:03.420> purposes<00:03:03.959> of

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
simulate the problem for the purposes of

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.220 
simulate the problem for the purposes of
the<00:03:04.200> video<00:03:05.599> so<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:06.689> connector<00:03:07.049> stuck

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
the video so the connector stuck

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:19.460 
the video so the connector stuck
together<00:03:07.409> now<00:03:17.629> all<00:03:18.629> right<00:03:18.750> now<00:03:18.810> let's<00:03:19.260> try

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
together now all right now let's try

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:27.110 
together now all right now let's try
that<00:03:19.620> scenario<00:03:19.980> game<00:03:22.190> so<00:03:23.190> race<00:03:24.090> codes<00:03:26.120> DTC's

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
that scenario game so race codes DTC's

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.149 
that scenario game so race codes DTC's
diagnostic<00:03:27.840> trouble<00:03:28.109> codes<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:28.650> freeze<00:03:28.919> data

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
diagnostic trouble codes and freeze data

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.619 
diagnostic trouble codes and freeze data
will<00:03:29.370> be<00:03:29.489> lost<00:03:29.609> do<00:03:29.849> you<00:03:29.970> wish<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.150> continue

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
will be lost do you wish to continue

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.610 
will be lost do you wish to continue
we're<00:03:31.409> going<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.590> click<00:03:31.739> yes<00:03:31.949> to<00:03:32.010> that<00:03:33.620> airbag

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
we're going to click yes to that airbag

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.699 
we're going to click yes to that airbag
like<00:03:34.859> gone<00:03:35.129> straight<00:03:35.489> away<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.709> hopefully

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
like gone straight away so hopefully

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.349 
like gone straight away so hopefully
this<00:03:37.919> answers<00:03:38.129> your<00:03:38.459> question<00:03:38.879> I'm<00:03:39.030> guessing

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
this answers your question I'm guessing

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.689 
this answers your question I'm guessing
it<00:03:39.480> will<00:03:39.829> and<00:03:40.829> hopefully<00:03:41.129> if<00:03:41.220> anybody<00:03:41.579> else

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
it will and hopefully if anybody else

it will and hopefully if anybody else
has<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.090> same<00:03:42.409> question<00:03:43.409> or<00:03:43.530> query<00:03:43.859> or<00:03:44.159> if

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
has the same question or query or if

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.039 
has the same question or query or if
they're<00:03:45.299> wondering<00:03:45.659> the<00:03:45.780> same<00:03:45.930> thing

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
they're wondering the same thing

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.750 
they're wondering the same thing

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
hopefully it answers your question as

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.089 
hopefully it answers your question as
well<00:03:47.970> that<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:48.989> do<00:03:49.199> need<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.590> reset<00:03:50.069> the

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
well that you do need to reset the

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.240 
well that you do need to reset the
actual<00:03:51.229> physical<00:03:52.229> problem<00:03:52.680> rather<00:03:52.979> than<00:03:53.129> just

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
actual physical problem rather than just

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.939 
actual physical problem rather than just
resetting<00:03:53.909> the<00:03:54.090> actual<00:03:54.680> diagnostic<00:03:55.680> trouble

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
resetting the actual diagnostic trouble

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.649 
resetting the actual diagnostic trouble
code<00:03:56.099> because<00:03:56.310> that<00:03:56.459> alone<00:03:56.729> will<00:03:56.940> not<00:03:57.180> fix<00:03:57.479> the

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
code because that alone will not fix the

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.379 
code because that alone will not fix the
airbag<00:03:57.989> light<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:58.739> need<00:03:58.979> to<00:03:59.220> use<00:03:59.909> the<00:04:00.120> code<00:04:00.359> to

erase<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.109> airbag<00:04:01.470> light<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:01.979> also<00:04:02.400> fix<00:04:02.760> the
