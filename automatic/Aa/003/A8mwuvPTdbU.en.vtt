00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:07.260
 the sauce we're going to need four 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.620
 tablespoons mayonnaise 4 tablespoons 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.410
 of soup chest a tablespoon of 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.990
 onion and crush Benilde is the same or 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.810
 then you can roll two tablespoons of 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:25.470
 Pickled pineapple or pickles 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.579
 August saosin and two boiled cold eggs 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.650
 cold right 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.589
 salt and pepper to taste 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.780
 to temper the first step is to wash 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.060
 onion to take some of this acidity 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.070
 this is the name she has to stay 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.270
 more gentle, right? 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.210
 we put some water 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.850
 now it would be just a little bit to 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.240
 be able to take s 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.830
 This acidity she has is very strong. 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.870
 a very strong taste some people do not 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.790
 like but for those who do not want to put 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.460
 This ball does not need to be now 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.990
 let it drain while it goes 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.480
 running we're getting the others 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:07.080
 ingredients then we go here to snack 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.830
 canned cucumber needs to be 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.310
 applied fine is not too little 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.990
 to become more tasty but also the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.659
 more beautiful 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.700
 if you stay put into too much pieces 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:27.840
 large it could be that it did not give our taste 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.990
 eye that needs to stay and lies 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.920
 now it needs to be finely chopped but 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.110
 Unprocessed, you only stayed today. 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.549
 gotta feel the pieces have to stay 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.970
 more delicate it can not be too 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.580
 coarse because it's an eye 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.310
 made the chopped the pickles ten thousand 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.080
 Wines too, they 're fine. 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.260
 very small I need to ask two 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.049
 tablespoons gave straight - laced but this 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.030
 a little 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:04.020
 so we're going to lay eggs here 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.270
 You cut it half way down. 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.520
 at the time of importing into strips 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:15.280
 although you cut in half 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:17.890
 ah ah ah ah and I'll put it here too 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.250
 and I'll do the same with the thunder there 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.870
 Now we put the onion to 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:29.020
 mayonnaise and parsley is August and now 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.010
 people was mixed and added all the 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.770
 Ingredients 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.900
 then you test if you think you're missing the 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.760
 salt because the mayonnaise as it already has 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.220
 salt is you put a little more 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.810
 Careful, there you go if you want too. 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.410
 you can put some pepper 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.230
 Kingdom 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.630
 It 's good for me, it says to care because 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.430
 the already salty mayonnaise okay and so 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.040
 was tartar sauce is what I did to 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.170
 follow the ob fry they aim to just want 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.630
 make steak I'll leave the link on the side 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.100
 for those who want to follow and I hope 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.510

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.510
