angelou lucci from Fox technologies we
have<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.469> demo<00:00:46.680> set<00:00:46.980> up<00:00:47.070> quickly<00:00:47.329> so<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.360> can

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
have a demo set up quickly so I can

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.020 
have a demo set up quickly so I can
launch<00:00:50.300> 2x<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.629> log<00:00:51.840> into<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.170> Windows<00:00:52.649> desktop

in the database development world and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.590 
in the database development world and
here<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.680> my<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.130> know<00:01:23.250> database<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.420> is

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
here it is my you know database that is

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.929 
here it is my you know database that is
actually<00:01:25.130> originally<00:01:26.130> optimized<00:01:26.610> for<00:01:26.820> an

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
actually originally optimized for an

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.030 
actually originally optimized for an
iPad<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:28.020> know<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.439> might<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.890> do<00:01:29.009> a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
iPad you know we might have to do a

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.130 
iPad you know we might have to do a
little<00:01:29.220> bit<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.729> know<00:01:29.850> screen<00:01:30.450> tweaking

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
little bit of you know screen tweaking

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.190 
little bit of you know screen tweaking
so<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.250> actually<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:33.600> know<00:01:33.659> see<00:01:33.960> things

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
so we can actually you know see things

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.469 
so we can actually you know see things
perfectly<00:01:34.619> well<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.130> platform<00:01:35.400> but<00:01:36.210> here

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
