00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:07.350
 hi such areas today I bring you 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.350
 I have treated that I want to finish 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.960
 this is a video says that several times 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:22.520
 They are doing right now recently 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.520
 and the truth is that I like a lot 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.550
 pretty good because we read right now 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.860
 all so many sagas that is so that 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.079
 let's take a little control I'll 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.300
 start with this year's rates that I've 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.220
 started and I know for sure that I'm going to 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.310
 continue this year 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.320
 next good the first one with which 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.540
 we meet is battle of kings is 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.750
 a trilogy and it says the review and I have 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.000
 the other two in ebook so this year 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.700
 I'm sure 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.890
 The Visigoth of Isabella San Sebastian 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.770
 which is a biology I do not have to second 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.630
 but I want to read it under the sky 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.470
 eternal of veronica rossi is a trilogy 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:06.350
 of young dystopian new liked a lot 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.120
 missing but for taking out in Spanish and 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.750
 I will definitely finish it 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.360
 the side of Luis Lowry I liked a lot 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.240
 three more books I think there's the saga 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.040
 complete in my library so I 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.830
 I will do with him I had thought to read it this 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.320
 summer but we'll see how the thing I think 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.940
 that this year does not happen by the way is a 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.520
 juvenile book I almost liked 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.370
 a lot and says the review claire the beat and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.280
 the city of the dead of bleed this 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.280
 it's a saga of a detective and every 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.460
 book is going to be a different case the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.290
 second book is in the USA but here in 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.780
 Spain not because it has been taken out of this 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.480
 year the first I hope it will continue 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.570
 editing in Spanish but I'll read it 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.060
 in English because I liked one 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.770
 of my favorite books this year the 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.190
 next and that I will not doubt a 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.530
 moment to follow is going to be the saga of 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.780
 the seven kingdoms this is the first the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.580
 king demon I also have the second one already 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.080
 the exiled queen are 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.720
 books the third one is also in 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.240
 Spanish and in ebook format I liked it 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.330
 a lot of fantasy and in jet world of 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.100
 susanne and I learned recently that a 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.750
 saga of six books I thought it was a 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.400
 trilogy and that I've thrown myself a bit to 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.670
 back but the truth is that it has 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.980
 liked it a lot and I think I will continue 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.299
 with her 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.780
 of course game of thrones occasion of 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:38.270
 ice and fire I have three this storm 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.450
 of swords which is the third 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.300
 and clash of kings all of george rr 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.420
 Martin those three assured this one yes that 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.940
 I read them this year but the fourth and the 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.490
 fifth 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.590
 and so it came I'll ask my cousin and if 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.720
 I will not ask for it for kings 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.850
 probably 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.880
 one of the ones that I started last year and 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.700
 I wanted to continue with her but still 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.550
 I do not have the other two books is heart 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.520
 of fire of death has already left recently 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.340
 the third is a pity that it is not in 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.400
 none 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.000
 is a dystopia is great one of the 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.970
 best books that I saw myself last year 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.820
 by the way if you are interested is 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.550

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:29.540
 salt in spanish yes friends 6 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.700

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.670

 good when I say pro doctor to the best 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.310
 at this moment I have a lot of desire and 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.560
 before now I thought that next year 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.750
 they were going to take out winter that is going to be the 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.080
 last and fourth book of the saga and goes 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.240
 there to take another 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.170
 or whatever it is that he was not 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.360
 planned voucher has been in surprise plan 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:02.390
 so the last book in the saga does not 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.390
 we're going to have until 2016 or over there 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:09.400

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.210

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.910
 trilogy in Spanish 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.100
 this book I have to be prepared and 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.350
 mentalized and I also want to reread it 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.170
 before putting me with the other two that 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:26.630

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.630
 of books that I'm going to ask for Christmas
