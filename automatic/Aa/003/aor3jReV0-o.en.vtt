00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.210 

let's<00:00:00.780> talk<00:00:01.050> today<00:00:01.230> about<00:00:01.350> winter<00:00:01.860> feeding

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
let's talk today about winter feeding

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.360 
let's talk today about winter feeding
our<00:00:02.340> bees<00:00:02.629> in<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.870> northern<00:00:04.259> climates<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:05.190> live

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
our bees in the northern climates I live

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.740 
our bees in the northern climates I live
in<00:00:05.490> Utah<00:00:05.990> and<00:00:06.990> so<00:00:07.820> the<00:00:08.820> winter<00:00:09.179> months<00:00:09.510> are

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
in Utah and so the winter months are

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.580 
in Utah and so the winter months are
fairly<00:00:10.200> cold<00:00:10.940> there<00:00:11.940> are<00:00:12.179> periods<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.349> time

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
fairly cold there are periods of time

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.259 
fairly cold there are periods of time
when<00:00:13.830> we'll<00:00:14.040> go<00:00:14.370> for<00:00:14.610> several<00:00:14.820> weeks<00:00:14.969> the

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
when we'll go for several weeks the

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.900 
when we'll go for several weeks the
temperature<00:00:16.170> never<00:00:16.320> gets<00:00:16.619> much<00:00:17.580> above

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
temperature never gets much above

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.640 
temperature never gets much above
freezing

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
freezing

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.410 
freezing
when<00:00:19.650> we've<00:00:19.770> got<00:00:19.800> bees<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.760> bed<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.119> winter

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
when we've got bees to bed in the winter

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.859 
when we've got bees to bed in the winter
we<00:00:22.109> try<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.350> have<00:00:22.529> enough<00:00:22.800> stores<00:00:23.490> for<00:00:23.850> them<00:00:24.000> to

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
we try to have enough stores for them to

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.929 
we try to have enough stores for them to
last<00:00:25.140> through<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.800> winter<00:00:25.980> until<00:00:26.550> spring

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
last through the winter until spring

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.480 
last through the winter until spring
when<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.050> hut<00:00:28.320> when<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> cluster<00:00:28.949> can<00:00:29.250> break

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
when the hut when the cluster can break

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.840 
when the hut when the cluster can break
and<00:00:29.820> they<00:00:29.939> can<00:00:30.179> get<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> outer<00:00:31.289> frames<00:00:31.850> but

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
and they can get to the outer frames but

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.240 
and they can get to the outer frames but
sometimes<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.390> doesn't<00:00:33.540> work<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.780> way<00:00:34.250> this

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
sometimes it doesn't work that way this

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.130 
sometimes it doesn't work that way this
year<00:00:35.579> we've<00:00:35.820> had<00:00:36.059> quite<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.540> few<00:00:36.690> days<00:00:36.899> where

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
year we've had quite a few days where

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.959 
year we've had quite a few days where
the<00:00:37.230> temperature<00:00:37.410> had<00:00:37.680> been<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.790> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
the temperature had been in the in the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.760 
the temperature had been in the in the
upper<00:00:39.120> 50s<00:00:39.750> which<00:00:39.960> means<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> bees<00:00:40.739> are

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
upper 50s which means that the bees are

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.400 
upper 50s which means that the bees are
active<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.640> all<00:00:42.450> they're<00:00:42.660> doing<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:42.989> eating

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
active and all they're doing is eating

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.740 
active and all they're doing is eating
they're<00:00:43.860> not<00:00:44.100> producing<00:00:45.000> anything<00:00:45.300> they're

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
they're not producing anything they're

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.590 
they're not producing anything they're
not<00:00:45.780> getting<00:00:46.260> any<00:00:46.469> nectar<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.450> most

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
not getting any nectar and so in most

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600 
not getting any nectar and so in most
conditions<00:00:49.079> sometimes<00:00:49.500> we'll<00:00:49.860> run<00:00:50.010> short<00:00:50.370> on

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
conditions sometimes we'll run short on

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.959 
conditions sometimes we'll run short on
honey<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.210> it's<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.289> terrible<00:00:52.530> shame<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.760> lose

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
honey and it's a terrible shame to lose

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.479 
honey and it's a terrible shame to lose
a<00:00:54.000> higher<00:00:54.379> because<00:00:55.379> they<00:00:55.680> run<00:00:55.860> out<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.070> stores

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
a higher because they run out of stores

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.810 
a higher because they run out of stores
the<00:00:57.420> way<00:00:57.570> bees<00:00:57.870> feed<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> winter<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.609> they

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
the way bees feed in the winter is they

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.470 
the way bees feed in the winter is they
get<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.210> cluster<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:02.000> say<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.210> four

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
get in a cluster and say it's four

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.390 
get in a cluster and say it's four
frames<00:01:03.840> wide<00:01:05.299> they<00:01:06.299> will<00:01:06.450> eat<00:01:06.659> going<00:01:07.650> up<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.340> if

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
frames wide they will eat going up so if

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.450 
frames wide they will eat going up so if
they're<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> if<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> two<00:01:09.540> box

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
they're in the if you have a two box

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.010 
they're in the if you have a two box
wintering<00:01:11.460> hive<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> bottom

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
wintering hive and then in the bottom

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.370 
wintering hive and then in the bottom
box<00:01:14.119> they<00:01:15.119> don't<00:01:15.270> start<00:01:15.479> out<00:01:15.600> down<00:01:15.840> there<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
box they don't start out down there and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.249 
box they don't start out down there and
they'll<00:01:16.860> eat<00:01:17.040> straight<00:01:17.460> up<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.110> once<00:01:19.110> they

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
they'll eat straight up and once they

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.410 
they'll eat straight up and once they
get<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.680> very<00:01:19.860> top<00:01:20.060> unless<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.270> weather

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
get to the very top unless the weather

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.899 
get to the very top unless the weather
is<00:01:21.780> warm<00:01:22.080> enough<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.650> they<00:01:23.310> can<00:01:23.580> break

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
is warm enough that they can break

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.760 
is warm enough that they can break
cluster<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.720> move<00:01:24.900> over<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.170> an<00:01:25.350> outside

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
cluster and move over to an outside

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.270 
cluster and move over to an outside
frame<00:01:26.450> those<00:01:27.450> outer<00:01:27.720> frames<00:01:28.170> will<00:01:28.710> stay<00:01:29.040> I

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
frame those outer frames will stay I

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.399 
frame those outer frames will stay I
still<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.820> honey<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.180> them<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.229> bees

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
still have honey in them and the bees

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.160 
still have honey in them and the bees
will<00:01:31.590> run<00:01:31.770> out<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.950> food<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.549> will<00:01:32.909> starve

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
will run out of food and will starve

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.429 
will run out of food and will starve
and<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:35.310> terrible<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.060> happens<00:01:36.479> one

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
and it's terrible that that happens one

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.710 
and it's terrible that that happens one
of<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> ways<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.460> try<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.180> prevent<00:01:39.479> that

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
of the ways that I try to prevent that

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.950 
of the ways that I try to prevent that
is<00:01:39.930> with<00:01:40.140> some<00:01:40.850> dry<00:01:41.850> feeding<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.570> winter

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
is with some dry feeding in the winter

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.969 
is with some dry feeding in the winter
now<00:01:43.890> I've<00:01:44.009> used<00:01:44.040> several<00:01:44.490> ways<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.979> just

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
now I've used several ways you just

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.350 
now I've used several ways you just
pouring<00:01:47.340> dry<00:01:47.549> sugar<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:49.520> on<00:01:50.520> top<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.119> inner

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
pouring dry sugar on on top of the inner

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.850 
pouring dry sugar on on top of the inner
cover<00:01:51.659> with<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> hole<00:01:52.320> where<00:01:52.590> they<00:01:52.680> could

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
cover with the hole where they could

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.690 
cover with the hole where they could
come<00:01:52.979> up<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.340> it

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
come up to it

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.429 
come up to it
I<00:01:54.350> used<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.470> candy<00:01:55.829> board<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:58.020> candy<00:01:58.290> boys

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
I used a candy board and candy boys

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.090 
I used a candy board and candy boys
worked<00:01:58.740> quite<00:01:58.950> well<00:02:00.350> this<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.619> candy<00:02:01.950> for

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
worked quite well this is a candy for

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.530 
worked quite well this is a candy for
that<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.399> made<00:02:02.610> up<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.820> couple<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.119> years<00:02:03.270> ago<00:02:03.360> and

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
that I made up a couple of years ago and

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.719 
that I made up a couple of years ago and
haven't<00:02:03.840> used<00:02:04.079> yet<00:02:04.320> but<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.070> just<00:02:05.250> take<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> piece

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
haven't used yet but I just take a piece

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.589 
haven't used yet but I just take a piece
of<00:02:06.000> 3/4<00:02:06.719> inch<00:02:07.220> quarter<00:02:08.220> inch<00:02:08.340> plywood<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
of 3/4 inch quarter inch plywood the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.390 
of 3/4 inch quarter inch plywood the
same<00:02:09.840> size<00:02:10.080> as<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.440> hive<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.979> then<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.190> put<00:02:11.370> a

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
same size as the hive and then I put a

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.190 
same size as the hive and then I put a
furring<00:02:11.849> strip<00:02:12.180> nailed<00:02:13.170> around<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.620> edge

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
furring strip nailed around the edge

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.890 
furring strip nailed around the edge
and<00:02:14.500> then<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.069> cook<00:02:15.280> up<00:02:15.430> some<00:02:15.670> sugar<00:02:15.939> with<00:02:16.689> a

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
and then I cook up some sugar with a

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.899 
and then I cook up some sugar with a
jigger<00:02:17.349> and<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.099> small<00:02:18.370> amount<00:02:18.459> of<00:02:18.670> water

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
jigger and and the small amount of water

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.750 
jigger and and the small amount of water
cook<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:19.989> soft<00:02:20.290> ball<00:02:20.560> stage<00:02:20.590> let<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.579> cool

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
cook it to a soft ball stage let it cool

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.089 
cook it to a soft ball stage let it cool
a<00:02:21.819> little<00:02:21.939> bit<00:02:22.209> and<00:02:22.569> then<00:02:22.689> pour<00:02:22.989> it<00:02:23.140> under

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
a little bit and then pour it under

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.940 
a little bit and then pour it under
there<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.579> let<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.090> set<00:02:25.450> up<00:02:25.769> it<00:02:26.769> always

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
there and let it set up it always

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.089 
there and let it set up it always

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
granulates no matter what I do so I

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.380 
granulates no matter what I do so I
don't<00:02:30.340> worry<00:02:30.459> about<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.760> beast<00:02:30.970> could<00:02:31.150> still

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
don't worry about it beast could still

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.069 
don't worry about it beast could still
take<00:02:31.599> care<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.989> it<00:02:33.299> then<00:02:34.299> what<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.629> do<00:02:34.780> here<00:02:35.049> is

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
take care of it then what you do here is

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.920 
take care of it then what you do here is
did<00:02:35.319> for<00:02:35.560> this<00:02:35.769> on<00:02:36.340> top<00:02:36.549> of<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.790> hive<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.750> when

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
did for this on top of the hive and when

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.170 
did for this on top of the hive and when
the<00:02:38.019> bees<00:02:38.230> get<00:02:38.409> up<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.799> it<00:02:38.920> then<00:02:39.790> they<00:02:39.939> will<00:02:40.060> eat

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
the bees get up to it then they will eat

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.670 
the bees get up to it then they will eat
it<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.510> they'll<00:02:40.599> eat<00:02:40.840> an<00:02:40.959> area<00:02:41.290> in<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.620> middle

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
it and they'll eat an area in the middle

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.920 
it and they'll eat an area in the middle
like<00:02:42.459> this<00:02:42.489> they<00:02:42.879> usually<00:02:43.030> leave<00:02:43.359> the<00:02:43.510> corners

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
like this they usually leave the corners

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.710 
like this they usually leave the corners
and<00:02:44.650> so<00:02:44.859> that's<00:02:45.099> that's<00:02:45.909> kind<00:02:46.120> of<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.269> waste<00:02:46.450> on

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
and so that's that's kind of a waste on

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.550 
and so that's that's kind of a waste on
there<00:02:47.909> there<00:02:48.909> are<00:02:49.030> some<00:02:49.329> people<00:02:50.079> who<00:02:50.260> will<00:02:50.349> put

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
there there are some people who will put

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.750 
there there are some people who will put
some<00:02:50.769> essential<00:02:51.310> oils<00:02:51.700> or<00:02:53.129> mix<00:02:54.129> a<00:02:54.250> little<00:02:54.489> dry

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
some essential oils or mix a little dry

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.379 
some essential oils or mix a little dry
Paul<00:02:55.629> substitute<00:02:56.379> in<00:02:56.500> with<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:56.829> I<00:02:57.060> never<00:02:58.060> have

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
Paul substitute in with it I never have

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.110 
Paul substitute in with it I never have
my<00:02:58.799> thinking<00:02:59.799> on<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.099> is<00:03:00.310> if<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.760> bees<00:03:00.939> are

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
my thinking on it is if the bees are

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.170 
my thinking on it is if the bees are
eating<00:03:01.329> their<00:03:01.510> natural<00:03:01.989> honey<00:03:02.889> in<00:03:03.189> the<00:03:03.970> hive

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
eating their natural honey in the hive

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.420 
eating their natural honey in the hive
there's<00:03:04.599> nothing<00:03:04.989> natural<00:03:05.079> honey<00:03:05.470> there's<00:03:06.250> no

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
there's nothing natural honey there's no

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.670 
there's nothing natural honey there's no
pollen<00:03:06.879> that<00:03:06.909> mixed<00:03:07.269> in<00:03:07.420> with<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.599> and<00:03:08.049> they

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
pollen that mixed in with that and they

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.679 
pollen that mixed in with that and they
get<00:03:08.829> along<00:03:09.010> just<00:03:09.069> fine<00:03:09.400> on<00:03:09.579> it<00:03:09.939> when<00:03:10.569> I've

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
get along just fine on it when I've

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.429 
get along just fine on it when I've
tried<00:03:10.959> to<00:03:11.079> give<00:03:11.260> them<00:03:11.349> some<00:03:12.389> palm<00:03:13.389> before<00:03:13.659> they

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
tried to give them some palm before they

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.679 
tried to give them some palm before they
easily<00:03:14.650> don't<00:03:14.950> take<00:03:15.159> it<00:03:15.340> we<00:03:15.489> have<00:03:15.639> a<00:03:15.689> great

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689 
easily don't take it we have a great

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.129 
easily don't take it we have a great
source<00:03:17.049> of<00:03:17.609> pollen<00:03:18.609> in<00:03:18.879> our<00:03:19.030> area<00:03:19.299> from<00:03:19.750> spring

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
source of pollen in our area from spring

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.539 
source of pollen in our area from spring
early<00:03:20.919> spring<00:03:21.250> it's<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.519> late<00:03:21.730> fall<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:24.310> that's

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
early spring it's a late fall so that's

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.990 
early spring it's a late fall so that's
that's<00:03:24.970> one<00:03:25.239> method<00:03:25.449> that<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:26.109> can<00:03:26.260> use<00:03:26.470> a

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
that's one method that you can use a

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.990 
that's one method that you can use a
method<00:03:28.000> that<00:03:28.120> I<00:03:28.680> have<00:03:29.680> used<00:03:29.829> in<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.159> past<00:03:30.430> it

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
method that I have used in the past it

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.710 
method that I have used in the past it
was<00:03:31.150> right

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
was right

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.599 
was right
I<00:03:31.750> made<00:03:32.319> these<00:03:32.500> boxes<00:03:35.040> just<00:03:36.040> three-quarter

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
I made these boxes just three-quarter

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.500 
I made these boxes just three-quarter
inch<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.319> about<00:03:38.319> four<00:03:38.889> inches<00:03:39.159> high<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.730> drill

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
inch and about four inches high a drill

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.240 
inch and about four inches high a drill

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
hole in the front and the bottom for

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.909 
hole in the front and the bottom for
ventilation<00:03:42.669> and<00:03:43.090> for<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.049> bees<00:03:44.199> to<00:03:44.379> use<00:03:44.620> and

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
ventilation and for the bees to use and

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.300 
ventilation and for the bees to use and
then<00:03:45.400> on<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.609> bottom<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:46.180> attacked<00:03:47.139> a<00:03:47.470> plastic

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
then on the bottom I attacked a plastic

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.569 
then on the bottom I attacked a plastic
queen<00:03:48.579> excluder<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:50.530> what<00:03:51.129> I've<00:03:51.250> done<00:03:51.370> in<00:03:51.489> the

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
queen excluder and what I've done in the

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.129 
queen excluder and what I've done in the
past<00:03:51.760> is<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.150> take<00:03:52.389> a<00:03:52.419> piece<00:03:52.690> of<00:03:52.720> parchment

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
past is you take a piece of parchment

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.099 
past is you take a piece of parchment
paper<00:03:53.579> lay<00:03:54.579> it<00:03:54.639> down<00:03:54.729> here<00:03:54.909> and<00:03:55.419> then<00:03:55.810> pour

it and sit that it right on top of the
cluster<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.389> then<00:04:01.569> put<00:04:01.870> your<00:04:02.159> your<00:04:03.159> cover

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
cluster and then put your your cover

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.409 
cluster and then put your your cover
over<00:04:03.909> the<00:04:03.940> top<00:04:04.739> our<00:04:05.739> climate<00:04:06.340> is<00:04:06.579> dry<00:04:07.269> enough

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
over the top our climate is dry enough

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.559 
over the top our climate is dry enough
here<00:04:07.870> that<00:04:08.109> that<00:04:08.620> sugar<00:04:09.060> doesn't<00:04:10.060> really<00:04:10.239> set

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
here that that sugar doesn't really set

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.379 
here that that sugar doesn't really set
up<00:04:10.750> it'll<00:04:11.319> get<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.500> crust<00:04:11.799> on<00:04:11.979> the<00:04:12.159> outside<00:04:12.639> but

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
up it'll get a crust on the outside but

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.000 
up it'll get a crust on the outside but
I<00:04:13.449> found<00:04:13.690> that<00:04:13.900> what<00:04:14.019> happens<00:04:14.470> as<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.829> bees

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
I found that what happens as the bees

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.250 
I found that what happens as the bees
are<00:04:15.220> eating<00:04:15.489> up<00:04:15.609> through<00:04:15.819> the<00:04:15.909> bottom<00:04:16.260> they'll

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
are eating up through the bottom they'll

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.140 
are eating up through the bottom they'll
get<00:04:17.530> into<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:17.889> sugar<00:04:18.159> where<00:04:18.459> it<00:04:18.579> hasn't<00:04:18.849> been

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
get into the sugar where it hasn't been

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.899 
get into the sugar where it hasn't been
set<00:04:20.139> up<00:04:20.169> and<00:04:20.560> it'll<00:04:21.190> just<00:04:21.370> drain<00:04:21.669> it<00:04:21.699> out

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:21.909 
set up and it'll just drain it out

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:23.940 
set up and it'll just drain it out
through<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:22.900> so<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.110> lose<00:04:23.380> quite<00:04:23.650> a<00:04:23.710> bit<00:04:23.860> of

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
through and so I lose quite a bit of

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.640 
through and so I lose quite a bit of
sugar<00:04:24.190> that<00:04:24.400> come

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
sugar that come

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.460 
sugar that come
I<00:04:24.710> mix<00:04:25.190> a<00:04:25.310> mess<00:04:25.580> I'll<00:04:26.419> even<00:04:26.630> get<00:04:26.930> sometimes<00:04:27.169> a

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
I mix a mess I'll even get sometimes a

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.780 
I mix a mess I'll even get sometimes a
couple<00:04:27.740> inches<00:04:27.860> of<00:04:28.040> sugar<00:04:28.340> down<00:04:28.580> on<00:04:28.699> the

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
couple inches of sugar down on the

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.150 
couple inches of sugar down on the
bottom<00:04:29.150> board<00:04:29.300> so<00:04:30.199> what<00:04:30.350> I've<00:04:30.470> gone<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:30.919> from

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
bottom board so what I've gone to from

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.590 
bottom board so what I've gone to from
that<00:04:31.340> is<00:04:31.669> to<00:04:33.190> moisten<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.460> sugar<00:04:34.729> and<00:04:35.000> then

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
that is to moisten the sugar and then

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.080 
that is to moisten the sugar and then
just<00:04:35.840> make<00:04:35.990> a<00:04:36.020> big<00:04:36.259> sugar<00:04:36.500> patty<00:04:36.889> that<00:04:37.759> I<00:04:37.789> put

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
just make a big sugar patty that I put

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.629 
just make a big sugar patty that I put
on<00:04:38.120> there<00:04:38.389> put<00:04:39.080> it<00:04:39.169> on<00:04:39.259> the<00:04:39.440> hive<00:04:39.650> and<00:04:39.949> it<00:04:40.460> works

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
on there put it on the hive and it works

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.670 
on there put it on the hive and it works
great<00:04:40.880> for<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.210> bees<00:04:41.389> and<00:04:42.199> here's<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.530> way<00:04:42.650> I

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
great for the bees and here's the way I

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:52.060 
great for the bees and here's the way I
do<00:04:42.830> that<00:04:43.160> I<00:04:49.090> make<00:04:50.090> it<00:04:50.240> out<00:04:50.530> just<00:04:51.530> granulated

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
do that I make it out just granulated

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.189 
do that I make it out just granulated
sugar<00:04:52.100> and<00:04:52.610> a<00:04:53.300> ratio<00:04:53.539> of<00:04:54.370> 1<00:04:55.570> 1<00:04:56.570> cup<00:04:56.840> of<00:04:56.870> water

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
sugar and a ratio of 1 1 cup of water

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.680 
sugar and a ratio of 1 1 cup of water
for<00:04:57.500> every<00:04:57.710> 5<00:04:58.039> pounds<00:04:58.400> of<00:04:58.490> sugar<00:04:58.669> so<00:04:59.449> I<00:04:59.479> don't

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
for every 5 pounds of sugar so I don't

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.710 
for every 5 pounds of sugar so I don't
do<00:04:59.810> 25<00:05:00.320> pounds<00:05:00.889> here<00:05:01.190> so<00:05:01.760> I've<00:05:01.880> got<00:05:02.030> 5<00:05:02.240> cups<00:05:02.570> of

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
do 25 pounds here so I've got 5 cups of

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.320 
do 25 pounds here so I've got 5 cups of
water<00:05:02.900> measured<00:05:03.320> out<00:05:04.030> I'll<00:05:05.030> put<00:05:05.210> a<00:05:05.240> little

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
water measured out I'll put a little

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.840 
water measured out I'll put a little
water<00:05:05.539> in<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:05.840> bottom<00:05:09.430> and<00:05:10.430> then<00:05:10.550> we<00:05:10.699> just

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
water in the bottom and then we just

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:23.800 
water in the bottom and then we just
pour<00:05:11.030> a<00:05:11.090> little<00:05:11.150> sugar

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.560 

people<00:05:24.810> it'll<00:05:24.930> stir<00:05:25.230> with<00:05:25.380> a<00:05:25.500> spoon<00:05:26.570> there's

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
people it'll stir with a spoon there's

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.780 
people it'll stir with a spoon there's
not<00:05:27.750> a<00:05:27.780> big<00:05:27.990> deal<00:05:28.230> on<00:05:28.440> this<00:05:28.590> story<00:05:28.950> it<00:05:29.490> just

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
not a big deal on this story it just

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.270

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
gets more Singh lettuce in a few minutes

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.610 
gets more Singh lettuce in a few minutes
it'll<00:05:32.400> come<00:05:32.670> firm<00:05:33.570> up<00:05:33.750> on<00:05:33.930> its<00:05:34.110> own

made up with the sugar and water this is

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.470 
made up with the sugar and water this is
an<00:06:16.170> easy<00:06:16.410> way<00:06:16.650> to<00:06:16.680> feed<00:06:17.180> it's<00:06:18.180> a<00:06:18.270> great
