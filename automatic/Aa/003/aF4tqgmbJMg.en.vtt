00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.720
 Now I'll talk a little about the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.500
 possibility of setting the timbres 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.310
 huh 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.130
 so we have three positions the first 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:38.450
 you get a sound is more installed 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:38.450
 clean otoni and open volume 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:01:00.610
 the second option is now with the volume 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:01:02.980
 all open and the key all closed 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.330
 so you get an ideal sound to 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.330
 bossa nova samba 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:46.950
 the third position adjustment option 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:49.680
 with the whole tone closed and the volume 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.410
 a little low 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.000
 so you get a sound for jec's good 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.000
 similar to guitar and semi-acoustic
