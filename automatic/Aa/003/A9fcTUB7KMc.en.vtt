was<00:04:16.000> because<00:04:16.360> it<00:04:16.630> can<00:04:16.750> also<00:04:16.959> go<00:04:17.320> on<00:04:17.500> cheers<00:04:18.040> not

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
was because it can also go on cheers not

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.070 
was because it can also go on cheers not
a<00:04:18.670> lot<00:04:18.850> of<00:04:18.880> people<00:04:18.970> know<00:04:19.299> that<00:04:19.330> I<00:04:19.540> don't<00:04:19.660> think

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080
