that big of a deal outside on concrete

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.859 
that big of a deal outside on concrete
would<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.850> know<00:02:01.939> sometimes<00:02:02.270> even<00:02:02.450> hard<00:02:02.659> grass

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
would you know sometimes even hard grass

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.990 
would you know sometimes even hard grass
and<00:02:03.080> soil<00:02:03.200> that's<00:02:04.100> not<00:02:04.460> going<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.700> feel<00:02:04.819> good

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
and soil that's not going to feel good

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.730 
and soil that's not going to feel good
so<00:02:05.450> it's<00:02:05.569> very<00:02:05.720> important<00:02:06.289> as<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.500> step

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
so it's very important as you step

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.100 
so it's very important as you step

guys<00:02:19.459> one<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.880> reasons<00:02:20.150> this<00:02:20.239> is<00:02:20.299> known<00:02:20.569> as

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
guys one of the reasons this is known as

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.990 
guys one of the reasons this is known as
a<00:02:20.750> safety<00:02:21.410> rule<00:02:21.709> is<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.250> there<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.610> save<00:02:22.970> you

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
a safety rule is it is there to save you

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.910 
a safety rule is it is there to save you
so<00:02:23.690> this<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:23.900> not<00:02:24.110> just<00:02:24.290> for<00:02:24.319> when<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.620> jump

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
so this is not just for when you jump

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.320 
so this is not just for when you jump
down<00:02:24.950> off<00:02:25.310> things<00:02:25.489> this<00:02:25.580> is<00:02:25.700> also<00:02:25.819> for<00:02:26.060> hearing

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
down off things this is also for hearing

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.059 
down off things this is also for hearing
tricks<00:02:26.630> if<00:02:27.019> i<00:02:27.080> start<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:27.410> do<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.530> front<00:02:27.769> flip<00:02:27.799> and
