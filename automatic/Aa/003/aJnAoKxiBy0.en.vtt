00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
then come back so I don't know I I

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.379 
then come back so I don't know I I
really<00:04:27.280> wanted<00:04:27.520> to<00:04:27.639> get<00:04:27.759> him<00:04:27.969> from<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.240> last

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:31.719 
through two three and four and I thought

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:32.909 
through two three and four and I thought
I<00:04:31.780> could<00:04:31.960> just<00:04:32.080> get<00:04:32.199> him<00:04:32.349> to<00:04:32.500> five<00:04:32.680> but

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.980 
I could just get him to five but
unfortunately<00:04:33.879> came<00:04:34.000> across<00:04:34.240> a<00:04:34.449> lap<00:04:34.750> rider
