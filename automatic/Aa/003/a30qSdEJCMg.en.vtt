00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello and welcome to hardware advice 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.770
 read video the technology news of 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.110
 calendar week 38 2014 nvidia brings 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.630
 finally your maxwell graphics cards out 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:18.000
 since friday you can officially get the gtx 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:21.990
 980 970 buy the gtx 89 has 2000 48 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.910
 shader units and the gtx 970 1664 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.320
 Shader units that sounds in the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.510
 compared to keppler less 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.429
 However, Nvidia took with max or 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.009
 architecture significantly more power per 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.880
 shader out both cards feature 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.000
 4 GB of gddr5 memory over a 256 bit 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.040
 interface is connected and 3506 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.719
 megahertz fast is performance-related 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.620
 seen are the cards off and not 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.260
 really better 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.770
 the gtx 980 is only slightly stronger than 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.910
 the gtx 280 ce and the gtx 970 so 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.649
 between the r9 290 and gtx 87 de was 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.469
 but it has really improved a lot 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.309
 The power consumption of the GTX 980 has one 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.790
 tdp of just 1 165 watts the gtx 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.340
 970 a tdp of 145 watts 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.070
 that is now nvidia amd by lengths 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.170
 what he is still doing at the gtx 970 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.810
 hamburg rasse is the price she is from 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.689
 To get 310 euros so make it 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.110
 In my opinion, none in 1990 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.500
 to buy because you buy a gtx 970 yes 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.330
 can 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.390
 but I think he already has it 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.700
 reacts because the r 9 290 has been around 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.780
 Thursdays from 280 euros 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.310
 however that is 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.729
 value for money with it always 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.880
 even worse than the gtx 970 the gtx 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.070
 980 is actually too expensive with 510 euro 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.740
 You pay for 18 to 25 percent 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.290
 more power compared to the gtx 970 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.090
 fabulous 67 more 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.119
 this card is part of the luxury area 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.250
 So I think with pcs from 1500 euro 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.350
 about either originally wanted 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.320
 bring out the cards in 20 nanometers 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.520
 instead of the 28 nanometer what would be then 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.799
 probably for an energy consumption 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.719
 maybe only 100 came out 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.180
 watt is no matter max but welcome 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.360
 again in 20 or 16 nanometers 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.090
 My conclusion so far 6 980 is not now 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.180
 so the brÃ¼ller but the gtx 970 is 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.689
 just awesome 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.909
 Ingenious processors could already 2017 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.879
 only seven nanometers have this 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:23.920
 in any case, the plan of the company sms ml 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.989
 builds exposure machines for processor 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.280
 position among others is intel and 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.900
 tsmc with him customer 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.510
 this is possible with a technology 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.849
 called iv lithography intel itself 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.159
 also experiment with ev lithography 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.109
 machines, however, still in 14 and 10 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.849
 naked area intel wants but 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.739
 really just experiment with it 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.810
 Processors will be in the shops 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.239
 structure width with these methods never 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.129
 Intels processors are coming onto the market 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.109
 that will come out soon, yes 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.510
 classic in the 14 nanometer with 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.579
 emissions level graffy produced though 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.349
 proves that Moore's Law is not 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.000
 more so with the one and a half 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.430
 years but the progress remains 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.129
 at least not stand 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.069
 amd is not going to be 1985 iks 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.950
 Bring the 285 again is equal 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.989
 However wdr 1980 has a better one 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.650
 power consumption this is due to a new one 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:17.739
 gpu the tonga, however , he should 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.629
 1985 to replace iks ddr 980x 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.459
 but do not appear I guess 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.340
 that one would rather wait for it 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.079
 in medias dx900 comes out because 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.879
 He will directly compete with the card 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.099
 but it can also be that 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.470
 the one at a similar gpu like the one 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.540
 Tonga fiddles because the Tonga has more 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.669
 performance per watt as your predecessor 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.650
 So it can be that amd one 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.780
 new high end map on Tonga base 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.979
 wants to bring out 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.009
 microsoft buys the minecraft developer 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:46.810
 office mojang whole two and a half billion 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:48.310
 you pay us dollars for this 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.409
 Of course that's what I'm thinking 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.000
 The game Minecraft mainly loud 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.069
 microsoft should be the player of the 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.019
 Acquisition only benefit the worlds 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.819
 but it gets faster and bigger 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.379
 should give new tools and more 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.599
 interaction possibilities between 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.699
 each other the founder notch has to 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.659
 that meant everything to him 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:05.739
 was too big 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.569
 he does not want to continue the 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.489
 responsibility for such a successful one 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.769
 Business carry the bulk of 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.590
 developers stay there as the founders person 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.479
 moni and porsche will be with a full 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.000
 bank account leave the company now 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.560
 Microsoft has confirmed that minecraft 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.719
 as so far continued and 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.279
 is developed further 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:26.020
 what also with the technology becomes this 

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:26.810
 week when the livestock failed 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.490
 against a tree 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.350
 high if you want to load an abo da 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.350
 then until the next video
