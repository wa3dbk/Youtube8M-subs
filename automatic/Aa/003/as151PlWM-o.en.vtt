00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.400
Well, we gathered in a stack,
All our fears and doubts

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.701
So I can burn it all to hell

00:00:06.702 --> 00:00:09.302
Well, I go to the center
the fucking Coliseum

00:00:10.203 --> 00:00:12.103
I have torch and gasoline canister in my hands

00:00:12.104 --> 00:00:14.804
In front of me crowd of naked people
crammed on the walls

00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:16.605
I'm in the middle of events
as you can see

00:00:16.606 --> 00:00:19.156
Besides I myself also
an event...

00:00:19.157 --> 00:00:19.800
oh yes ...

00:00:19.805 --> 00:00:21.000
... I created me ...

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:22.800
I imposed myself at everything...

00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:23.801
Do you understand what I’m talking about?

00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:25.102
Weird ...

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.103
I am, I exist

00:00:28.804 --> 00:00:30.604
I exist in reality

00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:34.100
I can think I am completely
freed from the stereotypes

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:35.101
oh yes ...

00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:37.802
My world is potentials without borders

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:41.000
where there no daily
food of standard lethargy

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.001
It has no standard expressions and slogans ...

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:46.500
imposed by the government

00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:49.800
by your stupid-box
or by your beloved internet

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.801
This is me

00:00:53.802 --> 00:00:54.802
Here I am, real

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.400
While you, staring at the screen
of your Computer...

00:00:57.401 --> 00:00:58.401
... But are you there;

00:00:58.402 --> 00:00:59.000
Hey ...

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:00.000
... Hello ...

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:02.100
But you can prove me?

00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:04.101
As you can see ....

00:01:05.102 --> 00:01:07.102
... You do not exist ...
but I'm exist...

00:01:09.103 --> 00:01:10.400
I always have something to say ...

00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:11.600
And you, what you can say;

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:12.601
Think about it ...

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.300
- ...............................

00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:15.700
- What a loathing?! or

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.700
-Darling, I must go to the toilet ...

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:20.500
But you sitting in shithole and write to your girlfriend SMS
or, sorry for the expression, jerking off ...

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.501
Your life is one big lie ...

00:01:22.502 --> 00:01:26.100
Porn ... everyday reality ... Internet
dependence and subordination to mobile

00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:27.300
Why? Am I wrong?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Well ... tell me, have you've ever
did something real

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:41.700
NEVER ...

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:42.950
And you can’t ...
You know why?

00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:46.950
Because all these things are far behind
the limits of your comfort

00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:48.600
you are packed in these

00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:51.400
as a plastic bag

00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:52.900
and pieces of meat!

00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:55.901
Crowded in the narrow context
of everyday life and work

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Next please!

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.800
Am I wrong?

00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:01.801
Maybe I don’t  know?

00:02:01.802 --> 00:02:02.802
Correct me ...

00:02:02.803 --> 00:02:05.500
Let's say ... can you give your mobile to
the first man you meet on the street? E?

00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:07.050
Tricky question...

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.400
Or can you right now
format the windows on your computer

00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:13.800
What? Are you afraid?

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.400
And you know why you
wouldn’t do that?

00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:19.000
Because it’s equivalent to suicide

00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:22.200
You don’t exist without all this

00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:26.600
Generally speaking, have you ever did anything
by yourself?!

00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:28.601
Followed your own decision?!

00:02:28.602 --> 00:02:31.000
Didn’t waste your time waiting for orders ...

00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:32.500
JUST DO IT ?!!!!!! E ?!!!!

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.000
So it proves ....
That I'm real

00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:40.000
And you're just an early fruit
of someone’s  fantasy

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.300
Nobody  painted you yet

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.200
And you should try very hard
to prove yourself the opposite

00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:50.500
To have the chance
to be called alive

00:02:50.501 --> 00:02:53.200
The important thing ....
This is not a toy ...

00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:54.201
... It is ..............
