00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.880
 I noticed from television services 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.380
 who has rediscovered the taste of 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.649
 free destruction 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.570
 I recovered this should not be 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:31.119
 the police to investigate do not have i 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.619
 means to analyze it should be based 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.360
 that would give him what for now is one 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.430
 tool for someone else is a weapon e 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.230
 his imagination maybe and then what it is 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.059
 that does not turn into a weapon enough 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.040
 others of the police were not catching them 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.899
 maybe he would have done it if it were not 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.579
 appeared gods to show that 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.440
 derive if I had more strength there is no strength 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.089
 he was chased by an army of 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.489
 cops with lots of nice toys 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.410
 new fox but how will it go when it has 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.359
 in front of him that will make you fight with 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.640
 more strength as always is a look at it 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.690
 his speed his ferocity his 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.570
 training 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.449
 I see in him the power of faith I see 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.670
 a sect of shadows that you rise again 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.110
 said he was excommunicated from home 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.179
 album who commands her ra's al ghul was the 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.110
 sect of shadows and I defeated him well 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:17.020
 I'm a mercenary 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.350
 we have to find out what's on his mind 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.119
 stock exchanges in codes and mine 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.149

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.700
 selina kyle brings the fox can hunt the 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.899
 code tell us 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.899
 on which actions they operated 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:39.290
 I'll bring this Mr. Fox but nothing 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.510
 the more I sewed them up 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.880
 bones but I don't want to know 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.420
 I buried too many members of the 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.130
 wayne family you can let me see you 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.080
 only an end to his journey 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.420
 leave and the only means I have for 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.880
 open the eyes 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.720
 she is no longer batman must find 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.180
 another way 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.220
 once he wanted to end it talked about 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.500
 a life outside that cave has 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.360
 hurry and cell died knowing that 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.890
 we had decided to stay together that 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.440
 it was my life outside the cave now 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.280
 I can't start again 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.590
 she didn't do it couldn't and if 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.100
 if he could she can no longer be like that 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.920
 that's enough 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.630
 and if he had written one before he died 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.890
 letter in which he said he had chosen 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.890
 harvey dent and not her 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:39.830
 and if then to spare them the pain 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:43.700
 I burned that letter like you dare 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:47.870
 use rachel to try to stop me 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.880
 I'm using the veritas on the net maybe 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.170
 we should all stop hiding the 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.170
 truth and openly declare it 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:01.910
 i'm sorry you mind i think later 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.190
 that you destroyed my world I can 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:09.230
 even shake your hand 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:12.980
 no no no i know what this means 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.530
 means means his hatred e 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.750
 it also means losing a person who 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.190
 I loved and looked after from day one 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:26.650
 I heard his cries echo 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:31.700
 in this house but it can also mean 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:34.000
 save his life and that's the thing 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.000
 more important 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.270
 goodbye hurry
