00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 well hello everyone with you again DJ 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.640
 baby online and again we program 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.770
 traktor pro 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.599
 talk about such a function today as 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.799
 autoplay your 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.389
 tracks that is, without your participation tracks 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.740
 will automatically load and and 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.109
 reduced by simply replacing the channels 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.699
 so so since frequencies this program 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.189
 the estate works automatically only 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.510
 There is a channel replacement how it works 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.359
 I'll show you now 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.450
 and use this feature by you or 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.790
 I do not have to solve only to you personally tell their 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.510
 I do not use opinion because I think that 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.579
 better still cook yourself but there are 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.670
 situations that you need such a program 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.600
 for you is one or a pair of tracks 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.870
 let's see how this feature 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.239
 works for starters go to the playlist 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:01:00.300
 create a new playlist 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:02.460
 let's call it 123 okay we see a playlist in 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.280
 this playlist we can drag the tracks 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.210
 you can go the other way i 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.189
 most often use 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.979
 go and in your collection of tracks well to 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:16.680
 for example. so far choose July 2013 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:20.549
 right- click and import the folder 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.189
 as a playlist we import and we see that 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.400
 there was her 2013 folder here it is 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.240
 appeared in our playlist now 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:35.990
 sort by key further go to 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:39.210
 construction site necessarily in the mixer tab 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.400
 one more crossfader tab here 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.310
 we see the value that is which time 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.259
 we will become ie we set a minute 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.930
 the end of the minute will occur 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.090
 Replacing a track from one to another is easy 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.299
 by replacing the channels you can supply 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.950
 any value can 30 seconds can 10 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:01.259
 seconds can feel maximum 100 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.590
 seconds choose any value let's 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.590
 let's see how it works 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.590
 load 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:23.590
 track first track scalper lose it 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.530
 Select the channel and here is the upper right corner 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.799
 we see this icon automatically 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.640
 play the next track and dump 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:35.260
 its channel setup click immediately a 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:43.450
 the next track is loading 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:47.489
 deck b is just our sings and 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.489
 ending let's see from intrigue 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.000
 Now it will be a countdown 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:03:01.239
 ended exactly a minute left for 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:06.810
 information all automatically launched on 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:09.459
 the next step and went channel replacement i 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:39.700
 absolutely do not do anything program all 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:41.470
 does everything for me and which country 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.480
 then spin the next track i.e. 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.790
 he will subscribe all the tracks will pass 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.609
 which is you playlist and on this 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.280
 stop here so it works 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:55.319
 function to use and or not again 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:59.910
 it's up to you personally, I don't use 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:04.510
 somehow not well, do not consider it for information 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:06.900
 let's say so that is also about no minute 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.380
 machine gunners will start the next track 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.380
 far from 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:41.940
 right now it will be exactly the minute i 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:57.780
 because the pain behind the deck track is sitting 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:59.970
 auto channel replacement principle 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:09.990
 most everyone understands that to want 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:13.020
 next track and so in order we pour 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:16.470
 100 up to the function of the difference form on the icon 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.900
 not lit, that is, the function turned off well 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.300
 Well here is such a short video lesson 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.820
 this function 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:26.310
 only my personal opinion she does not use 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.800
 I think that well, if so happened 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.360
 what you need urgently find and fit 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.590
 time whistles the river you can't do it 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.419
 do that she will help you new 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:40.400
 Only except to bring a couple of tracks one 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:43.199
 two tracks reduce well well thank you all 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.300
 subscribe to the channel there will be more videos 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:49.590
 since so many questions come 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:52.880
 I will also touch the interface 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.050
 programs also talk about settings 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.560
 feature will affect all settings 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.330
 programs what each item means because 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.659
 What exactly is the most settings? 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.270
 questions come and we will analyze 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:08.360
 wait for the following 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:13.210
 reviews on this program 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.210
 thank you all see you soon
