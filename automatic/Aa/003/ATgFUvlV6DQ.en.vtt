his legendary status and the fact that
it<00:04:20.160> looks<00:04:20.489> so<00:04:20.760> cool<00:04:21.090> it'd<00:04:21.510> be<00:04:21.959> nice<00:04:22.169> if<00:04:22.410> it<00:04:22.830> was

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.679 
should be separated you know just
because<00:04:44.250> people<00:04:44.310> are<00:04:44.639> abusing<00:04:45.150> auto<00:04:45.300> rifles

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
to nerf them in PvE which is what Bungie

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.390 
to nerf them in PvE which is what Bungie

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
PvP but a nerf in general was arguably

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.300 
PvP but a nerf in general was arguably
unnecessary<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.590> fact<00:05:13.830> that<00:05:13.919> people<00:05:14.129> were

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
unnecessary the fact that people were

unnecessary the fact that people were

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
getting killed by auto rifles in PvP is

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.950 
getting killed by auto rifles in PvP is
just<00:05:17.460> because<00:05:17.819> they<00:05:18.030> were<00:05:18.090> common

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
them is much higher so of course you're

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.070 
them is much higher so of course you're
gonna<00:05:40.650> get<00:05:40.830> killed<00:05:41.129> by<00:05:41.340> auto<00:05:41.520> rifles<00:05:42.000> a<00:05:42.210> lot<00:05:42.810> in

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
gonna get killed by auto rifles a lot in

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.430 
gonna get killed by auto rifles a lot in
PvP<00:05:43.830> that's<00:05:44.699> just<00:05:44.879> because<00:05:44.969> people<00:05:45.360> are<00:05:46.050> using

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
PvP that's just because people are using

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.140 
PvP that's just because people are using
them<00:05:46.589> the<00:05:46.979> best<00:05:47.190> example<00:05:47.520> I<00:05:47.550> can<00:05:47.699> give<00:05:47.819> is<00:05:47.879> in

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
them the best example I can give is in

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.670 
them the best example I can give is in
black<00:05:48.449> ops<00:05:48.750> 2<00:05:48.990> when<00:05:49.199> they<00:05:49.289> added<00:05:49.589> the

peacekeeper SMG through DLC everyone was
using<00:05:53.580> it<00:05:53.699> and<00:05:53.879> very<00:05:54.870> very<00:05:55.169> you<00:05:55.740> know<00:05:55.860> maybe

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
using it and very very you know maybe

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.579 
using it and very very you know maybe
not<00:05:56.639> the<00:05:56.729> smartest<00:05:57.300> people<00:05:57.509> we're<00:05:58.169> calling

00:05:58.579 --> 00:05:58.589 
not the smartest people we're calling

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:00.670 
not the smartest people we're calling
for<00:05:58.770> a<00:05:58.800> nerf<00:05:59.099> to<00:05:59.339> the<00:05:59.430> Peacekeeper<00:05:59.940> SMG

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
for a nerf to the Peacekeeper SMG

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.100 
for a nerf to the Peacekeeper SMG
statistically<00:06:01.680> it<00:06:01.860> was<00:06:01.979> clearly<00:06:02.430> the<00:06:03.029> worst

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
statistically it was clearly the worst

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.050 
statistically it was clearly the worst
SMG<00:06:04.110> the<00:06:04.680> only<00:06:04.919> reason<00:06:05.190> people<00:06:05.460> were<00:06:05.550> using<00:06:05.819> it

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
SMG the only reason people were using it

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.149 
SMG the only reason people were using it
is<00:06:06.240> because<00:06:07.110> they<00:06:07.289> want<00:06:07.589> use<00:06:07.770> it<00:06:07.800> because<00:06:07.979> it

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:08.159 
is because they want use it because it

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.879 
is because they want use it because it
was<00:06:08.279> a<00:06:08.310> new<00:06:08.550> gun<00:06:08.819> because<00:06:09.240> it<00:06:09.419> was<00:06:09.599> common<00:06:10.409> so

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
was a new gun because it was common so

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:12.709 
was a new gun because it was common so
you<00:06:10.979> died<00:06:11.279> a<00:06:11.310> lot<00:06:11.520> from<00:06:11.699> the<00:06:11.819> Peacekeeper<00:06:12.270> SMG

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:12.719 
you died a lot from the Peacekeeper SMG

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:15.320 
you died a lot from the Peacekeeper SMG
just<00:06:13.500> because<00:06:13.770> everyone<00:06:14.129> was<00:06:14.250> using<00:06:14.490> it<00:06:14.699> not

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
just because everyone was using it not

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.540 
just because everyone was using it not
because<00:06:15.810> it<00:06:15.990> was<00:06:16.110> good<00:06:16.469> and<00:06:16.710> the<00:06:16.949> same<00:06:17.219> as<00:06:17.400> with

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
because it was good and the same as with

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.909 
because it was good and the same as with
auto<00:06:17.789> rifles<00:06:18.210> everyone's<00:06:19.139> using<00:06:19.349> them<00:06:19.620> it

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
auto rifles everyone's using them it

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.409 
auto rifles everyone's using them it
doesn't<00:06:20.520> mean<00:06:20.639> they're<00:06:20.819> unbelievably

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
doesn't mean they're unbelievably

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:23.540 
doesn't mean they're unbelievably
overpowered<00:06:22.169> and<00:06:22.289> they<00:06:22.620> certainly<00:06:23.099> need<00:06:23.520> to

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
overpowered and they certainly need to

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.290 
overpowered and they certainly need to
be<00:06:23.669> buffed<00:06:24.120> in<00:06:24.419> PvE<00:06:25.370> so<00:06:26.370> in<00:06:26.610> summation<00:06:26.940> the

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
be buffed in PvE so in summation the

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.689 
be buffed in PvE so in summation the
wolf<00:06:27.719> Slayers<00:06:28.110> claw<00:06:28.650> is<00:06:28.949> a<00:06:29.159> very<00:06:29.460> average

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 
wolf Slayers claw is a very average

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:32.869 
wolf Slayers claw is a very average
weapon<00:06:30.690> it's<00:06:30.900> not<00:06:31.529> bad<00:06:31.949> but<00:06:32.279> it's<00:06:32.430> certainly

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:32.879 
weapon it's not bad but it's certainly

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:35.629 
weapon it's not bad but it's certainly
not<00:06:33.000> good<00:06:33.690> there's<00:06:34.169> no<00:06:34.349> factors<00:06:34.949> of<00:06:35.190> this<00:06:35.339> gun

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 
not good there's no factors of this gun

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:38.329 
not good there's no factors of this gun
that<00:06:35.849> gives<00:06:36.060> it<00:06:36.209> an<00:06:36.330> edge<00:06:36.659> in<00:06:36.899> any<00:06:37.560> way<00:06:37.860> in<00:06:38.130> fact

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:38.339 
that gives it an edge in any way in fact

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:41.839 
that gives it an edge in any way in fact
it's<00:06:38.610> one<00:06:39.000> perk<00:06:39.419> down<00:06:39.930> from<00:06:40.680> most<00:06:41.039> guns<00:06:41.430> in<00:06:41.669> the
