00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.310
 little video about the ropa de plume 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.810
 because you have been many to me 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.430
 ask what is it that I give to 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.769
 more stalled his diet 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.720
 so right now she has so much 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.539
 of plant foliage greenery 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.429
 gardens a few fruit bowls and 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.520
 fresh vegetables of course hay at will 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.160
 and a bowl of water always fresh and 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.110
 clean sometimes I 'm not so 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.000
 some vegetables here on this little 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.040
 installation so still a few 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.050
 small precisions so in the spring and 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.450
 in summer down here is the beautiful season 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.310
 she could but excuse my knotted with 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.770
 grass plants garden flowers 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.050
 it's really a nice greasy air 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.700
 good green with no treatment to 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.500
 pesticides so apart from the few 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.420
 surrounding cars she is really 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.100
 healthy and unpolluted so she has 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.600
 really like that as food is 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.950
 quite fit that's during the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.480
 beautiful season you can quite 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.519
 Here's feeding your rabbit only 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.229
 with that no need to bring back and in 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.310
 winter one so much when in the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.590
 garden there is nothing more to eat 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.450
 she hay of course before tea and 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.950

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.780
 which is really great too 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.429
 that I'm drying my own erp so 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.960
 to be really sure that this is the era 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:20.340
 from my garden that there is no 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.069
 treatment and in addition it's a lot 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.869
 tastier for more harm and prefers 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.240
 largely to saint-herblain and that's 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.710
 also significantly cheaper because the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.560
 good quality purposes still costs 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.659
 quite expensive between 3 and 5 euros 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.829
 for a package of 500 grams and 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.450

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.609

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:42.450
