with<00:01:26.640> their<00:01:26.850> neural<00:01:27.240> net<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:28.380> airplane

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
with their neural net this airplane

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.859 
with their neural net this airplane
flies<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.549> way<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.759> think<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.390> wants<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.689> fly

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
flies the way you think it wants to fly

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.230 
flies the way you think it wants to fly
it<00:01:31.229> just<00:01:31.590> goes<00:01:31.829> where<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.340> think<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.789> it<00:01:32.969> takes

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
it just goes where you think it it takes

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.999 
it just goes where you think it it takes
no<00:01:33.479> control<00:01:33.899> motion<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.619> little<00:01:34.829> bit<00:01:34.920> of

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
no control motion just a little bit of

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.980 
no control motion just a little bit of
pressure<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.939> flies<00:01:36.149> just<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.810> these

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
pressure and it flies just like these

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.679 
pressure and it flies just like these
eek<00:01:37.380> Ron's<00:01:37.649> and<00:01:38.039> so<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.460> had<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.850> painted<00:01:39.000> like

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
eek Ron's and so we had it painted like

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.020 
eek Ron's and so we had it painted like
one<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.960> those<00:01:40.079> across<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.740> was<00:01:40.920> airbrushed<00:01:41.759> by
