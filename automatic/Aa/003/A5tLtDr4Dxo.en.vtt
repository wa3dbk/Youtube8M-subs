00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.700
 to place the wing we simply place it in that entrance in the fuselage 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:19.239
 if we put the elastic bands necessary to believe 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.239
 well subject 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.050
 here we see how it looks like nothing once 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.489
 tab to the fuselage 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:31.489
 some poncho or ten elastic bands 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.300
 let's check now 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.870
 that the center of gravity of the airplane this place that corresponds to 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.570
 usually in two manuals usually claimed where it goes to the center of 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.230
 area 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.570
 anyway in this type of plane 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.640
 usually go 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.140
 in the first third of the year 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.800
 that means 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.089
 we take the measure 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.449
 from the block of the ave we divide it in three parts 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.850
 where the terminal first third that would be more or less out there 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.530
 that should go the center of gravity that tends to move presents for me 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.420
 serve as a guide 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.540
 to verify the center of gravity then 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.830
 we support the plane at the tips of your fingers 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.150
 in the tenth point the brand 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.460
 hilarion 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.860
 must be left 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.500
 balanced at that point you should not lean 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.869
 nor for ahead 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.400
 nor back 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.430
 if I did not do it if the plane crashed backwards for example 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.200
 we can try to corroborate matters a little later 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.030
 as well back and the plane without reaching the city once the armed 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.050
 of the airplane 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.620
 It is important 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.410
 check before going to fly 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.770
 again in that the center of the area 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.010
 from its correct position 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.110
 that the sense the movement of the aileron controls rudder elevator last 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.160
 towers the carburetor is the correct 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.670
 that the batteries are well charged and with 20 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.039
 I will leave the batteries of the transmitter and receiver charging 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.039
 all the night before the day you are going to fly 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.759
 and obviously 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.909
 everything is well accepted standing
