00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.650
 Something The Critics Lee Discreetly Prescribes Libya has the books you have 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.650
 just need police 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.419
 by the best Brussels parliament 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:17.699
 this is how the children learn 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.679
 the tickets for 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.999
 I am in Berlin on 2 April that they mean business 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:26.629
 and I sat for tough task and columns for good chances of it's 

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:27.869
 condition 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.189
 the novel planning erp 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.230
 the word pike dive is not in 10 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.810
 never a reason i'm working with my but to attract the farmers 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.820
 it is a kind of reservoir, also just running for the profit in the middle 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.930
 is being carried out east, so it must meet again with the police 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.100
 well i think earlier 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.140
 in the end it is a lot better to complain better than nothing 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.790
 come on 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.080
 we must always keep the three points at home here 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.899
 Christmas didn't work 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.630
 because what better a point 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.480
 it then nothing at all 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.090
 the winner was if teams had to work hard more than any week 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.040
 and 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.720
 he will be sure that this would come 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.750
 do you have to imagine how team manager sept 10 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.200
 to the old style 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.480
 Karadzic and can buy tickets such as figurines a heart for traffic 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.860
 the black cape coast around the city 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.460
 the club celebrate the feel 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.909
 years before they went to live this would be the recognizable 7 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500
 In addition, the schedule is that I have won four prizes 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.590
 it is really rob wielaert the winner was the first team 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.350
 after the better of the game 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.479
 Jenson has a lot of time to be but I think we make it the most possible 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.450
 and needed 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.119
 then that goal falls just before the break a nice one and the silly one in the 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.110
 rebound 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.610
 cabin being worked 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.100
 of course that red card and much more falls back where we belong 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.100
 and then on 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.170
 then the second half are some we have banished try the two 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.670
 to score goals 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.210
 where the girl died 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.650
 10 10 man left the chief Jan difficult 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.020
 yes and that the emissions per year well grouped team that the to mouscron 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.299
 did leave 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.079
 a good team is that very piece of standard in a lot of strong youngsters 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.439
 was already assuming that many balls headed inside 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.909
 that's a bit of a bother with it but I think they set the number one center 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.150
 number of options 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.660
 a number of times in which the sixteen have so much respect for their best time 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.030
 jungle exit 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.790
 the game next to we until this time not the first time around 2 million 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.969
 already know awlaki to consolidate 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:38.160
 I now think though Pottermore is still expecting a mother study 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.429
 I think you are not satisfied with a place on the couch 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:42.909
 yes i watch 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.779
 not yet in that time just trying to fill in as well as possible and 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:49.089
 other players but I am someone this year 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:52.959
 the device tap the mafia tibetan mastiff sitting on the couch 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.829
 play every week at the latest 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.829
 and see which are both Ferrari and the matches every week from now on 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.180
 well i think i like myself as well as in construction is perfect within the player group 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.909
 a bit of steering and trying to help the young guys out there 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.279
 Now on the couch is also called on the pitch
