money<00:01:38.220> raised<00:01:38.579> for<00:01:38.850> cancer<00:01:39.240> research<00:01:39.270> UK<00:01:39.630> and

think I'd be able to kind of bring it to

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.940 
think I'd be able to kind of bring it to
that<00:01:47.040> level<00:01:47.899> specifically<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.680> level

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
that level specifically just that level

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.499 
that level specifically just that level
of<00:01:50.040> how<00:01:50.220> much<00:01:50.369> support<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.939> had<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.299> how<00:01:51.390> much

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
of how much support I had and how much

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.990 
of how much support I had and how much
had<00:01:51.689> going<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.100> 12<00:01:53.369> hours<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.850> we

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
had going on in just 12 hours like we

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.399 
had going on in just 12 hours like we
raised<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> ton<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.600> didn't<00:01:54.899> even<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.170> stay

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
raised a ton I didn't even have to stay

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.280 
raised a ton I didn't even have to stay
above<00:01:55.530> at<00:01:55.770> night<00:01:55.920> which<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.130> great<00:01:57.290> because

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
much compared to how much we raised in

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.020 
much compared to how much we raised in
my<00:04:19.320> last<00:04:19.590> charity<00:04:19.979> stream<00:04:20.280> but<00:04:20.760> I<00:04:20.789> just<00:04:20.910> feel

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
my last charity stream but I just feel

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.880 
my last charity stream but I just feel
like<00:04:21.090> it's<00:04:21.359> a<00:04:21.479> more<00:04:21.720> reasonable<00:04:22.109> goal<00:04:22.680> I'd

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
like it's a more reasonable goal I'd

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
like it's a more reasonable goal I'd
rather

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
rather

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.200 
rather
be<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.060> goal<00:04:25.130> it's<00:04:26.130> still<00:04:26.550> not<00:04:26.730> really<00:04:27.060> that

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
be a goal it's still not really that

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.700 
be a goal it's still not really that
reasonable<00:04:27.900> like<00:04:28.020> it's<00:04:28.170> still<00:04:28.350> a<00:04:28.380> lot<00:04:28.680> of

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
reasonable like it's still a lot of

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.760 
reasonable like it's still a lot of
money<00:04:29.010> but<00:04:29.660> I'd<00:04:30.660> rather<00:04:30.810> have<00:04:31.050> a<00:04:31.140> smaller<00:04:31.470> goal

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
money but I'd rather have a smaller goal

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.590 
money but I'd rather have a smaller goal
rather<00:04:31.950> than<00:04:32.220> just<00:04:32.460> super<00:04:32.880> duper<00:04:33.180> ambitious

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
rather than just super duper ambitious

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.330 
rather than just super duper ambitious
goal<00:04:33.780> that<00:04:33.930> we<00:04:34.020> don't<00:04:34.200> reach<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:34.770> just<00:04:35.220> feel

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
goal that we don't reach and just feel

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.530 
goal that we don't reach and just feel
upset<00:04:35.550> about<00:04:35.820> because<00:04:36.120> you're<00:04:36.240> not<00:04:36.330> being

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
upset about because you're not being

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.750 
upset about because you're not being
goals<00:04:36.810> is<00:04:36.960> fine<00:04:37.170> and<00:04:37.380> I<00:04:37.680> like<00:04:38.130> if<00:04:38.370> we<00:04:38.520> could

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
goals is fine and I like if we could

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.520 
goals is fine and I like if we could
raise<00:04:38.970> that<00:04:39.150> much<00:04:39.330> than<00:04:39.810> just<00:04:40.020> smashing<00:04:40.410> that

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
raise that much than just smashing that

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.250 
raise that much than just smashing that
goal<00:04:40.680> would<00:04:40.770> be<00:04:40.910> incredible<00:04:41.910> as<00:04:42.120> well<00:04:42.330> so

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
goal would be incredible as well so

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.050 
goal would be incredible as well so
that's<00:04:43.380> that<00:04:43.680> 25th<00:04:44.400> of<00:04:44.490> October<00:04:44.910> I'll

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
that's that 25th of October I'll

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.250 
that's that 25th of October I'll
probably<00:04:45.180> make<00:04:45.390> another<00:04:45.510> video<00:04:45.810> a<00:04:45.930> little<00:04:46.080> bit

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
probably make another video a little bit

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.990 
probably make another video a little bit
closer<00:04:46.440> to<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.710> time<00:04:46.980> as<00:04:47.130> well<00:04:47.340> just<00:04:47.820> so<00:04:47.940> you

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
closer to the time as well just so you

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.450 
closer to the time as well just so you
