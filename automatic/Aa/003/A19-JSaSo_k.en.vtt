00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
return right there close through time

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.289 
return right there close through time
goes<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:15.630> goes<00:01:16.380> around<00:01:16.590> goes<00:01:16.979> around<00:01:17.640> and

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
from the tank from the tank to the pump

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:55.819 
from the tank from the tank to the pump
and<00:01:46.619> then<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:54.110> yes<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.350> don't<00:01:55.649> know

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
and then this I just yes I don't know

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.999 
and then this I just yes I don't know
exactly<00:01:56.310> what<00:01:57.090> about<00:01:57.420> learn<00:01:57.689> more<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.890> you

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
exactly what about learn more and you

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.249 
exactly what about learn more and you
got<00:01:59.130> three<00:01:59.310> time<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.759> guess<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.360> then<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.110> got

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
got three time I guess that then we got

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.760 
got three time I guess that then we got
to<00:02:01.820> run<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> pump<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.600> engine

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
to run the pump to the engine

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.240 
to run the pump to the engine
I<00:02:05.750> figured<00:02:06.750> out<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:07.110> way<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.470> want<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.950> custom

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
I figured out a way I want to custom

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.979 
I figured out a way I want to custom
model<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.849> because<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.450> one<00:02:09.660> they<00:02:09.810> gave

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
model this because I just one they gave

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.760 
model this because I just one they gave
me<00:02:10.170> he<00:02:10.229> was<00:02:10.349> also<00:02:10.470> doing<00:02:12.380> but<00:02:13.940> they<00:02:15.410> said<00:02:16.410> that

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
me he was also doing but they said that

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.740 
me he was also doing but they said that
you<00:02:17.280> connect<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.700> from<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.000> engine<00:02:18.090> straight

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
you connect it from the engine straight

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.110 
you connect it from the engine straight
to<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.200> push<00:02:19.739> from<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.340> pump<00:02:20.610> straight<00:02:20.910> to

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
to the push from the pump straight to

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.339 
to the push from the pump straight to
the<00:02:21.209> engine<00:02:21.450> they<00:02:21.599> made<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.900> thing<00:02:22.110> long

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
the engine they made the thing long

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.410 
the engine they made the thing long
enough<00:02:22.380> sold<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.569> from<00:02:24.569> this<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.830> engine

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
enough sold so from this to the engine

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.210 
enough sold so from this to the engine
easy<00:02:27.680> no<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.920> then<00:02:29.099> just<00:02:29.130> take<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.239> stock

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
easy no and then just take the stock

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.740 
easy no and then just take the stock
hose<00:02:32.220> out<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.940> don't<00:02:33.120> either<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.569> can

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
hose out and you don't either you can

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.350 
hose out and you don't either you can
just<00:02:33.870> put<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.290> side<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.910> so<00:02:36.180> pretty

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
just put it to the side and so pretty

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:47.500 
just put it to the side and so pretty
much<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:37.350> know<00:02:37.760> easy<00:02:39.890> tank<00:02:45.200> return<00:02:46.400> and

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
much you know easy tank return and

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.680 
much you know easy tank return and
engine<00:02:48.510> easy<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.799> then<00:02:49.920> out<00:02:50.160> at<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.690> wiring

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
engine easy and then out at the wiring
