screws which fit the thread

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.690

fine<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.500> had<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.920> shorten<00:02:14.099> up<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.340> screw<00:02:14.670> a

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
fine I had to shorten up the screw a

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.250 
fine I had to shorten up the screw a
little<00:02:15.030> bit<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.540> wouldn't<00:02:15.810> come<00:02:15.989> through

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
little bit so it wouldn't come through

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.960 
little bit so it wouldn't come through
on<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.560> framework<00:02:16.980> inside<00:02:17.400> there<00:02:17.840> um<00:02:19.970> but

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
on the framework inside there um but

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.030 
on the framework inside there um but
anyways<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.840> can<00:02:22.019> tell<00:02:22.260> they're<00:02:22.440> using<00:02:22.739> some

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
anyways you can tell they're using some

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.009 
anyways you can tell they're using some
kind<00:02:23.069> of<00:02:23.459> really<00:02:23.879> soft<00:02:24.180> steel<00:02:24.510> not<00:02:24.959> only

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
kind of really soft steel not only

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.259 
kind of really soft steel not only
because<00:02:25.500> they<00:02:25.620> strip<00:02:25.890> out<00:02:26.069> they<00:02:26.879> would<00:02:27.120> not

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
because they strip out they would not

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.039 
because they strip out they would not
take<00:02:27.569> an<00:02:27.720> edge<00:02:28.819> so<00:02:29.819> I<00:02:29.849> edge<00:02:30.209> them<00:02:30.480> they<00:02:30.989> should

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
take an edge so I edge them they should

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.240 
take an edge so I edge them they should
be<00:02:31.319> as<00:02:31.410> dark<00:02:31.620> as<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:31.920> blade<00:02:32.129> but<00:02:32.819> they're<00:02:33.030> not

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
be as dark as the blade but they're not

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.350 
be as dark as the blade but they're not
so<00:02:35.250> they're<00:02:35.700> very<00:02:36.090> very<00:02:36.420> stainless<00:02:37.019> hardware

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
so they're very very stainless hardware

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.589 
so they're very very stainless hardware
which<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.569> know<00:02:39.690> resist<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.709> etching<00:02:41.599> but

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
which you know resist that etching but

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.990 
which you know resist that etching but
what<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:42.840> what<00:02:43.799> i'll<00:02:43.890> do<00:02:44.099> is<00:02:44.280> i<00:02:44.370> just<00:02:44.610> find<00:02:44.790> some

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
what I what i'll do is i just find some

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.990 
what I what i'll do is i just find some
black<00:02:45.209> screws<00:02:45.480> or<00:02:45.720> ordering<00:02:46.079> for<00:02:46.410> him<00:02:47.000> he'll

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
black screws or ordering for him he'll

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.170 
black screws or ordering for him he'll
carry<00:02:48.239> this<00:02:48.420> every<00:02:48.840> day<00:02:48.870> for<00:02:49.349> years<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.860> years

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
carry this every day for years and years

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.599 
carry this every day for years and years
he's<00:02:51.180> been<00:02:51.329> super<00:02:51.690> pumped<00:02:52.019> too<00:02:52.109> soon<00:02:52.609> so

he's been super pumped too soon so

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.900 
he's been super pumped too soon so
hopefully<00:02:54.000> i<00:02:54.180> can<00:02:54.209> see<00:02:54.599> him<00:02:54.690> tomorrow<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:55.910> think

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
for Halloween here's some small details

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.199 
for Halloween here's some small details
that<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.569> might<00:03:03.840> not<00:03:03.989> be<00:03:04.170> able<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.349> pick<00:03:04.590> up<00:03:04.620> I

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
that you might not be able to pick up I

that you might not be able to pick up I
did<00:03:07.730> Stone<00:03:08.730> wash<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.420> while<00:03:10.079> hedge<00:03:10.349> and<00:03:10.530> stone

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
did Stone wash and while hedge and stone

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.580 
did Stone wash and while hedge and stone
washed<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.340> liners<00:03:12.349> kept<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.590> post<00:03:14.569> factory

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
washed the liners kept the post factory

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.319 
washed the liners kept the post factory
so<00:03:16.590> it's<00:03:16.709> kind<00:03:16.890> of<00:03:17.010> blasted<00:03:17.519> satin<00:03:17.910> in<00:03:18.030> real

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
so it's kind of blasted satin in real

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.319 
so it's kind of blasted satin in real
life<00:03:18.599> here<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.319> can<00:03:19.470> actually<00:03:19.650> see<00:03:20.060> all<00:03:21.060> these

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
life here you can actually see all these

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.830 
life here you can actually see all these
different<00:03:21.569> colors<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.560> combinations<00:03:22.950> here

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
different colors and combinations here

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.220 
different colors and combinations here
so<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:25.109> goes<00:03:25.290> you<00:03:25.799> know<00:03:25.889> g10<00:03:26.630> stone<00:03:27.630> wash<00:03:27.870> and

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
so it goes you know g10 stone wash and

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.099 
so it goes you know g10 stone wash and
then<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.470> regular<00:03:28.919> factory<00:03:29.340> blasted<00:03:29.849> look

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
then the regular factory blasted look

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.069 
then the regular factory blasted look
then<00:03:31.109> you<00:03:31.349> know<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.889> that<00:03:32.010> around<00:03:32.700> so

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.670 
able to see this on the thumb stud I
actually<00:03:40.620> took<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:41.340> thumb<00:03:41.549> stud<00:03:41.849> off<00:03:45.500> this<00:03:46.500> is

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
not going to focus here and I did not

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.680 
not going to focus here and I did not
etch<00:03:50.720> around<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.989> thumb<00:03:52.230> stud<00:03:53.299> so<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.450> thumb

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
etch around the thumb stud so the thumb

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.900 
etch around the thumb stud so the thumb
stud<00:03:54.959> around<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.709> is<00:03:55.829> blasted<00:03:56.430> Sony<00:03:56.639> looked

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
stud around it is blasted Sony looked

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.409 
stud around it is blasted Sony looked
down<00:03:57.090> its<00:03:57.359> last<00:03:57.840> two<00:03:58.019> blasts<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.500> blasted

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
the thumb stud so I appear not probably

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.719 
the thumb stud so I appear not probably
not<00:04:13.709> going<00:04:13.889> to<00:04:13.949> be<00:04:14.040> able<00:04:14.069> to<00:04:14.250> see<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.370> nap<00:04:16.729> and

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
not going to be able to see a nap and

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.199 
not going to be able to see a nap and
then<00:04:17.849> I<00:04:17.940> reach<00:04:18.180> arpan<00:04:18.539> it<00:04:18.630> up<00:04:18.780> for<00:04:19.049> him<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:20.209> very

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
then I reach arpan it up for him a very

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.290 
then I reach arpan it up for him a very
sharp

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
sharp

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:30.790 
sharp
again<00:04:24.300> this<00:04:24.450> is<00:04:24.510> this<00:04:24.810> HCR<00:04:25.440> 13<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.670> mov<00:04:28.190> well

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
again this is this HCR 13 and mov well

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.560 
again this is this HCR 13 and mov well
that's<00:04:31.800> how<00:04:32.010> I<00:04:32.040> tell<00:04:32.430> if<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.790> knife<00:04:33.270> is<00:04:33.540> sharp

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
that's how I tell if the knife is sharp

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.740 
that's how I tell if the knife is sharp
enough<00:04:33.990> for<00:04:34.380> me<00:04:34.500> for<00:04:34.770> daily<00:04:35.040> use<00:04:35.930> if<00:04:36.930> I<00:04:37.140> cannot

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
enough for me for daily use if I cannot

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.240 
enough for me for daily use if I cannot
do<00:04:39.750> this<00:04:39.960> with<00:04:40.230> just<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.530> knife<00:04:40.740> weight<00:04:40.980> alone

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
do this with just the knife weight alone

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.790 
do this with just the knife weight alone
and<00:04:41.850> it<00:04:41.970> doesn't<00:04:42.240> slide<00:04:42.450> off<00:04:42.510> your<00:04:42.690> thumb<00:04:43.110> you

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
and it doesn't slide off your thumb you

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.640 
and it doesn't slide off your thumb you
can<00:04:43.980> also<00:04:44.130> take<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.550> Bic<00:04:45.030> pen<00:04:45.450> or<00:04:46.140> any<00:04:46.290> kind<00:04:46.500> of
