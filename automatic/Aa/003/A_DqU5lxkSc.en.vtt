00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
nights that's a hundred bucks that's

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.530 
nights that's a hundred bucks that's
ridiculous<00:01:18.979> that's<00:01:19.280> enough<00:01:19.729> gas<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.299> drive

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
ridiculous that's enough gas to drive

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.580 
ridiculous that's enough gas to drive
through<00:01:20.870> another<00:01:21.110> state<00:01:21.470> that's<00:01:23.890> systems<00:01:26.590> the

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
through another state that's systems the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.950 
through another state that's systems the
only<00:01:27.770> way<00:01:27.950> I<00:01:27.980> can<00:01:28.160> think<00:01:28.310> of<00:01:28.640> it<00:01:28.820> is<00:01:29.030> a<00:01:29.600> stealth

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
only way I can think of it is a stealth

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.880 
only way I can think of it is a stealth
campervan<00:01:30.650> is<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:30.980> only<00:01:31.220> way<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.400> go<00:01:32.890> it's

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
campervan is the only way to go it's

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.280 
campervan is the only way to go it's
probably<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.850> only<00:01:35.060> way<00:01:35.300> to<00:01:35.450> go<00:01:35.660> if<00:01:36.020> you<00:01:36.260> want

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
probably the only way to go if you want

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.150 
probably the only way to go if you want
to<00:01:36.590> travel<00:01:36.830> and<00:01:37.160> you<00:01:37.250> want<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.520> travel<00:01:37.760> cheap

to travel and you want to travel cheap

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.550 
to travel and you want to travel cheap
you<00:01:40.160> don't<00:01:40.280> have<00:01:40.400> tons<00:01:40.550> of<00:01:40.760> money<00:01:41.200> like<00:01:42.200> you

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
my stealth campervan I think an RV would

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.980 
my stealth campervan I think an RV would
just<00:02:37.630> be<00:02:37.780> asking<00:02:37.960> for<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:40.510> get<00:02:40.660> bothered

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
just be asking for to get bothered

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.440 
just be asking for to get bothered
though<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:42.010> be<00:02:42.100> honest<00:02:42.340> because<00:02:42.460> I<00:02:42.760> see<00:02:43.300> more

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
though to be honest because I see more

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.090 
though to be honest because I see more
videos<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:43.870> people<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.500> RVs<00:02:44.770> getting

videos of people and RVs getting

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.230 
videos of people and RVs getting
bothered<00:02:45.250> than<00:02:45.550> anything<00:02:45.790> else<00:02:46.120> I<00:02:47.190> mean

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
bothered than anything else I mean

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
bothered than anything else I mean
everybody<00:02:49.240> knows<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:49.780> can<00:02:49.930> live<00:02:50.080> in<00:02:50.170> an

everybody knows that you can live in an
RV<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.790> it's<00:02:52.090> very<00:02:52.840> blatantly<00:02:55.920> easy<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.220> tell

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
RV and it's very blatantly easy to tell

RV and it's very blatantly easy to tell
that<00:02:58.290> there's<00:02:59.290> one<00:02:59.560> I<00:02:59.920> mean<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:00.460> can't<00:03:00.700> miss

that there's one I mean you can't miss
in<00:03:01.060> RV<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:01.930> can<00:03:01.960> tell<00:03:02.320> that<00:03:02.470> it's<00:03:02.620> if<00:03:03.100> you

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
in RV you can tell that it's if you

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.940 
in RV you can tell that it's if you
drive<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.820> Walmart<00:03:04.240> and<00:03:04.410> then<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:05.530> see<00:03:05.740> it<00:03:05.830> the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
drive to Walmart and then you see it the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.410 
drive to Walmart and then you see it the
next<00:03:05.980> day<00:03:06.280> you're<00:03:06.520> not<00:03:06.610> gonna<00:03:06.730> forget<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.150> you

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
next day you're not gonna forget it you

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.610 
next day you're not gonna forget it you
know<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:08.440> van<00:03:09.040> like<00:03:09.280> mine<00:03:09.520> though<00:03:10.620> you're

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
know a van like mine though you're

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.980 
know a van like mine though you're
probably<00:03:12.250> not<00:03:12.700> gonna<00:03:12.940> even<00:03:13.150> notice<00:03:13.690> it<00:03:13.900> and

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
probably not gonna even notice it and

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.540 
probably not gonna even notice it and
you're<00:03:14.080> probably<00:03:14.260> gonna<00:03:14.710> forget<00:03:14.920> about<00:03:15.220> it

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
you're probably gonna forget about it

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.300 
you're probably gonna forget about it
even<00:03:16.150> if<00:03:16.360> you<00:03:16.480> do<00:03:16.630> notice<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:17.190> because<00:03:18.190> it

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
even if you do notice it because it

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.280 
even if you do notice it because it
looks<00:03:18.490> a<00:03:18.580> little<00:03:18.670> average<00:03:19.000> I<00:03:19.540> mean<00:03:20.140> I<00:03:20.200> don't

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
looks a little average I mean I don't

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.840 
looks a little average I mean I don't
even<00:03:20.410> want<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.710> Cargill<00:03:21.130> then<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.520> doesn't

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
even want to Cargill then that doesn't

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.670 
even want to Cargill then that doesn't
have<00:03:21.940> any<00:03:22.090> windows<00:03:22.390> I<00:03:24.060> wanted<00:03:25.060> one<00:03:25.330> I<00:03:25.660> mean<00:03:26.470> I

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
have any windows I wanted one I mean I

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.860 
have any windows I wanted one I mean I
wanted<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.160> ultimate<00:03:27.820> stealth<00:03:28.180> so<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:28.600> could

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
wanted it ultimate stealth so I could

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.520 
wanted it ultimate stealth so I could
literally<00:03:29.380> live<00:03:29.740> as<00:03:29.950> free<00:03:30.220> as<00:03:30.370> possible<00:03:30.580> I

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.570 

mean<00:03:35.530> it<00:03:35.650> would<00:03:35.770> have<00:03:35.800> been<00:03:35.950> easier<00:03:36.340> if<00:03:36.400> this

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
mean it would have been easier if this

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.580 
mean it would have been easier if this
dealt<00:03:36.850> with<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.150> Cargill<00:03:37.959> van<00:03:38.140> because<00:03:38.320> I<00:03:38.440> would

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
dealt with a Cargill van because I would

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.050 
dealt with a Cargill van because I would
have<00:03:38.680> had<00:03:38.770> an<00:03:38.920> empty<00:03:39.190> slate<00:03:39.489> to<00:03:39.700> work<00:03:39.730> with

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
have had an empty slate to work with

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.440 
have had an empty slate to work with
right<00:03:40.270> away<00:03:40.420> but<00:03:40.630> I<00:03:41.670> think<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:44.970> think<00:03:45.970> this<00:03:46.239> is

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
right away but I think I think this is

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.820 
right away but I think I think this is
the<00:03:46.570> best<00:03:46.780> route<00:03:47.020> because<00:03:47.260> this<00:03:47.410> looks<00:03:47.650> like

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
the best route because this looks like

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.290 
the best route because this looks like
hey<00:03:48.130> a<00:03:48.160> family<00:03:48.670> could<00:03:48.880> have<00:03:48.910> just<00:03:49.150> went

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
hey a family could have just went

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.070 
hey a family could have just went
somewhere<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:50.650> know<00:03:51.090> it's<00:03:52.090> got<00:03:52.300> windows<00:03:52.510> but

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
somewhere you know it's got windows but

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.830 
somewhere you know it's got windows but
but<00:03:53.770> people<00:03:54.070> can<00:03:54.250> just<00:03:54.400> assume<00:03:54.760> that<00:03:55.390> there's

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
but people can just assume that there's

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.340 
but people can just assume that there's
nothing<00:03:56.230> on<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.530> windows<00:03:56.890> and<00:03:58.110> that<00:03:59.110> there's

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
nothing on the windows and that there's

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.180 
nothing on the windows and that there's
nobody<00:03:59.530> inside<00:04:00.040> but<00:04:00.880> in<00:04:00.970> reality<00:04:01.350> it's<00:04:02.350> bright

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
nobody inside but in reality it's bright

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.360 
nobody inside but in reality it's bright
as<00:04:03.370> hell<00:04:03.550> inside<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:05.170> there's<00:04:05.800> somebody<00:04:06.070> in

as hell inside and there's somebody in
there<00:04:06.610> I<00:04:06.930> don't<00:04:07.930> know<00:04:08.019> those<00:04:08.890> are<00:04:08.920> just<00:04:09.190> my
