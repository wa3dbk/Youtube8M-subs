00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.500 
this time use the supplied hardware for
the<00:03:46.840> seat<00:03:47.110> and<00:03:47.549> it's<00:03:48.549> easier<00:03:48.880> to<00:03:48.970> do<00:03:49.120> this<00:03:49.299> with

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
the seat and it's easier to do this with

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.490 
the seat and it's easier to do this with
the<00:03:49.630> plate<00:03:49.900> down<00:03:51.720> so<00:03:52.720> that's<00:03:53.019> why<00:03:53.170> we<00:03:53.319> leave

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
the plate down so that's why we leave

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:02.610 
the plate down so that's why we leave
the<00:03:53.680> plate<00:03:53.890> loose<00:04:01.019> then<00:04:02.019> after<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.379> seats

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
the plate loose then after the seats

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.610 
the plate loose then after the seats
mounted<00:04:03.660> go<00:04:04.660> ahead<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:04.959> tighten<00:04:05.319> the<00:04:05.379> plate

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
mounted go ahead and tighten the plate

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.949 
mounted go ahead and tighten the plate
up<00:04:05.769> all<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.099> way<00:04:06.160> to<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.670> tight<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:07.660> it<00:04:07.690> so

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
up all the way to the tight to it so

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.009 
up all the way to the tight to it so
it's<00:04:08.110> tight<00:04:08.549> if<00:04:09.549> you<00:04:09.940> don't<00:04:10.360> take<00:04:10.540> your<00:04:10.599> seat

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
it's tight if you don't take your seat

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.199 
it's tight if you don't take your seat
on<00:04:11.170> and<00:04:11.379> off<00:04:11.470> very<00:04:11.769> often<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.400> recommend<00:04:12.879> some

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
on and off very often I recommend some

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.670 
on and off very often I recommend some
blue<00:04:14.049> loctite

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
blue loctite

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.319

on<00:04:14.860> those<00:04:15.250> bolts<00:04:15.700> just<00:04:17.850> to<00:04:18.850> make<00:04:18.970> sure<00:04:19.150> they

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
on those bolts just to make sure they

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.990 
on those bolts just to make sure they
stay<00:04:19.389> in<00:04:19.630> there<00:04:19.900> and<00:04:19.989> stay<00:04:20.200> put<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:21.609> reason

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
stay in there and stay put the reason

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.760 
stay in there and stay put the reason
that<00:04:23.130> this<00:04:24.130> needs<00:04:24.370> to<00:04:24.490> be<00:04:24.900> either<00:04:25.900> slightly

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
that this needs to be either slightly

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.300 
that this needs to be either slightly
loose<00:04:27.810> or<00:04:28.810> completely<00:04:29.380> removed<00:04:29.830> in<00:04:30.070> order<00:04:30.160> to

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
loose or completely removed in order to

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.010 
loose or completely removed in order to
get<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.490> seat<00:04:30.700> on<00:04:30.849> is<00:04:31.120> to<00:04:31.270> keep<00:04:31.479> this<00:04:31.720> nice

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
get the seat on is to keep this nice

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.770 
get the seat on is to keep this nice
fine<00:04:32.349> line<00:04:32.680> right<00:04:32.889> here<00:04:33.130> in<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:34.240> design<00:04:34.570> it

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
fine line right here in the design it

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.270 
fine line right here in the design it
was<00:04:34.840> impossible<00:04:35.139> to<00:04:35.530> be<00:04:35.770> able<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:35.979> still

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
was impossible to be able to still

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.810 
was impossible to be able to still
access<00:04:36.760> those<00:04:37.000> bolts<00:04:37.539> for<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:37.810> seat<00:04:38.169> and<00:04:38.820> keep

access those bolts for the seat and keep

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.940 
access those bolts for the seat and keep
this<00:04:40.030> nice<00:04:40.300> and<00:04:40.330> tight<00:04:40.599> I<00:04:40.990> like<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:41.620> way<00:04:41.740> this

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
this nice and tight I like the way this

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.830 
this nice and tight I like the way this
looked<00:04:42.250> so<00:04:42.789> it's<00:04:43.150> a<00:04:43.180> little<00:04:43.300> bit<00:04:43.510> of<00:04:43.599> a<00:04:43.660> hassle

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
looked so it's a little bit of a hassle

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.779 
looked so it's a little bit of a hassle
to<00:04:44.260> lower<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.740> plate<00:04:44.979> to<00:04:45.130> take<00:04:45.250> your<00:04:45.460> seat<00:04:45.639> off

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
to lower the plate to take your seat off

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.730 
to lower the plate to take your seat off
but<00:04:46.389> it<00:04:46.479> looks<00:04:46.630> much<00:04:46.840> cleaner<00:04:47.110> once<00:04:47.440> it's<00:04:47.590> on

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
but it looks much cleaner once it's on

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.129 
but it looks much cleaner once it's on
there<00:04:47.950> and<00:04:48.300> go<00:04:49.300> ahead<00:04:49.419> and<00:04:49.510> put<00:04:49.630> your<00:04:49.780> license

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
there and go ahead and put your license

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.589 
there and go ahead and put your license
plate<00:04:50.320> on<00:04:50.349> and<00:04:50.770> you<00:04:51.099> are<00:04:51.190> good<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.370> go<00:04:51.490> so<00:04:52.270> this

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599
