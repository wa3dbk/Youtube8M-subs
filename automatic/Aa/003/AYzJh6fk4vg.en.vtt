00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:09.180
 the following of the complexes we have 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:11.660
 the advanced a and b and the solution 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.660
 each 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.180
 go Go 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.180
 fifteen 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.890
 all of this let's say 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.700
 from here we are going to see this is let's say 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.760
 let's say the distributive property 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.740
 so that applying this bread is this 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.300
 with this and then 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:50.410
 this with this and this with this one of the 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.730
 mark one by one is one 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.730
 15 5 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.470
 and if there 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.409
 one for five mega 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.200
 and what is 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.200
 but 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.310
 this is much less one 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.560
 and I still have 2005 - one that I have left 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.560
 fine 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.909
 directly more 5 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.909
 give me a little 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.909
 and all this multiplied not us 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.479
 let's forget for 1 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.479
 all right 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.090
 and let's go now is the multiplying each 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:00.259
 one of them one politician 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.939
 5 and die is more 5 and square than the 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.150
 square minus one I would stay 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:08.399
 5 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:10.289
 but if it 's less than minus -1 it's 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.180
 plus one 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.180
 and 525 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.810
 organize the parties 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.569
 5 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.870
 harder 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:32.260
 in the 51 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.260
 more and that multiplies to 1 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.490
 + 5 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:45.660
 and equal to 5 14 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.660
 and we signed about 26 by giving more 6 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.900
 the result of the letter 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.300
 s 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.540
 more I know 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.850
 / of 53 and 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.070
 I think with this relationship 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.370
 that's how you usually eat this 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.370
 expression 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:21.130
 / of 5 -3 and then to divide the two 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.080
 first complex locations 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.090
 multiplied up and down that is 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.000
 first here named because the 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.030
 conjugates where the denominator can be 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.050
 conjugate of the pull already 2 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.050
 I think what we do 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.800
 besides here 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.740
 the east 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:47.780
 is to change imaginary sign ie 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:50.930
 unless orio and you say is that 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.920
 we have equal central to less 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:59.120
 from huari then just conjugate it will be 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.720
 more because we have the sign of the 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.210
 participation 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:07.570
 said this has changed the meaning of the 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:11.170
 part imagines get to 53 and divided from 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.170
 53 and 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:24.389
 here under the direct 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.889
 and set minus three times five minus 15 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:31.939
 - 3 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:31.939
 - Three because if I had 99 

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:45.180
 3 x 3 925 is plus 10 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.460
 two 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:58.159
 multiplied by three and by two more by 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:05:05.319
 36 and for it's equality but squares 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:05.319
 minus 16 minus six months 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.180
 in this sentence 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.840
 / d 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.840
 let's see an expression 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:26.440
 it tells us that we have good beds 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.440
 as it was said the roads well 

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:32.729
 that's why it's very different from squares 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.610
 so 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:52.650
 5 43 25 less 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:56.090
 that is 3 and water 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.090
 before it was said again 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.049
 9 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:03.049
 and which 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.840
 one 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:20.320
 minus -9 she plus 9 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.480
 and 25 + 9 are 34 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.630
 by train 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:29.390
 from here and his personal qualities and 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.740
 materials by imaginary less 15 16 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:35.740
 it is minus 21 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:43.470
 and it's more 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:47.180
 divided into 34 in the two components and 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:52.260
 14 more 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:58.260
 134 2 174 x 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:07:01.110
 to get the number of said division 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.670
 this decision here when we have a 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.260
 vision of complex numbers you have to 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:07.320
 multiply by being conjugated that is 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:11.910
 change the imaginary mark of in this 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:16.280
 case we have the problem especially that 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.280
 we see a girl today to all
