00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.710
 modding review on skyrim 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.270

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.039
 description the link of all modes 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.410
 that I presented as well as 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.449
 music or ost for example the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.920
 other games that I used for the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.580
 editing this video in the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.590
 description 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.900
 on this I wish you a very good 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.150
 viewing start this review with a 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.309
 fashion that will add a lot of things in 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.850
 white brive and so this is the mode 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.199
 jks or itron created by jk rod hurts and 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.449
 it's a mode that will offer you 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.059
 additional guard towers of the 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.979
 greenery of the fir trees what you will have 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.820
 will also be terraces next to the 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:57.750
 local bar the big square has been modified 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.850
 among others you will be able 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.379
 find the well with a roof this 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.140
 Once there are some gardens 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.380
 exteriors that were also added 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.850
 the sky forge is completely modified 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.680
 its part from the moment you take the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.090
 stairs until you arrive 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.189
 at the top, ie 4 the equipment 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.380
 extra that was added edith 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.170
 decoration that are really sublime 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.609
 so on this I let you admire these 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.609
 some changes in pictures 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.040
 so the pretty it is a whole 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.789
 new followers pack of 3 followers 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.670
 to be more exact which is called m bws 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.860
 child sisters followers created by ria 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.200
 and so to find these three followers 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.259
 I invite you to head into the 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.030
 guild mates to bleach it 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.250
 first name is silvia she 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.940
 will use the fight until tomorrow as well 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.940
 that heavy armor 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.450
 the second it is about the ina it is a 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.250
 archer who will also use the 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.709
 one-handed fight and she will take 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.040
 also light armor when 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.040
 battles 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:38.459
 the third and last followers get 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.980
 name she lives and will use the fight 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.379
 with one hand a heavy armor and she 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.689
 will also use a lot of parry 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.840
 to be able to counter the attacks of his 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.840
 opponents 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.109
 definitely I think the modder my 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.060
 bad sudan did not finish from us 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.920
 to put the eyes full with news 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.530
 weapons and for today I you 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.439
 offers the vassal mode created by him 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.209
 same and so this mode will propose us a 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.250
 any new one-handed blade in the 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.989
 steel category of our forges 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.269
 she has a sheath that is 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.859
 clean and is noted that when there are 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.000
 glare of the sun on this blade is 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.950
 really beautiful 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.109
 at the visual level you have the choice 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.030
 between textures two cases where 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.439
 textures four cases but you have to know 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.760
 that each time I use the 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:23.010
 better performance so what you 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.790
 have in front of you it's textures 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.790
 in 4k 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.540
 and here is finally a dark armor 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.120
 souls 2 that have textures 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.690
 drinking it's about the dark souls mode of 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.510
 armor this woman created by destiny 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.220
 strident is so it's a mode that 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.319
 will offer you brand new armor 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.860
 in the category and bonito your 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.950
 forges 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.870
 it has textures in 4k and 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.670
 animations that are also adapted 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.200
 according to your displacements what was 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.180
 not the case with other armor 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.459
 resembling this but with 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.930
 really mediocre textures and with 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.420
 armor pieces that are missing 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.090
 So here is a big congratulations to six engines 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.170
 and so on that I leave you in two 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.170
 charming company 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.360
 but well, let's say I was expecting 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.280
 something a little bigger but 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.380
 it's okay you 're recruiting I 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.500
 you embark with me it is about 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.570
 beans created by xbee everything and it's a 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.480
 mini dragon follower as you go 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.290
 to be able to find in the gorges of the world 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.390
 when he will follow you 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.190
 and during fights of course he goes 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.530
 hover in the air and throw a few 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.240
 scream about the enemies know that this 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.130
 dragon is a little dissident that he can 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.890
 happen that by moment there are certain 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.750
 bugs and you have the cantor 2 optional 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.180
 the optional where the dragon does not speak 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.710
 not voiceless is the dragon who has a 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:57.440
 voice when given orders 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:59.210
 we just talk to him I feel 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.950
 that there is going to be some abuse at the level 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.230
 of using this mode 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.680
 this is death blossom spel created 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.390
 by darren 83 and so this mode will propose 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.700
 a whole new destruction spell that 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.490
 you will be able to unlock thanks to a 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.890
 book that sits at the top of 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.630
 the academy the image of winter ford a 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.670
 huge book if I can say 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.720
 once you've read it just 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.520
 to go back to the category 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.710
 destruction and there you will find the spell 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.740
 Azores quest 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.380
 destruction with shooting effects of 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.800
 laser gun and it's a species of 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.590
 red mist that will appear around the 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.200
 field in which you swayed 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.120
 your spell and therefore a spell to use 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.310
 in moderation if you do not want 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.570
 finish with an arrow planted in the 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.570
 nose like house moncade 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.440
 and and the dog it was new bet if 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.600
 he does not seem to know much 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.190
 but still is it that well he 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.620
 This is really a new way of getting 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.170
 name dodge the companion skies created 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.730
 by eliane aura is so this famous 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.250
 who will you be able to find him at 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.170
 white shores and this mode contains 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.290
 several optional so note that at 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.660
 start he will be with armor as well as 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.340
 green eyes and well the optional ones of 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.830
 available will be to remove him 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.600
 the armor or to add him eyes of 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.000
 blue color depending on your 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:28.820
 preferences and know that this which 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.470
 will fight valiantly by your side then 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.150
 yes, I really feel like 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.810
 to walk in a forest that is more than 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.300
 realistic 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.540
 this is the fashion mode sky side simply big 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.670
 hurt ruiz created by fading signal that is 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.370
 a mode that will suggest you to increase 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.980
 1.5 times the size as well as the 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.440
 tree width of all trees 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.970
 even for example if you use the 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.890
 fashion that adds in the cities of 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.690
 trees as I l myself do they 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.980
 are also taken into account 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.960
 and I admit that it gives an impression 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.330
 much more realistic to walk around 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.060
 in a bigger forest and I 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.290
 really find this awesome mode know 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.060
 that it is in alpha of which you would have 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.550
 maybe some risks that it fits 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.320
 in collision with other modes that 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.669
 you have installed but know that for 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.440
 me it was not the case and the only 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:15.680
 dirt texture mode that I used 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.930
 it's electrise hd textures that's a 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.190
 fashion that re textures the trees and 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.290
 know that it's too much texture 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.880
 I had even installed before is 

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:27.740
 always taken into account despite 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:29.780
 the tree and change its size and that's it 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.490
 this review ends here so as 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.470
 usually you have the opportunity to 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.180
 put a light - dislike of pandas 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:37.880
 world located to appreciate or if you have 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.260
 hated this video there is space 

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.120
 comments below if you have any 

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:45.169
 questions or suggestions 

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.010
 and this as usual twitter and my 

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:48.110
 Facebook page 

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.900
 but after all we do not care 

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.490
 remains that social networks and on this 

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.690
 happy easter bath and merry christmas at 

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.690
 you all the worse 

00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.780
 well done but a small joint home 

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.230
 the grass 

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:08.100
 there are leaves of chichon and dj 

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:11.730
 gilou with good sound lively firecrackers 

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:15.140
 and the co-ops and songs were going we 

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.140
 like the music that makes you hover
