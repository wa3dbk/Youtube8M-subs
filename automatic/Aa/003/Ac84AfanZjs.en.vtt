00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
that stuff that I get anything going to

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.779 
that stuff that I get anything going to
save<00:00:50.230> this<00:00:50.379> I<00:00:50.500> need<00:00:50.620> to<00:00:50.739> scan<00:00:51.010> this<00:00:51.219> in<00:00:51.280> so<00:00:51.730> I

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
save this I need to scan this in so I

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.660 
save this I need to scan this in so I
can<00:00:51.850> save<00:00:52.120> it<00:00:52.149> digitally<00:00:52.809> but<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:54.340> so<00:00:54.610> much

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
can save it digitally but it's so much

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.760 
can save it digitally but it's so much
and<00:00:55.210> I'm<00:00:55.270> so<00:00:55.300> busy<00:00:55.690> that<00:00:56.050> I<00:00:56.109> never<00:00:56.379> have<00:00:56.620> the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
and I'm so busy that I never have the

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.049 
and I'm so busy that I never have the
time<00:00:56.800> to<00:00:57.070> actually<00:00:57.160> get<00:00:57.370> to<00:00:57.399> scan<00:00:57.670> yet<00:00:57.879> so<00:00:57.969> it

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
time to actually get to scan yet so it

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.810 
time to actually get to scan yet so it
just<00:00:58.239> piles<00:00:58.690> up<00:00:59.050> so<00:01:00.039> what<00:01:00.280> we're<00:01:00.399> going<00:01:00.489> to<00:01:00.579> do

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
just piles up so what we're going to do

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.900 
just piles up so what we're going to do
is<00:01:02.219> I've<00:01:03.219> had<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:04.149> NeatDesk<00:01:04.989> and<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.640> thing

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
is I've had the NeatDesk and the thing

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.090 
is I've had the NeatDesk and the thing
is<00:01:06.970> it<00:01:07.450> scans<00:01:08.170> things<00:01:08.500> but<00:01:08.710> it<00:01:08.800> doesn't

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
is it scans things but it doesn't

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.650 
is it scans things but it doesn't
doesn't<00:01:09.460> hold<00:01:09.700> a<00:01:09.789> lot<00:01:09.940> of<00:01:09.970> paper<00:01:10.210> at<00:01:10.420> one<00:01:10.450> time

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
doesn't hold a lot of paper at one time

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.969 
doesn't hold a lot of paper at one time
it<00:01:11.050> probably<00:01:11.110> holds<00:01:11.500> maybe<00:01:11.679> 20<00:01:12.310> pages<00:01:12.960> um

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
it probably holds maybe 20 pages um

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.580 
it probably holds maybe 20 pages um
those<00:01:14.979> receipts<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:15.460> business<00:01:15.580> cards<00:01:15.880> but

those receipts and business cards but

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.529 
those receipts and business cards but
it's<00:01:17.590> not<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.190> easiest<00:01:18.700> that<00:01:19.240> I'd<00:01:19.360> like<00:01:19.420> to

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
it's not the easiest that I'd like to

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:20.910 
it's not the easiest that I'd like to
save<00:01:19.720> my<00:01:19.869> stuff<00:01:20.080> in<00:01:20.170> Evernote<00:01:20.530> so<00:01:20.619> it's<00:01:20.770> in<00:01:20.830> the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
also say being copied on the computer so

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.229 
also say being copied on the computer so
it's<00:02:42.629> protected<00:02:42.989> both<00:02:43.110> ways<00:02:43.379> so<00:02:44.099> far<00:02:44.610> aside

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
it's protected both ways so far aside

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.580 
it's protected both ways so far aside
from<00:02:45.390> what's<00:02:45.629> in<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.870> tray<00:02:46.110> over<00:02:46.260> there<00:02:46.470> I've

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590

minutes worth of work so I still have

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.630 
minutes worth of work so I still have
some<00:02:51.629> more<00:02:51.780> time<00:02:52.079> before<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.190> end<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.519> day

some more time before the end of the day

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.979 
some more time before the end of the day
obviously<00:02:53.849> but<00:02:54.299> I'm<00:02:54.390> going<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.540> keep<00:02:54.659> going

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
obviously but I'm going to keep going

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.649 
obviously but I'm going to keep going
it's<00:02:55.290> already<00:02:55.470> if<00:02:56.099> you<00:02:56.310> can't<00:02:56.549> tell<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:57.060> more

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
it's already if you can't tell but more

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:58.729 
it's already if you can't tell but more
like<00:02:57.840> until<00:02:58.109> it's<00:02:58.200> already<00:02:58.379> looking<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.650> little

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
like until it's already looking a little

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.130 
like until it's already looking a little
better<00:02:58.920> in<00:02:59.220> here<00:02:59.459> but<00:03:00.329> maybe<00:03:00.900> we'll<00:03:01.019> do

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
better in here but maybe we'll do

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.720 
better in here but maybe we'll do
another<00:03:01.170> check-in<00:03:01.650> in<00:03:01.859> another<00:03:02.069> hour<00:03:02.250> or<00:03:02.459> so

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
another check-in in another hour or so

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.000 
another check-in in another hour or so
and<00:03:02.879> see<00:03:03.090> where<00:03:03.659> we're<00:03:03.840> at<00:03:03.870> alright<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:04.980> I

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
and see where we're at alright so I

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.390 
and see where we're at alright so I
don't<00:03:05.220> know<00:03:05.280> there's<00:03:05.489> probably<00:03:07.400> hundreds

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
don't know there's probably hundreds

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.589 
don't know there's probably hundreds
under<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.090> pages<00:03:09.420> here<00:03:09.599> of<00:03:10.230> content<00:03:11.599> content

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
under the pages here of content content

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.110 
under the pages here of content content
of<00:03:13.019> pages<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.709> I've<00:03:13.859> scanned<00:03:14.129> in<00:03:14.340> using<00:03:15.000> the

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
of pages that I've scanned in using the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.930 
of pages that I've scanned in using the
scansnap<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:16.019> again<00:03:16.739> it's<00:03:16.920> been<00:03:17.069> way<00:03:17.400> easier

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
scansnap and again it's been way easier

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.270 
scansnap and again it's been way easier
to<00:03:18.209> scan<00:03:18.450> all<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.810> in<00:03:18.989> with<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.040> scansnap

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
to scan all that in with the scansnap

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.920 
to scan all that in with the scansnap
tenant<00:03:20.730> was<00:03:20.819> with<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.090> NeatDesk<00:03:21.569> for<00:03:21.810> some

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
tenant was with the NeatDesk for some

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.020 
tenant was with the NeatDesk for some
reason<00:03:22.139> if<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.349> scansnap<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.920> much<00:03:23.459> faster<00:03:23.700> at

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
reason if the scansnap is much faster at

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.839 
reason if the scansnap is much faster at
getting<00:03:24.540> everything<00:03:24.780> into<00:03:25.049> a<00:03:25.109> database<00:03:25.379> and

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
getting everything into a database and

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.520 
getting everything into a database and
uploading<00:03:26.849> it<00:03:26.970> where<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.120> needed<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:27.450> go<00:03:27.569> so

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
uploading it where I needed to go so

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.500 
uploading it where I needed to go so
well<00:03:28.829> yeah<00:03:29.069> almost<00:03:29.430> i'm<00:03:29.519> going<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.760> shred<00:03:30.329> all

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
well yeah almost i'm going to shred all

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.159 
well yeah almost i'm going to shred all
