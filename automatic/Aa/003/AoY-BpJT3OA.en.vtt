for<00:02:11.590> offline<00:02:12.220> now<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:13.180> may<00:02:13.300> be<00:02:13.330> thinking<00:02:13.420> well

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
for offline now you may be thinking well

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.240 
for offline now you may be thinking well
why<00:02:14.200> does<00:02:14.410> it<00:02:14.500> allow<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.710> to<00:02:14.800> save<00:02:14.980> offline

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
why does it allow you to save offline

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.740 
why does it allow you to save offline
when<00:02:15.610> google<00:02:16.000> currents<00:02:16.300> does<00:02:16.510> save

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
when google currents does save

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.930 
when google currents does save
everything<00:02:16.990> offline<00:02:17.290> anyway<00:02:17.800> i<00:02:18.010> personally

everything offline anyway i personally

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.460 
everything offline anyway i personally
think<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.240> is<00:02:19.360> great<00:02:19.510> for<00:02:19.690> just<00:02:20.050> saving

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
think this is great for just saving

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.900 
think this is great for just saving
