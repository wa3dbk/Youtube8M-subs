00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.830 
they're connected to the city by a
bridge<00:02:22.739> we<00:02:23.700> thought<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.180> concept<00:02:24.600> of

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
bridge we thought of a concept of

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.440 
bridge we thought of a concept of
building<00:02:24.989> 300<00:02:25.500> man-made<00:02:26.250> islands<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.850> shape

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
building 300 man-made islands and shape

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.970 
building 300 man-made islands and shape
it<00:02:27.600> like<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.959> world

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.820 

so<00:02:32.760> how<00:02:32.970> do<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.209> build<00:02:33.510> an<00:02:33.780> island<00:02:34.290> or<00:02:34.440> in<00:02:34.680> this

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
so how do you build an island or in this

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.759 
so how do you build an island or in this
case<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:35.430> whole<00:02:36.030> new<00:02:36.299> world<00:02:36.629> you<00:02:37.170> have<00:02:37.409> to<00:02:37.590> take

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
case a whole new world you have to take

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.009 
case a whole new world you have to take
three<00:02:38.040> factors<00:02:38.549> into<00:02:39.030> mine<00:02:39.209> first<00:02:39.780> is

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.619 
three factors into mine first is
protecting<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.709> island<00:02:41.629> protection

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
protecting the island protection

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.199 
protecting the island protection

requires a breakwater a wall that

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.509 
requires a breakwater a wall that
