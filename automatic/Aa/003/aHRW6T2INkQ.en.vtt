I<00:00:06.870> got<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.589> opportunity<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:08.160> see<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.820> plate

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
I got the opportunity to see a plate

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.039 
I got the opportunity to see a plate
system<00:00:09.570> from<00:00:10.320> those<00:00:10.559> guys<00:00:10.830> up<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:11.280> Canada<00:00:12.049> and

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
system from those guys up in Canada and

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.509 
system from those guys up in Canada and
I<00:00:13.200> got<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.469> chance<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.950> actually<00:00:14.099> ride<00:00:14.490> a

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
I got the chance to actually ride a

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.760 
I got the chance to actually ride a
plate<00:00:14.910> system<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.660> most<00:00:16.170> people<00:00:16.500> don't<00:00:16.650> know

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
plate system that most people don't know

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.840 
plate system that most people don't know
exists<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:18.050> was<00:00:19.050> completely<00:00:19.980> blown<00:00:20.310> away<00:00:20.609> by

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
exists I was completely blown away by

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.310 
exists I was completely blown away by
the<00:00:20.910> performance<00:00:22.130> the<00:00:23.990> stability<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.170> it

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
the performance the stability that it

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.390 
the performance the stability that it
adds<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> board<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:27.019> amazing<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.400> was

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
adds to the board is amazing I was

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.209 
adds to the board is amazing I was
riding<00:00:30.240> faster<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.199> feeling<00:00:32.040> more

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
riding faster and feeling more

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.010 
riding faster and feeling more
comfortable<00:00:32.759> than<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.120> think<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.540> ever<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:34.050> I

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
comfortable than I think I ever have I

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.010 
comfortable than I think I ever have I
couldn't<00:00:37.020> feel<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:38.070> icy<00:00:38.570> chopped-up<00:00:39.570> terrain

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
couldn't feel the icy chopped-up terrain

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.010 
couldn't feel the icy chopped-up terrain
that<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.350> was<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.660> felt<00:00:42.660> incredibly

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
that I was on I felt incredibly

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.420 
that I was on I felt incredibly
comfortable<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.840> started<00:00:46.559> thinking

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
comfortable on it so I started thinking

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.580 
comfortable on it so I started thinking
how<00:00:48.300> can<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.629> make<00:00:48.960> something<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.309> and

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
how can I make something like this and

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.150 
how can I make something like this and
began<00:00:52.590> making<00:00:52.860> sketches<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:55.100> trying<00:00:56.100> to

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
began making sketches and trying to

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.580 
began making sketches and trying to
figure<00:00:56.309> out<00:00:56.430> what<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.730> could<00:00:57.030> do<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.510> make<00:00:58.379> an

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
figure out what I could do to make an

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.860 
figure out what I could do to make an
extremely<00:00:59.030> simple<00:01:00.030> plate<00:01:02.270> it's<00:01:03.270> not<00:01:03.420> my<00:01:03.570> goal

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
extremely simple plate it's not my goal

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.950 
extremely simple plate it's not my goal
to<00:01:03.930> make<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.489> thousand-dollar<00:01:05.489> plate<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.810> my

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
to make a thousand-dollar plate it's my

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.899 
to make a thousand-dollar plate it's my
goal<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.229> make<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> plate<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.729> about

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
goal to make a plate that just about

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
what I was able to feel so what I've

what I was able to feel so what I've
done<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.950> mind<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.490> prototype

done and mind you this is a prototype
this<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.630> first<00:01:21.869> one<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.439> started<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:22.830> this

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
this is the first one we started on this

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.890 
this is the first one we started on this
about<00:01:23.159> four<00:01:23.400> days<00:01:23.549> ago

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
about four days ago

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.920 
about four days ago
this<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.770> wood<00:01:25.979> core<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.930> fiberglass

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
this is just a wood core with fiberglass

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.539 
this is just a wood core with fiberglass

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
clear top sheet on it so you can see

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.960 
clear top sheet on it so you can see
what's<00:01:31.560> going<00:01:31.920> on

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
what's going on

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.670 
what's going on
it's<00:01:33.299> got<00:01:33.479> inserts<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.320> mounting<00:01:34.590> your

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
it's got inserts for mounting your

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.609 
it's got inserts for mounting your
bindings<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.880> also<00:01:36.090> got<00:01:36.329> inserts<00:01:36.750> for

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
bindings it's also got inserts for

bindings it's also got inserts for
mounting<00:01:37.950> hardware<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> opposite<00:01:39.210> side

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
mounting hardware on the opposite side

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.010 
mounting hardware on the opposite side
of<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.689> core<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:41.100> some<00:01:41.880> through<00:01:42.390> holes<00:01:42.659> for

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
of the core and some through holes for

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.249 
of the core and some through holes for
accessing<00:01:44.479> components<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.689> get<00:01:45.930> mounted

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
accessing components that get mounted

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.469 
accessing components that get mounted
underneath<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.040> plate<00:01:47.840> we<00:01:48.840> are<00:01:48.990> using<00:01:49.380> a

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
underneath the plate we are using a

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.030 
underneath the plate we are using a
whole<00:01:51.479> pattern<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.439> believe<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.399> similar<00:01:53.729> to

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
whole pattern I believe it's similar to

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.959 
whole pattern I believe it's similar to
the<00:01:56.040> Canadian<00:01:56.280> haul<00:01:56.670> pattern<00:01:57.119> and<00:02:00.380> we<00:02:01.380> will<00:02:01.619> be

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
the Canadian haul pattern and we will be

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.569 
the Canadian haul pattern and we will be
attempting<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.360> adapt<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.290> plate<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:05.070> work<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.520> a

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
attempting to adapt a plate to work on a

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.139 
attempting to adapt a plate to work on a
four<00:02:05.969> by<00:02:06.119> four<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.479> think<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:07.320> at<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.560> point

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
four by four I think but at this point

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.570 
four by four I think but at this point
this<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.450> most<00:02:09.720> convenient<00:02:10.229> way<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.619> do<00:02:10.920> it

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
this is the most convenient way to do it

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.980 
this is the most convenient way to do it
so<00:02:12.580> I'm<00:02:12.910> going<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.090> go<00:02:13.210> ahead<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.540> mount<00:02:13.660> this

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
so I'm going to go ahead and mount this

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.190 
so I'm going to go ahead and mount this
to<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.710> board<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.400> show<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.180> what<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:16.960> looks

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
to the board and show you what it looks

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.070 
to the board and show you what it looks
like<00:02:17.440> when<00:02:17.710> it's<00:02:17.830> mounted<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.750> what<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.780> plate

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
like when it's mounted and what a plate

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.330 
like when it's mounted and what a plate
system<00:02:20.380> actually<00:02:21.190> does<00:02:22.920> when<00:02:23.920> it's<00:02:24.100> working

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
system actually does when it's working

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.949 
system actually does when it's working
Oh

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
components for this very first prototype

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.540 
components for this very first prototype
is<00:02:35.550> about<00:02:36.550> 5.9<00:02:37.270> pounds<00:02:38.220> presumably<00:02:39.220> we'll<00:02:39.459> be

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
is about 5.9 pounds presumably we'll be

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.030 
is about 5.9 pounds presumably we'll be
able<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:40.020> shave<00:02:41.020> off<00:02:41.260> some<00:02:41.290> of<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.709> weight

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
able to shave off some of that weight

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.850 
able to shave off some of that weight
I've<00:02:42.910> already<00:02:43.240> identified<00:02:43.390> some<00:02:43.900> areas<00:02:44.560> where

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
I've already identified some areas where

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.820 
I've already identified some areas where
we<00:02:45.010> can<00:02:45.630> there's<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.720> couple<00:02:46.930> components<00:02:47.350> here

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
we can there's a couple components here

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.060 
we can there's a couple components here
that<00:02:48.070> are<00:02:48.300> fixes<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.690> problems<00:02:50.410> that<00:02:50.680> occurred

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
that are fixes to problems that occurred

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.070 
that are fixes to problems that occurred
that<00:02:51.310> we<00:02:51.430> didn't<00:02:51.700> anticipate<00:02:52.239> an<00:02:52.750> issue<00:02:52.900> on

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
that we didn't anticipate an issue on

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.250 
that we didn't anticipate an issue on
our<00:02:53.110> first<00:02:53.440> build<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:55.660> we'll<00:02:55.870> go<00:02:55.989> ahead<00:02:56.110> and

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
our first build and we'll go ahead and

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.680 
our first build and we'll go ahead and
compensate<00:02:57.070> for<00:02:57.250> those<00:02:57.370> in<00:02:57.700> future<00:02:58.030> designs

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:40.250 

let's<00:03:01.690> just<00:03:03.060> go<00:03:04.060> ahead<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:04.660> start<00:03:04.840> assembling

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.870 

unfortunately<00:03:41.260> at<00:03:41.590> this<00:03:41.800> point<00:03:42.220> we're<00:03:42.550> having

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
unfortunately at this point we're having

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.740 
unfortunately at this point we're having
to<00:03:43.000> use<00:03:43.090> a<00:03:43.540> four<00:03:44.140> millimeter<00:03:44.380> flat<00:03:45.070> head<00:03:45.750> screw

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
to use a four millimeter flat head screw

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.510 
to use a four millimeter flat head screw
it's<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.410> only<00:03:47.620> way<00:03:47.800> we<00:03:47.980> can<00:03:48.130> get<00:03:48.310> the

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
it's the only way we can get the

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.520 
it's the only way we can get the
clearance<00:03:49.650> but<00:03:50.650> hopefully<00:03:51.580> in<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.240> future<00:03:52.530> we

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
clearance but hopefully in the future we

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.070 
clearance but hopefully in the future we
will<00:03:53.770> find<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.400> way<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:57.570> go<00:03:58.570> to<00:03:58.630> a<00:03:58.810> five

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
will find a way to go to a five

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.410 
will find a way to go to a five
millimeter<00:03:59.730> prom<00:04:00.730> is<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:01.180> five<00:04:01.480> millimeter<00:04:03.420> has

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
millimeter prom is a five millimeter has

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.140 
millimeter prom is a five millimeter has
a<00:04:04.450> button<00:04:04.930> head<00:04:05.320> or<00:04:05.590> raised<00:04:06.010> head<00:04:06.430> on<00:04:06.670> it<00:04:06.850> so<00:04:07.030> we

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
a button head or raised head on it so we

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.290 
a button head or raised head on it so we
have<00:04:07.300> a<00:04:07.330> little<00:04:07.570> bit<00:04:08.100> clearance<00:04:09.100> issue<00:04:09.310> and

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
have a little bit clearance issue and

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:17.400 
have a little bit clearance issue and
that<00:04:10.600> results<00:04:11.080> in<00:04:11.170> a<00:04:11.320> taller<00:04:11.770> stack<00:04:16.230> right<00:04:17.230> now

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
that results in a taller stack right now

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.320 
that results in a taller stack right now
we'll<00:04:17.680> be<00:04:17.710> using<00:04:17.980> a<00:04:18.220> four<00:04:18.460> millimeter<00:04:18.730> but

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
we'll be using a four millimeter but

00:04:19.330 --> 00:05:11.180 
we'll be using a four millimeter but
hopefully<00:04:19.750> we

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.170 

okay<00:05:12.190> so<00:05:12.400> I'll<00:05:12.759> move<00:05:13.000> it<00:05:13.180> up<00:05:14.100> now<00:05:15.100> like<00:05:15.789> I<00:05:15.940> said

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
okay so I'll move it up now like I said

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.180 
okay so I'll move it up now like I said
we've<00:05:16.360> got<00:05:16.509> a<00:05:16.539> pivot<00:05:16.930> back<00:05:17.110> here<00:05:17.530> and<00:05:17.770> a<00:05:17.860> slider

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
we've got a pivot back here and a slider

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.620 
we've got a pivot back here and a slider
up<00:05:18.490> here<00:05:18.850> so<00:05:19.840> when<00:05:20.590> we<00:05:20.710> flex<00:05:21.009> the<00:05:21.190> board<00:05:21.630> we're

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
up here so when we flex the board we're

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:29.700 
up here so when we flex the board we're
going<00:05:22.780> to<00:05:22.840> see<00:05:23.160> that<00:05:25.800> front<00:05:26.800> end<00:05:26.949> slides<00:05:28.710> you

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
going to see that front end slides you

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.300 
going to see that front end slides you
see<00:05:30.460> a<00:05:30.490> little<00:05:30.699> bit<00:05:30.880> of<00:05:30.940> motion<00:05:31.210> there<00:05:31.660> and<00:05:32.500> the

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
see a little bit of motion there and the

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.279 
see a little bit of motion there and the
back<00:05:33.490> end<00:05:33.789> stays<00:05:34.120> fixed<00:05:36.870> essentially<00:05:37.870> what

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
back end stays fixed essentially what

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.879 
back end stays fixed essentially what
that<00:05:38.320> does<00:05:38.800> for<00:05:38.830> us<00:05:39.160> is<00:05:40.320> allows<00:05:41.320> the<00:05:41.590> board<00:05:41.800> to

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
that does for us is allows the board to

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.370 
that does for us is allows the board to
flex<00:05:42.220> completely<00:05:43.000> naturally<00:05:43.510> underneath<00:05:43.900> us

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
flex completely naturally underneath us

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.020 
flex completely naturally underneath us
and<00:05:45.060> keeps<00:05:46.060> our<00:05:46.360> stance<00:05:46.810> and<00:05:47.199> feet<00:05:47.770> in<00:05:48.280> that

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
and keeps our stance and feet in that

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.110 
and keeps our stance and feet in that
fixed<00:05:49.780> position<00:05:50.410> we've<00:05:51.280> spent<00:05:51.639> so<00:05:51.910> much<00:05:52.060> time

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
fixed position we've spent so much time

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.189 
fixed position we've spent so much time
trying<00:05:52.750> to<00:05:52.930> develop<00:05:53.520> we<00:05:54.520> spend<00:05:55.510> all<00:05:55.690> this<00:05:55.720> time

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
trying to develop we spend all this time

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.250 
trying to develop we spend all this time
and<00:05:57.130> energy<00:05:57.460> developing<00:05:58.419> and<00:05:58.690> figuring<00:05:59.139> out

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
and energy developing and figuring out

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.439 
and energy developing and figuring out
what<00:05:59.560> our<00:05:59.590> angles<00:06:00.190> should<00:06:00.280> be<00:06:00.610> what<00:06:00.940> can't

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.449 
what our angles should be what can't

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:04.379 
what our angles should be what can't
should<00:06:01.840> be<00:06:02.050> how<00:06:02.979> our<00:06:03.190> boots<00:06:03.490> should<00:06:03.789> be<00:06:03.940> set<00:06:04.210> up

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
should be how our boots should be set up

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.080 
should be how our boots should be set up
and<00:06:05.110> then<00:06:05.289> on<00:06:05.440> a<00:06:05.470> typical<00:06:05.949> snowboard<00:06:06.759> we<00:06:06.940> get

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
and then on a typical snowboard we get

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.110 
and then on a typical snowboard we get
into<00:06:07.330> a<00:06:07.360> turn<00:06:07.690> and<00:06:07.900> the<00:06:08.020> board<00:06:08.289> bends<00:06:08.620> and<00:06:09.580> what

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
into a turn and the board bends and what

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.770 
into a turn and the board bends and what
happens

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
happens

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.050 
happens
all<00:06:11.139> those<00:06:11.530> cants<00:06:12.010> and<00:06:12.280> all<00:06:12.460> those<00:06:12.639> angles

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
all those cants and all those angles

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.020 
all those cants and all those angles
change<00:06:13.630> well<00:06:13.960> our<00:06:14.229> body<00:06:14.440> adapts<00:06:15.130> but<00:06:15.760> when<00:06:15.910> we

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
change well our body adapts but when we

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.750 
change well our body adapts but when we
hit<00:06:16.210> something<00:06:16.590> irregular<00:06:17.590> in<00:06:17.770> the<00:06:17.889> snow<00:06:18.160> it

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
hit something irregular in the snow it

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.240 
hit something irregular in the snow it
changes<00:06:19.510> very<00:06:19.599> very<00:06:20.169> rapidly<00:06:20.740> and<00:06:21.039> that

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
changes very very rapidly and that

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.820 
changes very very rapidly and that
throws<00:06:21.639> us<00:06:21.880> for<00:06:22.120> a<00:06:22.180> big<00:06:22.360> loop<00:06:22.570> by<00:06:23.470> doing

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
throws us for a big loop by doing

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.240 
throws us for a big loop by doing
something<00:06:24.220> like<00:06:24.250> this<00:06:24.669> our<00:06:25.570> stance<00:06:26.250> stays

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 
something like this our stance stays

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.969 
something like this our stance stays
static<00:06:27.970> it<00:06:28.389> never<00:06:28.720> moves<00:06:29.020> we<00:06:29.620> become<00:06:31.979> very

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979 
static it never moves we become very

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.700 
static it never moves we become very
very<00:06:33.310> stable<00:06:33.720> and<00:06:34.720> what's<00:06:34.990> going<00:06:35.289> on<00:06:35.409> with<00:06:35.590> the

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
very stable and what's going on with the
