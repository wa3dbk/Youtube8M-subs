00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
hair or something I cut a bunch of it

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.319 
hair or something I cut a bunch of it
off<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.379> because<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.370> was<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.700> healthy<00:00:45.000> it

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
off and because it was so healthy it

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.190 
off and because it was so healthy it
grew<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:45.870> fast<00:00:46.670> so<00:00:47.670> basically<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.719> had<00:00:49.020> short

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
grew so fast so basically I had short

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.540 
grew so fast so basically I had short
hair<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:49.469> probably<00:00:49.860> like<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.039> month<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.460> then

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
hair for probably like a month and then

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.490 
hair for probably like a month and then
it<00:00:50.670> was<00:00:50.789> medium<00:00:51.180> length<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.930> missed<00:00:52.350> my

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
it was medium length so I missed my

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.260 
it was medium length so I missed my
short<00:00:52.710> hair<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.100> did<00:00:53.340> cut<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.730> up<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.149> my

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
short hair so I did cut it up to my

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.630 
short hair so I did cut it up to my
shoulders<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.930> little<00:00:55.320> yeah<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.010> guess<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:56.550> a

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
shoulders a little yeah I guess it's a

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.500 
shoulders a little yeah I guess it's a
little<00:00:56.789> straight<00:00:57.180> right<00:00:57.329> now

healthiest<00:03:34.989> for<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.709> 50th<00:03:36.130> time<00:03:36.160> because<00:03:36.640> I

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
healthiest for the 50th time because I

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.320
