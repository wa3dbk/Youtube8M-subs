00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
the small details I need to install the

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.189 
the small details I need to install the
magnetic<00:00:18.610> catches<00:00:19.060> so<00:00:19.240> when<00:00:19.360> the<00:00:19.449> doors<00:00:19.690> close

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
magnetic catches so when the doors close

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.589 
magnetic catches so when the doors close
they<00:00:20.890> stop<00:00:21.189> at<00:00:21.429> the<00:00:21.490> right<00:00:21.670> spot<00:00:21.970> and<00:00:22.330> stay

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599 
they stop at the right spot and stay

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.990 
they stop at the right spot and stay
closed<00:00:22.929> I<00:00:23.259> also<00:00:23.859> need<00:00:24.250> to<00:00:24.279> remove<00:00:24.670> all<00:00:24.880> the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
closed I also need to remove all the

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.570 
closed I also need to remove all the
hinges<00:00:25.240> and<00:00:25.599> grind<00:00:26.259> buff<00:00:26.679> and<00:00:26.920> polish<00:00:27.160> them

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
hinges and grind buff and polish them

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.820 
hinges and grind buff and polish them
and<00:00:27.820> that's<00:00:28.240> going<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:28.449> give<00:00:28.630> the<00:00:28.779> hinge<00:00:29.410> a

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
and that's going to give the hinge a

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.040 
and that's going to give the hinge a
much<00:00:30.339> nicer<00:00:30.550> look<00:00:30.910> more<00:00:31.119> of<00:00:31.179> a<00:00:31.240> handmade<00:00:31.720> feel

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050

much nicer look more of a handmade feel
I'm<00:00:32.680> going<00:00:32.920> to<00:00:32.980> start<00:00:33.250> with<00:00:33.400> the<00:00:33.520> hinges<00:00:33.910> and

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
I'm going to start with the hinges and

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.990 
I'm going to start with the hinges and
what<00:00:34.930> I<00:00:34.960> want<00:00:35.170> to<00:00:35.260> do<00:00:35.410> is<00:00:35.680> just<00:00:36.310> round<00:00:36.700> the

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
what I want to do is just round the

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.030 
what I want to do is just round the
hinge<00:00:37.240> over<00:00:37.540> a<00:00:37.750> little<00:00:38.050> bit<00:00:38.200> and<00:00:38.410> for<00:00:38.740> that<00:00:38.860> I'm

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
hinge over a little bit and for that I'm

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:51.290 
hinge over a little bit and for that I'm
going<00:00:39.160> to<00:00:39.190> use<00:00:39.370> the<00:00:39.670> bench<00:00:39.850> grinder

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.810 

I've<00:00:52.300> just<00:00:52.690> finished<00:00:53.130> rounding<00:00:54.130> over<00:00:54.280> this

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
I've just finished rounding over this

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.740 
I've just finished rounding over this
hinge<00:00:55.180> here

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
hinge here

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.390 
hinge here
the<00:00:56.140> one<00:00:56.320> in<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.470> center<00:00:56.770> you<00:00:57.010> can<00:00:57.130> see<00:00:57.280> it's

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.950 
the one in the center you can see it's
rounded<00:00:57.820> over<00:00:58.090> a<00:00:58.120> little<00:00:58.360> bit<00:00:58.480> at<00:00:58.660> the<00:00:58.780> edge

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
rounded over a little bit at the edge

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.860 
rounded over a little bit at the edge
this<00:00:59.830> one<00:01:00.070> is<00:01:00.340> directly<00:01:01.090> out<00:01:01.270> of<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.450> box<00:01:01.690> you

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
this one is directly out of the box you

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.079 
this one is directly out of the box you
see<00:01:01.989> it<00:01:02.170> has<00:01:02.290> sort<00:01:02.470> of<00:01:02.530> a<00:01:02.620> square<00:01:02.890> edge<00:01:03.250> now

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
see it has sort of a square edge now

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.510 
see it has sort of a square edge now
this<00:01:04.420> hinge<00:01:04.720> is<00:01:05.020> finished<00:01:05.620> I've<00:01:05.890> rounded<00:01:06.130> over

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
this hinge is finished I've rounded over

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.160 
this hinge is finished I've rounded over
the<00:01:06.610> edge<00:01:06.729> and<00:01:07.120> I've<00:01:07.210> buffed<00:01:07.540> it<00:01:07.690> out

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
the edge and I've buffed it out

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.890 
the edge and I've buffed it out
the<00:01:08.770> next<00:01:09.160> step<00:01:09.370> is<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:09.820> lightly<00:01:10.090> sand<00:01:10.540> the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
the next step is to lightly sand the

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.830 
the next step is to lightly sand the
lacquer<00:01:11.710> finish<00:01:12.369> off<00:01:12.670> of<00:01:13.060> this<00:01:13.180> hinge<00:01:13.570> and

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
lacquer finish off of this hinge and

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.810 
lacquer finish off of this hinge and
I'll<00:01:14.290> do<00:01:14.440> that<00:01:14.619> with<00:01:14.800> a<00:01:14.830> piece<00:01:15.070> of<00:01:15.100> 150

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
I'll do that with a piece of 150

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.969 
I'll do that with a piece of 150
sandpaper<00:01:16.360> now<00:01:16.900> generally<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:17.560> hinge<00:01:17.830> is

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
sandpaper now generally the hinge is

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.010 
sandpaper now generally the hinge is
going<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.430> come<00:01:18.700> with<00:01:18.940> a<00:01:19.000> coat<00:01:19.390> of<00:01:19.420> lacquer<00:01:19.750> on

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
going to come with a coat of lacquer on

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.960 
going to come with a coat of lacquer on
it<00:01:20.080> and<00:01:20.380> that's<00:01:20.920> there<00:01:21.190> to<00:01:21.340> keep<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.729> hinge

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
it and that's there to keep the hinge

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.940 
it and that's there to keep the hinge
from<00:01:22.300> tarnishing<00:01:22.930> because<00:01:23.320> brass<00:01:23.649> will

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
from tarnishing because brass will

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.490 
from tarnishing because brass will
tarnish<00:01:24.190> it<00:01:24.580> turns<00:01:25.149> sort<00:01:25.450> of<00:01:25.509> a<00:01:25.600> warm<00:01:25.930> green

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
tarnish it turns sort of a warm green

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.310 
tarnish it turns sort of a warm green
kind<00:01:26.920> of<00:01:26.979> a<00:01:27.100> color<00:01:27.390> but<00:01:28.390> I<00:01:28.420> want<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.930> hinge<00:01:29.140> to

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
kind of a color but I want the hinge to

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.770 
kind of a color but I want the hinge to
tarnish<00:01:29.590> so<00:01:30.070> it's<00:01:30.250> going<00:01:30.430> to<00:01:30.580> start<00:01:30.880> out<00:01:31.119> when

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
tarnish so it's going to start out when

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.600 
tarnish so it's going to start out when
I<00:01:31.810> deliver<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.320> cabinet<00:01:32.770> with<00:01:33.220> sort<00:01:33.490> of<00:01:33.550> a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
I deliver the cabinet with sort of a

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.600 
I deliver the cabinet with sort of a
shiny<00:01:33.880> brass<00:01:34.479> yellow<00:01:35.290> feel<00:01:35.590> but<00:01:36.190> over<00:01:36.399> time

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
shiny brass yellow feel but over time

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.120 
shiny brass yellow feel but over time
it's<00:01:36.910> going<00:01:37.119> to<00:01:37.270> take<00:01:37.450> on<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:37.660> sort<00:01:38.080> of<00:01:38.130> warm

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
it's going to take on that sort of warm

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.200 
it's going to take on that sort of warm
greenish<00:01:40.500> patina<00:01:41.500> so<00:01:42.280> what<00:01:42.820> I'm<00:01:42.910> gonna<00:01:43.000> do

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
greenish patina so what I'm gonna do

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.120 
greenish patina so what I'm gonna do
first<00:01:43.450> is<00:01:43.810> just<00:01:44.140> lightly<00:01:44.410> sand<00:01:44.740> it<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.040> the

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
first is just lightly sand it and the

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.790 
first is just lightly sand it and the
reason<00:01:45.369> why<00:01:45.430> I'm<00:01:45.520> doing<00:01:45.580> that<00:01:45.790> is<00:01:46.410> by<00:01:47.410> removing

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
reason why I'm doing that is by removing

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.510 
reason why I'm doing that is by removing
the<00:01:48.340> or<00:01:49.270> most<00:01:49.600> of<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:49.930> lacquer<00:01:50.170> it<00:01:50.619> seems<00:01:51.280> to

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
the or most of the lacquer it seems to

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.289 
the or most of the lacquer it seems to
buff<00:01:51.759> easier<00:01:52.390> on<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:52.960> buffing<00:01:53.289> wheel<00:01:57.150> ok<00:01:58.150> well

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
buff easier on the buffing wheel ok well

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.149 
buff easier on the buffing wheel ok well
that<00:01:58.450> looks<00:01:58.630> pretty<00:01:58.690> good<00:01:58.930> and<00:01:59.530> now<00:01:59.920> I'm<00:02:00.010> going

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
that looks pretty good and now I'm going

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.280 
that looks pretty good and now I'm going
to<00:02:00.250> polish<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.909> hinge<00:02:01.150> on<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.780> buffing<00:02:02.140> wheel

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
to polish the hinge on the buffing wheel

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.230 
to polish the hinge on the buffing wheel
and<00:02:02.560> occasionally<00:02:03.520> you're<00:02:03.700> gonna<00:02:03.790> see<00:02:04.090> me

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
and occasionally you're gonna see me

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.539 
and occasionally you're gonna see me
hold<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:04.570> red<00:02:04.869> bar<00:02:05.200> against<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.159> buffing

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
hold this red bar against the buffing

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:06.899 
hold this red bar against the buffing
wheel

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
wheel

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.840 
wheel
this<00:02:07.330> is<00:02:07.479> buffing<00:02:07.930> Rouge<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.619> this<00:02:09.580> just

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
this is buffing Rouge and this just

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.120 
this is buffing Rouge and this just
helps<00:02:10.269> to<00:02:10.330> get<00:02:10.600> a<00:02:10.780> really<00:02:11.049> nice<00:02:11.200> smooth<00:02:11.620> finish

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
helps to get a really nice smooth finish

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:24.130 
helps to get a really nice smooth finish
on<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.519> brass

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.790 

I<00:02:28.360> finished<00:02:29.360> buffing<00:02:29.630> one<00:02:29.959> of<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.140> hinges<00:02:30.350> and

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
I finished buffing one of the hinges and

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.100 
I finished buffing one of the hinges and
I<00:02:31.280> hung<00:02:31.550> this<00:02:31.730> door<00:02:31.970> that<00:02:32.330> has<00:02:32.600> already<00:02:32.930> been

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
I hung this door that has already been

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.699 
I hung this door that has already been
primed

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
primed

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.949 
primed
let's<00:02:34.280> bring<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:34.700> camera<00:02:35.150> in<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:35.750> take<00:02:35.930> a

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
let's bring the camera in and take a

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.870 
let's bring the camera in and take a
look<00:02:36.200> at<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.380> difference<00:02:36.830> between<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.640> hinge

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
look at the difference between the hinge

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.880 
look at the difference between the hinge
that's<00:02:38.000> been<00:02:38.270> buffed<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.620> one<00:02:39.770> that

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
that's been buffed and the one that

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.130 
that's been buffed and the one that
hasn't<00:02:40.069> here's<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.120> hinge<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.570> hasn't<00:02:41.959> been

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
hasn't here's a hinge that hasn't been

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.380 
hasn't here's a hinge that hasn't been
buffed<00:02:42.530> or<00:02:42.800> shaped<00:02:43.310> that's<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.120> very

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
buffed or shaped that's a very

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.510 
buffed or shaped that's a very
mechanical<00:02:45.200> kind<00:02:45.500> of<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:45.770> look<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.280> and

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
mechanical kind of a look to it and

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.850 
mechanical kind of a look to it and
here's<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.180> same<00:02:47.420> hinge<00:02:47.750> after<00:02:48.590> it's<00:02:48.709> been

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
here's the same hinge after it's been

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.500 
here's the same hinge after it's been
shaped<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.250> polished<00:02:49.459> now<00:02:50.150> I<00:02:50.180> need<00:02:50.390> to

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
shaped and polished now I need to

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.750 
shaped and polished now I need to
install<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.080> magnetic<00:02:51.530> caddies<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.160> they'll

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
install the magnetic caddies and they'll

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.550 
install the magnetic caddies and they'll
also<00:02:53.090> act<00:02:53.239> like<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.480> doorstop<00:02:53.989> so<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.350> door

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
also act like a doorstop so the door

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.910 
also act like a doorstop so the door
will<00:02:54.770> stop<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.760> then<00:02:56.270> stays<00:02:56.570> shut<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.800> the

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
will stop and then stays shut so the

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.390 
will stop and then stays shut so the
first<00:02:58.160> step<00:02:58.400> is<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:59.500> cut<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.680> block<00:03:01.130> of<00:03:01.370> wood

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
first step is to cut a block of wood

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.150 
first step is to cut a block of wood
because<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.000> need<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.540> piece<00:03:03.170> of<00:03:03.350> wood<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.590> attach

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
because I need a piece of wood to attach

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.699 
because I need a piece of wood to attach
the<00:03:04.489> catches<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.300> so<00:03:06.080> instead<00:03:06.320> of<00:03:06.380> just<00:03:06.560> a

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
the catches to so instead of just a

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.560 
the catches to so instead of just a
square<00:03:07.130> block<00:03:07.459> of<00:03:07.670> wood<00:03:07.820> I'll<00:03:07.970> shape<00:03:08.269> it<00:03:08.480> a

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
square block of wood I'll shape it a

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.000 
square block of wood I'll shape it a
little<00:03:08.750> bit<00:03:08.930> so<00:03:09.410> it<00:03:09.500> looks<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.709> little<00:03:09.800> bit

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
little bit so it looks a little bit

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.850 
little bit so it looks a little bit
nicer<00:03:10.040> I'm<00:03:10.940> using<00:03:11.180> a<00:03:11.330> piece<00:03:11.570> of<00:03:11.600> poplar<00:03:12.019> that

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
nicer I'm using a piece of poplar that

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.370 
nicer I'm using a piece of poplar that
measures<00:03:13.190> 2<00:03:13.489> by<00:03:14.239> 8<00:03:14.510> inches<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:15.170> I'm<00:03:15.230> going<00:03:15.350> to

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
measures 2 by 8 inches and I'm going to

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.110 
measures 2 by 8 inches and I'm going to
mount<00:03:15.620> this<00:03:15.800> to<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.070> inside<00:03:16.489> of<00:03:16.550> the<00:03:16.700> cabinet

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
mount this to the inside of the cabinet

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.940 
mount this to the inside of the cabinet
and<00:03:17.300> that's<00:03:17.870> what<00:03:18.019> I'll<00:03:18.110> mount<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.590> men<00:03:18.769> that

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
and that's what I'll mount the men that

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.280 
and that's what I'll mount the men that
it<00:03:19.040> catches<00:03:19.250> too<00:03:19.670> but<00:03:20.360> I<00:03:20.390> don't<00:03:20.570> want<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:20.780> just

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
it catches too but I don't want to just

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.050 
it catches too but I don't want to just
mount<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.680> square<00:03:22.100> block<00:03:22.400> of<00:03:22.610> wood<00:03:22.820> on<00:03:22.970> the

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
mount a square block of wood on the

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.400 
mount a square block of wood on the
inside<00:03:23.360> of<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.510> cabinet<00:03:23.810> because<00:03:23.930> it<00:03:24.290> just

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
inside of the cabinet because it just

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.590 
inside of the cabinet because it just
looks<00:03:24.650> sloppy<00:03:24.850> so<00:03:25.850> what<00:03:25.970> I've<00:03:26.060> done<00:03:26.180> is<00:03:26.360> I've

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
looks sloppy so what I've done is I've

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.539 
looks sloppy so what I've done is I've
measured<00:03:27.140> a<00:03:27.320> quarter<00:03:27.620> of<00:03:27.709> an<00:03:27.769> inch<00:03:27.860> in<00:03:28.130> and

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
measured a quarter of an inch in and

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.130 
measured a quarter of an inch in and
from<00:03:28.880> this<00:03:29.030> quarter<00:03:29.420> inch<00:03:29.630> mark

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
from this quarter inch mark

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:42.910 
from this quarter inch mark
I'll<00:03:30.410> cut<00:03:31.100> on<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:31.370> 45<00:03:31.459> degree<00:03:32.060> angle

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.430 

I'm<00:03:43.920> going<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.370> attach<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:45.090> cleat<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.720> the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
I'm going to attach the cleat to the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.230 
I'm going to attach the cleat to the
back<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:46.890> face<00:03:47.040> frame<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.760> I'm<00:03:48.030> going<00:03:48.180> to

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
back of the face frame and I'm going to

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.240 
back of the face frame and I'm going to
use<00:03:48.390> an<00:03:48.570> inch<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.110> five-eighths<00:03:49.530> long<00:03:49.800> screw

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
use an inch and five-eighths long screw

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.340 
use an inch and five-eighths long screw
and<00:03:50.820> I<00:03:50.880> want<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.120> be<00:03:51.210> careful<00:03:51.480> that<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:51.930> don't

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
and I want to be careful that I don't

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.560 
and I want to be careful that I don't
accidentally<00:03:53.100> send<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.550> screw<00:03:53.910> through<00:03:54.420> the

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
accidentally send the screw through the

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.170 
accidentally send the screw through the
front<00:03:54.930> of<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.230> face<00:03:55.440> ring<00:03:55.710> so<00:03:56.610> I'm<00:03:56.880> going<00:03:57.120> to

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
front of the face ring so I'm going to

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.470 
front of the face ring so I'm going to
measure<00:03:57.480> an<00:03:57.780> inch<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.470> an<00:03:59.460> eighth<00:03:59.730> up<00:03:59.970> on<00:04:00.330> the

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
measure an inch and an eighth up on the

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.450 
measure an inch and an eighth up on the
cleat<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.020> this<00:04:01.770> is<00:04:01.890> where<00:04:02.160> I'm<00:04:02.250> going<00:04:02.370> to

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
cleat and this is where I'm going to

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.460 
cleat and this is where I'm going to
drill<00:04:02.640> my<00:04:02.940> hole<00:04:03.210> or<00:04:03.420> pre-drill<00:04:03.960> my<00:04:04.110> hole<00:04:04.320> and

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
drill my hole or pre-drill my hole and

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.460 
drill my hole or pre-drill my hole and
that<00:04:05.250> way<00:04:05.490> I'll<00:04:05.760> only<00:04:06.000> be<00:04:06.270> catching<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:07.200> face

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
that way I'll only be catching the face

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.010 
that way I'll only be catching the face
frame<00:04:07.830> with<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.640> half<00:04:09.090> of<00:04:09.270> an<00:04:09.390> inch<00:04:09.510> of<00:04:09.780> the

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
frame with a half of an inch of the

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:17.810 
frame with a half of an inch of the
screw

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.630 

okay<00:04:18.820> clamped<00:04:19.480> the<00:04:19.720> cleat<00:04:19.930> in<00:04:20.020> place<00:04:20.290> and<00:04:20.640> now

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
okay clamped the cleat in place and now

like this so I like to make these frames
it's<00:06:19.669> actually<00:06:19.940> kind<00:06:20.120> of<00:06:20.150> a<00:06:20.240> frame<00:06:20.509> system

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
it's actually kind of a frame system

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.580 
it's actually kind of a frame system
where<00:06:21.860> you<00:06:21.949> have<00:06:22.070> a<00:06:22.130> frame<00:06:22.430> and<00:06:22.729> a<00:06:23.210> panel<00:06:23.750> that

where you have a frame and a panel that

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.689 
where you have a frame and a panel that
fits<00:06:24.889> right<00:06:25.130> in<00:06:25.340> there
