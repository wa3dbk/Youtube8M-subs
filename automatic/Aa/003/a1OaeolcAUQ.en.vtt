00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
the acting go back to the boxing it was

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.640 
the acting go back to the boxing it was
very<00:02:47.910> humbling<00:02:48.240> experience<00:02:48.600> because<00:02:49.230> your

record as a fighter
okay<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.420> think<00:02:51.870> it's<00:02:51.990> like<00:02:52.170> eight<00:02:52.410> wins<00:02:52.680> and

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
okay I think it's like eight wins and

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.970 
okay I think it's like eight wins and
six<00:02:53.640> knockouts<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.240> two<00:02:54.420> draws<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.920> you

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
six knockouts and two draws and so you

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.230 
six knockouts and two draws and so you
had<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.190> winning<00:02:56.460> record<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:56.880> that's<00:02:57.060> pretty

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
had a winning record so that's pretty

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.270 
had a winning record so that's pretty
