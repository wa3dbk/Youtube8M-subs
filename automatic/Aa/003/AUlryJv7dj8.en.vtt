00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.849
 Who at home knows the moment? 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.280
 sure to make the oil change of your 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.110
 car, are you sure you know? 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.059
 but you have important information that you 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.789
 can not fail to take into account 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.100
 when it comes to making the exchange that helps us 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.800
 the keys after-sales manager 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.900
 today is a good day people are taking in 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.439
 count the footage to make the exchange 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.230
 of oil 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.240
 that's correct, good morning, it's correct 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.250
 should take into account mileage but 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.590
 same time not only observing the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.559
 he has to see the time of 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.270
 use the oil he put you want 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.370
 say that even if he does not use the car 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.210
 and car stays there for a year or 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.360
 six months 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.250
 this time account this replacement account 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.610
 and who does not use the car the person 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.100
 wheel in a few courses is that 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.079
 wheel in small routes 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.660
 she left to turn 100 meters to the car 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.370
 this person has the probability and 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.680
 far more oil than wear 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.460
 person using your vehicle 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.909
 constantly a person who runs 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.920
 rather then that durability of the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.229
 This oil loss is going to be fine. 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.460
 greater for who runs - example is always 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.780
 important to take into consideration to 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.420
 now how will the customer know the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.369
 person who has a car will know if the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.259
 oil time has already expired if 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.790
 exchange what the information is today 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.799
 when the person exchanges the engine oil 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.740
 is always placed quetta in the poison 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.810
 dedicating their next exchange is 7 500 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.130
 usually put by the date of the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.759
 mileage 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.189
 I put a look at 10 000 and 10 places 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.530
 thousand or 1 before that date which 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.570
 compare the first time I rode 5 thousand in 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.030
 one year I have to put this oil 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.110
 engine and a year does not reach the 10 thousand 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.390
 Euros to time to change 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.140
 even if we did not reach the 10,000 in the hour of 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.720
 touch 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.189
 we have two types of oil on the market 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.280
 is how the person will know that 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.860
 types are these and which is the best 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.200
 best type of oil to put on the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.450
 your car is the oil indicated by 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.130
 the manufacturer that the engine project was 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.740
 for that oil and 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.880
 all the gaps and legs and motor 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.370
 so he has a durability 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.680
 better he has to use the oil 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.230
 recommended by the manufacturer. 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.900
 every manufacturer indicates an oil for 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.450
 synthetic oil and synthetic oil is a 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.750
 better quality oil and more additives 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.240
 has more chemistry and eye enveloping a 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.550
 oil that provides unification and 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.350
 a much better engine life 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.240
 Thank you for the information so 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.520
 not only for the footage but also for the 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.130
 time that an oil remains an engine of 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.060
 your car ultra and it is important to 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.060
 make replacement
