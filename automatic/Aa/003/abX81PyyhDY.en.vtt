00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.029
 Hello dear friends with you necrosis 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.420
 and I am sure that such a review from me 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:13.139
 none of you expected yes this is the same 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.120
 lego is bionicles and i generally loved 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.760
 get carried away either when was small and 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.180
 often asked mom to buy me this or 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.910
 in addition to a set of bionics I had 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.199
 other sets are so classic 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.689
 There police firefighters any such 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.690
 but the bionicles caught me the most 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.770
 First I want to say oleg 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.370
 this is a very ingenious thing and 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.090
 the material is very durable it can 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.660
 long kept it quite flexible in 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:54.149
 There is a use plan for parts 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:57.149
 a lot of extra holes in a good way 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.500
 hole some gadgets can 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.500
 add some 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.100
 feci that is it is possible from we admit here 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:12.409
 let's see who you are 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:19.900
 not kl and to figure it all started with 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:22.850
 then if I'm not mistaken, and these 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.830
 blue green white it to that of the second 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.880
 release I had more classic they 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:33.740
 all disassembled even show right here at 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.080
 me all the parts are kept vice and even 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.630
 a couple of books left sure that there is 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.979
 bag in the nightstand there are more details and 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:49.940
 most likely there are missing parts 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:52.220
 BIONICLE but what's the catch here is that these here 2 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.869
 release they well, maybe this is not the second 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.560
 release maybe i'm wrong but for me it is 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.830
 was second 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.300
 they had such mechanisms for 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.149
 rock work could even two hands 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.700
 include if additional gear 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:11.200
 put armor appeared and improved 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.200
 the mask is more beautiful 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.870
 then I started buying 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.230
 barracks not evolved ie 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.019
 this is the first release of the barracks they were famous for 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.909
 so that they could be like this 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:34.269
 put in a bun that is, they like 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:36.640
 well rolled it could be seen by 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:40.000
 trailer but the post on the table of course it 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.939
 The quality is not very good but I think 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.750
 that you understood and still had capsules with these 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.030
 barracks to 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.120
 in which they were sold and could 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:53.459
 them for some place in my here for it 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.459
 place to hang 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.140
 they had such interesting ones 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.160
 masks 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:09.350
 special slots for them look at 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:14.850
 each their own and it seems they were dependent on 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:18.240
 the colors of the fangs of these here let's set 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.720
 to the place and also they had such 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:25.370
 interesting function yes with a rubber band here 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.370
 we press it they beat their head like that 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.710
 also very cool thing naturally 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:40.410
 there are additional holes on the body 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:43.580
 and you can stir up something here 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:49.980
 arms at least and on his feet there 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:51.630
 so on the one hand bionicle can 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.050
 assemble according to the instructions on the other hand 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.500
 you are not deprived of the flight of fancy 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.390
 more than three of three for example three 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.560
 different barracks and 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.760
 of three different then it was possible to collect 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.080
 big geone who 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.990
 but my most favorite bionicle 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.570
 there were these rakshi here naturally I am not 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.340
 could neither buy black 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.230
 First of all, I myself liked the form 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.440
 there were very such aggressive pain 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:26.370
 secondly, I liked the idea of such 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.950
 side impact using the mechanism to me 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.460
 I liked the fact that they had a goal in their head 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.170
 different sides were spinning as in 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.169
 In principle, I liked everything very much 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.680
 strongly idea with these 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.349
 with your knees on hinges 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.229
 really look like a human joint 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:47.749
 a little bit and not somehow parks here 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:52.320
 Somehow more interesting these feet are very 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:57.840
 comfortable because it creates 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:00.570
 well let's say stability well and of course 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.730
 did they have like cleaning in their masks 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.440
 but I already called them from really brains 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:09.960
 because they really don't seem 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:13.050
 this case opens and here it is a nymph 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.890
 this brain because each had its own 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.810
 this one seems to be the right black product 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.870
 gray 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:24.180
 I was still brown and blue I am not 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.020
 I remember but in fact I have a lot of them if 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.450
 look posobirat so friends 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.050

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:36.920
