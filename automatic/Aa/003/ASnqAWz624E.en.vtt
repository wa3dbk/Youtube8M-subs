00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
in alignment with the band were actually

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.930 
in alignment with the band were actually
instead<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.560> being<00:01:31.590> at<00:01:31.860> an<00:01:31.950> angle<00:01:32.310> it'll<00:01:32.760> be

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
instead of it being at an angle it'll be

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.250 
instead of it being at an angle it'll be
going<00:01:33.090> straight<00:01:33.420> up<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.720> down<00:01:33.750> okay<00:01:34.200> so

would<00:01:46.620> do<00:01:46.800> is<00:01:47.040> when<00:01:47.910> you<00:01:48.030> first<00:01:48.240> get<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.510> band

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
would do is when you first get the band

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.040 
would do is when you first get the band
you<00:01:49.590> would<00:01:49.680> go<00:01:49.830> ahead<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.580> loop<00:01:50.760> it<00:01:50.850> around

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
you would go ahead and loop it around

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.420 
you would go ahead and loop it around
and<00:01:52.050> put<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.350> through<00:01:52.590> one<00:01:52.650> little<00:01:53.040> part<00:01:53.250> like

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
and put it through one little part like

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.760 
and put it through one little part like
this<00:01:53.610> okay<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:55.020> got<00:01:55.170> some<00:01:55.350> kind<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.620> see

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
this okay that you got some kind of see

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.160 
this okay that you got some kind of see
you<00:01:56.070> get<00:01:56.190> a<00:01:56.220> better<00:01:56.430> look<00:01:56.870> kind<00:01:57.870> of<00:01:57.930> get<00:01:58.050> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
you get a better look kind of get the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.380 
you get a better look kind of get the
idea<00:01:58.230> it's<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.220> a<00:01:59.310> big<00:01:59.520> rubber<00:01:59.700> band<00:01:59.940> you

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
idea it's like a big rubber band you

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.100 
idea it's like a big rubber band you
take<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.470> part<00:02:01.680> pull<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.010> out<00:02:02.190> oops

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
take this part pull it out oops

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.590 
take this part pull it out oops
anyway<00:02:04.110> alright<00:02:04.980> and<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.700> loop<00:02:06.450> it

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
anyway alright and you just loop it

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.589 
anyway alright and you just loop it
through<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.960> running<00:02:07.770> on<00:02:07.920> up<00:02:08.159> here<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.700> when

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
through it running on up here and when

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.759 
through it running on up here and when
you<00:02:09.690> get<00:02:09.810> up<00:02:09.929> here<00:02:09.959> let<00:02:10.229> me<00:02:10.259> go<00:02:10.379> ahead<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.590> on

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
you get up here let me go ahead and on

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.830 
you get up here let me go ahead and on
fasten<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.459> guys<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:11.700> see<00:02:12.120> now<00:02:12.720> this

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
fasten it so you guys can see now this

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.420 
fasten it so you guys can see now this
is<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.080> reason<00:02:13.349> why<00:02:13.440> I<00:02:13.470> double<00:02:13.890> knot<00:02:14.129> it<00:02:14.280> like

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
is the reason why I double knot it like

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.820 
is the reason why I double knot it like
this<00:02:14.640> it's<00:02:15.269> so<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.599> could<00:02:15.810> have<00:02:15.989> you

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
this it's so that you could have you

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.710 
this it's so that you could have you
know<00:02:16.980> saying<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.610> right<00:02:17.790> type<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.360> resistance

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
know saying the right type of resistance

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.059 
know saying the right type of resistance
that<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:18.989> need<00:02:19.170> if<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.590> just<00:02:19.769> do<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:19.950> like

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
that you need if you just do it like

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.289 
that you need if you just do it like
this<00:02:20.400> there's<00:02:20.640> not<00:02:20.730> going<00:02:20.879> to<00:02:20.940> be<00:02:21.000> enough

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
this there's not going to be enough

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.239 
this there's not going to be enough
resistance<00:02:21.840> when<00:02:21.989> you<00:02:22.079> go<00:02:22.230> down<00:02:22.409> okay<00:02:22.799> you<00:02:22.980> see

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:23.249 
resistance when you go down okay you see

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.220 
resistance when you go down okay you see
how<00:02:23.280> loose<00:02:23.549> it<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.599> what<00:02:24.749> you<00:02:24.870> want<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.079> do

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
how loose it is so what you want to do

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.640 
how loose it is so what you want to do
is

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
is

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.069 
is

off in the last part so as you guys can
see<00:02:37.349> um<00:02:37.860> let's<00:02:38.819> say<00:02:38.939> the<00:02:39.000> dump<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:40.049> ban<00:02:40.260> is

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
see um let's say the dump the the ban is

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.800 
see um let's say the dump the the ban is
looped<00:02:40.799> around<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.640> dumbbell<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.659> I'm

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
looped around the dumbbell and I'm

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.599 
looped around the dumbbell and I'm
rolling<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.230> up<00:02:43.379> now<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.010> don't<00:02:44.250> want<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.430> have

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
rolling it up now you don't want to have

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.190 
rolling it up now you don't want to have
it<00:02:44.730> this<00:02:44.849> loose<00:02:45.150> okay<00:02:45.510> because<00:02:45.750> when<00:02:45.989> you<00:02:46.079> go

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
it this loose okay because when you go

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.270 
it this loose okay because when you go
down<00:02:46.379> there's<00:02:46.590> not<00:02:46.709> going<00:02:46.859> to<00:02:46.920> be<00:02:46.980> enough

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
down there's not going to be enough

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.740 
down there's not going to be enough
resistance<00:02:47.640> okay<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.299> want<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.599> make<00:02:48.720> sure

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
resistance okay so you want to make sure

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.039 
resistance okay so you want to make sure
that<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.140> pull<00:02:50.040> pull<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:51.000> band<00:02:51.209> up<00:02:51.540> twist

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
that you pull pull the band up twist

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.069 
that you pull pull the band up twist
loop<00:02:52.620> twist<00:02:53.579> and<00:02:53.909> loop<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.239> around<00:02:54.299> again<00:02:54.659> okay

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
loop twist and loop it around again okay

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.680 
loop twist and loop it around again okay
let<00:02:55.379> me<00:02:55.470> go<00:02:55.560> ahead<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.709> show<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:55.980> guys<00:02:56.690> I'm

just look at what I'm doing alright so
anyway<00:03:01.920> you're<00:03:02.010> gonna<00:03:02.129> go<00:03:02.310> ahead<00:03:02.400> put<00:03:03.269> your

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
anyway you're gonna go ahead put your

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.300 
anyway you're gonna go ahead put your
foot<00:03:03.750> on<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.230> dumbbell<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:04.889> that<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.159> won't

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
foot on the dumbbell so that it won't

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.830 
foot on the dumbbell so that it won't
move<00:03:05.579> or<00:03:05.940> anything<00:03:06.030> like<00:03:06.389> that<00:03:06.450> from<00:03:06.810> the

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
move or anything like that from the

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.970 
move or anything like that from the
increased<00:03:07.319> pressure<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:07.769> you're<00:03:07.950> putting

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
increased pressure that you're putting

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.280 
increased pressure that you're putting
if<00:03:08.370> you're<00:03:08.459> going<00:03:08.549> to<00:03:08.639> be<00:03:08.700> pulling<00:03:08.970> up<00:03:09.209> okay<00:03:09.540> so

if you need to use heavier go ahead and

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.979 
if you need to use heavier go ahead and
use<00:03:13.859> heavier<00:03:14.280> ones<00:03:14.549> a<00:03:14.760> pen<00:03:15.000> like<00:03:15.480> these<00:03:15.659> banks

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989

bench<00:04:08.940> presses<00:04:09.359> with<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.870> resistance<00:04:10.260> videos

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
bench presses with the resistance videos

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.640 
bench presses with the resistance videos
okay<00:04:11.030> damn<00:04:12.030> open<00:04:12.359> a<00:04:12.449> to<00:04:12.510> Dart<00:04:12.900> okay<00:04:13.139> can<00:04:13.620> you

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
to go ahead and do some bench presses

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.360 
to go ahead and do some bench presses
for<00:04:19.139> you<00:04:19.199> guys<00:04:19.380> just<00:04:19.409> to<00:04:19.650> demonstrate<00:04:19.889> real

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
fast and then let me get back to my

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.409 
fast and then let me get back to my
workout<00:04:22.109> so<00:04:22.800> anyway<00:04:23.159> man<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.820> whole<00:04:24.000> point<00:04:24.330> of

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
workout so anyway man the whole point of

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.260 
workout so anyway man the whole point of
view<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.810> resist

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
view to resist

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.999 
view to resist
when<00:04:25.960> you're<00:04:26.080> doing<00:04:26.229> your<00:04:26.349> bench<00:04:26.620> pressing

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
when you're doing your bench pressing

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:28.200 
when you're doing your bench pressing
this<00:04:27.129> to<00:04:27.220> help<00:04:27.400> you<00:04:27.520> increase<00:04:27.819> your<00:04:27.910> bench

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
this to help you increase your bench

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.230 
this to help you increase your bench
press<00:04:28.300> by<00:04:29.080> helping<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:29.889> strengthen<00:04:30.550> the

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
press by helping you strengthen the

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.050 
press by helping you strengthen the
locking<00:04:31.690> point<00:04:32.020> of<00:04:32.440> your<00:04:33.129> bench<00:04:33.490> press<00:04:33.580> okay

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
locking point of your bench press okay

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.149 
locking point of your bench press okay
so<00:04:34.599> that's<00:04:34.960> basically<00:04:35.259> just<00:04:35.409> part<00:04:35.860> of<00:04:36.039> the

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159 
so that's basically just part of the

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.249 
so that's basically just part of the
exercise<00:04:36.610> if<00:04:37.419> you're<00:04:37.569> laying<00:04:37.750> down<00:04:37.930> on<00:04:38.199> a

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
exercise if you're laying down on a

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:40.920 
exercise if you're laying down on a
bench<00:04:38.500> go<00:04:39.250> ahead<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:39.550> put<00:04:39.699> the<00:04:39.789> bar<00:04:39.970> up<00:04:40.300> when

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
bench go ahead and put the bar up when

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.960 
bench go ahead and put the bar up when
you<00:04:41.020> go<00:04:41.169> down<00:04:41.470> the<00:04:41.919> resistive<00:04:42.370> bands<00:04:42.580> get

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
you go down the resistive bands get

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.909 
you go down the resistive bands get
lighter<00:04:43.300> and<00:04:43.750> you<00:04:44.139> know<00:04:44.259> it's<00:04:44.379> not<00:04:44.470> that<00:04:44.770> much

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
lighter and you know it's not that much

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.040 
lighter and you know it's not that much
resistance<00:04:45.340> so<00:04:45.759> the<00:04:46.210> weight<00:04:46.419> actually<00:04:46.659> gets

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
resistance so the weight actually gets

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.990 
resistance so the weight actually gets
lighter<00:04:47.500> and<00:04:48.099> then<00:04:48.280> when<00:04:48.460> you<00:04:48.520> push<00:04:48.759> back<00:04:48.970> up

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
lighter and then when you push back up

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.969 
lighter and then when you push back up
the<00:04:49.419> resistant<00:04:49.870> bands<00:04:50.169> pretty<00:04:50.379> much<00:04:50.560> tighten

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
the resistant bands pretty much tighten

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.640 
the resistant bands pretty much tighten
up<00:04:51.129> and<00:04:51.699> then<00:04:51.909> it<00:04:52.090> causes<00:04:52.990> you<00:04:53.319> to<00:04:53.349> use<00:04:53.620> a

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
up and then it causes you to use a

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.219 
up and then it causes you to use a
little<00:04:53.979> bit<00:04:54.069> more<00:04:54.190> on<00:04:54.789> muscle<00:04:55.720> fibers<00:04:56.110> in

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
little bit more on muscle fibers in

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.809 
little bit more on muscle fibers in
order<00:04:56.440> to<00:04:56.500> push<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:56.860> weight<00:04:57.009> back<00:04:57.250> up<00:04:57.490> okay<00:04:57.759> so

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:57.819 
order to push the weight back up okay so

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.059 
order to push the weight back up okay so
and<00:04:58.240> also<00:04:58.599> increase<00:04:59.110> increases<00:04:59.620> your<00:04:59.770> speed

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.069 
and also increase increases your speed

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:01.499 
and also increase increases your speed
on<00:05:00.280> the<00:05:00.400> bench<00:05:00.610> press<00:05:00.669> and<00:05:01.000> everything<00:05:01.210> like

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
on the bench press and everything like

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.830 
on the bench press and everything like
that<00:05:01.539> so<00:05:01.720> real<00:05:02.500> great<00:05:02.800> thumb<00:05:03.479> exercise<00:05:04.479> to<00:05:04.690> do

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
that so real great thumb exercise to do
