00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.999 
past couple years understanding it and
beginning<00:01:49.209> to<00:01:49.329> take<00:01:49.509> ownership<00:01:49.630> with<00:01:50.109> it<00:01:50.319> now

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
beginning to take ownership with it now

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.519 
beginning to take ownership with it now
our<00:01:51.159> hope<00:01:51.369> is<00:01:51.549> that<00:01:51.579> students<00:01:52.359> might<00:01:53.200> do<00:01:53.380> the

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:53.529 
our hope is that students might do the

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:55.980 
our hope is that students might do the
same<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:53.950> that<00:01:54.630> eventually<00:01:55.630> we're<00:01:55.869> also

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
same and that eventually we're also

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.019 
same and that eventually we're also
going<00:01:56.259> to<00:01:56.350> have<00:01:56.529> community<00:01:56.889> hopefully<00:01:57.849> take

00:01:58.019 --> 00:01:58.029 
going to have community hopefully take

00:01:58.029 --> 00:02:00.169 
going to have community hopefully take
ownership<00:01:58.240> with<00:01:58.569> this<00:01:58.719> too<00:01:58.990> it's<00:01:59.409> really

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
ownership with this too it's really

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.199 
ownership with this too it's really
listening<00:02:01.179> to<00:02:01.240> what<00:02:02.069> different<00:02:03.069> parts<00:02:03.520> of<00:02:03.729> our

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
listening to what different parts of our

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.870 
listening to what different parts of our
school<00:02:04.509> feel<00:02:04.659> that<00:02:04.869> they<00:02:04.990> need<00:02:05.279> including<00:02:06.279> you

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
school feel that they need including you

students needs in trying to come up with
ways<00:02:10.270> for<00:02:10.869> us<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.350> meet<00:02:11.590> those<00:02:11.830> needs

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
ways for us to meet those needs

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.700 
ways for us to meet those needs
to<00:02:13.180> create<00:02:13.450> really<00:02:13.810> strong<00:02:14.110> culture<00:02:14.530> in<00:02:14.620> a

supportive culture so while the

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.820 
supportive culture so while the
classroom<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.140> most<00:02:17.320> important<00:02:17.770> part

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
classroom is the most important part

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.820 
classroom is the most important part
that<00:02:18.700> component<00:02:19.150> piece<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.830> being

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
that component piece of being

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.640 
that component piece of being
emotionally<00:02:21.310> well<00:02:21.490> is<00:02:21.730> this<00:02:22.650> extremely

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
emotionally well is this extremely

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.890 
emotionally well is this extremely
valuable<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.220> it's<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:25.210> really<00:02:25.390> important

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
valuable to it's a really important

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.420 
valuable to it's a really important
element<00:02:26.350> to<00:02:26.410> what<00:02:26.620> you<00:02:26.860> have<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.130> deal<00:02:27.280> with

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
element to what you have to deal with

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.980 
element to what you have to deal with
during<00:02:27.640> teenage<00:02:28.090> years<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.690> know<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:28.840> think

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
during teenage years you know I think

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.110 
during teenage years you know I think
probably<00:02:29.320> every<00:02:29.740> institution<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.640> every

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
probably every institution and every

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.390 
probably every institution and every
person<00:02:32.070> could<00:02:33.070> take<00:02:33.610> some<00:02:33.820> time<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.210> do<00:02:35.400> kind

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
person could take some time to do kind

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.400 
person could take some time to do kind
of<00:02:36.460> a<00:02:36.550> personal<00:02:36.910> inventory<00:02:37.500> about<00:02:38.500> how<00:02:38.950> our

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
of a personal inventory about how our

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.830 
of a personal inventory about how our
emotional<00:02:41.410> needs<00:02:41.740> are<00:02:42.160> being<00:02:42.850> met<00:02:43.000> or<00:02:43.570> not

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
emotional needs are being met or not

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.140 
emotional needs are being met or not
whether<00:02:44.410> students<00:02:45.040> fully<00:02:45.459> realize<00:02:45.850> it<00:02:46.000> or<00:02:46.090> not

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
whether students fully realize it or not

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.600 
whether students fully realize it or not
if<00:02:47.050> students<00:02:47.740> are<00:02:47.860> interested<00:02:48.070> in<00:02:48.370> something

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
if students are interested in something

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.060 
if students are interested in something
and<00:02:48.880> it's<00:02:49.000> important<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.660> them<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.770> makes

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
and it's important to them that makes

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.100 
and it's important to them that makes
the<00:02:51.489> faculty<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.239> parents<00:02:52.660> much<00:02:53.080> more

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
the faculty and the parents much more

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.370 
the faculty and the parents much more
interested<00:02:53.950> so<00:02:54.310> I<00:02:54.610> think<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.720> students<00:02:56.290> will

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
interested so I think that students will

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.920 
interested so I think that students will
ultimately<00:02:56.890> be<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.280> ones<00:02:57.459> that<00:02:57.670> carry<00:02:58.660> this

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
ultimately be the ones that carry this

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.350 
ultimately be the ones that carry this
forward
