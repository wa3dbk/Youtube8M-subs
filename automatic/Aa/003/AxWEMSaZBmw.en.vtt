 caviar from eggplant or very little blue 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.100
 the most useful here we are so small 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.000
 eggplant but ripe since there is no 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.850
 still such seeds 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.689
 we will boil carrots too 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:28.910
 boil the onions, we will cut and fry large 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.349

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.260
 with skins who do not like skins so 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.079
 can be for a few seconds in boiling water and 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.690
 skin peel it will scroll 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.760
 in a meat grinder but I'm still so 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.379
 put water for eggplant eggplant 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.600
 my 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.870
 cut tails or throw talk 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.239
 water we do not salt we will salt then well 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.030
 still here the most important thing we have eggplant 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.200
 will rise up we shallow 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.689

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.580
 also we washed and cleaned throw boil 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.330
 servants we chop and grill on 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.330
 vegetable oil 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:29.189
 garlic 2 cloves also ship yes luko 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:33.329
 here our onion is fried it is no longer necessary we 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.729
 turn it off our eggplants when at 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.720
 piercing such soft means they already 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.159
 ready too turn off so here we got 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.170
 the eggplants they cool 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.530
 I cut them so they went in well 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.840
 grinder and even when young eggplant 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.750
 never take off the skin 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.649
 this is an extra broom for our 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.350
 bowel she is very helpful here are old 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.500
 eggplant to such skin the seeds need 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.560
 clean up there 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.560
 you 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.910
 he and home 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.510
 more such a route is repeated 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.180
 eggplants 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.760
 I'm in the service 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.870
 called further what we scrolled 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:48.320
 put on the fire now we taste salt 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:50.570
 and pepper and mix and after 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:56.930
 boiling on a slow fire set 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:59.120
 and 10 minutes boil this caviar in 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.360
 we do not much overcook 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.560
 overall i'm a carcass and just five minutes of this 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.020
 enough to keep it true for long 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.040
 but if you want such a cru close on 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.450
 winter then 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.220
 jars on hitherto fighters there in blood 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:21.470
 half liter 10 minutes liter 20 minutes 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:24.280
 and roll up and put the land in a jar 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.750
 close the lid in the fridge 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.750
