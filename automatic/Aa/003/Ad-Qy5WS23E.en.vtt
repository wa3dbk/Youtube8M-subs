what's happened is a breadboard

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.750 
what's happened is a breadboard
construction<00:00:58.200> which<00:00:58.950> means<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.399> board<00:00:59.640> is

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
construction which means the board is

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.830 
construction which means the board is
run<00:00:59.910> lengthwise<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.809> these<00:01:01.320> boards<00:01:01.739> run

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
perpendicular at the ends I think when

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.210 
perpendicular at the ends I think when
it<00:01:05.729> was<00:01:05.759> built<00:01:06.060> originally<00:01:06.680> these<00:01:07.680> two<00:01:07.979> end

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
it was built originally these two end

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.249 
it was built originally these two end
boards<00:01:08.640> were<00:01:08.759> nailed<00:01:09.060> down<00:01:09.300> to<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.690> legs<00:01:09.899> and

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
boards were nailed down to the legs and

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.910 
boards were nailed down to the legs and
they<00:01:10.770> held<00:01:11.039> these<00:01:11.220> boards<00:01:11.990> captive<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
they held these boards captive but the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.010 
they held these boards captive but the
tens<00:01:14.280> are<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.820> small<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.180> don't<00:01:15.420> understand<00:01:15.840> why

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
tens are so small I don't understand why

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.130 
tens are so small I don't understand why
this<00:01:16.080> tenant<00:01:16.680> here<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.759> tiny<00:01:18.119> tiny<00:01:18.450> tenon

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
this tenant here is just tiny tiny tenon

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.270 
this tenant here is just tiny tiny tenon
so<00:01:20.009> what<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.160> intend<00:01:20.550> to<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.410> cut<00:01:22.410> new

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.710 
so what I intend to do is cut new
tenants<00:01:23.789> not<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.149> whole<00:01:24.270> length<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
tenants not the whole length of the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.289 
tenants not the whole length of the

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.230

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.140 
longer Tenon's Elden glue and set early
and<00:01:30.540> leave<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.259> antenna<00:01:31.740> loose<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
and leave the antenna loose so that the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.450 
and leave the antenna loose so that the
top<00:01:33.360> can<00:01:33.570> expand<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.110> contract<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.830> then

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
top can expand and contract and then

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.030 
top can expand and contract and then
reattach<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.240> top<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> base<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.890> was

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
reattach the top to the base as it was

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.249 
reattach the top to the base as it was
done<00:01:38.189> originally<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.630> should<00:01:39.840> hold<00:01:40.079> it

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
done originally and that should hold it

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.399 
done originally and that should hold it
and<00:01:40.409> should<00:01:40.590> work<00:01:40.740> fine<00:01:41.869> so<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.990> first<00:01:43.200> thing

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
and should work fine so the first thing

Tenon's three inches wide and I'll start

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.780 
Tenon's three inches wide and I'll start
with<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.320> center<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.860> then<00:02:08.340> I'll<00:02:08.429> mark<00:02:08.640> out

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
with the center and then I'll mark out

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:15.680 
with the center and then I'll mark out
the<00:02:09.329> two<00:02:09.540> on<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.780> ends<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:14.700> sport<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.180> 7/8

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
the two on the ends the sport is 7/8

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.910 
the two on the ends the sport is 7/8
thick<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.790> I'll<00:02:17.910> make<00:02:18.090> my<00:02:18.239> 10<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.690> 7/16<00:02:19.620> half

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
thick so I'll make my 10 and 7/16 half

here to the tabletop the other tenants

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.190 
here to the tabletop the other tenants
will<00:04:21.520> be<00:04:21.640> floating<00:04:21.970> so<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.480> tabletop<00:04:22.960> can

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
will be floating so the tabletop can

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.440 
will be floating so the tabletop can
expand<00:04:23.560> and<00:04:23.680> contract<00:04:24.000> because<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.240> top

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
expand and contract because the top

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
isn't flat I put these calls on here to

00:04:28.330 --> 00:05:18.400 
isn't flat I put these calls on here to
hold<00:04:28.510> it<00:04:28.720> flat<00:04:28.960> while<00:04:29.890> I<00:04:30.100> assemble<00:04:30.250> it

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.990 

okay<00:05:19.410> I've<00:05:19.590> got<00:05:19.620> the<00:05:19.800> top<00:05:20.130> back<00:05:20.430> on<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:20.790> bass

okay I've got the top back on the bass

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.940 
okay I've got the top back on the bass
here

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
here

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.470 
here
I've<00:05:22.950> been<00:05:23.100> wondering<00:05:23.430> mala<00:05:23.790> how<00:05:24.030> I<00:05:24.060> was<00:05:24.300> going

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
I've been wondering mala how I was going

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.080 
I've been wondering mala how I was going
to<00:05:24.540> attach<00:05:24.840> this<00:05:25.110> top<00:05:25.440> there's<00:05:25.740> no<00:05:26.040> great<00:05:26.880> way

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
to attach this top there's no great way

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.120 
to attach this top there's no great way
to<00:05:27.120> do<00:05:27.390> it<00:05:27.420> and<00:05:27.630> I<00:05:27.690> got<00:05:27.810> to<00:05:27.960> thinking<00:05:28.260> it

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
to do it and I got to thinking it

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.400 
to do it and I got to thinking it
originally<00:05:29.610> was<00:05:29.640> nailed<00:05:30.090> down<00:05:30.390> to<00:05:31.050> the<00:05:31.170> legs

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
originally was nailed down to the legs

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.730 
originally was nailed down to the legs
through<00:05:32.310> the<00:05:32.520> top<00:05:32.760> and<00:05:33.230> I<00:05:34.230> never<00:05:34.440> thought<00:05:34.680> I

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
through the top and I never thought I

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.830 
through the top and I never thought I
would<00:05:35.190> do<00:05:35.700> something<00:05:36.000> like<00:05:36.180> that<00:05:36.330> but<00:05:36.720> I'm

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
would do something like that but I'm

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.780 
would do something like that but I'm
thinking<00:05:37.170> it<00:05:37.650> really<00:05:37.860> makes<00:05:38.250> the<00:05:38.490> most<00:05:38.640> sense

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
thinking it really makes the most sense

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.270 
thinking it really makes the most sense
the<00:05:39.420> nail<00:05:39.660> holes<00:05:39.990> are<00:05:40.260> already<00:05:40.440> here<00:05:40.920> if<00:05:41.100> I

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
the nail holes are already here if I

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.810 
the nail holes are already here if I
nail<00:05:41.520> this<00:05:41.760> top<00:05:42.060> down<00:05:42.810> to<00:05:43.440> these<00:05:43.650> legs<00:05:43.980> it<00:05:44.730> will

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
nail this top down to these legs it will

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.870 
nail this top down to these legs it will
be<00:05:44.970> secure<00:05:45.420> the<00:05:46.080> center<00:05:46.320> can<00:05:46.760> expand<00:05:47.760> and

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
be secure the center can expand and

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.600 
be secure the center can expand and
