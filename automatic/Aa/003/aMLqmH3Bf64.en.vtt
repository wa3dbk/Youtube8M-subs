00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
maybe maybe that's why they don't put

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.810

Pelican<00:06:47.280> Pelican<00:06:47.490> 13<00:06:48.300> I<00:06:48.390> can't<00:06:48.600> really<00:06:48.720> showed

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
Pelican Pelican 13 I can't really showed

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.350 
Pelican Pelican 13 I can't really showed
it<00:06:49.020> right<00:06:49.250> there<00:06:50.250> the<00:06:50.640> programming<00:06:51.180> was

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
it right there the programming was

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.280 
it right there the programming was
mercury<00:06:51.800> no<00:06:52.800> graphics<00:06:53.900> special<00:06:54.900> so<00:06:55.020> I<00:06:55.050> guess

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.290 
mercury no graphics special so I guess

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.320 
mercury no graphics special so I guess
it's<00:06:55.470> the<00:06:55.530> same<00:06:55.710> person<00:06:56.010> who<00:06:56.100> programmed<00:06:56.330> or

it's the same person who programmed or

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.570 
it's the same person who programmed or
maybe<00:06:57.540> it's<00:06:57.720> the<00:06:57.810> same<00:06:58.050> a<00:06:58.080> game<00:06:59.070> design<00:06:59.400> and

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
maybe it's the same a game design and

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.750 
maybe it's the same a game design and
art<00:06:59.760> I<00:06:59.940> guess<00:07:00.180> yeah<00:07:01.050> probably<00:07:01.470> well<00:07:02.460> I<00:07:02.490> guess
