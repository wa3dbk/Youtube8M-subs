of<00:00:25.980> people<00:00:26.220> when<00:00:26.310> they<00:00:26.430> look<00:00:26.610> at<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.820> they

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
of people when they look at it they

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.220

don't<00:00:27.090> really<00:00:27.210> understand<00:00:27.750> how<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.020> works

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
actually very simple but it is kind of

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.100 
actually very simple but it is kind of
confusing<00:00:32.250> when<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.790> first<00:00:32.820> look<00:00:33.180> at<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.420> this

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
nice thing about this arm around the way

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.649 
nice thing about this arm around the way
that<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.729> allows<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.149> easily<00:01:48.479> be

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
that it is it allows it to easily be

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.450 
that it is it allows it to easily be

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
on the other arm usually what I like to

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.139 
on the other arm usually what I like to
do<00:02:01.859> is<00:02:01.979> do<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.189> from<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.399> opposite<00:02:02.729> side<00:02:02.909> do<00:02:03.060> it

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
do is do it from the opposite side do it

from<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.359> bottom<00:02:03.979> of<00:02:04.979> his<00:02:05.130> arm<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.670> underside

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
from the bottom of his arm the underside

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.230 
from the bottom of his arm the underside
of<00:02:06.060> his<00:02:06.210> arm<00:02:06.359> and<00:02:06.560> then<00:02:07.560> push<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.280> arm<00:02:08.820> through

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
of his arm and then push the arm through

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.690 
of his arm and then push the arm through
and<00:02:09.479> then<00:02:10.110> slide<00:02:10.350> back<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:11.190> reason<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.430> like<00:02:11.580> to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
and then slide back the reason I like to

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.190 
and then slide back the reason I like to
do<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.880> that<00:02:12.000> way<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.659> way<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.840> get<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
do it that way is that way you get the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.259 
do it that way is that way you get the
long<00:02:13.409> end<00:02:13.709> closest<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.700> his<00:02:14.819> hand

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
long end closest to his hand

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.760 
long end closest to his hand
I<00:02:15.319> found<00:02:16.319> that

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
I found that

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.460 
I found that
that<00:02:16.860> seems<00:02:17.070> to<00:02:17.220> give<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.400> most<00:02:17.790> support<00:02:18.780> to

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
that seems to give the most support to

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.800 
that seems to give the most support to
the<00:02:19.590> arm<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.010> allow<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.670> do<00:02:20.910> most<00:02:21.690> things

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
the arm and allow it to do most things

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.710 
the arm and allow it to do most things
the<00:02:22.200> way<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.590> would<00:02:22.680> want<00:02:22.920> them<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.720> so

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
the way that you would want them to so

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.750 
the way that you would want them to so
that's<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.230> with<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.470> arm<00:02:25.590> rod<00:02:25.800> like<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.550> said

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
that's it with the arm rod like I said

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.180 
that's it with the arm rod like I said
it's<00:02:27.060> really<00:02:27.360> easy<00:02:27.660> but<00:02:28.500> when<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:28.800> first<00:02:28.950> look

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
it's really easy but when you first look

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.580 
it's really easy but when you first look
at<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.400> kind<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:30.090> confusing<00:02:30.570> almost<00:02:31.380> what<00:02:31.500> you

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
at it kind of confusing almost what you

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.810 
at it kind of confusing almost what you
might<00:02:31.740> want<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:31.980> think<00:02:32.130> of<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.340> as<00:02:32.490> when<00:02:32.700> you're

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
might want to think of it as when you're

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.180 
might want to think of it as when you're
taking<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.180> apart<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.510> put<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.750> on<00:02:34.010> it's<00:02:35.010> very

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
taking it apart and put it on it's very

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.730 
taking it apart and put it on it's very
similar<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.730> keyring<00:02:36.350> you<00:02:37.350> know<00:02:37.440> just<00:02:37.620> one

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
similar to a keyring you know just one

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.410 
similar to a keyring you know just one
of<00:02:37.770> those<00:02:37.890> wrong<00:02:38.130> key<00:02:38.400> rings<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:38.970> kind

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
of those wrong key rings that you kind

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.760 
of those wrong key rings that you kind
of<00:02:39.450> put<00:02:39.630> your<00:02:39.660> key<00:02:39.930> on<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.260> then<00:02:40.380> slide<00:02:40.650> it

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
of put your key on and then slide it

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.770 
of put your key on and then slide it
around<00:02:40.890> until<00:02:41.310> it's<00:02:41.430> inside<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.970> keys<00:02:42.480> until

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
around until it's inside the keys until

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.420 
around until it's inside the keys until
it's<00:02:43.380> inside<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.770> ring<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.040> then<00:02:44.130> all<00:02:44.250> those

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
it's inside that ring and then all those

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.600 
it's inside that ring and then all those
keys<00:02:44.640> stay<00:02:44.850> together<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:46.440> yep<00:02:47.070> it's<00:02:47.490> pretty

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
keys stay together so yep it's pretty

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.610 
keys stay together so yep it's pretty
easy<00:02:47.970> if<00:02:48.510> anybody<00:02:48.840> has<00:02:48.990> any<00:02:49.170> questions<00:02:49.200> about
