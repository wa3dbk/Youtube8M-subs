00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.969 
specifically the two USB ports the added
battery<00:01:50.270> life<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:50.899> a<00:01:51.619> little<00:01:51.860> bit<00:01:51.920> of

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
battery life and a little bit of

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.219 
battery life and a little bit of
durability<00:01:52.520> if<00:01:53.000> I'm<00:01:53.119> tossing<00:01:53.479> it<00:01:53.780> in<00:01:53.899> my<00:01:54.020> bag

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
durability if I'm tossing it in my bag

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.740 
durability if I'm tossing it in my bag
or<00:01:54.619> if<00:01:54.740> someone's<00:01:55.160> dropping<00:01:55.399> a<00:01:55.729> smart<00:01:56.300> jacket

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
or if someone's dropping a smart jacket

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.920 
or if someone's dropping a smart jacket
will<00:01:56.990> add<00:01:57.350> protection<00:01:58.479> where<00:01:59.479> I<00:01:59.509> think<00:01:59.750> the

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
will add protection where I think the

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.290 
will add protection where I think the
elitepad<00:02:00.710> really<00:02:01.700> is<00:02:01.790> going<00:02:01.910> to<00:02:02.000> make<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.210> big

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
elitepad really is going to make a big

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.960 
elitepad really is going to make a big
difference<00:02:02.600> is<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.140> be<00:02:03.259> able<00:02:03.410> to<00:02:03.890> focus<00:02:04.670> my

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
difference is to be able to focus my

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.180 
difference is to be able to focus my
time<00:02:05.000> on<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.840> patient<00:02:06.350> rather<00:02:06.649> than<00:02:06.920> be

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
time on the patient rather than be

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.020 
time on the patient rather than be
tethered<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.479> a<00:02:08.509> computer<00:02:09.380> screen<00:02:09.850> so<00:02:10.850> what

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
tethered to a computer screen so what

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.400
