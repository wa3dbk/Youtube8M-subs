00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.259
 it's zero on tv thank you for following us 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.030
 every day and today we are going 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.190
 and well buried technology that 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.799
 yet rocked the first hours 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.470
 flat screens the plasma jerome the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.660
 plasma is he dead will he die after 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.970
 the annunciation of samsung who decided not to 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.130
 no longer make plasma there is no left 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.660
 more than one manufacturer is good 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.400
 who produces this type of technology 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.900
 it was the record in zero to the city 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.820
 auch and last night and yes every thursday 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.109
 evening between 18h to 18h30 we propose you 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.730
 a debriefing of high tech news 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.600
 we discussed this subject with among others 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.600
 pp garcia 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.410
 a news that fell this week 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.120
 Samsung announced Sat his art is 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.040
 manufacture of plasma TVs a 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.290
 giro exactly then after is 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.570
 after hitachi pioneer sony toshiba 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.989
 panasonic and well yes it's the turn of 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.579
 samsung 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.199
 finally there is more than lg and 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.239
 some Chinese manufacturers who 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.860
 still manufacture plasma TVs 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.869
 we are therefore entitled to ask 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.940
 question the plasma is it dead 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.110
 but I do not like the word dead because 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.690
 it's when you lose your soul you can 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.820
 we can say decide pixels here 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.450
 pixel seizures the poor 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.190
 beast 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.210
 yeah but less for me when I 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.350
 even had a little problem is that in 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.369
 I think he does not have any more 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.360
 a long time because of brands and 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.810
 continues to put him under the tent at 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.390
 oxygen 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.590
 it will not last what there are still 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.660
 find some small models a few 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.399
 brands that have made in china with 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.539
 no name we found judged that is still 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.640
 resistant but when we go all 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.110
 actors who have deserted the segment it's 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.020
 still delirium why the plasma 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.979
 stop it not me first if I love 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.119
 you have to know that we may be 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.320
 several sources is mine I love the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.789
 ch plasma technology and that was a trick 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.740
 which is it my first kif when 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.450
 I was much younger I do not have 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.009
 seen a lot younger I was there I 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.200
 saw my first writings remain and nec 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.450
 the picture was orange I did not care 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.150
 it was placement you were awesome 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.350
 was 125 thousand euros is here it's 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.630
 because it was first summer 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.520
 first and I said it's great then 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.170
 it quickly evolved I liked this 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.640
 technology because I find that the 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.140
 black was very deep naturally and 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.360
 no need to push behind then 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.250
 why is it a quality 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.440
 here I am nature naturally 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.239
 contrasted cinema but the problem 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.260
 is that his debut a little chaotic of 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.910
 plasma had a kind of legend 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.829
 urban of the kind do not put it in the sun 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.540
 will change color what was true 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:21.060
 in the beginning the steps of two filters and the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.320
 uv was doing had an effect on 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.880
 nominal strong and change color there 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.440
 turned orange after a year and a half 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.450
 that it continues to pursue a little the 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.130
 plasma even in the general public after 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.170
 the pot the problem now is that 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.209
 it remains a product that is heavy 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.910
 energy intensive and have 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.350
 then estimated unfortunately despite the 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.329
 panasonic's ads is host did 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.010
 ever evolved to the ultra hd is to say 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.600
 that when everything climbs to the level of 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.950
 the definition we have ten prom ball balls 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.480
 cushy he will stay in full hd 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.769
 he will stay to consume a lot because 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.500
 they have to reduce consumption 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.670
 it's still something that consumes and that 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.790
 count it will continue a little to make the 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.959
 noise 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.000
 like that there is always a tingling 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.140
 on the picture is natural on the plasma and 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.310
 a sound system that is quite 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.379
 normal it's the national sun and makes 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.909
 two posterization of color is very 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.849
 technical but really knows about 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.209
 thank him for being here at all 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.459
 rights 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.739
 good then the panasonic has disengaged 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.750
 of plasma last year I believe 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.430
 our 2014 range can not have more than 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.069
 products now pass in his 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.470
 range why why we stopped them 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.629
 because plasma technology does not 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.989
 not allow as elise and grandpa everything to 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.670
 the time of techno does not allow them 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.650
 share in the resolution 4k the path 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.209
 for pixel number questions 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.590
 on the slab the moment I would say to 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.090
 letters anyway for the future oled 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.889
 four cases because ok ok for a moment 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.819
 we are on the on the lcd so that 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.430
 panasonic does not dole with 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.400
 obviously christophe a christophe 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.799
 scum with water but christophe not under 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.629
 a Sicilian tunnel in my classes 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.519
 any future panasonic if you make the d 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.260
 no no questions and therefore no 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.840
 answer it's true it's very nice 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.959
 we master oled on technology 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.730
 happens to make it convex concave in 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.639
 all the senses it's parra it's not a 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.280
 problem today the the problematic 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.389
 arises at the level of the economic model 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.879
 compared to oled technology and to 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:05.470
 his neck so today we have a 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.340
 technology that works very well 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.060
 we will do everything we can 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.129
 technologically for the year to the 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.549
 image quality and maintain but 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.829
 promise of dabo has image quality 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:21.479
 movie lovers with LED technology 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.870
 if the market is seeking 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.210
 oled technology 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.310
 we have here the possibility of 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.330
 go out of the screens with but I do not know 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.330
 it's not a problem
