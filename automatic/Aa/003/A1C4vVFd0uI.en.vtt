my point

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.189 
my point
I<00:00:28.980> heard<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.699> really<00:00:30.119> awesome<00:00:30.390> song<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.109> the

I heard this really awesome song in the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.770 
I heard this really awesome song in the
game<00:00:31.730> thought<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.759> would<00:00:33.239> try<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.480> figure<00:00:33.660> it

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
game thought I would try and figure it

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.450 
game thought I would try and figure it
out<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.230> did<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.649> didn't<00:00:34.920> take<00:00:35.070> too<00:00:35.100> long

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
out and I did it didn't take too long

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.330 
out and I did it didn't take too long
just<00:00:35.790> because<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.170> really<00:00:37.500> easy<00:00:37.530> song<00:00:37.980> and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
just because it's a really easy song and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.880 
just because it's a really easy song and
I<00:00:38.550> guess<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.940> repeats<00:00:39.239> itself<00:00:39.390> but<00:00:39.930> anyways<00:00:40.620> um

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
I guess it repeats itself but anyways um

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.430 
I guess it repeats itself but anyways um
this<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.940> pretty<00:00:42.120> much<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.329> all<00:00:42.840> my<00:00:43.170> chicken
