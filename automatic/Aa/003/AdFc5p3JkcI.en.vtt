00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.720
 as you see all alone on the tokyo game show 2010 you see we know the end 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.990
 of the los angeles show remove my 3d glasses 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.430
 to talk about an e game on which could have gotten hands on 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.149
 literally since the cd available on kinect 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.179
 it's the choice of pedals feel comfortable at 360 so 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:50.960
 but also on ps3 we had the opportunity 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.470
 dijoux and francfort at a first level master level I know it's 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.860
 the one that was presented to the e3 but that it was a little bit more 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.360
 technical 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.550
 for others too, but that's only for later what are your first 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.520
 impressions of the manceau on the game 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.020
 Well, listen to me, g 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.000
 because I love it visually I love it you said it all in video and 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.600
 so 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.150
 at the time we are really in 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.020
 with the headphones on the ears the music is great frankly the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.730
 music is superb it is signed on August 8th it could quite with 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.860
 his 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.860
 in his group e which is called with 16 points chiroptera 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.760
 % in all the cases where he ate a lot of grieved actually that the design the 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.120
 music concept 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.380
 after where I was a little over six anyway it's more of 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.540
 kinect side that these mistakes of recognition 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.270
 at times that we do with the hand it's very simple the game upstream and 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.230
 had moved hand for tea to heaps of stuff on the screen 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.020
 Lille has 5% to shoot 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.579
 it works pretty well 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.340
 but it's not exceptional in terms of recognition yes it's true that lag 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.270
 is a bit big 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.719
 when we do this for its part a bit with their stock price positioned 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.690
 and suddenly it loses a little dynamism and has a 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.460
 little impression of not really totally controlled what we do 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.960
 but support also played on the controller so that gives what exactly 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.450
 listen to that I will not talk about it 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.740
 cake that what I can not talk about that we do not have the right 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.520
 effective mans we went to make a dissection table of the tool 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.209
 which has made us a lot but there is a little time runners 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.900
 it will be the end of the vote the time is right 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.629
 to be quite honest we happen 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.480
 very nice little interview with 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.480
 the fashion designer job in which he will talk about the second level 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:20.879
 we did not play anymore 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.699
 and the five minutes barely 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:24.900
 here it is waiting for me what I can tell you is that 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.290
 he will be the first of his three cadets rafa plays for the sometimes anyway 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.829
 that's all new 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:30.850
 we have 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:31.889
 working in the world 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.999
 more or less typed% because of the control kinect 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.300
 in europe thanks the most 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.310
 afp and that's what is a little complicated is that me personally 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.799
 I have not done anything 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:41.680
 in ej 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.000
 that's where the universe is ethically is super good music to the world in 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.920
 embarrassment in order to make even more of the year 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.800
 but the handiness really for now they have made it clear 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.770
 watch out I'm not finished 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.310
 they still have percent and pixi coming in for kinect to refine a 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.230
 little bit of motion recognition 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.230
 but it's true they'll have the same dream come in but what road 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.290
 not working very well we can not do it for that 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.100
 So here is half-tone here is this game that looks really great but 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.850
 I really want to play at home for example but it's not 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.900
 still it was not happening confirmed remains to be confirmed so 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.670
 in europe it will be released on ps3 so I do not see how it could not 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.349
 operate with drying 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.400
 and that's very clearly the thaw allegations of chosen 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.359
 that's what we read for now but you'll understand 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.760
 we see other names are for you to talk about it a little more widely 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.610
 this is another level that has been revealed the results of a biopsy 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.530
 who had so on gameblog fr in september 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.740
 in the meantime we may have some people also touch ups and maybe the 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.279
 things will be a little by little refined 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:37.549
 abbas even wants guy like like assse 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.720
 this is also the tokyo game show 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.050
 profitable in the late morning every time hopes to beat 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.890
 since june 16 mache parker 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.309
 furthermore, 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:53.789
 he loved only two problems alone children of debt outside 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:56.789
 after the break we can not do that in fact 

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:25.049
