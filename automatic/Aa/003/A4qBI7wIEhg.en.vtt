00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everyone with you kroon this group 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.170
 Player Kucher 98 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.110
 found these will take 13 frags look like 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.389
 he will do it at the beginning of our fight to remove 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.099
 slept a little bit more precisely did not sleep 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.710
 looked where they were leaving right 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.529
 allies and chose the best place 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.410
 the attack of the enemy is art that is the best 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.800
 so just go under the bridge there just 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.189
 I went to another birdie 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.759
 companies with them went our hero first 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.710
 goal first goal then jackson lower level 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.200
 but he already hid him to destroy 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.350
 need to break the fence 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.920
 neatly near the bush so as not to 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.620
 palitsya but enemies already on the right is already underway 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.250
 work on two fronts jackson leaned out 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.710
 better first bun right there from drying it 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.550
 got the second one and hid 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.910
 but also the right chamber of the Hulk 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.090
 our moves and 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:06.950
 finishing off jackson getting sympathetic 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:09.920
 cannon game very tasty nests of magicians 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.090
 tight shelling is on the right hulk 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.860
 switches to the right flank 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.690
 there is a problem in the same our players 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.790
 clamped and left enemies die very 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.479
 quickly one by one and strictly speaking 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.830
 on the right you also need to go under the bridge itself 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.450
 Elsa light to disappear and pop world 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.640
 minus minus what if not 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.140
 remove enemies from at least one 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.910
 the directions are then simply disassembled with 2 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.640
 meanwhile the allies have merged completely 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.740
 first line 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.560
 so all train g in fact now 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.450
 the enemy is very dangerous such 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:56.500
 The moment nevertheless the coffin departed from the company 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:00.560
 in my so he came back again bends 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.319
 two strands of us climb on the train also st-shki 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.170
 broke through the first line go from there 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.390
 the hulk is moving away so as not to get plumes 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.470
 on the left to work only for one 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.470
 side only forward 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.320
 the next goal of the discussion is not in 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.990
 Shoot something that is not too shot snow 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.600
 an hour should already work hard yes 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.840
 he is heavy 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:29.560
 ready very good precision hellket 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.400
 good speed allows fast 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:37.020
 come down shoot and go good 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.260
 damage allows you to remove opponents 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.989
 twenty percent 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.159
 Of course they are so lucky and the site of the century to 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:49.489
 Essentially , the backache is perfect but not 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:53.209
 breaks through 2 non-penetration rebounds no fart 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.700
 as they say but hulk persistent and he 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.690
 in general still finishes the damn shell 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.150
 true but wbr such wbr is now five 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.359
 frags one more and will be cherished howls 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.260
 the dream of many players who never 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:11.569
 finished off more than eight 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.730
 Ahead is also a whole burden and so can you 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.540
 very nice hand out come to life halka 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.060
 Essentially, he can just step 411 but already 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.579
 went to capture the base and have no time 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.329
 fight with the strands in the center as possible 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:30.170
 shoot down a few cars there and 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:32.359
 grabbing just flies our class squared b 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.459
 7 is just sleeping, that is, he can watch 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.590
 he absolutely doesn’t care what's going on 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.989
 on the base therefore you have to run 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.650
 and literally in the last seconds 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:47.870
 i.e. time is past seconds 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:49.400
 the shot was and went shooting down already two tanks 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.060
 on capture has already stabilized 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.890
 situation 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.540
 enemies looking at a sleeping class and not 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.160
 pays attention to hell 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:04.629
 k it therefore pushes quietly throws 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.330
 over and over again put on the caterpillars finished kvass 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:10.930
 one opponent is already easier to capture 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.720
 his strength would have been brought up but how 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.419
 if she is the first to knock it down 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.940
 saved the game if it were n’t 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.859
 cream 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.820
 removes the last invader from us 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:28.120
 even the girl Victoria see and in fact 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:32.760
 affairs left five enemies on 5 allies 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.760
 Much possible but she already has eight frags 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:41.220
 Immediately send an invitation to the clan with such 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.220
 this is not surprising 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:48.300
 the enemy has one strand three stitches and 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:52.050
 orto orto missed the moment did not throw 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:55.949
 Helke did not throw another f-shki also with 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:59.540
 open top and for it now will be 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.540
 pay the rest of the enemy team 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:09.330
 a very dangerous hour risks getting only 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:11.430
 well, under the arta, nevertheless throws n77 here 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:16.190
 dies quickly and now nine 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.190
 frags intrigue heating up 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:25.230
 does not risk does not climb forward so as not 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:29.070
 get a deadly bun kills yet 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:32.460
 one too the same time home 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.240
 nevertheless at home before the slaughter our hero is already 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.790
 I threw 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:40.920
 he already did a good shoot down and therefore 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:43.110
 you can even just get the next one 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.930
 will be brew then carelessly power because 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.290
 crow already receives a projectile but it remains 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:52.130
 Essentially one art and premium roam 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:58.230
 2 who can do almost nothing 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:06:00.090
 here of course he is not a whole art must 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.450
 will be near the base even a little closer 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:08.550
 the gun does not hit the whole card 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:10.650
 if it is a stock pass tidy 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.540
 through the bushes to once again not the police 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.960
 here at the same time light it is art which 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.600
 crawled out to shoot and out. artak right there 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.130
 dying as the most dangerous end with a cat 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.560
 the gun starts to fire very 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:26.260
 speedy but the damage is not enough 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.210
 20 percent flies away very fast here 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.840
 actually so our hero took 13 frags 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.860
 very nice nice fight hulk te 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:36.150
