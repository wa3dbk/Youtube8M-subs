actually turn color I'm not sure if the
camera<00:01:20.040> really<00:01:20.340> gets<00:01:20.579> it<00:01:21.049> but<00:01:22.049> that's<00:01:22.229> pretty

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740

cool
comes<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:26.399> the<00:01:27.180> cable<00:01:27.509> obviously<00:01:28.079> connected

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
comes with the cable obviously connected

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.270 
comes with the cable obviously connected
to<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:29.280> back<00:01:29.430> there<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.320> here<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:32.159> actual

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
to the back there and here is the actual

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.849 
to the back there and here is the actual
on/off<00:01:32.939> switch<00:01:33.179> I<00:01:33.869> don't<00:01:34.500> know<00:01:34.619> what

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
on/off switch I don't know what

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.910 
on/off switch I don't know what
one-in-two<00:01:35.759> does<00:01:35.969> so<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.240> assume<00:01:36.659> one's<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
one-in-two does so I assume one's like a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.490 
one-in-two does so I assume one's like a
super<00:01:38.909> regular<00:01:39.600> cooling<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.140> was<00:01:40.350> like<00:01:40.469> a

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
super regular cooling and I was like a

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.840 
super regular cooling and I was like a
super<00:01:40.890> cooling<00:01:41.100> because<00:01:41.310> that'd<00:01:41.609> be<00:01:41.700> cool

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
super cooling because that'd be cool

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.889 
super cooling because that'd be cool
actually<00:01:44.850> there's<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.509> little<00:01:46.039> in<00:01:47.039> the<00:01:47.310> bottom

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
actually there's a little in the bottom

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.539 
actually there's a little in the bottom
of<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.079> box<00:01:49.409> actually<00:01:50.070> there's<00:01:50.249> nothing<00:01:50.460> on

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
of the box actually there's nothing on

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.770 
of the box actually there's nothing on
the<00:01:50.609> one<00:01:50.759> over<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.999> rocks<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.420> thought<00:01:51.630> there

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
the one over the rocks I thought there

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.169 
the one over the rocks I thought there
was<00:01:52.039> just<00:01:53.039> covered<00:01:53.609> up<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.909> thought<00:01:54.030> that'd

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
was just covered up and I thought that'd

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:55.010 
was just covered up and I thought that'd
be<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.359> something<00:01:54.659> serious<00:01:54.899> or<00:01:54.990> something

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
be like something serious or something

weird<00:02:35.220> but<00:02:36.220> if<00:02:36.430> anyone<00:02:36.910> has<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.300> answer<00:02:37.600> to

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
weird but if anyone has the answer to

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.580 
weird but if anyone has the answer to
that<00:02:37.720> let<00:02:38.200> me<00:02:38.350> know<00:02:39.810> because<00:02:40.810> as<00:02:41.080> far<00:02:41.230> as<00:02:41.290> often

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
that let me know because as far as often

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.960 
that let me know because as far as often
says<00:02:41.710> just<00:02:41.950> plug<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.280> play<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.700> don't<00:02:42.760> even

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
says just plug and play I don't even

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.510 
says just plug and play I don't even
know<00:02:43.150> if<00:02:43.270> it<00:02:43.360> really<00:02:43.570> needs<00:02:43.750> drivers<00:02:44.430> but<00:02:45.430> it's

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
know if it really needs drivers but it's

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.920 
know if it really needs drivers but it's
probably<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:45.820> generic<00:02:46.210> kind<00:02:46.360> of<00:02:46.480> driver<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.840> use

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
probably a generic kind of driver to use

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.230 
probably a generic kind of driver to use
in<00:02:47.110> Windows<00:02:47.260> but<00:02:47.590> I'll<00:02:47.650> use<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:47.860> Mac<00:02:48.130> so<00:02:48.460> pretty

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
in Windows but I'll use a Mac so pretty

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.390 
in Windows but I'll use a Mac so pretty
much<00:02:49.330> almost<00:02:49.720> most<00:02:50.350> things<00:02:50.590> work<00:02:50.830> really<00:02:51.070> with

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
much almost most things work really with

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.090 
much almost most things work really with
the<00:02:51.490> Mac<00:02:52.290> that's<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.440> there<00:02:53.560> let's<00:02:53.710> open<00:02:53.800> it<00:02:53.980> up

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
the Mac that's it there let's open it up

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.520 
the Mac that's it there let's open it up
see<00:02:54.940> what's<00:02:55.120> inside<00:02:56.340> awesome<00:02:57.340> stuff<00:02:58.530> that's

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
see what's inside awesome stuff that's

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.410 
see what's inside awesome stuff that's
it<00:02:59.650> there<00:02:59.800> at<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.280> top<00:03:00.490> right<00:03:00.970> up<00:03:01.150> there

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
it there at the top right up there

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.930 
it there at the top right up there
there's<00:03:01.750> a<00:03:01.810> little<00:03:01.960> LED<00:03:02.440> light<00:03:02.980> or<00:03:03.220> LED<00:03:03.610> I

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
there's a little LED light or LED I

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.880 
there's a little LED light or LED I
think<00:03:04.240> that<00:03:04.570> is<00:03:04.720> or<00:03:04.960> at<00:03:05.110> least<00:03:05.260> some<00:03:05.530> in<00:03:05.800> the

photos that I saw and there's the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.490 
photos that I saw and there's the
cooling<00:03:08.890> platform<00:03:09.400> there<00:03:09.930> what<00:03:10.930> I'm<00:03:11.140> gonna<00:03:11.290> do

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
cooling platform there what I'm gonna do

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.250 
cooling platform there what I'm gonna do
is<00:03:11.650> just<00:03:11.970> unwrap<00:03:12.970> this<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:13.900> actually<00:03:14.140> just

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
is just unwrap this and actually just

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.880 
is just unwrap this and actually just
hook<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.530> up<00:03:14.770> quickly<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.310> my<00:03:15.430> mic<00:03:16.030> right<00:03:16.360> here

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.280 

see<00:03:20.890> what<00:03:21.040> it<00:03:21.130> does

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290

can see the red light there it's on the
number<00:03:40.180> 2<00:03:40.510> option<00:03:40.930> at<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.290> moment

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
number 2 option at the moment

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.650 
number 2 option at the moment
and<00:03:42.300> there's<00:03:43.300> like<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.780> off<00:03:44.820> then<00:03:45.820> the<00:03:46.330> single

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.680 
and there's like the off then the single
one<00:03:46.870> button<00:03:47.200> I<00:03:47.580> actually<00:03:48.580> you<00:03:48.940> can<00:03:49.090> feel<00:03:49.510> it

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
one button I actually you can feel it

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.200 
one button I actually you can feel it
through<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.380> bottom<00:03:50.590> here<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:51.790> can<00:03:51.910> feel<00:03:52.030> the

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
through the bottom here you can feel the

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.780 
through the bottom here you can feel the
wind<00:03:52.420> kind<00:03:52.780> of<00:03:52.870> come<00:03:52.990> through<00:03:53.520> or<00:03:54.520> the<00:03:54.610> air

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
wind kind of come through or the air

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.270 
wind kind of come through or the air
circulating<00:03:55.720> through<00:03:55.900> it<00:03:56.020> winds<00:03:56.920> probably

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
circulating through it winds probably

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.840 
circulating through it winds probably
not<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.580> correct<00:03:57.850> terminology<00:03:58.030> but<00:03:58.510> whatever

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
not the correct terminology but whatever

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.020 
not the correct terminology but whatever
then<00:04:00.850> if<00:04:00.970> you<00:04:01.060> hit<00:04:01.210> -<00:04:01.660> I<00:04:02.490> shouldn't<00:04:03.490> see<00:04:03.670> feel

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
then if you hit - I shouldn't see feel

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.940 
then if you hit - I shouldn't see feel
anything<00:04:04.830> I've<00:04:05.830> no<00:04:06.580> idea<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:08.290> think<00:04:08.560> with<00:04:08.770> two

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
anything I've no idea you think with two

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.190 
anything I've no idea you think with two
buttons<00:04:09.280> it<00:04:09.610> would<00:04:09.820> be<00:04:10.030> easy<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:10.690> understand

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
buttons it would be easy to understand

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.680 
buttons it would be easy to understand
but<00:04:11.980> I<00:04:12.190> assume<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.550> one<00:04:12.760> just<00:04:13.150> kind<00:04:13.330> of<00:04:13.420> cools

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
but I assume the one just kind of cools

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.130 
but I assume the one just kind of cools
it<00:04:13.840> down<00:04:14.760> I'm<00:04:15.760> quickly<00:04:15.970> looking<00:04:16.359> at<00:04:16.480> the<00:04:16.690> front

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
it down I'm quickly looking at the front

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.349 
it down I'm quickly looking at the front
here<00:04:17.410> just<00:04:18.370> seconds<00:04:18.700> after<00:04:18.790> plugging<00:04:19.150> the

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
here just seconds after plugging the

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.300 
here just seconds after plugging the
fridge<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:20.230> cold<00:04:20.410> plate<00:04:20.530> chills<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:21.220> the

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
fridge the cold plate chills to the

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.180 
fridge the cold plate chills to the

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
helping to keep the breviary cool is

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.780 
helping to keep the breviary cool is

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300 
some from some USB some website I forget

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.779 
some from some USB some website I forget
what<00:06:50.509> it<00:06:50.629> is<00:06:50.870> but<00:06:51.770> that's<00:06:51.919> pretty<00:06:52.249> awesome<00:06:52.460> I

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:52.789 
what it is but that's pretty awesome I

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:54.369

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:54.379 
don't think it said anything about being

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:57.999 
don't think it said anything about being
like<00:06:54.650> a<00:06:55.180> hot<00:06:56.180> and<00:06:56.300> cold<00:06:56.599> kind<00:06:56.870> of<00:06:56.990> fridge<00:06:57.259> so<00:06:57.650> if
