00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.090
 in very good was that made 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.710
 increasing today I bring you a gameplay of 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.759
 ghosts finally a little bit of forest already 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.050
 I know there are people in the channel who 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.160
 like you but good and then I will speak a 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.170
 little bit of that subject also I 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.240
 time is a short clerk a 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.830
 hard misunderstanding by teams playing with the 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.450
 vector once I broadcast more favorites and 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.680
 that also after the patch that 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.660
 they went up a bit the reach then it goes 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.680
 much better and that lately is 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.029
 starting to see a lot more in 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.350
 competitive than regret thing that I 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.820
 like but united and writing game 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.090
 competitive so I stopped rolling 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.310
 hard per team is map of sovereign and 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.630
 a game of dynamics the truth is very 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.100
 quite then catch in a light 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.540
 because I think it's good I 'm not left without 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.370
 bullets but if I do not just grab a 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.740
 light that I'm pretty good at m27 one of 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.970
 the best light also and here you 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.260
 I leave the background for example the truth 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.390
 it's pretty entertaining they kill me 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.830
 a few times and killed quite a lot 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.380
 by teams so well I hope that you 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.790
 mole and before you start talking about 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.560
 video good the camouflage because this 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.540
 video is basically to teach the 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.300
 new camouflage this of the unicorns and 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.830
 to talk a little bit about what 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.110
 of the goal not about how he is right now 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.240
 is in the channel and all that then tell you 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.880
 that as I always like to remind you 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.070
 Well, you have me in my description 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.720
 personal sponsor that is box code and there 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.490
 So you have codes of 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.980
 the life of the xv that is to say you know that 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.840
 to play the xbox you need a goal from 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.180
 just like the ps4 there are also codes 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.180
 of psn and just that you do not have 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.740
 codes of xbox live gold you have codes 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.330
 of points that would be good too and of 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.520
 money that are to buy for example 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.740
 these new camouflages or dlc is what 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.120
 you want games that also 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.560
 they sell downloadable games for example 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.360
 in the whole one the 3 sat me 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.860
 I'm wrong too and then on the play 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.500
 3 more of the same in play 4 you have 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.930

 Games also sting of origin and 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.430
 What if I'm also kind of 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.260

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.670
 cheaper games and codes 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.930
 they are also quite cheap and not only 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.790
 that but also you have in the 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.560
 description a small code of 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.300

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.310

 pretty cheap the cards then still 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.970
 cheaper still so if interested

 As for region, if I'm not wrong, it's 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.860

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.640
 that is, that page 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.630
 you can say it globally so you do not have 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.090
 problem to buy the implements 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.650
 for gais by paypal if I'm not wrong or 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.900
 per card as you want if they send you a 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.520
 sms to the mobile so well then if you 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.560
 you need for whatever psn points

 live or cheap pc games then there 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.910
 you have to good after that little 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.830
 it's because from small for a 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.270
 advertising we go to day there is no 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.860
 the camouflage the camouflage the unicorns 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.440
 by boat take another round of new 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.000
 camouflages have also taken out the 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.740
 camouflage of specter with the respective 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.450
 doll costume is pretty cool the 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.310
 true the camouflage of spectrum and already what 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.260
 I had was a camouflage that they gave you for 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.090
 move from the 360 ​​to the one 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.650
 I guess I started 4 too for 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.480
 move from ps3 to weigh when they gave it to you 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.010
 but well I 'm not going to buy just 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.170
 Buy me this time from the 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.510
 unicorns that I said did not have 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.830
 no lilac purple camouflage and I do not know 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.690
 It appeared funny and I bought the 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.770
 it's really cool, but I do not 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.090
 I'm going to buy more with flashes of this 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.620
 tanda I do not like either 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.300
 too much already I think that for example there 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.130
 one green that I already have green camouflage 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.570
 there is also one that is fire in plan 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.100
 of the extinction mode that looks like 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.170
 very much to the fire camouflages that 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.310
 they pulled out the previous time so like 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.450
 are already a little repeating the 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.710
 camouflage is not the only one that has 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.510
 seemed novelty soria is kind of what I 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.140
 I bought and also today 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.630
 we're 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.580
 but before yesterday to today they have 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.780
 removed the previous camouflages if 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.880
 you remember from a video of the of the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.400
 marijuana I also made a video in the 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.900
 weapons guide teaching the camouflage of 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.700
 camouflage show that blue that is 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.010
 pretty cool too and have taken out then 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.520
 the voices of snoop dogg and the instructor 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:43.030
 or I do not know what it's called and you also have 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.000
 the good suit is the marijuana show 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.350
 the camouflage that yellow stays and 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.700
 I bought myself I do not know if they get it 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.960
 they point to a video if not only does it also come out 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.130
 but come on, I have intentions and 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.470
 us as classes that I bought 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.910
 so good that you know in the 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.380
 rendering 3 usually followed as 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.970
 French one month later for example 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.320
 those that have left now will come out 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.210
 a month later is to buy the 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.400
 unicorns because he is camouflaged before 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.170
 cool the truth and good after 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.820
 talk about the camouflages that good 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.040
 because you know they are not free to 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.060
 you have to pay for them obviously it's a 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.170
 I think it's good that 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.780
 what you put there are many people who criticize 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.040
 but today it is totally optional if 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.510
 you want to share it you buy it but 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.330
 buy it from another where you buy it 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.980
 you are forced to pay to play no 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.060
 it is simply an accessory of the game 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.070
 If you like it, you buy it now 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.780
 it's so good about the taste in 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.700
 the channel a lot of people are in the channel not 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.290
 I know by ghost and such and I will not stop 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.820
 upload ghosts where for the moment up 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.830
 What happens to me from the game is a game that 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.050
 if people play well and touch maps 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.090
 decent because it's a game that I pass it 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.160
 well playing and I say to you that is strange 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.750
 that people play well because people 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.060
 it's very very disgusting in this game there 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.639
 a lot of house there is a lot of corner and a lot 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.560
 people go with light 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.530
 with thermal measures staying still 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.080
 then it is very complicated to play this 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.460
 I play in a Russian way that's how I 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.439
 like to play and then the gameplays of 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.779
 the children that you see I like to try 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:00.340
 move but I still like it always 

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:03.539
 before moving around the sites review 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.099
 things because I really tell you that 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.569
 It costs a lot to move in this game and it does not 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.710
 I will stop bringing golf amps 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.729
 because I know there are people in the Canary 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.710
 this always many times I've said 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.229
 there are people who do not raise you because it is 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.550
 shit I'll upload what I like 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.479
 because it's my channel and obviously 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.460
 I also have to have a certain 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.779
 commitment to some subscribers 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.949
 you are not the only ones in the channel what is said 

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:23.409
 many times you are many subscribers 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.120
 you are more than 80,000 already then I can not 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:27.069
 have 100% happy to everyone 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.330
 I will continue to bring you I will continue 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.889
 bringing whites all I will continue 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.479
 bringing all the call of duty but with 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.919
 the frequency that is ready is not such 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.870
 and as they are now, I will bring you one or 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.819
 twice a week and then I'm old 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.650
 also the series of cornered or in 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:40.569
 who also added goss the guide 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.310
 weapons that for example would raise weapons 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:44.020
 Saturday touches the remington already in fact 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.520
 I have the game taken to accompany 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.770
 the guide I just have to assemble the boards 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.270
 and all that tomorrow for example you will have 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.800
 cos 2 nuclear mentality one 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.000
 series that for those who are newbies in 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.640
 call of duty or simply by 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.500
 learn some tricks that I use and 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.000
 Well, there I give you my secrets of how 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.100
 play call of duty and how to improve and everything 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.690
 that therefore a series that goes very well and is 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.980
 in the black or door then you are 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.270
 having I believe in the channel quite 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.870
 variety in terms of call of duty but 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.980
 the series of nostalgic always tried 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.690
 albeit twice put one or two 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.860
 times a week but obviously there are 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.210
 many videos on the channel and I do not want 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.950
 neglect any kind of video in 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.940
 I also want to tell you that I have not 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.200
 said in this video that I'm from 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.570
 exams with which if you see that some 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.920
 day I do not upload video or that someday 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.540
 example on Sundays is your kind of 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.800
 videos I just upload a video you know it's 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.320
 that's why I'm exams for 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.790
 example I think that this month and a half like this 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.690
 so a finished example I hope that you 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.490
 you liked this gameplay you liked 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:34.169
 I did not like favorites and 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.169
 subscribe for more goodbye
