00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
 ah 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.010
 hello all welcome to the channel 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.990
 lethal crisis' today I bring you a video 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.450
 Good as you already know the theme of 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.640
 my videos usually vary a bit I'm by 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.890
 streaks sometimes medicating more for magic 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.599
 by experiments now as you will have in 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.579
 everything is not a bit chopped and another 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.110
 once with weapons and today I bring you a 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.599
 slingshot or also called strip 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.300
 very powerful beans for cheese what 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.309
 you are going to need a bottle and a balloon 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.800
 but literally only these two things 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.040
 no insulation tape or silicone or anything 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.690
 more so let's go with it good as 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.670
 said we will need a bottle of 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.769
 plastic other than the balloon what the 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.870
 we'll have to cut through here and 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.999
 then with the cap cut out what is 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.730
 all this stage is to say just leave the 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:57.170
 lateral so let's go with this 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.829
 we must do it in the most adjusted way 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.829
 possible 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.370
 well you're already cut you see that neither 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.960
 It has been very irregular but let's go 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.330
 Squeezing like this with the tip of the knife 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.060
 you can cut very well now this what 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.670
 we throw away it no longer serves us and we fit the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.200
 two parts and we would already have what is the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.720
 body of the bottle now only remains 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.229
 mount what more or less could be the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.600
 trigger that would be the balloon but placed 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.280
 directly would be very weird so 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.630
 that we are going to cut a piece of here 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.630
 so let's go there 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.740
 well we already have the three parts that 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.500
 we wanted and the first thing will fit the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.990
 balloon here that will be part more or less 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.300
 harder and nothing now we have it now 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.430
 as you will suppose we just have to fit 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.130
 this so that the egg does not come out 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.440
 then now we put the thread and already 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.750
 we would have mounted our super gun 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.729
 super slingshot good and here at last what 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.950
 we have already assembled one hundred percent as 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.810
 I'm just going to be bottle and balloon without 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.200
 zinc- free silicone adhesive 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.230
 insulator with nothing and is very powerful let's 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.600
 there with the firing tests 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.489
 Well, we'll start with close shots 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.100
 to this cardboard box that good was the 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.630
 only one that I had at home and we will do honor 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.459
 to the name that I said before throws 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.920
 baked beans that good as it had no water 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.320
 throw chickpeas but it is similar and as 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.680
 you will suppose we put a chickpea leaving it 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.230
 fall out 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.230
 we take from here we make strength and 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.790
 set what power of shots that without 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.200
 problems have gone through the cardboard and 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.810
 so you can see that it's true and there's no 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.770
 trick now without cutting the video I'm going to 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.900
 teach like here 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.470
 they have to be the chickpeas you see that 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.290
 they are here 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.209
 inside the box you see them here 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.200
 so nothing now let's go with shots 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.200
 long-distance shooting 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.490
 and well you see that this distance also 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.110
 goes through the cardboard so nothing for 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.330
 today in the market and the firing tests 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.860
 before he breaks something and well then 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.600
 nothing I hope you liked the video 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.360
 and now we go in parts because I was 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.400
 very comment two things the first that the 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.530
 question of this video as already warns and 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.990
 will do one per week one per video 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.150
 is going to be what category of videos do you 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.770
 like more is to say no although video in 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.440
 concrete but playlist 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.510
 if you like weapons more 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.300
 chemical reactions experiments magic 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.830
 well that's what you tell me life hacks 

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:22.460
 maybe it's good what I say 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.680
 you comment and the second one that I bring you two 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.750
 super collaborations this is a 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.180
 Notification because I bring you the 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.770

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.160
 it's going to be in about a week 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.220
 maybe two and also approximately in 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.410

 magic is going to be a collaboration to 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.570
 distance but stores where you will be 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.400
 here with me in my recording studio 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.060
 so nothing has already been dedicated to you 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.190
