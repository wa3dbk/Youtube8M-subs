00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
pitches up and it's some items going

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.120 
pitches up and it's some items going
that's<00:02:28.540> another<00:02:28.750> thing<00:02:28.930> if<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.170> do<00:02:29.350> manage<00:02:29.590> to

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
that's another thing if you do manage to

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.970 
that's another thing if you do manage to
get<00:02:30.430> in<00:02:30.550> if<00:02:30.940> they<00:02:31.630> are<00:02:31.870> there<00:02:32.350> are<00:02:32.500> some<00:02:32.770> bugs

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
get in if they are there are some bugs

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.730 
get in if they are there are some bugs
and<00:02:34.140> it<00:02:35.140> will<00:02:35.650> be<00:02:35.830> slightly<00:02:36.240> laggy<00:02:37.560> because<00:02:38.560> I

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
and it will be slightly laggy because I

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.460 
and it will be slightly laggy because I
mean<00:02:39.070> I<00:02:39.190> don't<00:02:39.730> have<00:02:39.850> a<00:02:39.880> extremely<00:02:40.510> high<00:02:41.110> spec

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
mean I don't have a extremely high spec

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.030

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.990 
computer of our imac in them yeah so but
the<00:02:45.190> common<00:02:46.440> little<00:02:47.440> glitch<00:02:47.860> things<00:02:48.310> are<00:02:48.610> if

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
the common little glitch things are if

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.820 
the common little glitch things are if
you<00:02:49.090> dig<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.330> block<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.990> sometimes<00:02:50.650> it

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
you dig a block and sometimes it

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.640 
you dig a block and sometimes it
regenerates<00:02:51.460> if<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:51.880> see<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:52.440> don't<00:02:53.440> worry

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
regenerates if you see that don't worry

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.590 
regenerates if you see that don't worry
about<00:02:53.710> it<00:02:54.040> it's<00:02:54.190> normal<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:54.940> sometimes<00:02:55.480> you

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
see huge glitch craters in the ground

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.030 
see huge glitch craters in the ground
that<00:02:58.210> go<00:02:58.630> down<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.990> the<00:02:59.050> bottom<00:02:59.230> don't<00:02:59.890> worry

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
that go down to the bottom don't worry

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.520 
that go down to the bottom don't worry
