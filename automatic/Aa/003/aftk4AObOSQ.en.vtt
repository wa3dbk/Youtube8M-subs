00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:09.860 

okay<00:00:01.680> this<00:00:02.070> is<00:00:02.460> the<00:00:02.790> apple<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.300> Eden<00:00:03.620> and<00:00:08.870> for

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
okay this is the apple of Eden and for

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.580 
okay this is the apple of Eden and for
pretty<00:00:10.679> much<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.920> end<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:13.170> memory

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
pretty much the end of this memory

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.480 
pretty much the end of this memory
sequence<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.880> think<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.139> only<00:00:16.490> weapon

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
sequence I think this is the only weapon

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:26.029 
sequence I think this is the only weapon
you<00:00:18.330> can<00:00:18.480> actually<00:00:18.660> carry<00:00:23.420> the<00:00:24.529> 1<00:00:25.529> percent

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
you can actually carry the 1 percent

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.580 
you can actually carry the 1 percent
sink<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.910> -<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.820> think<00:00:29.820> it's<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.810> not<00:00:30.990> take<00:00:31.349> any

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
sink is - I think it's to not take any

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.920 
sink is - I think it's to not take any
damage<00:00:34.430> which<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.460> really<00:00:35.940> annoying<00:00:36.750> just

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
damage which is really annoying just

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.819 
damage which is really annoying just
because<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.550> everyone's<00:00:38.550> chasing<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.239> like

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.100 

you'll<00:00:43.879> get<00:00:44.879> away<00:00:45.059> from<00:00:45.120> those<00:00:45.450> guys<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:46.020> as

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
you'll get away from those guys but as

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.990 
you'll get away from those guys but as
soon<00:00:46.350> as<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.559> go<00:00:46.710> into<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> next<00:00:47.370> area<00:00:47.579> is

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
soon as you go into the next area is

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.580 
soon as you go into the next area is
like<00:00:48.410> mediately<00:00:49.410> detected

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.340 

but<00:00:57.220> uh

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.200 

there's<00:00:59.890> probably<00:01:00.280> a<00:01:00.519> quicker<00:01:01.000> way<00:01:01.179> of

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
there's probably a quicker way of

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.720 
there's probably a quicker way of
getting<00:01:01.629> out<00:01:01.780> of<00:01:01.929> here<00:01:02.230> but<00:01:02.890> I<00:01:03.219> was<00:01:03.460> just<00:01:03.489> in
