that so let's jump into the next topic
my<00:04:21.019> first<00:04:21.350> thought<00:04:21.560> as<00:04:21.709> far<00:04:21.919> as<00:04:22.039> not<00:04:22.220> sharing

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
my first thought as far as not sharing

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.629 
my first thought as far as not sharing
Santa<00:04:23.150> with<00:04:23.330> them<00:04:24.039> teaching<00:04:25.039> him<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:25.520> he's

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
Santa with them teaching him that he's

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.430 
Santa with them teaching him that he's
real<00:04:25.940> and<00:04:25.970> he<00:04:26.270> comes<00:04:26.479> down<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:26.840> chimney<00:04:26.870> and

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
real and he comes down the chimney and

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.020 
real and he comes down the chimney and
he's<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.740> one<00:04:27.889> who<00:04:27.979> brings<00:04:28.130> us<00:04:28.370> gifts<00:04:28.820> and<00:04:28.940> all

he's the one who brings us gifts and all

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.440 
he's the one who brings us gifts and all
that<00:04:29.270> is<00:04:29.479> that<00:04:29.990> there's<00:04:30.880> 365<00:04:31.880> days<00:04:32.150> in<00:04:32.180> the
