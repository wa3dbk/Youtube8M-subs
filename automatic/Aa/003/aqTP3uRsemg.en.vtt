the<00:00:36.329> way<00:00:36.630> my<00:00:36.780> body<00:00:36.960> looks<00:00:37.110> I've<00:00:37.530> noticed<00:00:38.010> it

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
the way my body looks I've noticed it

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160 
the way my body looks I've noticed it
personally<00:00:38.730> myself<00:00:38.910> my<00:00:39.719> clothes<00:00:40.050> fit

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
personally myself my clothes fit

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.380 
personally myself my clothes fit
differently<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:41.160> see<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.640> pictures<00:00:42.030> and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
differently I can see it in pictures and

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.180 
differently I can see it in pictures and
stuff<00:00:42.480> like<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.350> figured<00:00:43.980> why<00:00:44.160> not

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
stuff like that so I figured why not

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.740 
stuff like that so I figured why not
share<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.640> since<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.270> many<00:00:45.360> people

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
share it since I have so many people

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.720 
share it since I have so many people
asked<00:00:46.110> me<00:00:46.170> about<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.770> had<00:00:47.219> already<00:00:47.370> recorded

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
asked me about it I had already recorded

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.000 
asked me about it I had already recorded
this<00:00:48.210> video<00:00:48.360> one<00:00:49.020> time<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.410> was<00:00:49.440> about<00:00:49.710> 20

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
this video one time it was about 20

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.310 
this video one time it was about 20
minutes<00:00:50.160> long<00:00:50.489> wait<00:00:51.390> longer<00:00:51.690> than<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.989> like<00:00:52.170> my

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
minutes long wait longer than I like my

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.770 
minutes long wait longer than I like my
videos<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.520> figured<00:00:54.059> why<00:00:54.270> not<00:00:54.300> break

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
videos to be so I figured why not break

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.959 
videos to be so I figured why not break
it<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.079> into<00:00:55.260> multiple<00:00:55.500> segments<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.399> this

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
it up into multiple segments so this

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.369 
it up into multiple segments so this
video<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.390> just<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.930> be<00:00:58.020> talking<00:00:58.199> about

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
you're building muscle the number isn't
