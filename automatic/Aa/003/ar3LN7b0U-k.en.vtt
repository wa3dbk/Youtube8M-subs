00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.520 
flat chalky kind of finish in this
particular<00:01:39.610> segment<00:01:40.450> what<00:01:40.900> I<00:01:40.930> wanted<00:01:41.260> to<00:01:41.350> do

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
particular segment what I wanted to do

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.039 
particular segment what I wanted to do
is<00:01:41.770> just<00:01:42.130> to<00:01:42.280> get<00:01:42.430> you<00:01:42.580> familiar<00:01:42.790> with<00:01:43.659> how<00:01:43.840> it

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
is just to get you familiar with how it

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.030 
is just to get you familiar with how it
flows<00:01:44.380> se<00:01:45.220> can<00:01:45.460> record<00:01:45.790> a<00:01:45.909> brushstroke<00:01:47.040> but

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
flows se can record a brushstroke but

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.700 
flows se can record a brushstroke but
very<00:01:48.310> simply<00:01:48.880> it<00:01:49.119> is<00:01:49.570> going<00:01:49.960> to<00:01:50.049> be<00:01:50.170> a<00:01:50.320> matte

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
very simply it is going to be a matte

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.730 
very simply it is going to be a matte
finish<00:01:50.740> and<00:01:51.430> it<00:01:51.970> has<00:01:52.090> often<00:01:52.390> used<00:01:53.170> quite<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.619> bit

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
finish and it has often used quite a bit

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.940 
finish and it has often used quite a bit
in<00:01:54.009> collage<00:01:54.490> work<00:01:54.820> it<00:01:55.030> is<00:01:55.299> a<00:01:55.330> great<00:01:55.950> material
