bridge<00:00:17.779> it's<00:00:18.779> like<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> drawbridge<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:19.680> it

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
bridge it's like a drawbridge but it

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.849 
bridge it's like a drawbridge but it
rolls<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.640> rather<00:00:20.910> than<00:00:21.060> flips<00:00:21.390> up<00:00:21.680> anyway

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859

it's<00:00:23.100> today<00:00:23.760> run<00:00:24.150> as<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.420> museum<00:00:25.140> by<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> team<00:00:25.800> of

it's today run as a museum by a team of
impressively<00:00:26.670> committed<00:00:27.180> re-enactors<00:00:27.840> and

impressively committed re-enactors and

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.080 
impressively committed re-enactors and
we'll<00:00:28.619> be<00:00:28.740> seeing<00:00:28.920> more<00:00:29.039> from<00:00:29.369> them<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.730> other

we'll be seeing more from them in other

we'll be seeing more from them in other
videos<00:00:30.949> twelve<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.099> these<00:00:32.219> huge<00:00:32.579> guns<00:00:32.910> were

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
videos twelve of these huge guns were

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.810 
videos twelve of these huge guns were
built<00:00:33.300> eight<00:00:33.840> was<00:00:34.290> sold<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.920> Italian<00:00:35.399> Navy

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
built eight was sold to the Italian Navy

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.790 
built eight was sold to the Italian Navy
which<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.719> largely<00:00:36.989> why<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.260> British<00:00:37.500> then

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
which is largely why the British then

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.950 
which is largely why the British then
installed<00:00:38.250> two<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.940> defend<00:00:39.270> Valletta<00:00:39.660> and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
installed two to defend Valletta and

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.709 
installed two to defend Valletta and
another<00:00:40.620> two<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:41.129> Gibraltar<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.790> figures

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
another two for Gibraltar the figures

another two for Gibraltar the figures
are<00:00:42.870> just<00:00:43.309> mind-melting<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.760> thing<00:00:45.030> fired<00:00:45.570> a

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
are just mind-melting this thing fired a

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.180 
are just mind-melting this thing fired a

gel<00:00:50.489> which<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.700> what<00:00:50.879> my<00:00:51.000> guidebook<00:00:51.449> says<00:00:51.660> but

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
gel which is what my guidebook says but

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.299 
gel which is what my guidebook says but
no<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.039> one-ton<00:00:53.039> shell<00:00:53.640> 8<00:00:54.360> miles<00:00:54.860> which<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.039> as

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
no a one-ton shell 8 miles which is as

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.150 
no a one-ton shell 8 miles which is as
far<00:00:56.610> away<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.120> horizon<00:00:57.870> when<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.859> arrived

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
far away as the horizon when it arrived

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.709 
far away as the horizon when it arrived
there<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.609> still<00:00:59.879> had<00:01:00.090> quite<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.359> flat

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
there it still had quite a flat

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.569 
there it still had quite a flat
trajectory<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.710> presumably<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.219> thing<00:01:02.399> had

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
trajectory so presumably this thing had

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.920 
trajectory so presumably this thing had
a<00:01:02.609> range<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.180> could<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.600> fired

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
a range that could have just fired

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.710 
a range that could have just fired
virtually<00:01:04.769> into<00:01:04.949> space<00:01:05.400> but<00:01:05.729> its<00:01:06.150> effective

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
virtually into space but its effective

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.300 
virtually into space but its effective
range<00:01:06.750> was<00:01:07.200> as<00:01:07.320> far<00:01:07.530> as<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.740> could<00:01:07.890> see<00:01:08.100> which

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
range was as far as it could see which

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.149 
range was as far as it could see which
was<00:01:08.490> eight<00:01:08.670> miles<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.650> it<00:01:10.650> had<00:01:10.890> something

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
was eight miles and it had something

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.820 
was eight miles and it had something
like<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> ninety-eight<00:01:11.909> percent<00:01:12.090> hit<00:01:12.630> rate<00:01:12.990> so

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
like a ninety-eight percent hit rate so

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.800 
like a ninety-eight percent hit rate so
in<00:01:14.100> other<00:01:14.220> words<00:01:14.430> if<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.970> were<00:01:15.090> an<00:01:15.180> enemy<00:01:15.330> ship

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
in other words if you were an enemy ship

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.950 
in other words if you were an enemy ship
and<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:17.400> saw<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.030> got<00:01:18.090> angry<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.630> don't

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
and this saw you and got angry you don't

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.390 
and this saw you and got angry you don't
have<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.170> get<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.590> terms<00:01:19.770> with<00:01:19.890> not<00:01:20.009> being

it<00:01:23.130> didn't<00:01:23.430> even<00:01:23.549> have<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.939> hit<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.390> because

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
it didn't even have to hit you because

it didn't even have to hit you because
though<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.380> could<00:01:25.590> flatten<00:01:25.950> pretty<00:01:26.310> much

thing<00:01:35.369> would<00:01:36.030> put<00:01:36.360> one<00:01:36.720> ton<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.110> explosive

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
thing would put one ton of explosive

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.280 
thing would put one ton of explosive
into<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> water<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.540> underwater

into the water and the underwater

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.960 
into the water and the underwater
concussion<00:01:41.070> would<00:01:41.250> be<00:01:41.340> enough<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.700> rupture

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
concussion would be enough to rupture

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.560 
concussion would be enough to rupture
the<00:01:42.240> hull<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.930> most<00:01:43.320> ships<00:01:44.030> it<00:01:45.030> was<00:01:45.270> never

the hull of most ships it was never

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.990 
the hull of most ships it was never
fired<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.439> anger<00:01:46.740> however<00:01:47.100> which<00:01:47.520> means<00:01:47.790> that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
fired in anger however which means that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.429 
fired in anger however which means that
it<00:01:48.090> was<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> success<00:01:48.659> because<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.290> like

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
it was a success because this is like

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.950 
it was a success because this is like
the<00:01:49.470> Victorian<00:01:50.180> nuclear<00:01:51.180> deterrent<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.780> its

and<00:04:07.830> actually<00:04:08.340> fixing<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.970> problem

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
and actually fixing the problem

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.900 
and actually fixing the problem
therefore<00:04:10.260> it<00:04:10.440> was<00:04:10.590> much<00:04:10.830> more<00:04:11.100> efficient<00:04:11.730> to

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
therefore it was much more efficient to

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.509 
therefore it was much more efficient to
ask<00:04:12.299> one<00:04:12.540> of<00:04:12.570> your<00:04:12.810> soul
