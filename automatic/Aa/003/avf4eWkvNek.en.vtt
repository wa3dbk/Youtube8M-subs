00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
entire system and there's nothing I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.350 
entire system and there's nothing I
would<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.489> able<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.970> help<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:07.220> alright

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.010 

stays<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.380> there<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:20.369> can<00:01:20.520> also<00:01:20.869> control<00:01:21.869> it

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
stays on there you can also control it

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.330 
stays on there you can also control it
with<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.380> system<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.520> signal

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.219 

so<00:01:26.969> there<00:01:27.179> you<00:01:27.210> go<00:01:28.399> I'll<00:01:29.399> just<00:01:29.640> show<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
so there you go I'll just show the

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.120 
so there you go I'll just show the
external<00:01:31.310> controller<00:01:32.310> working<00:01:34.130> this

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
external controller working this

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.300 
external controller working this
controller<00:01:35.609> is<00:01:35.729> not<00:01:35.939> included<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:38.159> you

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
controller is not included but so you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.309 
controller is not included but so you
would<00:01:38.399> do<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.759> switch<00:01:39.409> that<00:01:40.409> switch<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
would do is switch that switch to the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:47.020 
would do is switch that switch to the
side<00:01:43.429> closest<00:01:44.429> to<00:01:44.459> the<00:01:45.020> first<00:01:46.020> player<00:01:46.259> port

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
side closest to the first player port

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:56.529 
side closest to the first player port
and<00:01:48.030> turn<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:50.959> it's<00:01:51.959> an<00:01:52.250> EVO<00:01:53.250> and

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539

you<00:01:57.539> will<00:01:57.689> notice<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.229> controller<00:01:58.709> than<00:01:59.039> to

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
you will notice this controller than to

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.589 
you will notice this controller than to
do<00:01:59.340> anything<00:02:00.409> all<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.860> power<00:02:02.220> went<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.909> this
