two at a time and as long as your

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.490 
two at a time and as long as your
creases<00:01:06.090> are<00:01:06.330> not<00:01:06.510> cutting<00:01:06.869> through<00:01:07.229> your<00:01:07.350> die

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
creases are not cutting through your die

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.010 
creases are not cutting through your die
or<00:01:07.920> through<00:01:08.130> your<00:01:08.220> paper<00:01:08.460> then<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.540> might<00:01:09.900> be

you just lay them out on your table so

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
you just lay them out on your table so

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
direction and what connects these all to

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.170 
direction and what connects these all to
each<00:01:33.930> other<00:01:34.229> are<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.740> long<00:01:35.009> tabs<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.970> side

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
each other are the long tabs on the side

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.390 
each other are the long tabs on the side
of<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> piece<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:37.259> machine<00:01:37.619> has<00:01:37.799> made<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
of the piece the machine has made the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.859 
of the piece the machine has made the
score<00:01:38.670> line<00:01:38.880> for<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.840> matter

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
score line for you so it's just a matter

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.380 
score line for you so it's just a matter
of<00:01:40.110> finding<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.790> don't<00:01:42.060> cross

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
of finding that so that you don't cross

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.270 
of finding that so that you don't cross
it<00:01:42.689> with<00:01:42.869> your<00:01:43.049> adhesive<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.740> I'm<00:01:43.890> gonna<00:01:44.040> use<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
it with your adhesive so I'm gonna use a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.090 
it with your adhesive so I'm gonna use a
tape<00:01:44.610> runner<00:01:44.840> now<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.869> might<00:01:46.259> choose<00:01:46.680> for

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
tape runner now I might choose for

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.100 
tape runner now I might choose for
longevity<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.000> maybe<00:01:48.210> use<00:01:48.450> even<00:01:48.659> something<00:01:48.960> a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
longevity to maybe use even something a

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.020 
longevity to maybe use even something a
little<00:01:49.380> stronger<00:01:49.680> but<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.460> tape<00:01:50.729> runner<00:01:50.939> is

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
little stronger but the tape runner is

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.320 
little stronger but the tape runner is
gonna<00:01:51.210> hold<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.570> just<00:01:51.810> fine

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
gonna hold it just fine

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.630 
gonna hold it just fine
our<00:01:52.420> demo<00:01:52.980> then<00:01:53.980> we're<00:01:54.100> just<00:01:54.130> gonna<00:01:54.340> line<00:01:54.610> up

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
our demo then we're just gonna line up

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.040 
our demo then we're just gonna line up
that<00:01:54.940> word<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.420> one<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:55.810> then<00:01:55.930> we'll

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
that word to that one and then we'll

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.920 
that word to that one and then we'll
take<00:01:56.200> our<00:01:56.350> tape<00:01:56.620> runner<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:59.460> next<00:02:00.460> panel

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
take our tape runner to the next panel

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.980 
take our tape runner to the next panel
and<00:02:01.930> we'll<00:02:02.110> line<00:02:02.290> up<00:02:02.320> this<00:02:02.650> one<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.070> this<00:02:03.220> one

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
and we'll line up this one to this one

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.690 
and we'll line up this one to this one
and<00:02:04.990> then<00:02:05.350> we've<00:02:05.590> got<00:02:05.710> one<00:02:05.980> more<00:02:06.160> panel<00:02:06.520> to

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
and then we've got one more panel to

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.770 
and then we've got one more panel to
connect<00:02:07.120> tape<00:02:07.870> runner<00:02:09.000> again<00:02:10.000> don't<00:02:10.330> try<00:02:10.570> not

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
connect tape runner again don't try not

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.080 
connect tape runner again don't try not
to<00:02:10.869> cross<00:02:11.050> your<00:02:11.260> fold<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:12.940> don't

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
to cross your fold so that you don't

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.300 
to cross your fold so that you don't
have<00:02:13.270> straight<00:02:13.660> adhesive<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.290> then<00:02:14.410> once<00:02:15.160> I

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
have straight adhesive and then once I

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.770 
have straight adhesive and then once I
get<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.790> end<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.210> have<00:02:16.360> no<00:02:16.570> more

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
get to the end and I have no more

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.810 
get to the end and I have no more
neighbors<00:02:17.230> then<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.560> can<00:02:17.740> cut<00:02:17.950> off<00:02:17.980> my<00:02:18.430> final

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
neighbors then I can cut off my final

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.910 
neighbors then I can cut off my final
panel<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.420> made<00:02:19.930> my<00:02:20.020> final<00:02:20.200> tab<00:02:20.530> that's<00:02:20.710> what<00:02:20.860> I

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
panel I made my final tab that's what I

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.380 
panel I made my final tab that's what I
meant<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.130> say<00:02:23.460> okay<00:02:24.460> decorating<00:02:25.270> your

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
meant to say okay decorating your

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.850 
meant to say okay decorating your
accordion<00:02:25.720> album<00:02:26.080> is<00:02:26.230> probably<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.620> lot

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
accordion album is probably a lot

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.770 
accordion album is probably a lot
simpler<00:02:27.190> when<00:02:27.280> it's<00:02:27.580> flat<00:02:27.880> like<00:02:28.150> this<00:02:28.480> I

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
simpler when it's flat like this I

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.110 
simpler when it's flat like this I
always<00:02:29.320> like<00:02:29.740> to<00:02:29.770> design<00:02:30.250> decorator<00:02:30.850> dies

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
always like to design decorator dies

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.270 
always like to design decorator dies
when<00:02:31.450> I<00:02:31.480> can<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:32.500> I've<00:02:32.620> got<00:02:32.770> another<00:02:33.040> new

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
when I can and so I've got another new

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.460 
when I can and so I've got another new
default<00:02:33.520> die<00:02:33.850> called<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.390> frame<00:02:34.690> label<00:02:35.020> and

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
default die called the frame label and

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.250 
default die called the frame label and
it<00:02:35.620> cuts<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.400> same<00:02:36.670> size<00:02:37.000> frame<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.900> fit<00:02:38.110> the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
it cuts the same size frame to fit the

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.530 
it cuts the same size frame to fit the
accordion<00:02:38.770> album<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.760> smaller<00:02:40.150> piece

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
accordion album and the smaller piece

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.380 
accordion album and the smaller piece
that<00:02:41.170> can<00:02:41.320> be<00:02:41.440> used<00:02:41.709> for<00:02:42.400> your<00:02:42.730> photos<00:02:43.180> and

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
that can be used for your photos and

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.270 
that can be used for your photos and
papers<00:02:43.780> so<00:02:43.990> that<00:02:44.110> they<00:02:44.230> will<00:02:44.350> fit<00:02:44.680> your<00:02:44.920> album

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
papers so that they will fit your album

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.960 
papers so that they will fit your album
just<00:02:45.550> perfectly<00:02:45.970> so<00:02:46.300> let's<00:02:46.930> cut<00:02:47.230> one<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.620> those

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
just perfectly so let's cut one of those

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.920 
just perfectly so let's cut one of those
that's<00:02:48.970> also<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.630> big-sized<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:52.209> oh<00:02:52.330> yes

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
that's also a big-sized I just oh yes

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.449 
that's also a big-sized I just oh yes
that's<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.320> right<00:02:53.440> one<00:02:53.530> okay<00:02:54.040> just<00:02:54.280> like<00:02:54.430> that

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
that's the right one okay just like that

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.430 
that's the right one okay just like that
and<00:02:54.910> then<00:02:55.150> maybe<00:02:55.330> let's<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.720> get<00:02:55.810> some<00:02:56.050> you

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
and then maybe let's to get some you

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.930 
and then maybe let's to get some you
know<00:02:56.530> for<00:02:56.709> this<00:02:56.800> one<00:02:57.040> let's<00:02:57.160> cut<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.459> couple<00:02:57.820> at

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
know for this one let's cut a couple at

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.330 
know for this one let's cut a couple at
a<00:02:57.970> time<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:59.200> is<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.410> big<00:02:59.650> size<00:02:59.800> Diana<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:00.220> does

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
a time this is a big size Diana it does

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.100 
a time this is a big size Diana it does
not<00:03:00.519> have<00:03:00.730> any<00:03:00.880> creases<00:03:01.450> in<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:01.989> there

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
not have any creases in it so there

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.810 
not have any creases in it so there
won't<00:03:02.290> be<00:03:02.350> any<00:03:02.590> problem<00:03:03.070> cutting<00:03:03.280> two<00:03:03.580> layers

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
won't be any problem cutting two layers

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.380 
won't be any problem cutting two layers
at<00:03:04.120> one<00:03:04.300> time<00:03:05.430> I'll<00:03:06.430> need<00:03:06.610> a<00:03:06.670> sandwich<00:03:07.060> with<00:03:07.269> my

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
at one time I'll need a sandwich with my

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.650 
at one time I'll need a sandwich with my
cutting<00:03:07.600> pads<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.910> then<00:03:10.090> I'll<00:03:10.180> just<00:03:10.360> roll<00:03:10.540> it

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
cutting pads and then I'll just roll it

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.880 
cutting pads and then I'll just roll it
through<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.930> big<00:03:11.050> shot

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.410 

so<00:03:17.890> you'll<00:03:18.040> see<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.400> what<00:03:18.610> that<00:03:18.640> cuts<00:03:19.090> just

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
so you'll see that what that cuts just

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.110 
so you'll see that what that cuts just
three<00:03:19.780> pieces<00:03:20.110> it<00:03:20.500> cuts<00:03:20.830> your<00:03:21.400> outer<00:03:21.640> frame

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
three pieces it cuts your outer frame

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.300 
three pieces it cuts your outer frame
which<00:03:22.599> my<00:03:22.959> paper<00:03:23.260> was<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.500> little<00:03:23.770> ripped<00:03:24.099> there

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
which my paper was a little ripped there

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.620 
which my paper was a little ripped there
but<00:03:24.489> that<00:03:24.610> will<00:03:24.760> perfectly<00:03:25.150> fit<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.599> outer

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
but that will perfectly fit the outer

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.380 
but that will perfectly fit the outer
frame<00:03:26.230> of<00:03:26.739> your<00:03:26.800> accordion<00:03:27.430> album<00:03:27.819> and<00:03:27.970> this

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
frame of your accordion album and this

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.880 
frame of your accordion album and this
piece<00:03:28.660> which<00:03:28.900> maybe<00:03:29.080> I<00:03:29.200> would<00:03:29.410> have<00:03:29.500> used<00:03:29.650> with

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
piece which maybe I would have used with

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.920 
piece which maybe I would have used with
photos<00:03:30.340> will<00:03:30.910> fit<00:03:31.120> right<00:03:31.360> in<00:03:31.510> there<00:03:31.690> like<00:03:31.900> that

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
photos will fit right in there like that

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.440 
photos will fit right in there like that
and<00:03:32.470> then<00:03:32.980> ADCs<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:33.700> then<00:03:33.819> you<00:03:33.910> left<00:03:34.209> with

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
and then ADCs and then you left with

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.270 
and then ADCs and then you left with
this<00:03:34.569> piece<00:03:34.870> in<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.110> middle<00:03:35.200> which<00:03:36.100> isn't

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
this piece in the middle which isn't

inner<00:03:46.269> frame<00:03:48.000> inside<00:03:49.000> what<00:03:49.930> I<00:03:49.989> like<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.290> do<00:03:50.440> is

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
inner frame inside what I like to do is

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.289 
inner frame inside what I like to do is
line<00:03:50.830> up<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:51.069> top<00:03:51.400> and<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.700> bottom<00:03:51.850> in<00:03:52.180> the

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
line up the top and the bottom in the

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.670 
line up the top and the bottom in the
center<00:03:52.330> and<00:03:52.810> just<00:03:52.959> kind<00:03:53.110> of<00:03:53.140> let<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.410> sides

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
center and just kind of let the sides

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.550 
center and just kind of let the sides
find<00:03:54.400> where<00:03:54.580> they're<00:03:54.700> supposed<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:55.120> go<00:03:55.560> and

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
find where they're supposed to go and

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.320 
find where they're supposed to go and
then<00:03:56.890> I<00:03:56.920> would<00:03:57.160> do<00:03:57.340> that<00:03:57.489> again<00:03:57.549> for<00:03:57.819> all<00:03:58.150> the

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
then I would do that again for all the

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.610 
then I would do that again for all the
panels<00:03:58.750> then<00:04:00.060> when<00:04:01.060> I'm<00:04:01.180> ready<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:02.230> assemble

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
panels then when I'm ready to assemble

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.340 
panels then when I'm ready to assemble
all<00:04:02.980> of<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.549> accordion<00:04:04.180> fund<00:04:04.660> nests<00:04:04.900> of<00:04:05.170> my

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
all of the accordion fund nests of my

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.500 
all of the accordion fund nests of my
album<00:04:05.830> then<00:04:06.459> I'm<00:04:06.549> just<00:04:06.790> going<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.030> use<00:04:07.269> some

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
album then I'm just going to use some

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.740 
album then I'm just going to use some
small<00:04:07.870> adhesive<00:04:08.530> like<00:04:08.709> a<00:04:08.739> glue<00:04:09.100> dot<00:04:09.450> well<00:04:10.450> it

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
small adhesive like a glue dot well it

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.809 
small adhesive like a glue dot well it
helps<00:04:10.989> if<00:04:11.080> you<00:04:11.170> hit<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.470> tab<00:04:13.380> okay<00:04:14.580> let<00:04:15.580> me<00:04:15.670> try

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
helps if you hit the tab okay let me try

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.009 
helps if you hit the tab okay let me try
that<00:04:15.850> again

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
that again

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.520 
that again
a<00:04:17.079> glue<00:04:17.859> dot<00:04:17.889> in<00:04:18.370> these<00:04:18.609> little<00:04:19.060> tabs<00:04:19.810> and

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
a glue dot in these little tabs and

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.040 
a glue dot in these little tabs and
those<00:04:20.769> are<00:04:20.949> what<00:04:21.099> connects<00:04:21.639> the<00:04:21.759> tabs<00:04:22.060> are<00:04:22.900> the

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
those are what connects the tabs are the

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.930 
those are what connects the tabs are the
small<00:04:23.530> pieces<00:04:23.949> to<00:04:24.099> each<00:04:24.220> other<00:04:24.430> so<00:04:24.639> I'm<00:04:24.759> just

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
small pieces to each other so I'm just

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.339 
small pieces to each other so I'm just
going<00:04:25.060> to<00:04:25.090> go<00:04:25.240> through<00:04:25.509> here<00:04:25.690> and<00:04:25.900> add<00:04:26.020> glue

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
going to go through here and add glue

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.100 
going to go through here and add glue
dots<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:27.009> my<00:04:27.159> little<00:04:27.940> small<00:04:28.270> tabs<00:04:28.599> on<00:04:28.930> each

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
dots to my little small tabs on each

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:41.090 
dots to my little small tabs on each
panel

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:53.200 

hard<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.670> go<00:04:41.850> here

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.510 

and<00:04:53.419> then<00:04:53.900> when<00:04:54.050> I<00:04:54.080> get<00:04:54.199> to<00:04:54.380> the<00:04:54.620> end<00:04:54.800> my<00:04:55.250> last

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
and then when I get to the end my last

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.400 
and then when I get to the end my last
one<00:04:55.820> doesn't<00:04:56.060> have<00:04:56.270> a<00:04:56.419> neighbor<00:04:56.780> so<00:04:57.110> I<00:04:57.169> can

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
one doesn't have a neighbor so I can

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.800 
one doesn't have a neighbor so I can
just<00:04:57.560> trim<00:04:57.889> off<00:04:57.919> those<00:04:58.520> final<00:04:58.820> two<00:04:59.300> little

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
just trim off those final two little

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.879 
just trim off those final two little
taps<00:05:00.940> okay<00:05:01.940> assembly<00:05:02.720> is<00:05:02.870> just<00:05:03.110> so<00:05:03.289> simple<00:05:03.650> I

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
taps okay assembly is just so simple I

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.159 
taps okay assembly is just so simple I
usually<00:05:04.250> just<00:05:04.400> kind<00:05:04.520> of<00:05:04.639> lift<00:05:04.880> my<00:05:05.210> accordion

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
usually just kind of lift my accordion

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.400 
usually just kind of lift my accordion
album<00:05:06.710> up<00:05:06.949> and<00:05:07.190> I<00:05:07.610> do<00:05:07.669> a<00:05:07.850> valley<00:05:08.419> on<00:05:08.690> my<00:05:09.110> big

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
album up and I do a valley on my big

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.100 
album up and I do a valley on my big
frames<00:05:09.940> between<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.090> first<00:05:11.330> two<00:05:11.660> so<00:05:11.990> I'm

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
frames between the first two so I'm

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.749 
frames between the first two so I'm
going<00:05:12.259> to<00:05:12.289> make<00:05:12.470> that<00:05:12.650> into<00:05:12.889> a<00:05:13.039> valley<00:05:13.430> that's

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
going to make that into a valley that's

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.189 
going to make that into a valley that's
caved<00:05:14.120> in<00:05:14.360> away<00:05:14.600> from<00:05:14.870> me

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
caved in away from me

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.020 
caved in away from me
then<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.650> next<00:05:15.889> one<00:05:16.100> would<00:05:16.220> be<00:05:16.280> opposite<00:05:16.820> it

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
then the next one would be opposite it

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.150 
then the next one would be opposite it
would<00:05:17.210> be<00:05:17.330> a<00:05:17.539> mountain<00:05:18.169> fold<00:05:18.410> so<00:05:18.710> I<00:05:18.740> will<00:05:19.009> just

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
would be a mountain fold so I will just

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.430 
would be a mountain fold so I will just
make<00:05:19.340> that<00:05:19.520> one<00:05:19.729> into<00:05:20.030> a<00:05:20.060> mountain<00:05:20.630> and<00:05:20.810> then

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
make that one into a mountain and then

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.670 
make that one into a mountain and then
my<00:05:21.590> final<00:05:21.889> will<00:05:22.669> be<00:05:22.820> a<00:05:22.850> valley<00:05:23.330> again<00:05:23.870> and<00:05:24.169> if<00:05:24.530> I

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
my final will be a valley again and if I

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.740 
my final will be a valley again and if I
had<00:05:24.889> more<00:05:25.130> panels<00:05:25.639> I<00:05:25.789> would<00:05:25.940> do<00:05:26.090> mountain<00:05:26.570> and

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
had more panels I would do mountain and

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.670 
had more panels I would do mountain and
then<00:05:26.840> Valley<00:05:27.110> and<00:05:27.500> so<00:05:27.710> I'm<00:05:27.830> making<00:05:28.099> a<00:05:29.259> W<00:05:30.259> so<00:05:30.620> to

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
then Valley and so I'm making a W so to

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.740 
then Valley and so I'm making a W so to
speak<00:05:30.889> then<00:05:31.580> when<00:05:31.729> I<00:05:31.759> connect<00:05:32.240> my<00:05:32.419> small

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
speak then when I connect my small

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.510 
speak then when I connect my small
frames<00:05:33.080> to<00:05:33.289> each<00:05:33.440> other<00:05:33.680> using<00:05:34.009> those<00:05:34.250> little

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
frames to each other using those little

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.900 
frames to each other using those little
glue<00:05:34.669> dots<00:05:34.910> I<00:05:35.210> go<00:05:35.509> in<00:05:35.750> front<00:05:36.080> of<00:05:36.470> valleys<00:05:37.430> like

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
glue dots I go in front of valleys like

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.600 
glue dots I go in front of valleys like
I'm<00:05:38.060> doing<00:05:38.330> here<00:05:38.690> just<00:05:39.320> gonna<00:05:39.500> line<00:05:39.770> up<00:05:40.009> that

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
I'm doing here just gonna line up that

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.540 
I'm doing here just gonna line up that
tab<00:05:41.030> with<00:05:41.300> its<00:05:41.449> neighbour<00:05:42.370> glue<00:05:43.370> that
