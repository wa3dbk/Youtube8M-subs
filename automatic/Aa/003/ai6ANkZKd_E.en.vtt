punch and just like that you make a

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.260 
punch and just like that you make a
really<00:01:21.560> simple<00:01:21.799> little<00:01:22.159> hole<00:01:22.310> I'm<00:01:22.970> just<00:01:23.150> going

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
really simple little hole I'm just going

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.340 
really simple little hole I'm just going
to<00:01:23.329> show<00:01:23.540> you<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.930> various<00:01:24.350> sizes<00:01:24.799> here<00:01:26.350> so

to show you the various sizes here so
that<00:01:27.500> was<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:27.710> point<00:01:27.890> eight<00:01:28.159> this<00:01:28.909> is<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.119> one

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
that was the point eight this is the one

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:39.290 
that was the point eight this is the one
millimeter<00:01:33.159> one<00:01:34.159> point<00:01:34.430> two

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.680 

1.5

and finally to and you can see the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.750 
and finally to and you can see the
graduated<00:01:51.960> sizes<00:01:52.200> one<00:01:53.010> thing<00:01:53.160> I<00:01:53.220> really<00:01:53.580> like

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
graduated sizes one thing I really like

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.550 
graduated sizes one thing I really like
about<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.150> tool<00:01:54.330> is<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.870> actually<00:01:55.050> really

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
about this tool is I can actually really

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.560 
about this tool is I can actually really
very<00:01:55.890> precisely<00:01:56.400> see<00:01:56.850> where<00:01:57.120> I'm<00:01:57.300> going<00:01:57.510> to

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
very precisely see where I'm going to

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.510 
very precisely see where I'm going to
punch<00:01:57.810> let's<00:01:58.590> say<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.770> was<00:01:58.920> lining<00:01:59.220> at<00:01:59.430> my

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
punch let's say I was lining at my

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.070 
punch let's say I was lining at my
rivets<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.060> want<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.330> make<00:02:00.420> sure<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.600> punched

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
rivets and I want to make sure I punched

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.470 
rivets and I want to make sure I punched
exactly<00:02:01.890> right<00:02:02.070> here<00:02:02.340> sometimes<00:02:02.880> with<00:02:03.210> some

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
exactly right here sometimes with some

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.610 
exactly right here sometimes with some
of<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.630> larger<00:02:03.900> tools<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.260> can<00:02:04.380> be<00:02:04.440> a<00:02:04.470> little

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
of the larger tools it can be a little

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.870 
of the larger tools it can be a little
hard<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.070> see<00:02:05.280> what<00:02:05.430> you're<00:02:05.580> doing

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
hard to see what you're doing

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.270 
hard to see what you're doing
but<00:02:06.390> with<00:02:06.510> this<00:02:06.780> because<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.620> needle<00:02:07.980> is<00:02:08.100> so

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
but with this because that needle is so

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.070 
but with this because that needle is so
slim<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.850> this<00:02:09.149> part<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.570> tool<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.930> so

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
slim and this part of the tool is so

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.920 
slim and this part of the tool is so
narrow<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:10.590> slim<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:11.100> can<00:02:12.000> punch<00:02:12.240> exactly

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
narrow and slim I can punch exactly

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.230 
narrow and slim I can punch exactly
where<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.230> want<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.740> punch<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.940> let<00:02:15.060> me<00:02:15.120> just

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
where I want to punch so let me just

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.090 
where I want to punch so let me just
show<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.450> on<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.660> cork<00:02:15.900> real<00:02:16.170> quick<00:02:16.410> as<00:02:16.560> well

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100
