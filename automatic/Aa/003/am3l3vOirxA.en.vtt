whoa<00:01:03.180> staff<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.949> think<00:01:05.309> cuz<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.150> episode<00:01:06.570> 45

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
whoa staff and I think cuz in episode 45

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.649 
whoa staff and I think cuz in episode 45
it<00:01:07.290> showed<00:01:07.530> there<00:01:07.770> was<00:01:07.890> writing<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.659> whose

it showed there was writing on whose

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.200 
it showed there was writing on whose
staff<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.350> think<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:11.130> some<00:01:11.430> kind<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.760> spell

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
staff so I think it's some kind of spell

ok and ok here's another picture with
Kai<00:02:16.430> I<00:02:16.819> think<00:02:17.180> probably<00:02:17.480> in<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.930> destinies

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
Kai I think probably in the destinies

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.069 
Kai I think probably in the destinies
about<00:02:18.560> his<00:02:18.709> boat<00:02:19.040> where<00:02:19.280> they<00:02:19.400> captured<00:02:19.909> him

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
about his boat where they captured him

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.080 
about his boat where they captured him
with<00:02:21.079> Ronan<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:22.040> he's<00:02:22.189> at<00:02:22.340> tape<00:02:22.610> over<00:02:22.939> his

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
with Ronan and he's at tape over his

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.050 
with Ronan and he's at tape over his
mouth<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.390> they<00:02:24.019> probably<00:02:24.790> held<00:02:25.790> him<00:02:25.909> hostage

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
mouth so they probably held him hostage

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.319 
mouth so they probably held him hostage
and<00:02:26.920> let<00:02:27.920> me<00:02:28.040> tell<00:02:28.189> let<00:02:28.489> me<00:02:28.519> tell<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.849> Ronon

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329
