00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 g2 to fulfill games in digital media 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:11.460
 as security and prices not to be missed link 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:14.549
 oops unique in description to another and 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.369
 merz remembering and karoubi looks and he is 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.230
 back and repaginated in very high 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.740
 definition in its new version 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.600
 available in the steam version of which 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.060
 the police play and bring mine now 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.449
 my opinion on this subject. 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.390
 specific version I will not comment 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.790
 So much will be very soon indeed. 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.309
 precisely because I've made a video with 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.530
 my considerations about the game as 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.750
 a whole including the dreamcast version 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.539
 playing comparative with my friend 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.129
 shell on channel shadow player games 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.320
 this video will be slow and 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.149
 description ok for those who have lost 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.930
 who want to know a little more about 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.289
 play a game that pulls the challenge to the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.989
 it really requires blood from the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.210
 player is a cruel but very 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.270
 fun for lovers of that genre 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.369
 which is becoming more and more rare is a great 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.450
 requested mainly now in high 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.760
 definition 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.080
 So now that it's relaunched, I'll 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.600
 I can play online 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.909
 no unfortunately does not have multiplayer 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.490
 online but local multiplayer continues 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.830
 lippi two players exactly like the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.290
 dreamcast also has the option of you 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.049
 play with two ships using only 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.720
 a control is very complicated you can 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.390
 it's not easy to see there, I can not 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.509
 play so each ship is controlled by 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.310
 logic and the controls and there 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.250
 halfway then left side for a 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.799
 ship with a game button to take the side 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.710
 right to another button on another button to 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.690
 this ship then shoot really is 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.450
 it is complicated even in this way of 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.729
 game there is another mode that is the mode 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.800
 all the hype the module a prototype where 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.050
 have a limit of shots you need to have 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.420
 reloading ammunition and really to 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.759
 who forcing hot because it is impossible 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.500
 or some bond made during game 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.500
 in these absurd modes 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.350
 I do not know even on the hardest difficulty. 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.410
 low the traditional line to case mod 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.060
 the game remains extremely challenging 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.860
 I did not mind spending the second 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.269
 chapter of the game that is much but a lot 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.060
 hardcore for those who did not know 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.470
 a great request is the Icarus now 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.269
 available on steam 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.030
 Many thanks to all who accompanied 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.800
 the tech video was actually in chat 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.630
 soon because I already did as I said the 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.300
 my thoughts on it then 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.700
 as a whole in the cast version video 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.070
 any critical doubt or suggestion may 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.900
 talk to me through social networks 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.900
