00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.709
 10 serve john and mark 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.629
 I know Russian 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.750
 so here's a farewell tour of the holes court 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.750
 houses 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:48.300
 well and so necessary in this task 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:53.809
 I try to take a couple of Jeju Mr. 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.339
 my ball hit takes Challenge to the point 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.489
 honest it seemed that the sword line 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:03.920
 land after its filing 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.920
 we will tell Hawkeye reserve 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.550
 the meeting was only two sets two months 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:19.590
 for fixing it 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:19.590
 and here is 22 john and sign again 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:37.240
 sasuke was just playing to force it 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.240
 would definitely allow not to miss at 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:51.780
 now probably will get to the sixth 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.899
 title in the history of his speeches on 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.899
 Hopman Cup 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:12.920
 and all six 163 john edgar win and 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.760
 bethany mota xanth need justine enen 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.180
 and ruby ​​bemelmans just under an hour 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.700
 it took 58 minutes to minutes and 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.660
 overall US team victory over the national team 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.209
 belgium 21 absolutely deserved success 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.390
 this is trainer john edgar on your screens 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.790
 was what is created to congratulate us 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.519
 team us our team if remember 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.950
 also in her time here excelled 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:42.519
 four years ago but now 6 times already 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.590
 in my story I repeat the US team 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.810
 wins the Hopman Betan Mott Cup 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.140
 end which title is still wrong 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.150
 much here her trainer is surely happy 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.640
 but john is also riding at the beginning of his journey 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.650
 Probably many of his titles are still only 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:03.800
 expect but for the Belgian team this too 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.370
 a great achievement that may be him 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.920
 they didn't do it at all 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.160
 fully deserved due to Serb failure 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.720
 still remind they played in the final yet 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.720
 congratulations to americans
