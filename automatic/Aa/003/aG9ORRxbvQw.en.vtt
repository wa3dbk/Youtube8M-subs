of how I review as far as checking out
negative<00:03:28.400> reviews<00:03:28.909> I<00:03:29.120> would<00:03:29.329> see<00:03:29.510> comments

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
negative reviews I would see comments

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.890 
negative reviews I would see comments
like<00:03:30.079> finally<00:03:30.590> an<00:03:30.859> honest<00:03:31.310> review<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:32.120> I

like finally an honest review and I

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.020 
like finally an honest review and I
would<00:03:33.139> think<00:03:33.349> a<00:03:33.590> now<00:03:34.069> I<00:03:34.459> don't<00:03:34.699> know<00:03:34.790> about<00:03:34.909> you

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
would think a now I don't know about you

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.240 
would think a now I don't know about you
guys<00:03:35.209> but<00:03:35.389> maybe<00:03:35.989> there's<00:03:36.349> a<00:03:36.440> perception<00:03:36.919> that

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
guys but maybe there's a perception that

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.699 
guys but maybe there's a perception that
negative<00:03:38.239> reviews<00:03:38.690> hold<00:03:39.049> more<00:03:39.199> value<00:03:39.680> than

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
negative reviews hold more value than

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.949 
negative reviews hold more value than
positive<00:03:40.400> ones<00:03:40.430> or<00:03:40.909> that<00:03:41.120> being<00:03:41.419> more

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
positive ones or that being more

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.170 
positive ones or that being more
critical<00:03:42.500> means<00:03:42.919> or<00:03:43.129> being<00:03:43.340> more<00:03:43.489> honest<00:03:43.970> and

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
critical means or being more honest and

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.050 
critical means or being more honest and
for<00:03:44.989> me<00:03:45.109> personally<00:03:45.319> I<00:03:45.650> do<00:03:45.949> not<00:03:46.190> see<00:03:46.849> it<00:03:47.000> that

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
for me personally I do not see it that

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.789 
for me personally I do not see it that
way<00:03:47.419> I<00:03:47.690> think<00:03:47.959> both<00:03:48.139> negative<00:03:48.379> and<00:03:48.709> positive

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
way I think both negative and positive

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.460 
way I think both negative and positive
reviews<00:03:49.699> hold<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.329> same<00:03:50.510> value<00:03:50.900> for<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.290> most

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
reviews hold the same value for the most

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.830 
reviews hold the same value for the most
part<00:03:51.680> unless<00:03:51.889> a<00:03:52.220> reviewer<00:03:52.639> is<00:03:52.909> obviously

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
part unless a reviewer is obviously

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.990 
part unless a reviewer is obviously
insincere<00:03:54.680> are<00:03:54.919> disingenuous<00:03:55.280> with<00:03:55.879> the

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
insincere are disingenuous with the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.059 
insincere are disingenuous with the
review<00:03:56.389> I<00:03:56.419> have<00:03:56.900> no<00:03:57.079> reason<00:03:57.379> to<00:03:58.040> think

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
review I have no reason to think

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.399 
review I have no reason to think
otherwise<00:03:58.400> of<00:03:59.239> what<00:03:59.629> they're<00:03:59.810> feeling<00:04:00.049> for

though when it really comes down to

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:20.080 
though when it really comes down to
reviewing

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
reviewing

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.180 
reviewing
positive<00:04:20.449> and<00:04:20.660> negative<00:04:20.750> is<00:04:21.350> that<00:04:21.410> you<00:04:21.980> have<00:04:22.160> a

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
positive and negative is that you have a

positive and negative is that you have a
really<00:04:22.430> strong<00:04:22.550> foundation<00:04:23.449> reasoning

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
really strong foundation reasoning

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.170 
really strong foundation reasoning
behind<00:04:24.260> why<00:04:24.590> you<00:04:24.740> liked<00:04:25.190> or<00:04:25.430> didn't<00:04:25.790> like<00:04:25.820> book

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
behind why you liked or didn't like book

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.939 
behind why you liked or didn't like book
and<00:04:26.510> I<00:04:26.570> think<00:04:26.780> as<00:04:26.930> long<00:04:27.139> as<00:04:27.350> you<00:04:27.500> go<00:04:27.650> over

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
and I think as long as you go over

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:29.590 
and I think as long as you go over
points<00:04:28.340> that<00:04:28.460> really<00:04:28.729> stood<00:04:28.970> out<00:04:29.180> to<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:29.570> that

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
points that really stood out to you that

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.450 
points that really stood out to you that
you<00:04:29.900> liked<00:04:30.139> or<00:04:30.260> disliked<00:04:30.800> then<00:04:31.070> I<00:04:31.250> think

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
you liked or disliked then I think

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.430 
you liked or disliked then I think
they're<00:04:31.580> being<00:04:31.790> as<00:04:31.910> honest<00:04:32.330> as<00:04:32.479> you<00:04:32.510> can<00:04:32.810> about

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
they're being as honest as you can about

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.750 
they're being as honest as you can about
the<00:04:33.620> book<00:04:33.770> hopefully<00:04:34.070> people<00:04:34.460> will

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760
