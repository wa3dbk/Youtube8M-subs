00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:04.433
 Which of the following is a true interpretation 

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:09.066
 of the expression 1 plus 6? 

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.656
 Before we read them, let's just think 

00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:13.666
 what happens to 1 plus 6 on the number axis. 

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.474
 I will start at 1, which will be 1 

00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:17.200
 to the right of 0. 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.967
 And then I'll add 6 more. 

00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:21.200
 I will move another 6 to the right of 0, 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.766
 to get to 7, 

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:25.733
 which will be 7 to the right of 0. 

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:29.266
 The number that is 6 left of 1 

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.733
 on the numerical axis. 

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:34.200
 Now with 6 left of 1, with this type of numerical axis, 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.700
 the standard numerical axis, 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.533
 which is positive to the right and negative to the left. 

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.986
 If you move 6 left, it means that 

00:00:39.986 --> 00:00:42.033
 you get 6 out of 1, so the answer is not true. 

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:43.733
 Add 6. 

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.571
 The number that is 6 to the right of 1 

00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:46.366
 on the numerical axis. 

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.866
 Yes exactly. 

00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.700
 We move 6 right. 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.966
 If you add 6, you move to the right. 

00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.700
 You will increase. 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.333
 Definitely this is the answer. 

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.000
 Let's continue. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.233
 Which of the following is a true interpretation 

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:04.833
 of phrase 3 plus minus 7? 

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:07.067
 Before we look at these answers, 

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.633
 one of the ways I can think of is starting from 3 

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:12.300
 and then move with 7 to the left of 3. 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.066
 Add minus 7. 

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:17.000
 This is the same as 3 minus 7. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.433
 I move 7 left of 3. 

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:21.033
 Let's see what they will say here. 

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:22.700
 Start from 7 on the numerical axis 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.133
 and move it to 3 on the left. 

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:24.933
 That makes no sense. 

00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.000
 I want to start at 3. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.533
 Let's jump to here. 

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:28.933
 We start from 3 on the numerical axis 

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.533
 and move with 7 to the left. 

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:31.966
 Yes exactly. 

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.366
 We will start at 3 

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:34.566
 and then we'll move on with 7 

00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.842
 in the negative direction to the left, 

00:01:36.842 --> 00:01:39.629
 if we follow the generally accepted standard practice, 

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:41.129
 that left is the negative, 

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:42.912
 and to the right are the positive numbers. 

00:01:42.912 --> 00:01:45.133
 So that's true. 

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.433
 Let's solve one more. 

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:50.000
 Now we have 3 minus, minus 4. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.904
 One possible approach is 

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:55.200
 to equate 3 minus, minus 4 to 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.100
 deducting a negative number, that's the same thing as 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.833
 adding a positive version. 

00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:01.300
 So it's the same as 3 plus 4. 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.773
 I want to start at 3 

00:02:03.773 --> 00:02:05.900
 and then move with 4 to the right. 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.639
 This is the same 

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:09.509
 like 3 plus 4. 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.666
 3 minus, minus 4 is the same thing 

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:13.733
 like 3 plus 4. 

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:17.200
 I want to start at 3 and move 4 right. 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.700
 I start at 3 and I move with 4 to the right. 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.567
 This will be the same as 3 plus 4, 

00:02:21.567 --> 00:02:25.078
 which is the same as this expression.
