either completely honest I mean uh huh
let's<00:03:31.639> see<00:03:31.879> my<00:03:32.030> hands<00:03:32.480> up<00:03:32.569> deciding<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:33.260> dreamy

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
let's see my hands up deciding to dreamy

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.869 
let's see my hands up deciding to dreamy
look<00:03:33.980> this<00:03:34.219> point<00:03:35.919> I<00:03:36.919> didn't<00:03:37.400> take<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:37.669> shots

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
look this point I didn't take the shots

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.819 
look this point I didn't take the shots
on<00:03:38.090> that<00:03:38.239> guy<00:03:38.389> and<00:03:38.780> he<00:03:39.169> only<00:03:39.290> saw<00:03:39.500> him<00:03:39.590> for<00:03:39.739> a

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
on that guy and he only saw him for a

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.099 
on that guy and he only saw him for a
brief<00:03:39.980> moment<00:03:40.239> he<00:03:41.239> knows<00:03:41.419> that<00:03:41.659> one<00:03:41.840> of<00:03:41.930> them's

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
brief moment he knows that one of them's

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:43.689 
brief moment he knows that one of them's
probably<00:03:42.230> pushing<00:03:42.769> up<00:03:42.949> from<00:03:43.069> that<00:03:43.280> way<00:03:43.489> and

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
probably pushing up from that way and

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:48.309 
probably pushing up from that way and
he's<00:03:43.849> 100<00:03:44.599> is<00:03:44.719> that<00:03:44.870> right<00:03:46.540> just<00:03:47.540> checking

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
he's 100 is that right just checking

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.550 
he's 100 is that right just checking
this<00:03:48.409> corners<00:03:48.799> I<00:03:49.099> mean<00:03:49.760> it<00:03:50.540> feels<00:03:51.139> a<00:03:51.409> little

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
this corners I mean it feels a little

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.610 
this corners I mean it feels a little
instinctively<00:03:52.340> that<00:03:52.519> he<00:03:52.879> knows<00:03:53.230> what's<00:03:54.230> going

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
instinctively that he knows what's going

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.530 
instinctively that he knows what's going
on<00:03:54.829> in<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.069> math<00:03:55.280> but<00:03:55.639> not<00:03:55.939> enough<00:03:56.209> to<00:03:56.239> where<00:03:56.389> i

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
on in the math but not enough to where i

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.270 
on in the math but not enough to where i
would<00:03:56.780> feel<00:03:56.989> suspicious<00:03:57.319> about<00:03:57.919> it<00:03:58.129> and

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
would feel suspicious about it and

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.679 
would feel suspicious about it and
things<00:03:58.489> could<00:03:58.699> easily<00:03:59.060> been<00:03:59.239> call<00:03:59.479> it<00:03:59.569> out

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
things could easily been call it out

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.890 
things could easily been call it out
from<00:03:59.900> other<00:04:00.049> positions<00:04:00.560> as<00:04:00.680> well<00:04:00.919> so<00:04:01.900> maybe

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
from other positions as well so maybe

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.379 
from other positions as well so maybe
it's<00:04:03.169> just<00:04:03.259> a<00:04:03.470> it<00:04:04.129> could<00:04:04.340> honestly<00:04:04.639> be<00:04:04.909> a<00:04:05.060> full

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
it's just a it could honestly be a full

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.240 
it's just a it could honestly be a full
pre-made<00:04:05.900> team<00:04:06.199> that<00:04:06.500> you<00:04:06.769> know<00:04:06.859> kind<00:04:07.159> of

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
pre-made team that you know kind of

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.030 
pre-made team that you know kind of
intertwined<00:04:07.819> with<00:04:08.030> each<00:04:08.060> other<00:04:08.359> because

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
intertwined with each other because

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.860

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.719 
evidence at all could really call that
so<00:06:39.960> for<00:06:40.440> me<00:06:40.560> it's<00:06:40.740> going<00:06:40.919> to<00:06:40.979> be<00:06:41.099> insufficient

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729
