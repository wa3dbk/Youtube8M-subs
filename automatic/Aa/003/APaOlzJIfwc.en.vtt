00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
an early position will be totally

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.199 
an early position will be totally
different<00:02:11.129> from<00:02:11.430> what<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.700> play<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.060> later

different from what you play in a later
position<00:02:12.629> at<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.780> time

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
position at the time

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.670 
position at the time
as<00:02:13.249> well<00:02:13.629> one<00:02:14.629> thing<00:02:14.989> that<00:02:15.019> a<00:02:15.170> lot<00:02:15.230> of<00:02:15.499> guides

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
as well one thing that a lot of guides

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.750 
as well one thing that a lot of guides
that<00:02:15.890> are<00:02:15.980> actually<00:02:16.159> out<00:02:16.430> there<00:02:16.459> on<00:02:16.670> the

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
that are actually out there on the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.699 
that are actually out there on the
internet<00:02:17.090> don't<00:02:17.269> really<00:02:17.480> tell<00:02:17.719> you<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.139> that

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
internet don't really tell you is that

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.770 
internet don't really tell you is that
the<00:02:19.609> strength<00:02:19.849> of<00:02:19.999> a<00:02:20.030> good<00:02:20.180> starting<00:02:20.540> hand

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
the strength of a good starting hand

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.449 
the strength of a good starting hand
depends<00:02:21.200> greatly<00:02:21.260> on<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.829> number<00:02:22.129> of<00:02:22.159> players

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
depends greatly on the number of players

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.030 
depends greatly on the number of players
left<00:02:22.730> in<00:02:22.909> the<00:02:22.999> game<00:02:23.209> and<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:24.290> number<00:02:24.409> of<00:02:24.650> callers

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
left in the game and a number of callers

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.979 
left in the game and a number of callers
as<00:02:25.189> well<00:02:25.579> just<00:02:25.999> a<00:02:26.090> quick<00:02:26.299> tip<00:02:26.480> just<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:26.870> keep

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
as well just a quick tip just to keep

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.629 
as well just a quick tip just to keep
that<00:02:27.139> in<00:02:27.200> mind<00:02:27.439> so<00:02:27.680> your<00:02:28.189> strength<00:02:28.430> of<00:02:28.549> your

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:28.639 
that in mind so your strength of your

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:29.709 
that in mind so your strength of your
starting<00:02:28.969> hand<00:02:29.120> will<00:02:29.239> be<00:02:29.329> totally<00:02:29.599> different

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:29.719 
starting hand will be totally different

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:30.970 
starting hand will be totally different
if<00:02:29.989> there's<00:02:30.170> 10<00:02:30.319> people<00:02:30.349> sitting<00:02:30.829> at<00:02:30.889> the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
if there's 10 people sitting at the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
table this is only three okay so you

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.250 
table this is only three okay so you
need<00:02:34.219> to<00:02:34.310> keep<00:02:34.459> all<00:02:34.639> that<00:02:34.730> in<00:02:34.790> mind<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.269> the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
need to keep all that in mind to the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.440 
need to keep all that in mind to the
next<00:02:36.500> thing<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.739> wanted<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.420> cover<00:02:38.420> off<00:02:38.810> was

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
next thing I wanted to cover off was

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.729 
next thing I wanted to cover off was
strategies<00:02:41.450> about<00:02:41.989> betting<00:02:42.379> betting

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
strategies about betting betting

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.399 
strategies about betting betting
strategies<00:02:43.189> so<00:02:43.400> preflop<00:02:44.329> post-flop<00:02:45.079> as<00:02:45.230> well

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
strategies so preflop post-flop as well

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:46.959 
strategies so preflop post-flop as well
there's<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.069> lot<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:46.280> different<00:02:46.340> strategies

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:46.969 
there's a lot of different strategies

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.209 
there's a lot of different strategies
that<00:02:47.090> are<00:02:47.150> out<00:02:47.359> there<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:48.590> what<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:49.069> actually

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:49.219 
that are out there and what you actually

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.240 
that are out there and what you actually
do<00:02:49.549> especially<00:02:50.180> in<00:02:50.389> preflop<00:02:50.750> as<00:02:50.989> well<00:02:51.250> is

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
do especially in preflop as well is

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.610 
do especially in preflop as well is
directly<00:02:53.000> affected<00:02:53.449> by<00:02:53.599> your<00:02:53.989> starting<00:02:54.379> hand

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
directly affected by your starting hand

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.869 
directly affected by your starting hand
and<00:02:54.859> where<00:02:54.980> you're<00:02:55.099> sitting<00:02:55.280> at<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.519> table

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
and where you're sitting at the table

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.209 
and where you're sitting at the table
and<00:02:56.030> so<00:02:56.329> there<00:02:57.079> are<00:02:57.139> some<00:02:57.379> really<00:02:57.590> cool<00:02:57.859> charts

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:58.219 
and so there are some really cool charts

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.530 
and so there are some really cool charts
out<00:02:58.370> there<00:02:58.579> there's<00:02:58.790> one<00:02:58.819> on<00:02:59.030> screen<00:02:59.299> at<00:02:59.480> the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
out there there's one on screen at the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.000 
out there there's one on screen at the
moment<00:02:59.870> that<00:03:00.019> you<00:03:00.169> can<00:03:00.349> see<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:00.680> helps<00:03:00.919> you

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
moment that you can see that helps you

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.080 
moment that you can see that helps you
actually<00:03:01.310> figure<00:03:01.519> out<00:03:01.549> what<00:03:01.730> you<00:03:01.819> should<00:03:01.969> do

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
actually figure out what you should do

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.000 
actually figure out what you should do
in<00:03:02.209> certain<00:03:02.359> situations<00:03:02.919> eventually<00:03:03.919> you

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
in certain situations eventually you

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.110 
in certain situations eventually you
won't<00:03:04.099> need<00:03:04.280> them<00:03:04.430> but<00:03:04.730> they're<00:03:04.909> a<00:03:04.939> good

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
won't need them but they're a good

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.229 
won't need them but they're a good
starting<00:03:05.419> point<00:03:05.629> as<00:03:05.810> well<00:03:06.669> the<00:03:07.669> next<00:03:07.819> thing<00:03:08.000> I

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
starting point as well the next thing I

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.929 
starting point as well the next thing I

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
equations that relate to okay well what

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:51.729 
equations that relate to okay well what

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
money's in the pot then whether it's

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.369 
money's in the pot then whether it's
worth<00:03:55.159> you<00:03:56.090> actually<00:03:56.540> making<00:03:56.719> the<00:03:56.870> next<00:03:57.169> bit

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
worth you actually making the next bit

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.259 
worth you actually making the next bit
based<00:03:57.949> on<00:03:58.159> how<00:03:58.310> many<00:03:58.519> cards<00:03:58.790> are<00:03:59.000> actually

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
based on how many cards are actually

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.959 
based on how many cards are actually
coming<00:03:59.449> out<00:03:59.689> of<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.900> pack<00:04:00.129> this<00:04:01.129> is<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.669> lot<00:04:01.909> of

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:01.969 
coming out of the pack this is a lot of

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:03.159 
coming out of the pack this is a lot of
different<00:04:02.209> our<00:04:02.419> ways<00:04:02.599> to<00:04:02.750> actually<00:04:02.900> work<00:04:03.139> with

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
different our ways to actually work with

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:05.530 
different our ways to actually work with
stuff<00:04:03.469> out<00:04:03.620> on<00:04:03.709> the<00:04:03.799> fly<00:04:04.009> and<00:04:04.729> it's<00:04:05.090> very<00:04:05.329> very

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
stuff out on the fly and it's very very

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.199 
stuff out on the fly and it's very very
useful<00:04:05.750> okay<00:04:06.439> one<00:04:07.069> thing<00:04:07.099> like<00:04:07.430> order<00:04:07.939> also

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
useful okay one thing like order also

useful okay one thing like order also
recommend<00:04:08.810> is<00:04:08.959> you<00:04:09.109> should<00:04:09.289> make<00:04:09.469> decisions

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:09.979 
recommend is you should make decisions

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:13.089 
recommend is you should make decisions
based<00:04:10.039> on<00:04:10.459> maths<00:04:11.090> not<00:04:11.719> chance<00:04:12.349> not<00:04:12.680> luck<00:04:12.919> or

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
based on maths not chance not luck or

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.439 
based on maths not chance not luck or
anything<00:04:13.340> like<00:04:13.370> unless<00:04:13.849> you've<00:04:14.180> won<00:04:14.329> the

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
but when people are playing with four

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.300 
but when people are playing with four
with<00:04:40.810> play<00:04:41.020> money<00:04:41.050> it's<00:04:41.529> you<00:04:41.860> don't<00:04:42.099> get<00:04:42.219> the

with play money it's you don't get the
