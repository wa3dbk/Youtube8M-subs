00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.260
 hi friends my name is Sasha dragon and 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.990
 today you watch the next editions and 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.070
 series skill up skill up this tips for 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.480
 dancers who always help and 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.520
 Today we will talk about such an important 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.490
 indispensable in the household economy 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.130
 the housework thing is glide says it is not 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.330
 cute but he should slide glide it 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.550
 your movement 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.160
 which you do in such a way that 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.630
 create the illusion of your viewer 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:41.309
 that you somehow move very smoothly 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.680
 unreal perfectly and so how is this 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.329
 reach in one of the release you releases i 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.940
 told you about the main secret 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.620
 balance glide I won't 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.070
 say what kind of release find it 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.770
 yourself 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.300
 I will not say what is this secret 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.250
 will find out i'll tell you now 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.100
 about the second component of this secret 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.649
 about which I did not tell earlier that it 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:07.950
 so to do cool glide 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:09.500
 it is necessary to transfer very relief 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.270
 heel and toe 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.360
 very many make such a mistake they 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.770
 make glide like that no matter what 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.659
 so here it is and it turns out extremely 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.780
 no relief is due to the fact that 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.799
 There is no pronounced transition here with 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.710
 heels on a toe that is to say 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.630
 must be very tall thoughtful 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:39.210
 transition well if you look at that 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.030
 release to the end you have this transition 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.740
 will appear because I charge you 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.930
 right transition ok 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.820
 i'm not really joking if you learn 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.590
 this transition is correct then you have glide and 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.829
 right up in the sun or 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.689
 Well, very noticeably what is ready then 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.040
 we will do the exercises that attention 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.810
 on my legs so that you and you 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.430
 learned to do and competent transition 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.290
 between heel and toe 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.060
 do a very simple exercise 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.550
 put your heel on the floor 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.310
 basis weight I now have here but 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.640
 this leg here 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:18.410
 with no i'm doing just such a thing 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:21.739
 just pool pool that is such a picking 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.450
 ochku see here I'm standing right on my heels 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.140
 on the tip but I have no weight on my leg 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.840
 see sock but I have no weight leg 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.620
 empty this foot is empty on it 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.920
 weight all weight right here is simple 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.360
 exercise do it necessarily on 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:47.870
 both legs while it should look 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:50.120
 air puma memory memory memory 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.010
 that is, the whole illusion is here 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.830
 this is not really necessary well 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.080
 can turn out yes that is right here 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.260
 here you are and powerfully returned here to her 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.459
 powerfully turned the heel sock and 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.299
 turnout and now I will reveal to you the most 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.610
 top secret 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.459
 for which it was generally worth living on it 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.590
 Do not switch the light, and so is the 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.019
 the main secret is that when i 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.989
 do glide when i do glide i 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.209
 combining continuous movement with 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.310
 movement here this heel sock carrying 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:26.810
 I see, I will show you now how it is 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:30.739
 make here look here is the movement itself 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:35.109
 directly without they are the answer here 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.109
 here is motion uniform motion 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.230
 and now I add another transition from the heel 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.390
 on the toe 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.740
 here it turns out is such a very 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:51.250
 illusory beautiful movement i mean i 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.520
 combining two things first thing I combine 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.500
 just moving the second thing I combine 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.590
 here is an exercise that you already 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.260
 showed clearly and the task is to do so 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.440
 so here on this and on this leg the weight is not 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:11.830
 there was a whole weight right there on the legs 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:16.800
 and so once again I recall the usual movement 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:21.330
 there is no weight and the usual movement is this 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.330
 I fold it turns out 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.640
 they should be glued as if you were their 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.280
 will take blinded together and here they are 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.220
 become one 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.750
 see then there will be more 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.500
 illusive look what you do 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.500
 like glide and 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.380
 that with friends, I hope with this 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.610
 release you have already come to half 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:10.100
 enlightenment is great beyond that 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.720
 still learned to do well glide it 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.910
 there was a second secret about which I tell you 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.980
 told the first secret you find yourself 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.590
 on my youtube channel here's my 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.600
 YouTube channel first you need now 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.240
 subscribe to it and those who have not yet 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.520
 I found a release about the skill from where 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.280
 the main secret was revealed 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.860
 glide look look look and 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.520
 subscribe well and also if you this 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.230
 release seemed useful and interesting 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.060
 but I think I need to be too 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.730
 cool i'll be cool if you 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.440
 like this video you can 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:46.850
 write something comment and most importantly 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:51.910
 Like this hockey with you 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.910
