00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.720 

the<00:00:06.839> principle<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.470> dye<00:00:07.710> curtain<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.490> same

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
the principle of dye curtain is the same

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.480 
the principle of dye curtain is the same
with<00:00:08.970> every<00:00:09.300> machine<00:00:09.510> all<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:10.620> changes<00:00:11.219> is

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
with every machine all that changes is

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.879 
with every machine all that changes is
the<00:00:11.610> combination<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.450> plates<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:13.559> brand

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
the combination of the plates the brand

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.099 
the combination of the plates the brand
or<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.400> size<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.969> shape<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.420> dye<00:00:15.750> and

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
or the size and shape of the dye and

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.820 
or the size and shape of the dye and
whether<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.160> machine<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.640> mechanical<00:00:18.570> or

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
whether the machine is mechanical or

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.939 
whether the machine is mechanical or
electric<00:00:19.850> so<00:00:20.850> first<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.390> all<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:22.260> place<00:00:22.560> your

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
electric so first of all you place your

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.839 
electric so first of all you place your
dye<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:23.730> your<00:00:23.760> plates<00:00:24.529> so<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:26.130> case<00:00:26.460> we've

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
dye on your plates so in this case we've

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.450 
dye on your plates so in this case we've
got<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.090> combination<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.960> plates<00:00:28.260> plates<00:00:29.189> are

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
got a combination of plates plates are

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.519 
got a combination of plates plates are
going<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.730> be<00:00:29.820> built<00:00:30.090> up<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.810> what<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.320> call<00:00:31.470> a

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
going to be built up and what we call a

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.340 
going to be built up and what we call a
sandwich<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.790> built<00:00:33.120> up<00:00:33.360> until<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.930> comes<00:00:34.140> to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
sandwich is built up until it comes to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.290 
sandwich is built up until it comes to
the<00:00:34.469> depth<00:00:34.770> where<00:00:35.399> when<00:00:35.579> pass<00:00:35.850> through<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
the depth where when pass through the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.510 
the depth where when pass through the
rollers<00:00:36.719> inside<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.440> Machine<00:00:37.800> there'll<00:00:38.489> be

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
rollers inside the Machine there'll be

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.790 
rollers inside the Machine there'll be
enough<00:00:38.879> pressure<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.930> actually<00:00:40.379> secure

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
enough pressure on it to actually secure

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.369 
enough pressure on it to actually secure
the<00:00:41.040> cut<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.270> cut<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.750> made<00:00:42.960> by<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the cut and the cut is made by the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.920 
the cut and the cut is made by the
raised<00:00:43.800> areas<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.090> dive<00:00:45.270> which<00:00:45.570> are<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
raised areas on the dive which are the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.410 
raised areas on the dive which are the
blades<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:47.190> I'm<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.610> put<00:00:48.239> my<00:00:48.360> sandwich

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
blades so I'm going to put my sandwich

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.590 
blades so I'm going to put my sandwich
together<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.280> case<00:00:50.610> I'm<00:00:51.180> going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.480> be

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
together so in this case I'm going to be

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.200 
together so in this case I'm going to be
using<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:52.379> couple<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.980> different<00:00:53.340> plates<00:00:53.610> but

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
using a couple of different plates but

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.970 
using a couple of different plates but
please<00:00:54.420> don't<00:00:54.750> worry<00:00:54.930> if<00:00:55.289> your<00:00:55.500> plates<00:00:55.770> get

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
please don't worry if your plates get

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.729 
please don't worry if your plates get
marked<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.670> these<00:00:57.000> or<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.870> fact<00:00:58.079> they<00:00:58.410> change

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
marked like these or in fact they change

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.439 
marked like these or in fact they change
shape<00:00:58.859> it's<00:00:59.670> quite<00:01:00.000> normal

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
shape it's quite normal

shape it's quite normal
you're<00:01:00.719> not<00:01:00.899> damaging<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.410> machine<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
you're not damaging the machine and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.000 
you're not damaging the machine and
you're<00:01:02.489> certainly<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:02.910> gonna<00:01:03.180> gin<00:01:03.480> your<00:01:03.629> dye

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
you're certainly not gonna gin your dye

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.770 
you're certainly not gonna gin your dye
so<00:01:05.010> I'm<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.430> place<00:01:05.670> my<00:01:05.700> dye<00:01:06.090> onto<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
so I'm going to place my dye onto the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.750 
so I'm going to place my dye onto the
plate<00:01:07.049> now<00:01:07.950> at<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.220> point<00:01:08.490> there's

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
plate now at this point there's

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.490 
plate now at this point there's
something<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.600> do<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.320> will<00:01:10.470> make

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
something that we can do that will make

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.920 
something that we can do that will make
our<00:01:10.860> lives<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.220> little<00:01:11.340> bit<00:01:11.549> easier<00:01:11.810> first<00:01:12.810> of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
our lives a little bit easier first of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.800 
our lives a little bit easier first of
all<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.229> dye<00:01:13.380> moves<00:01:13.680> around<00:01:14.420> to<00:01:15.420> stop<00:01:15.659> that

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
all the dye moves around to stop that

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.630 
all the dye moves around to stop that
happening<00:01:16.049> I'm<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.220> work<00:01:17.400> with<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
happening I'm going to work with a

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.539 
happening I'm going to work with a
magnetic<00:01:18.299> shim<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> very<00:01:19.950> very<00:01:20.400> thin

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
magnetic shim this is a very very thin

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.510 
magnetic shim this is a very very thin
tattered<00:01:21.540> lace<00:01:21.570> shim<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.680> can<00:01:22.830> see<00:01:23.040> how<00:01:23.250> thin

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
tattered lace shim you can see how thin

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.249 
tattered lace shim you can see how thin
it<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.759> by<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.119> way<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.360> could<00:01:24.600> scrunch<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.110> up

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
it is by the way I could scrunch it up

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.800 
it is by the way I could scrunch it up
and<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:26.070> will<00:01:26.220> then<00:01:26.340> flatten<00:01:26.850> out<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.720> I'm

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
and it will then flatten out so I'm

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.819 
and it will then flatten out so I'm
going<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> place<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.380> onto<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:30.060> base<00:01:30.270> plate

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
going to place that onto the base plate

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.039 
going to place that onto the base plate
just<00:01:31.829> smooth<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.159> out<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.939> pop<00:01:33.479> my<00:01:33.600> dye<00:01:33.659> in

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
just smooth that out and pop my dye in

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.010 
just smooth that out and pop my dye in
position<00:01:34.590> dye<00:01:35.040> now<00:01:35.310> isn't<00:01:35.759> going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.119> move<00:01:36.360> so

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
position dye now isn't going to move so

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.530 
position dye now isn't going to move so
it's<00:01:37.140> securely<00:01:37.560> held<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:38.100> place<00:01:38.250> I've<00:01:39.030> got<00:01:39.390> a

this<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.759> cutting<00:01:47.970> plate<00:01:48.299> that's<00:01:48.600> gonna

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
this is the cutting plate that's gonna

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.499 
this is the cutting plate that's gonna
go<00:01:48.990> on<00:01:49.020> top<00:01:49.549> so<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.670> blade<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.180> dye<00:01:51.450> is

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
go on top so the blade of the dye is

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.050 
go on top so the blade of the dye is
gonna<00:01:51.869> cut<00:01:52.140> through<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.619> cardstock<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.520> then

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
gonna cut through the cardstock and then

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.030 
gonna cut through the cardstock and then
it<00:01:54.390> may<00:01:54.689> leave<00:01:54.960> an<00:01:55.170> impression<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:55.860> the

plastic that's all part of the process

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.069 
plastic that's all part of the process
and<00:01:58.409> quite<00:01:58.619> okay<00:01:59.149> so<00:02:00.149> with<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.479> rest<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.930> my

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
and quite okay so with the rest of my

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.830 
and quite okay so with the rest of my
plate<00:02:01.549> this<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.790> combination<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.689> I'm

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
plate this is the combination that I'm

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.620 
plate this is the combination that I'm
using<00:02:04.110> as<00:02:04.829> my<00:02:05.399> sandwich<00:02:05.850> I'm<00:02:06.119> now<00:02:06.329> going<00:02:06.540> to

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
using as my sandwich I'm now going to

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.080 
using as my sandwich I'm now going to
pass<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:07.079> through<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.439> machine<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.789> I'm<00:02:08.879> going

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
pass it through the machine so I'm going

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.449 
pass it through the machine so I'm going
to<00:02:09.149> feed<00:02:09.479> those<00:02:09.720> plates<00:02:10.110> through<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.860> then

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
to feed those plates through and then

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.720 
to feed those plates through and then
start<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.090> turn<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.510> handle<00:02:12.959> and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
start to turn the handle and

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.059 
start to turn the handle and
hold<00:02:13.849> onto<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.269> machine<00:02:14.629> best<00:02:15.500> machines<00:02:15.890> have

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
hold onto the machine best machines have

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.530 
hold onto the machine best machines have
little<00:02:16.340> rubber<00:02:16.550> feet<00:02:16.819> on<00:02:17.090> them<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:17.420> those

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
little rubber feet on them and those

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.839 
little rubber feet on them and those
little<00:02:17.750> rubber<00:02:18.019> feet<00:02:18.200> make<00:02:19.190> sure<00:02:19.489> that<00:02:19.700> the

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
little rubber feet make sure that the

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.869 
little rubber feet make sure that the
machine<00:02:20.000> doesn't<00:02:20.569> move<00:02:20.750> on<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.080> table

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
machine doesn't move on the table

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.550 
machine doesn't move on the table
sometimes<00:02:22.879> it'll<00:02:23.120> take<00:02:23.420> one<00:02:23.659> pass<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.260> cut<00:02:24.440> the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
sometimes it'll take one pass to cut the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.100 
sometimes it'll take one pass to cut the
die<00:02:24.709> perfectly<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:26.030> other<00:02:26.299> occasions<00:02:26.870> you

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
die perfectly and other occasions you

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.070 
die perfectly and other occasions you
may<00:02:27.260> want<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.650> use<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.190> second<00:02:28.580> pass<00:02:28.930> often<00:02:29.930> use

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
may want to use a second pass often use

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.690 
may want to use a second pass often use
the<00:02:30.230> second<00:02:30.620> part<00:02:30.830> because<00:02:31.250> it's<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:31.580> much

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
the second part because it's so much

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.390 
the second part because it's so much
easier<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:32.750> take<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.230> die<00:02:33.410> back<00:02:33.830> out<00:02:34.069> of<00:02:34.099> the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
easier to take the die back out of the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.780 
easier to take the die back out of the
machine<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:35.209> way<00:02:35.360> that<00:02:35.540> we<00:02:35.599> put<00:02:35.840> it<00:02:35.959> in<00:02:36.790> so

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
machine the way that we put it in so

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.100 
machine the way that we put it in so
what<00:02:37.940> will<00:02:38.030> happen<00:02:38.390> then<00:02:38.599> well<00:02:38.959> you'll<00:02:39.080> be

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
what will happen then well you'll be

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.800 
what will happen then well you'll be
left<00:02:39.410> with<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.860> waste<00:02:40.099> you<00:02:40.940> may<00:02:41.120> find<00:02:41.450> little

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
left with the waste you may find little

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.229 
left with the waste you may find little
pieces<00:02:42.049> of<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.860> card<00:02:43.099> stock<00:02:43.340> actually<00:02:43.579> on<00:02:43.940> the

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
pieces of the card stock actually on the

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.300 
pieces of the card stock actually on the
cutting<00:02:44.599> plate<00:02:44.810> which<00:02:45.110> we<00:02:45.319> can<00:02:45.500> wipe<00:02:45.680> off<00:02:45.950> and

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
cutting plate which we can wipe off and

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.229 
cutting plate which we can wipe off and
then<00:02:46.970> you've<00:02:47.180> got<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.599> die<00:02:47.780> itself<00:02:49.090> now<00:02:50.090> with

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
then you've got the die itself now with

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.819 
then you've got the die itself now with
some<00:02:50.450> dies<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:50.959> may<00:02:51.079> have<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.349> push<00:02:51.560> out<00:02:51.799> the

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
some dies you may have to push out the

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.250 
some dies you may have to push out the
elements<00:02:52.459> with<00:02:53.090> tattered<00:02:53.450> lace<00:02:53.480> because<00:02:54.019> they

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
elements with tattered lace because they

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.349 
elements with tattered lace because they
have<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.470> non-stick<00:02:54.980> coating<00:02:55.250> we<00:02:56.180> can

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
have a non-stick coating we can

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.479 
have a non-stick coating we can
literally<00:02:56.810> just<00:02:57.079> drop<00:02:57.349> out<00:02:57.560> these<00:02:57.859> elements

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
literally just drop out these elements

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.330 
literally just drop out these elements
sometimes<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.599> short<00:02:59.900> tap<00:03:00.260> actually<00:03:01.099> allows

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
sometimes a short tap actually allows

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.520 
sometimes a short tap actually allows
everything<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:02.030> pop<00:03:02.209> out<00:03:02.450> but<00:03:03.049> in<00:03:03.140> this<00:03:03.260> case

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
everything to pop out but in this case

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.789 
everything to pop out but in this case
it's<00:03:04.099> cut<00:03:04.400> cleanly<00:03:04.730> any<00:03:05.690> excess<00:03:06.440> little

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
it's cut cleanly any excess little

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.190 
it's cut cleanly any excess little
pieces<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.549> are<00:03:07.700> still<00:03:07.970> left<00:03:08.209> in<00:03:08.599> the<00:03:08.989> dye

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
pieces that are still left in the dye

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.259 
pieces that are still left in the dye
can<00:03:09.859> be<00:03:09.890> wiggled<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.640> will<00:03:10.819> drop<00:03:11.030> out

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
can be wiggled and will drop out

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.860 
can be wiggled and will drop out
naturally<00:03:11.959> or<00:03:12.200> we<00:03:13.129> can<00:03:13.340> use<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:13.970> pokey<00:03:14.599> tool

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
naturally or we can use a pokey tool

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.099 
naturally or we can use a pokey tool
which<00:03:15.769> looks<00:03:16.069> something<00:03:16.280> like<00:03:16.760> this<00:03:17.359> to<00:03:18.079> just

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
which looks something like this to just

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.580 
which looks something like this to just
push<00:03:18.500> out<00:03:18.739> those<00:03:19.489> extra<00:03:20.000> little<00:03:20.090> elements<00:03:20.989> but

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
push out those extra little elements but

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.069 
push out those extra little elements but
there<00:03:21.769> we<00:03:21.919> go<00:03:22.130> there's<00:03:22.549> our<00:03:22.700> perfect<00:03:23.209> cuts<00:03:23.569> and

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
there we go there's our perfect cuts and

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.710 
there we go there's our perfect cuts and
I've<00:03:24.470> also<00:03:24.650> cut<00:03:25.099> at<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.370> same<00:03:25.609> time<00:03:25.970> the

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
I've also cut at the same time the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.309 
I've also cut at the same time the
little<00:03:26.989> bird<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.940> little<00:03:29.209> bow<00:03:29.419> so<00:03:30.200> all

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
little bird and the little bow so all

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.979 
little bird and the little bow so all
three<00:03:30.650> of<00:03:30.680> those<00:03:31.010> have<00:03:31.639> cut<00:03:31.940> from<00:03:32.150> my<00:03:32.389> die

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
three of those have cut from my die

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.409 
three of those have cut from my die
while<00:03:33.799> I've<00:03:33.950> got<00:03:33.980> this<00:03:34.340> die<00:03:34.579> in<00:03:34.639> my<00:03:34.849> hand<00:03:35.090> I'm

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:35.419 
while I've got this die in my hand I'm

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.720 
while I've got this die in my hand I'm
just<00:03:35.569> going<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:35.930> explain<00:03:36.349> to<00:03:36.620> you<00:03:36.769> about<00:03:37.549> these

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
just going to explain to you about these

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.479 
just going to explain to you about these
little<00:03:38.150> tiny<00:03:38.480> bridges<00:03:39.139> that<00:03:39.709> we've<00:03:39.889> got<00:03:40.130> here

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
little tiny bridges that we've got here

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.270 
little tiny bridges that we've got here
that<00:03:41.180> are<00:03:41.329> holding<00:03:41.599> these<00:03:42.049> extra<00:03:42.590> die<00:03:42.739> pieces

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
that are holding these extra die pieces

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.270 
that are holding these extra die pieces
in<00:03:43.459> place<00:03:43.760> if<00:03:44.239> you<00:03:45.109> want<00:03:45.319> to<00:03:45.530> remove<00:03:45.859> them

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
in place if you want to remove them

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.520 
in place if you want to remove them
anywhere<00:03:47.090> there's<00:03:47.329> a<00:03:47.480> little<00:03:47.810> tiny<00:03:48.079> bridge

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
anywhere there's a little tiny bridge

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.740 
anywhere there's a little tiny bridge
that's<00:03:49.250> been<00:03:49.459> used<00:03:49.730> in<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.060> manufacturing

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
that's been used in the manufacturing
