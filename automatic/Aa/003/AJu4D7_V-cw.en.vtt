not even scratched oh the squatter

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.070 
not even scratched oh the squatter
screen<00:01:46.750> is<00:01:46.900> actually<00:01:48.390> starting<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.420> lift<00:01:49.810> up

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
screen is actually starting to lift up

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.850 
screen is actually starting to lift up
I'm<00:01:50.590> not<00:01:50.830> sure<00:01:50.890> if<00:01:51.100> you<00:01:51.250> can<00:01:51.370> see<00:01:51.430> that<00:01:52.620> but<00:01:53.620> the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
I'm not sure if you can see that but the

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.290 
I'm not sure if you can see that but the
screen<00:01:54.070> looks<00:01:54.190> like<00:01:54.640> it's<00:01:54.820> starting<00:01:54.970> to<00:01:55.180> come

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
screen looks like it's starting to come

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.790 
screen looks like it's starting to come
off<00:01:56.220> but<00:01:57.220> I<00:01:57.750> pretty<00:01:58.750> sure<00:01:58.960> it<00:01:59.290> would<00:01:59.440> still

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
off but I pretty sure it would still

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.330 
off but I pretty sure it would still
work<00:02:01.200> because<00:02:02.200> it's<00:02:02.680> just<00:02:02.830> starting<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.130> raise

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
work because it's just starting to raise

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.880 
work because it's just starting to raise
a<00:02:03.370> little<00:02:03.610> bit<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.580> can't<00:02:07.000> really<00:02:07.090> see<00:02:07.330> it

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
a little bit so you can't really see it

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.580 
a little bit so you can't really see it
on<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.070> camera<00:02:09.100> so<00:02:09.850> it's<00:02:10.000> not<00:02:10.060> that<00:02:10.179> bad<00:02:10.590> I'm

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
on the camera so it's not that bad I'm

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.220 
on the camera so it's not that bad I'm
gonna<00:02:11.800> drop<00:02:12.070> it<00:02:12.220> from<00:02:12.310> like<00:02:12.900> six<00:02:13.900> feet<00:02:14.170> now

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
gonna drop it from like six feet now

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.260 
gonna drop it from like six feet now
because<00:02:14.860> this<00:02:15.070> thing<00:02:15.310> seems<00:02:15.670> pretty<00:02:15.790> durable

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
because this thing seems pretty durable

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.770 
because this thing seems pretty durable
