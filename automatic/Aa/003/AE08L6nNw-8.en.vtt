00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.890
 Korean brand 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.110
 charming provocative and even flirtatious 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.520
 That's the night you lied month and 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.410
 especially on the street saw a point 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.540
 very popular and entertaining city 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.480

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.489
 presley but during the day and crossing 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.520
 from Tennessee to very south and we had the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.650
 opportunity to try the new sonata 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.360
 2015 the seventh generation of one of the 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.910
 most iconic models of the Korean brand 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.160
 presents changes and improvements that you are going 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.080
 to want to look very carefully is for 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.320
 that reason it's worth stopping at 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.630
 the way and analyze it with good calm and 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.009
 we have stopped on the road of the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.649
 sonata lehamn test of the year 2015 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.100
 I find that equal my great friend colleague 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.100
 journalist 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.560
 cold missis push the border 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.480
 towards Mississippi from Tennessee and maybe 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.640
 part of the environmental noise that are 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.290
 listening does not correspond to the car but 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.930
 that we are in a region in which there is 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.030
 a fumigation plane that is being 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.680
 occupying agricultural labor and that is 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.210
 the noise that there is now but we have come 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.820
 stalled of course I approve the 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.030
 seventh the seventh was gentlemen the 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.890
 seventh generation of ondrej sonata el 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.590
 vehicle that was a freddy era the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.750
 standard bearer of hyundai is no longer city 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.060
 has now the genesis and have the 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.820
 liquid but no doubt this is still 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.500
 the one of the most important vehicles 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.400
 in the panoply of chickens Company 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.500
 because this segment of the sedans 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.500
 medium is still the most important 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.909
 challenging two contenders 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.040
 historical which are in this case the sling 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:19.569
 accord and the toyota cambry and it is 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.689
 doing very well accurate that also 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.420
 they are looking back from by melting that has 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:27.970
 gained ground within that battle of 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.790
 the sedans is the American case 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.140
 american american exactly one of 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.390
 the interesting things that the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.210
 vehicle that we have 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.780
 we will continue counting in this edition 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.400
 of car power 360 in Spanish is that the 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.730
 car has grown inside arranges 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.730
 Photos 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.940
 surely maybe he was even treated 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.380
 on camera to the plane when joking I'll 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.580
 He also commented that the car 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.130
 it grew from its interior 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.690
 now according to where he says he has the 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.860
 space for the legs 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.380
 more generous of the entire segment also 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.790
 the space for the head the amplitude 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.070
 that offers you that space between 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.709
 head and what is the roof is also 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.510
 one of the most extensive because they have 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.340
 added to what is the distance between 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.130
 axes and also the cabin itself has 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.050
 grown yes for more comfort in this 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.270
 moment what we do not have is a 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.090
 surprise new v6 engine in this 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.860
 generation the three engines are four 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.730
 cylinder four cylinder that 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.650
 translates into 1.65 also the 2.0 turbo that 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.570
 is one of the novelties have added a 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.180
 turbo for greater efficiency greater 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.120
 power to improve the experience and is 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.560
 the 2.4 that is this version that we 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.940
 can see in the back and that 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.190
 we will be showing you more 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.410
 carefully those we have tried 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.150
 we have tried as it is said of all 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.750
 colors and flavors not the white vehicle 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.750
 and one color 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.840
 species like that from well intense that 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.150
 it is a new color a new revelation 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.400
 that he was driving in the morning and 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.849
 Of course they are very important 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.220
 one of the things that most calls me the 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:12.090
 attention and it's incredibly 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.090
 soundproof 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.650
 once there is very little almost zero 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.840
 sound of the wind generated by the 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.760
 mirrors and the other thing is that the 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.260
 tires with which it is footwear 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.570
 the car, they are extremely 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.550
 silent specifically in the 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.340
 marker at 60 miles per hour and also 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.570
 a little test for everything normal about 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.949
 the 80 miles per hour that is not 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.080
 allowed because sense with a 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:38.600
 speed that immediately reveals how 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.419
 noisy are the shoes that causes the 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.340
 car that causes the car that is what most 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.560
 you liked in a few words the new 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.000
 sonata 2015 I like the style and I 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.310
 it seems that much more beautiful is' a 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.070
 continue so it is a delay loves the 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.370
 flow and the design that is as if it were 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.289
 another ear of a car sculpted to 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.840
 through a current of air is a 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.060
 sort of concept invented in 34 years 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.270
 by the crash and great flower habitually 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.729
 of my followers this server both in 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.130
 radio as a written company they already know 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.220
 every time they communicate with me if I 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:16.500
 they say that I have a manifest enthusiasm 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.199
 which is not only this company 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.389
 coming from below the sonata is different 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:24.060
 or nothing yet when I founded sell a 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.889
 company so cherished in the usa 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.470
 the models that exist with the case of 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.820
 access and all that person is in spite 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.220
 of that still 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:37.380
 What was more what more you 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.380
 has liked my dear new 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:48.400
 but obviously I would have to do 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.890
 a summary what is what combines the 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.910
 card when they are bought and they are 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:56.520
 looking for value 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.470
 which represents something of quality and 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.850
 guarantee and the handy has the 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.340
 particularity that those three 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.110
 two-time components value is a 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.400
 car that approximately for 21 thousand 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:11.550
 dollars can be purchased to begin 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.320
 exactly what is the quality with 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.300
 all the attachments that have made the 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.970
 standard the level of technology that has 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.640
 increased and the size of the car 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:23.160
 because it's a medium sedan but almost that 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.020
 comes to press objects following the 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.300
 trend today growth day does it 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.950
 all cars and in this case this area 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.050
 It also goes around because it's not 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.270
 spacious inside and out did not play 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.990
 Visibly visit that third point 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.490
 the guarantee because it is difficult to be able to 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.770
 beat the ten years offered by the 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.360
 Korean manufacturer and today's funds 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.660
 they are not counted and six years without 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.670
 However, the company still retains 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.230
 best market guarantee that is that 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.280
 what are we insisting or this server 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:54.330
 and my friend who is one hundred thousand miles or ten 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.979
 years 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:59.700
 and I hope and love converse 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:01.800
 cars and me also today we face 

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.020
 leave me your comments on this video 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.030
 and I invite you to visit the tent on 36 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.310
 and in Spanish you can also follow me on 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:11.390
 hard power 360 social networks 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.390
 until next time
