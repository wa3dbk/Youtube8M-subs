feelings<00:00:34.079> about<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.500> original<00:00:35.040> touch<00:00:35.250> cover

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
feelings about the original touch cover

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.520 
feelings about the original touch cover
and<00:00:35.880> here<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.390> attached<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.960> my<00:00:37.230> surface

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
and here it is attached to my surface

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.799 
and here it is attached to my surface
pro<00:00:37.739> now<00:00:38.489> one<00:00:38.730> thing<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.000> really<00:00:39.329> like<00:00:39.600> about

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
pro now one thing I really like about

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.660 
pro now one thing I really like about
the<00:00:40.200> original<00:00:40.530> touch<00:00:40.680> cover<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.370> because

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
the original touch cover is that because

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.280 
the original touch cover is that because
it's<00:00:41.850> much<00:00:42.120> thinner<00:00:42.510> than<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.870> type<00:00:43.079> cover

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
it's much thinner than the type cover

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.380 
it's much thinner than the type cover
when<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.070> fold<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.430> over<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.940> surface

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
when you fold it over on the surface

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.389 
when you fold it over on the surface
it's<00:00:45.629> much<00:00:45.870> more<00:00:46.050> flush<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> top<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
it's much more flush with the top of the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.279 
it's much more flush with the top of the
surface<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.969> feels<00:00:48.360> more<00:00:48.539> like<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.750> part<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
surface it feels more like a part of the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.110 
surface it feels more like a part of the
tablet<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.100> other<00:00:50.250> nice<00:00:50.520> thing<00:00:50.789> about<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
tablet the other nice thing about the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.430 
tablet the other nice thing about the
touch<00:00:51.270> cover<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.899> when<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.110> fold<00:00:52.320> it

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
touch cover is that when you fold it

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.959 
touch cover is that when you fold it
backwards<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:53.039> use<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.460> surface<00:00:53.789> like<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
backwards to use the surface like a

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.119 
backwards to use the surface like a
tablet<00:00:54.420> your<00:00:54.930> fingers<00:00:55.260> aren't<00:00:55.530> pressing<00:00:55.770> down

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
tablet your fingers aren't pressing down

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.069 
tablet your fingers aren't pressing down
on<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> keyboard<00:00:56.820> keys<00:00:57.270> there's<00:00:57.539> just<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.809> flat

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
on the keyboard keys there's just a flat

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.139 
on the keyboard keys there's just a flat
surface<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.219> was<00:00:59.340> much<00:00:59.489> more<00:00:59.670> grippy<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
surface if it was much more grippy and

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.389 
surface if it was much more grippy and
more<00:01:00.690> secure<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.739> other<00:01:01.890> thing<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.219> really

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
more secure the other thing I really

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.160 
more secure the other thing I really
like<00:01:02.699> about<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.149> touch<00:01:03.329> cover<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.019> it's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
like about the touch cover is that it's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.980 
like about the touch cover is that it's
actually<00:01:04.379> spill<00:01:05.010> resistant<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.689> know<00:01:06.810> if

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
actually spill resistant so you know if

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.300 
actually spill resistant so you know if
you're<00:01:07.110> going<00:01:07.320> around<00:01:07.530> brushing<00:01:08.040> your<00:01:08.130> teeth

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
you're going around brushing your teeth

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.770 
you're going around brushing your teeth
while<00:01:08.520> using<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.909> surface<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.330> don't<00:01:09.570> have<00:01:09.689> to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
while using a surface you don't have to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.080 
while using a surface you don't have to
worry<00:01:09.990> about<00:01:10.140> water<00:01:10.729> messing<00:01:11.729> up<00:01:11.820> all<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
worry about water messing up all the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.719 
worry about water messing up all the
keys<00:01:12.830> unfortunately<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.010> found<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
keys unfortunately I found that the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.670 
keys unfortunately I found that the
original<00:01:15.299> touch<00:01:15.479> cover<00:01:15.509> was<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.320> not<00:01:16.470> very

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
original touch cover was just not very

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.649 
original touch cover was just not very
accurate<00:01:16.950> for<00:01:17.369> typing<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.150> found<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.570> I

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
accurate for typing and I found that I

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.179 
accurate for typing and I found that I
really<00:01:18.990> couldn't<00:01:19.229> type<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:19.830> very<00:01:19.979> long

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
really couldn't type on it for very long

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.730 
really couldn't type on it for very long
because<00:01:20.759> all<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.479> typos<00:01:21.900> would<00:01:22.110> really<00:01:22.380> annoy

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
because all the typos would really annoy

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.039 
because all the typos would really annoy
me<00:01:22.979> now<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.939> new<00:01:24.060> touch<00:01:24.270> cover<00:01:24.299> -<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
me now this is the new touch cover - and

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.929 
me now this is the new touch cover - and
I<00:01:25.140> got<00:01:25.409> one<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.680> these<00:01:25.830> because<00:01:26.159> apparently<00:01:26.880> it

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
I got one of these because apparently it

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.399 
I got one of these because apparently it
has<00:01:27.090> everything<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:27.960> about<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
has everything that I like about the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.870 
has everything that I like about the
original<00:01:28.770> touch<00:01:28.950> cover<00:01:28.979> while<00:01:29.670> at<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> same

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
original touch cover while at the same

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.460 
original touch cover while at the same
time<00:01:30.090> Microsoft<00:01:30.780> claims<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.320> they<00:01:31.439> were

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
time Microsoft claims that they were

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.020 
time Microsoft claims that they were
able<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.860> dramatically<00:01:32.490> improve<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
able to dramatically improve the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.330 
able to dramatically improve the
accuracy<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.290> typing<00:01:34.740> performance<00:01:35.250> on

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
accuracy of the typing performance on

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.100 
accuracy of the typing performance on
the<00:01:35.610> touch<00:01:35.759> cover<00:01:35.939> -<00:01:36.210> by<00:01:36.659> dramatically

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the touch cover - by dramatically

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.600 
the touch cover - by dramatically
increasing<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.710> number<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.100> senses

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
increasing the number of senses

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.399 
increasing the number of senses
throughout<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.210> keyboard<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.840> they<00:01:40.200> also

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
throughout the keyboard and they also

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.830 
throughout the keyboard and they also
added<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:41.040> back<00:01:41.430> light<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.180> touch<00:01:42.509> cover<00:01:42.689> 2

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
added a back light to the touch cover 2

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.800 
added a back light to the touch cover 2
which<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.320> really<00:01:43.860> really<00:01:44.130> nice<00:01:44.520> addition

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
which is a really really nice addition

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.749 
which is a really really nice addition
at<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.020> same<00:01:46.290> time<00:01:46.680> they've<00:01:46.950> also<00:01:47.130> made<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
at the same time they've also made the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.240 
at the same time they've also made the
touch<00:01:48.030> cover<00:01:48.240> 2<00:01:48.360> slightly<00:01:49.110> thinner<00:01:49.619> than<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
touch cover 2 slightly thinner than the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.429 
touch cover 2 slightly thinner than the
original<00:01:50.280> touch<00:01:50.939> cover<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.479> then<00:01:51.780> even<00:01:52.079> made

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
original touch cover and then even made

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.350 
original touch cover and then even made
it<00:01:52.560> slightly<00:01:52.979> lighter<00:01:53.729> than<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.210> original

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
it slightly lighter than the original

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.959 
it slightly lighter than the original
touch<00:01:55.140> cover<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.710> it's<00:01:56.250> not<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> huge

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
touch cover and it's not a huge

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.490 
touch cover and it's not a huge
difference<00:01:57.149> but<00:01:57.540> because<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> surface<00:01:58.259> pro

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
difference but because the surface pro

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.770 
difference but because the surface pro
is<00:01:58.530> already<00:01:58.920> such<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> bulky<00:01:59.700> tablet<00:02:00.180> every

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
is already such a bulky tablet every

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.990 
is already such a bulky tablet every
little<00:02:01.079> bit<00:02:01.290> counts<00:02:01.369> now<00:02:02.369> before<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.729> get<00:02:02.790> into

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
little bit counts now before I get into

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.639 
little bit counts now before I get into
what<00:02:03.210> typing<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:04.020> on<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.439> new<00:02:04.619> touch

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
what typing is like on the new touch

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.950 
what typing is like on the new touch
cover<00:02:04.860> 2<00:02:05.189> there<00:02:05.759> was<00:02:05.880> one<00:02:06.119> small<00:02:06.360> physical

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
cover 2 there was one small physical

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.270 
cover 2 there was one small physical
difference<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.439> wanted<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.799> point<00:02:08.009> out

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
difference that I wanted to point out

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.339 
difference that I wanted to point out
between<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.090> old<00:02:09.569> touch<00:02:09.750> cover<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.229> new

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
between the old touch cover and the new

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.460 
between the old touch cover and the new
touch<00:02:10.560> cover<00:02:10.590> now<00:02:11.430> on<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.910> old

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
touch cover now on the old

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.920 
touch cover now on the old
cover<00:02:12.890> on<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.430> folding<00:02:13.970> mechanism<00:02:14.150> there's

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
cover on the folding mechanism there's

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.650 
cover on the folding mechanism there's
actually<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.740> second<00:02:16.550> band<00:02:16.880> right<00:02:17.360> in<00:02:17.570> the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
actually a second band right in the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.720 
actually a second band right in the
middle<00:02:17.870> here<00:02:18.140> between<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.830> docking<00:02:19.250> part<00:02:19.520> and

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
middle here between the docking part and

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.790 
middle here between the docking part and
the<00:02:20.000> keyboard<00:02:20.540> which<00:02:21.080> adds<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:21.470> bit<00:02:21.650> of

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
the keyboard which adds a bit of

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.560 
the keyboard which adds a bit of
strength<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:22.430> rigidity<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.240> folding

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
strength and rigidity to the folding

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.840 
strength and rigidity to the folding
mechanism<00:02:23.620> now<00:02:24.620> they've<00:02:24.830> actually<00:02:24.980> removed

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
mechanism now they've actually removed

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.300 
mechanism now they've actually removed
that<00:02:26.210> section<00:02:26.750> on<00:02:26.960> the<00:02:27.260> touch<00:02:27.530> cover<00:02:27.770> -<00:02:28.070> you

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
that section on the touch cover - you

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.370 
that section on the touch cover - you
see<00:02:28.490> that<00:02:28.670> that's<00:02:28.820> completely<00:02:29.300> blank<00:02:29.570> so<00:02:30.110> it's

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
see that that's completely blank so it's

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.710 
see that that's completely blank so it's
a<00:02:30.590> little<00:02:30.980> less<00:02:31.400> rigid<00:02:31.760> than<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.210> old<00:02:32.390> touch

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
a little less rigid than the old touch

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.930 
a little less rigid than the old touch
cover<00:02:32.960> design<00:02:33.380> now<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.070> only<00:02:34.520> notice<00:02:34.820> this

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
cover design now I only notice this

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.150 
cover design now I only notice this
because<00:02:35.120> I'm<00:02:35.300> a<00:02:35.360> lazy<00:02:35.630> person<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.890> like<00:02:37.100> to

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
because I'm a lazy person and I like to

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.280 
because I'm a lazy person and I like to
use<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.610> surface<00:02:37.790> pro<00:02:38.120> lying<00:02:38.390> down<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.780> lot<00:02:39.110> and

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
use the surface pro lying down a lot and

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.500 
use the surface pro lying down a lot and
even<00:02:39.860> though<00:02:39.980> Microsoft<00:02:40.250> probably<00:02:41.120> wouldn't

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
even though Microsoft probably wouldn't

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.720 
even though Microsoft probably wouldn't
recommend<00:02:41.840> this<00:02:42.230> on<00:02:42.470> when<00:02:42.980> I'm<00:02:43.070> lying<00:02:43.310> down<00:02:43.430> I

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
recommend this on when I'm lying down I

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.090 
recommend this on when I'm lying down I
sometimes<00:02:44.090> use<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.780> keyboard<00:02:45.380> just<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.800> prop

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
sometimes use the keyboard just to prop

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.130 
sometimes use the keyboard just to prop
up<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.459> weight<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.180> surface<00:02:47.540> pro<00:02:47.570> just<00:02:48.020> a

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
up the weight of the surface pro just a

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.560 
up the weight of the surface pro just a
little<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:48.670> this<00:02:49.670> is<00:02:49.790> something<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.209> I

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
little and this is something that I

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.780 
little and this is something that I
really<00:02:51.110> wouldn't<00:02:51.320> encourage<00:02:51.890> you<00:02:52.130> doing<00:02:52.610> on

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
really wouldn't encourage you doing on

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.910 
really wouldn't encourage you doing on
the<00:02:52.910> new<00:02:53.060> touch<00:02:53.270> cover<00:02:53.330> because<00:02:54.110> with<00:02:54.740> the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
the new touch cover because with the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.760 
the new touch cover because with the
unlock<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.640> that<00:02:56.000> internal<00:02:56.510> support<00:02:57.050> here<00:02:57.320> you

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
unlock of that internal support here you

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.760 
unlock of that internal support here you
can<00:02:57.920> actually<00:02:58.130> see<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.290> cover<00:03:00.290> actually

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
can actually see that the cover actually

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.280 
can actually see that the cover actually
folds<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.400> lot<00:03:01.670> more<00:03:01.970> along<00:03:02.420> that<00:03:02.630> area<00:03:02.900> and

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
folds a lot more along that area and

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.680 
folds a lot more along that area and
it's<00:03:03.950> not<00:03:04.220> very<00:03:04.430> rigid<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:05.000> think<00:03:05.300> it<00:03:05.480> would

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
it's not very rigid and I think it would

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.930 
it's not very rigid and I think it would
really<00:03:05.990> damage<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.470> cover<00:03:07.220> over<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.790> long

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
really damage the cover over the long

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.460 
really damage the cover over the long
term<00:03:08.150> now<00:03:08.900> I'm<00:03:08.959> going<00:03:09.110> to<00:03:09.170> show<00:03:09.230> you<00:03:09.320> some

typing<00:03:09.950> tests<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:10.459> then<00:03:10.610> I'm<00:03:10.670> going<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:10.820> give

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
typing tests and then I'm going to give

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.030 
typing tests and then I'm going to give
you<00:03:11.060> my<00:03:11.180> conclusion<00:03:11.900> about<00:03:12.170> what<00:03:12.350> typing<00:03:12.890> is

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
you my conclusion about what typing is

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.910 
you my conclusion about what typing is
like<00:03:13.280> on<00:03:13.490> the<00:03:13.580> new<00:03:13.730> touch<00:03:13.760> cover<00:03:13.970> -<00:03:14.570> now<00:03:15.260> I'm

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
like on the new touch cover - now I'm

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.710 
like on the new touch cover - now I'm
just<00:03:16.130> using<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.550> free<00:03:16.880> typing<00:03:17.300> test<00:03:17.510> that<00:03:17.660> I

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
just using a free typing test that I

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.890 
just using a free typing test that I
found<00:03:17.959> over<00:03:18.320> at<00:03:18.500> 10<00:03:18.950> fast<00:03:19.250> fingers<00:03:19.550> comm<00:03:20.360> this

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
is not going to be a scientific test

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.759 
is not going to be a scientific test
because<00:03:22.850> it's<00:03:22.970> not<00:03:23.120> real-world<00:03:23.630> typing<00:03:24.260> but

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
because it's not real-world typing but

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.800 
because it's not real-world typing but
ah<00:03:24.920> I'm<00:03:25.370> going<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:25.580> give<00:03:25.730> you<00:03:25.880> average<00:03:26.330> results

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
ah I'm going to give you average results

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.110 
ah I'm going to give you average results
over<00:03:27.200> three<00:03:27.590> runs<00:03:27.890> compared<00:03:28.580> to<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.940> original

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
over three runs compared to the original

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.180 
over three runs compared to the original
keyboards<00:03:30.080> and<00:03:30.200> then<00:03:30.530> maybe<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:30.860> can<00:03:30.950> get<00:03:31.070> an

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
keyboards and then maybe you can get an

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.370 
keyboards and then maybe you can get an
idea<00:03:31.519> of<00:03:31.580> what<00:03:32.030> are<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.810> accuracy

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
idea of what are the accuracy

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.840

improvements<00:03:33.950> are<00:03:34.040> like<00:03:34.310> on<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.550> new<00:03:34.820> touch

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
improvements are like on the new touch

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.090 
improvements are like on the new touch

2<00:04:35.750> now<00:04:36.289> I<00:04:36.349> would<00:04:36.620> take<00:04:36.740> that<00:04:36.919> result<00:04:37.220> with<00:04:37.400> a

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960

as the type cover and that's number one

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.210

and<00:05:10.250> another<00:05:10.669> issue<00:05:10.880> I<00:05:11.060> find<00:05:11.360> with<00:05:11.539> the<00:05:11.599> touch

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
and another issue I find with the touch

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.260 
and another issue I find with the touch
covers<00:05:12.169> is<00:05:12.320> that<00:05:13.099> because<00:05:13.820> they're<00:05:13.970> a<00:05:14.000> little

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
covers is that because they're a little

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.460 
covers is that because they're a little
inaccurate<00:05:14.509> I<00:05:14.870> find<00:05:15.110> myself

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
inaccurate I find myself

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.249 
inaccurate I find myself
unconsciously<00:05:15.979> typing<00:05:16.580> the<00:05:16.759> keys<00:05:17.389> harder<00:05:17.840> and

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
unconsciously typing the keys harder and
