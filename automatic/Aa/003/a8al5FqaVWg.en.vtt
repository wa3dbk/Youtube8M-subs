00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
 the horse on the ground 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.319
 his mastery worries all the riders 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.540

 his pony without his stirrups jumping 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.429
 directly on the stage a technique 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.009
 not easy easy but essential 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.689
 to reach series 1 if desired is 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.820
 the first essential step for 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.349
 to succeed it is to ground on horse work 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.880
 and the famous impulse you go in 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.259
 made in a straight line 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.790
 agree to trot at first 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.430
 your legs have to stay parallel 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.059

 you grabbed my pommel 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.749
 left the mane still running like 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.519
 that a moment that you say and to you 

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:45.260
 type your inter-sites to read type 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.809
 you trot like this online 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.699
 right typed in front of the dental and to 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.070
 can potting the air and you go 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.929
 keep your pelvis in alignment 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.159
 from earlier you not ask to do 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.429
 horse 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.079
 we just run and we show you 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.969
 as high as possible vertically 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.890
 once we have done that we continue 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.920
 our run go hop it's 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.920
 left 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.950
 no no no no to bounce back to 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.000
 the beyond do not hold back 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.000
 that's okay 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.180
 you ask us to pat us and to stay 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.549
 like that helps up in the air taking 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.259
 support on your pony like that no 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.289

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:46.000
 hand actions towards the manga the right 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.450
 it's a bit of anything for the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.470
 moment the fangs there lol 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.670

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.170
 Oops but you need that world to the 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.770
 high camille it is not necessary that he makes 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.770
 holes in the ground 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.860
 in summary the series 1 is not yet 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.020
 for tomorrow a good time to complete 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.630
 his ways win over the multi go 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.940
 to adore happened no reason he will 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.980
 have to train thoroughly is remember 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.480
 the pony games is a team sport 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.890

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.890

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.390
