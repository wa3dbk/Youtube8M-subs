they're<00:02:02.509> doing<00:02:02.539> here<00:02:03.140> they're<00:02:03.469> motivated<00:02:03.619> and

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
they're doing here they're motivated and

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.190 
they're doing here they're motivated and
they've<00:02:05.000> really<00:02:05.270> dug<00:02:05.479> into<00:02:05.689> some<00:02:06.049> of<00:02:06.140> these

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
they've really dug into some of these

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.889 
they've really dug into some of these
topics<00:02:06.500> here<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.819> eco<00:02:08.000> car<00:02:08.149> competition<00:02:08.390> is

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
topics here the eco car competition is

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.500 
topics here the eco car competition is
important<00:02:09.709> because<00:02:09.860> it<00:02:10.549> allows<00:02:10.610> us<00:02:11.239> to

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
important because it allows us to

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.110 
important because it allows us to
experiment<00:02:12.200> with<00:02:12.319> vehicles<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:13.220> aren't<00:02:13.910> in

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
experiment with vehicles that aren't in

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.390 
experiment with vehicles that aren't in
market<00:02:14.420> yet<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:14.900> show<00:02:15.560> that<00:02:15.860> some<00:02:16.250> these

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
market yet and show that some these

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.940 
market yet and show that some these
technologies<00:02:16.940> are<00:02:16.970> viable<00:02:17.450> well<00:02:18.200> I'm<00:02:18.530> really

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
technologies are viable well I'm really

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.309 
technologies are viable well I'm really
amazed<00:02:19.250> of<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.700> facilities<00:02:20.569> of<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:20.870> one<00:02:21.019> dream

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
amazed of the facilities of a one dream

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.330 
amazed of the facilities of a one dream
front<00:02:21.739> today<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.720> learned<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:24.290> first<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:25.250> most

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
front today I learned the first and most

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.430 
front today I learned the first and most
important<00:02:25.730> thing<00:02:25.760> is<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.150> we<00:02:26.930> actually<00:02:27.049> saw

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
important thing is that we actually saw

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.949 
important thing is that we actually saw
the<00:02:27.500> hardware<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:29.060> we<00:02:29.090> can<00:02:29.360> see<00:02:29.510> what<00:02:29.720> we<00:02:29.870> were

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
the hardware so we can see what we were

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.750 
the hardware so we can see what we were
seeing<00:02:30.200> in<00:02:30.319> the<00:02:30.410> CAD<00:02:30.560> files<00:02:30.829> so<00:02:31.099> I<00:02:31.160> could<00:02:31.370> have

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
seeing in the CAD files so I could have

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.850 
seeing in the CAD files so I could have
a<00:02:31.790> better<00:02:32.030> impression<00:02:32.299> of<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.840> packaging<00:02:33.620> and

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
a better impression of the packaging and

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.710 
a better impression of the packaging and
everything<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.489> learn<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.730> lot<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.299> controls

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
everything and learn a lot of controls

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.479 
everything and learn a lot of controls
but<00:02:36.110> also<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.470> battery<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:36.920> that's<00:02:37.220> really

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
but also the battery and that's really

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.319 
but also the battery and that's really
important<00:02:37.819> for<00:02:37.849> us

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
important for us

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.750 
important for us

Eagle Car Challenge we think this is
just<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.260> fantastic<00:02:57.620> program<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:59.120> equal<00:02:59.359> car

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
just a fantastic program the equal car

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.000 
just a fantastic program the equal car
challenge<00:02:59.930> is<00:03:00.079> developing<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.829> next
