00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.040
 Velen 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.980
 Here you can, for example, stop everything 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.720
 what you want to have 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.760
 Effects how strong they should be but the picturesque yet Marek his ex-club 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.390
 and silence 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.950
 there's no time for it today 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.950
 Today we do the NBA installation 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.580
 then through, for example, the fouries seventies version 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.530
 then we have these two pear files 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.430
 the UN go 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.750
 but like packing everything now 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.090
 him for that 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.880
 Son and San Andreas

 Boxing coach test chambers meeting 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.419
 again and again would have clearer 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.359
 now push in because the whole files here 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:17.539
 they just say we write half I've got it Dürener that thing is 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:20.329
 he has me like that 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:21.460
 how so 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.429
 we hope the war too 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:26.429
 if you're in the game in there with the button 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.789
 and f12 did that 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:31.399
 on and off 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:34.709
 and then with the box 11 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.979
 until 11 years ago then had the effects 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:40.720
 The investor always asks me to go to Strunk 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.020
 if you hear no one pushed you in and sometimes another one 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.989
 to try their motto from another series zol or theirs 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.109
 Have battles Alicia 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.759
 then you take this one here in the place 

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:55.689
 the weak right-back 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.079
 and push that line of the 2 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.079
 over here 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:09.239
 and now is expensive in the place even for low computing power 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.209
 Of course we can do this in the same way 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.659
 override on the other files 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.999
 here is for example still the 75 that persons with it can also on-line 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.369
 gamble 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:25.529
 who does not like these graphics settings in here 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:29.439
 he can out of the 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.449
 Mother's son for weak Essenes 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.449
 keep a few data hold 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.459
 if that is 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.799
 we and this is the new version here is something for the weak Jena 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.979
 and if you see proxy proxy 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.769
 Effect Effect No Kati Maaß and draftsman back numbers 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:56.879
 No here is for example take 0 and here is only one if now 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:04:01.339
 These effects Amoltern but that must rewrite from 1 

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:04.389
 then make the 0 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.789
 yes and finally ask you then take over then you just say via 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:12.899
 for a small tip and makes you dumb a backup so that yes 

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:15.899
 logically the original have fewer parts 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.699
 sometimes you do not save 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.949
 so to have a better overview could here 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:24.909
 always to this 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:29.459
 People who are here in parentheses are then the individual sections can there 

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:32.629
 you also make Hima so dial tone 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:35.959
 with the other kind of a course also one has it up to the better overview 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.580
 so then describes a decision not enough 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.520
 that was already in that of her in the place agreed 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.169
 and then we have 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.069
 so beautiful graphics effects 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:53.050
 the clans on the cars 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.879
 You can still set all these plants for the strength of the shade 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.879
 should and so and that you do everything in this 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.120
 in each participant 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.599
 for example defective «blowout 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:05.889
 and there is around 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.270
 Blurring see Fekter 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.270
 then we have something here and little something further 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.319
 what halfway percent 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.050
 I want to look at the quality of the effects here 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.900
 Shadow effects how strong they should be 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.900
 You can set between Knoll and a hundred 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.360
 and Prunn stuff on and off which you can still with 1 around 0 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.589
 do 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:31.259
 as with but as I said around 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.900
 This tool will Mama again extra for Nemos times really nice long 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.099
 time and 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.229
 I will explain the individual things what is what 

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:42.259
 with a lot of fun with the bmw engine
