all<00:00:08.210> right<00:00:08.330> this<00:00:08.510> is<00:00:08.719> the<00:00:08.750> third<00:00:09.110> cake<00:00:09.410> on<00:00:09.650> the

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
all right this is the third cake on the

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.810 
all right this is the third cake on the
what<00:00:11.170> I'm<00:00:11.290> trying<00:00:11.560> to<00:00:11.650> do<00:00:11.740> in<00:00:11.860> this<00:00:11.980> experiment

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
what I'm trying to do in this experiment

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.180 
what I'm trying to do in this experiment
is<00:00:13.120> see<00:00:13.870> if<00:00:14.020> my<00:00:14.260> alum<00:00:14.650> conversion<00:00:15.580> on<00:00:16.059> this

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
is see if my alum conversion on this

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.890 
is see if my alum conversion on this
garden<00:00:18.190> tractor<00:00:18.580> battery<00:00:18.939> well<00:00:19.510> it's<00:00:19.750> gonna

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
garden tractor battery well it's gonna

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.170 
garden tractor battery well it's gonna
be<00:00:20.080> strong<00:00:20.290> enough<00:00:20.529> to<00:00:20.650> actually<00:00:20.710> start<00:00:21.340> my

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
be strong enough to actually start my

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.019 
be strong enough to actually start my
riding<00:00:22.540> mower<00:00:23.279> it's<00:00:24.279> worked<00:00:24.550> the<00:00:24.670> first<00:00:24.849> time

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
riding mower it's worked the first time

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.150 
riding mower it's worked the first time
second<00:00:25.720> time<00:00:25.869> around<00:00:25.990> my<00:00:26.349> engine<00:00:26.619> was<00:00:26.680> flooded

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
second time around my engine was flooded

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.730 
second time around my engine was flooded
the<00:00:27.250> first<00:00:27.490> time<00:00:27.789> unfortunately<00:00:28.690> the<00:00:29.230> battery

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
the first time unfortunately the battery

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.880 
the first time unfortunately the battery
my<00:00:30.039> camera<00:00:30.400> ran<00:00:30.550> out<00:00:30.789> so<00:00:31.510> I<00:00:31.539> didn't<00:00:31.930> get<00:00:32.110> the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
my camera ran out so I didn't get the

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.340 
my camera ran out so I didn't get the
shot<00:00:32.920> so<00:00:33.460> I<00:00:33.489> know<00:00:33.640> this<00:00:33.910> works<00:00:34.239> the<00:00:34.809> science<00:00:35.230> is

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
shot so I know this works the science is

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.280 
shot so I know this works the science is
about<00:00:35.559> producing<00:00:35.920> things<00:00:36.400> that<00:00:36.640> work<00:00:37.230> on<00:00:38.230> a

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
about producing things that work on a

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.549 
about producing things that work on a
predictable<00:00:38.980> repeatable<00:00:39.190> fashion<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:41.140> my

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
predictable repeatable fashion so my

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:42.780 
predictable repeatable fashion so my
battery<00:00:41.830> just<00:00:41.860> a<00:00:42.040> little<00:00:42.309> bit<00:00:42.430> low<00:00:42.550> right<00:00:42.729> now

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
battery just a little bit low right now

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.090 
battery just a little bit low right now
eleven<00:00:43.269> point<00:00:43.449> seven<00:00:43.809> seven<00:00:44.050> seven<00:00:44.800> point

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
eleven point seven seven seven point

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.119 
eleven point seven seven seven point
seven<00:00:45.430> eight

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
seven eight

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.740 
seven eight
it<00:00:48.129> normally<00:00:48.280> it'll<00:00:48.729> top<00:00:48.970> out<00:00:49.150> about<00:00:49.360> eleven

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
it normally it'll top out about eleven

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.740 
it normally it'll top out about eleven
point<00:00:49.989> nine<00:00:50.729> after<00:00:51.729> charging<00:00:52.299> it<00:00:52.390> several

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
point nine after charging it several

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.899 
point nine after charging it several
times<00:00:52.989> so<00:00:53.229> there's<00:00:53.409> a<00:00:53.500> voltage<00:00:53.799> the<00:00:54.519> starting

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
times so there's a voltage the starting

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.600 
times so there's a voltage the starting
voltage<00:00:55.059> on<00:00:55.540> it<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.890> we'll<00:00:57.129> see<00:00:57.309> if<00:00:57.370> we<00:00:57.519> can

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
voltage on it and we'll see if we can

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.210 
voltage on it and we'll see if we can
get<00:00:57.760> this<00:00:57.909> thing<00:00:58.150> to<00:00:58.420> fire<00:00:58.930> up<00:00:59.140> for<00:00:59.409> me<00:00:59.559> give<00:01:00.100> it

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
get this thing to fire up for me give it

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.820 
get this thing to fire up for me give it
some<00:01:00.430> time<00:01:00.670> hopefully<00:01:01.530> carburetors<00:01:02.530> lined

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
some time hopefully carburetors lined

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.490 
some time hopefully carburetors lined
out<00:01:03.010> now<00:01:03.250> as<00:01:03.909> you<00:01:04.089> can<00:01:04.239> see<00:01:04.479> I'm<00:01:04.930> hooking

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
out now as you can see I'm hooking

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.560 
out now as you can see I'm hooking
through<00:01:06.010> jumper<00:01:06.460> cables<00:01:06.820> directly<00:01:07.240> to<00:01:07.420> the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
through jumper cables directly to the

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.880 
through jumper cables directly to the
starter<00:01:07.930> solenoid<00:01:08.850> right<00:01:09.850> here<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:11.710> is<00:01:11.799> the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
starter solenoid right here this is the

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.590 
starter solenoid right here this is the
positive<00:01:12.100> terminal<00:01:12.400> terminal<00:01:13.270> would

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
positive terminal terminal would

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.429 
positive terminal terminal would
normally<00:01:14.500> go<00:01:14.619> to<00:01:14.859> the<00:01:14.979> battery<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.450> we'll<00:01:16.659> see

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
normally go to the battery so we'll see

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:32.750 
normally go to the battery so we'll see
what<00:01:17.619> she<00:01:17.649> does

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.310 

so<00:01:33.760> we<00:01:33.880> see<00:01:34.060> it's<00:01:34.180> got<00:01:34.330> enough<00:01:34.750> power<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.050> turn

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
so we see it's got enough power to turn

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.010 
so we see it's got enough power to turn
it<00:01:35.500> over<00:01:36.180> engines<00:01:37.180> still<00:01:37.480> not<00:01:37.690> wanting<00:01:37.990> to

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
it over engines still not wanting to

00:01:38.020 --> 00:02:04.560 
it over engines still not wanting to
start<00:01:38.460> give<00:01:39.460> her<00:01:39.610> another<00:01:39.820> shot

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:26.520 

yep

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.120 

watch<00:02:27.010> my<00:02:27.310> videos

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.190
