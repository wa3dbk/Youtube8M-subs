00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
my head if I just work at it so think of

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.830 
my head if I just work at it so think of
that<00:00:36.130> quality<00:00:38.280> he's<00:00:39.280> travelling<00:00:39.940> it<00:00:40.180> comes<00:00:40.570> to

that quality he's travelling it comes to

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.690 
that quality he's travelling it comes to
a<00:00:40.870> stop

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
a stop

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.420 
a stop
thought<00:00:42.700> I've<00:00:43.120> got<00:00:43.930> to<00:00:43.960> get<00:00:44.230> he'll<00:00:44.500> prepare

with breaths dramatize those more like

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.220 
with breaths dramatize those more like
almost<00:00:48.940> like<00:00:49.090> an<00:00:49.330> athlete<00:00:49.690> preparing<00:00:50.170> a

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
almost like an athlete preparing a

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.040 
almost like an athlete preparing a
minute<00:00:50.500> is<00:00:50.680> what<00:00:50.860> it's<00:00:51.010> doing<00:00:54.360> what's<00:00:55.360> really

minute is what it's doing what's really
great<00:00:56.350> is<00:00:56.710> what<00:00:57.700> we<00:00:57.880> are<00:00:58.000> able<00:00:58.270> to<00:00:58.420> isolate

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
great is what we are able to isolate

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.890 
great is what we are able to isolate
this<00:00:59.440> is<00:00:59.770> breathing<00:01:00.310> that's<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.270> only<00:01:01.630> thing

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
this is breathing that's the only thing

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.930 
this is breathing that's the only thing
you<00:01:02.080> see<00:01:02.320> because<00:01:02.980> everything<00:01:03.550> else<00:01:03.670> is<00:01:03.910> so

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
you see because everything else is so

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.390 
you see because everything else is so
new<00:01:04.420> to<00:01:04.449> all<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.229> other<00:01:05.409> movements<00:01:06.040> further

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
new to all the other movements further

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.280 
new to all the other movements further
the<00:01:06.640> puppeteers<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.600> puppet<00:01:07.960> of<00:01:08.049> some

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
the puppeteers and the puppet of some

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:17.030 
the puppeteers and the puppet of some
YouTube<00:01:08.650> that's<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:10.180> thing<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.880> huge

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.490 

yeah<00:01:18.040> bigger

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.630 

give<00:01:21.040> his<00:01:21.310> eyes<00:01:21.520> up<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:23.740> found<00:01:24.040> when<00:01:24.250> we<00:01:24.280> worked

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
give his eyes up we found when we worked

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.420 
give his eyes up we found when we worked
with<00:01:24.820> opera<00:01:25.540> singers<00:01:25.870> that<00:01:26.050> the<00:01:26.890> way<00:01:27.040> to<00:01:27.100> make

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
with opera singers that the way to make

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.060 
with opera singers that the way to make
the<00:01:27.580> puppet<00:01:27.940> match<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.870> singing<00:01:29.260> was<00:01:29.770> for<00:01:29.980> us

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
the puppet match the singing was for us

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.550 
the puppet match the singing was for us
to<00:01:30.100> learn<00:01:30.340> exactly<00:01:30.580> where<00:01:31.030> they<00:01:31.150> breathed<00:01:31.560> and

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
to learn exactly where they breathed and

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.530 
to learn exactly where they breathed and
so<00:01:33.010> that<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.280> impulse<00:01:33.700> of<00:01:33.850> their<00:01:34.090> in-breath

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
so that the impulse of their in-breath

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.170 
so that the impulse of their in-breath
was<00:01:34.960> reflected<00:01:35.440> in<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.650> puppet<00:01:35.980> and<00:01:36.130> that<00:01:36.940> led

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
was reflected in the puppet and that led

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.480 
was reflected in the puppet and that led
us<00:01:37.210> on<00:01:37.480> to<00:01:37.780> realizing<00:01:38.560> actually<00:01:39.190> with<00:01:39.340> the

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
us on to realizing actually with the

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.870 
us on to realizing actually with the
audience<00:01:39.910> if<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.960> audience<00:01:41.260> doesn't<00:01:41.950> see<00:01:42.160> the

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
audience if the audience doesn't see the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.520 
audience if the audience doesn't see the
puppet<00:01:43.180> breathing<00:01:43.570> isn't<00:01:43.840> aware<00:01:44.140> that<00:01:44.350> there

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
puppet breathing isn't aware that there

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.490 
puppet breathing isn't aware that there
is<00:01:44.880> breath<00:01:45.880> in<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.180> figure<00:01:46.510> they<00:01:47.050> hold<00:01:47.320> their

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
is breath in the figure they hold their

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.200 
is breath in the figure they hold their
breath<00:01:48.000> for<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.410> puppet<00:01:50.710> and<00:01:51.210> after

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
breath for the for the puppet and after

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.700 
breath for the for the puppet and after
a<00:01:52.240> while<00:01:52.360> you<00:01:52.450> get<00:01:52.570> tired<00:01:52.840> of<00:01:52.990> doing<00:01:53.170> that<00:01:53.470> and

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
a while you get tired of doing that and

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.340 
a while you get tired of doing that and
so<00:01:54.370> the<00:01:54.580> image<00:01:55.060> of<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.390> figure<00:01:55.690> dissolves<00:01:56.200> to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
so the image of the figure dissolves to

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.800 
so the image of the figure dissolves to
a<00:01:56.710> degree<00:01:57.010> so<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.480> breath<00:01:59.110> anyway<00:01:59.590> for<00:02:00.810> as

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
a degree so the the breath anyway for as

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.420 
a degree so the the breath anyway for as
a<00:02:01.870> method<00:02:02.230> of<00:02:02.290> keeping<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.710> puppet<00:02:02.980> a<00:02:03.040> lot<00:02:03.220> is

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
a method of keeping the puppet a lot is

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.490 
a method of keeping the puppet a lot is
very<00:02:03.670> important<00:02:04.150> it's<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.690> thing<00:02:04.930> that<00:02:04.960> that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
very important it's the thing that that

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.960 
very important it's the thing that that
underlies<00:02:05.979> everything<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.700> in<00:02:06.820> this

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
underlies everything and in this

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.919 
underlies everything and in this
particular<00:02:07.390> piece<00:02:09.240> one<00:02:10.240> of<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.630> main

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
particular piece one of the main

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.970 
particular piece one of the main
characters<00:02:11.530> has<00:02:11.950> emphysema<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:14.170> breath<00:02:14.500> of

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
characters has emphysema so breath of

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.810 
characters has emphysema so breath of
course<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:16.020> what<00:02:17.020> he's<00:02:17.260> really<00:02:17.550> striving<00:02:18.550> for

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
course is what he's really striving for

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.390 
course is what he's really striving for
fighting<00:02:19.450> for<00:02:19.920> failing<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:21.160> get<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:23.400> that

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
fighting for failing to get and that

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.000 
fighting for failing to get and that
coupled<00:02:24.970> with<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.150> fact<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:26.010> musical

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
coupled with the fact that the musical

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.070 
coupled with the fact that the musical
instrument<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.940> we've<00:02:28.150> chosen<00:02:28.510> for<00:02:28.750> the

instrument that we've chosen for the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.729 
instrument that we've chosen for the
production<00:02:29.560> is<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:30.510> piano<00:02:31.510> accordion<00:02:32.020> which<00:02:32.560> is
