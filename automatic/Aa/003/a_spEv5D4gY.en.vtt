 here in general everything is warm and media 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.750
 aware of all cases 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.959
 in the toilet there is no camera moving yet 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.349

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:32.910
 Friedberg although unlikely 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.440
 one animatronic frightened light ran away 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.440
 we trade bone stomping I like 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.210

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.040
 how was it to refuse 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.810
 so contour works 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:04.320
 and nothing works at all empty damn 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.320

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:12.310

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:15.480
 I can't hear him 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.430
 demo known how many nights there are 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.720
 but I think I will not survive because 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.420
 I have left and we have interest 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.170
 working means here did not invent anything 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:29.050
 there is still a red leather wind 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.380
 re shoes 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.180
 second part but 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.129
 those who have already managed to play all the smoke 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:40.909
 heads you can not play 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:43.429

00:05:43.429 --> 00:05:48.999
 fan-made 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:51.769
 then fans asked for a moment 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:57.830
 variable then we will be confused later 

00:05:51.769 --> 00:06:00.499

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:05.650
