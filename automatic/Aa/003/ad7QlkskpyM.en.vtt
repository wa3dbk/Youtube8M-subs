want to get too much into detail but if

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.630 
want to get too much into detail but if
you're<00:00:37.140> using<00:00:37.350> programs<00:00:37.950> like<00:00:38.160> Little<00:00:38.460> Snitch

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
you're using programs like Little Snitch

to<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.770> there's<00:00:40.770> actually<00:00:41.100> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
to do this for you there's actually a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.119 
to do this for you there's actually a
lot<00:00:41.430> easier<00:00:41.460> way<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.059> block<00:00:42.450> such<00:00:42.980> access<00:00:43.980> to

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
lot easier way to block such access to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.750 
lot easier way to block such access to
the<00:00:44.280> Internet<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.469> in<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:47.100> Mac<00:00:47.520> operating

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
the Internet so in the Mac operating

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.819 
the Internet so in the Mac operating
system<00:00:48.390> what<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.629> want<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.899> do<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.170> first<00:00:49.379> open

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
system what you want to do is first open

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.920 
system what you want to do is first open
up<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.129> command<00:00:50.610> prompt<00:00:51.390> or<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.629> case<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
up a command prompt or in this case a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.000

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
either open up terminal through the dock

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.010 
either open up terminal through the dock
which<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.160> here<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.520> bottom<00:00:59.820> or<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.840> can
