handed<00:01:25.590> bubble<00:01:25.920> were<00:01:26.070> out<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.580> get<00:01:26.729> that

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
handed bubble were out so you get that

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.300 
handed bubble were out so you get that
like<00:01:27.060> he's<00:01:27.450> looking<00:01:27.900> at<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.500> maybe<00:01:29.100> that

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
like he's looking at it and maybe that

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.859 
like he's looking at it and maybe that
would<00:01:29.430> draw<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.700> into<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.270> image<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.630> that

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
would draw you into the image and that

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.450 
would draw you into the image and that
could<00:01:31.049> work<00:01:31.079> also<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.680> black<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.130> white<00:01:32.310> as

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
exposure right though especially in the

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.449 
exposure right though especially in the

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
pull back a little wider also so we got

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.069

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
is all good I'm seeing again a lot of

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.819 
is all good I'm seeing again a lot of
tight<00:03:36.420> shots<00:03:36.780> blowing<00:03:37.200> out<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.320> background<00:03:37.590> I

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
tight shots blowing out the background I

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.039 
tight shots blowing out the background I

know you're using a kit lens if I am

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.680 
know you're using a kit lens if I am
correct<00:03:40.500> it's<00:03:41.010> probably<00:03:41.519> still<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:41.880> 55<00:03:42.390> to

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
correct it's probably still that 55 to

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:51.910 
correct it's probably still that 55 to
200<00:03:45.709> it's<00:03:46.709> not<00:03:46.980> showing<00:03:47.310> me<00:03:48.709> don't<00:03:49.709> know<00:03:49.769> why

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
200 it's not showing me don't know why

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.410 
200 it's not showing me don't know why
quicktime<00:03:52.920> so<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.430> that<00:03:53.489> pulled<00:03:53.940> from<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.239> video

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
quicktime so is that pulled from a video

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.520 
quicktime so is that pulled from a video
i<00:03:56.570> don't<00:03:57.570> think<00:03:57.750> it's<00:03:57.870> pulled<00:03:58.079> from<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.380> video

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
i don't think it's pulled from a video

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.080 
i don't think it's pulled from a video
but<00:03:58.980> i<00:03:59.160> like<00:03:59.609> the<00:03:59.790> shot<00:04:00.060> nice<00:04:00.390> frame<00:04:01.880> maybe<00:04:02.880> the

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
but i like the shot nice frame maybe the

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.640 
but i like the shot nice frame maybe the
exposures<00:04:03.510> just<00:04:03.720> needs<00:04:04.049> to<00:04:04.170> be<00:04:04.200> tweaked<00:04:04.530> up

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
exposures just needs to be tweaked up

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.800 
exposures just needs to be tweaked up
just<00:04:04.920> a<00:04:05.010> little<00:04:05.190> bit<00:04:05.310> in<00:04:05.519> post-production<00:04:05.910> but

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
just a little bit in post-production but

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.229 
just a little bit in post-production but
again<00:04:07.079> it's<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.320> it's<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.650> it's<00:04:07.680> a<00:04:07.980> tight<00:04:08.310> shot<00:04:08.670> so

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
again it's a it's a it's a tight shot so

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.789

we're<00:04:09.359> not<00:04:09.450> getting<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.780> lot<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:09.930> context<00:04:10.530> going

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
we're not getting a lot of context going

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.140 
we're not getting a lot of context going

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
there we've got the top down look we can

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.260 
there we've got the top down look we can
see<00:04:32.100> that<00:04:32.310> they're<00:04:32.490> climbing<00:04:32.910> they're<00:04:33.030> off

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
see that they're climbing they're off

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.570 
see that they're climbing they're off
the<00:04:33.570> ground<00:04:33.870> you<00:04:34.380> have<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.830> Rope<00:04:35.070> going<00:04:35.400> out

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
the ground you have the Rope going out

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.820 
the ground you have the Rope going out
of<00:04:35.610> focus<00:04:35.910> leading<00:04:36.450> into<00:04:36.750> here<00:04:36.990> this<00:04:37.560> is

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
of focus leading into here this is

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.340 
of focus leading into here this is
context<00:04:38.760> that<00:04:39.270> if<00:04:39.630> it<00:04:39.810> was<00:04:39.900> just<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.140> tight

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
context that if it was just a tight

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.500 
context that if it was just a tight
headshot<00:04:40.830> then<00:04:41.070> it<00:04:41.190> wouldn't<00:04:41.430> be<00:04:41.460> any<00:04:41.640> good<00:04:41.760> so

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
headshot then it wouldn't be any good so

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.780 
headshot then it wouldn't be any good so
this<00:04:42.690> is<00:04:42.720> much<00:04:43.170> better<00:04:43.440> really<00:04:44.040> like<00:04:44.250> this<00:04:44.490> see

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
this is much better really like this see

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.070 
this is much better really like this see
what<00:04:44.940> black<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:45.330> white<00:04:45.420> would<00:04:45.570> look<00:04:45.720> like<00:04:45.870> as

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
what black and white would look like as

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.290 
what black and white would look like as
well<00:04:46.320> and<00:04:46.590> I<00:04:47.070> don't<00:04:47.400> think<00:04:47.580> we're<00:04:47.700> in<00:04:47.730> focus<00:04:48.150> on

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
well and I don't think we're in focus on

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.540 
well and I don't think we're in focus on
the<00:04:48.420> eyes<00:04:48.450> but<00:04:48.870> i'm<00:04:49.290> i'm<00:04:49.530> passing<00:04:50.220> over<00:04:50.430> that

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
the eyes but i'm i'm passing over that

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.120 
the eyes but i'm i'm passing over that
just<00:04:50.790> for<00:04:50.970> passing<00:04:51.390> over<00:04:51.630> at<00:04:51.750> sake<00:04:52.020> i<00:04:52.290> like<00:04:53.100> the

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
just for passing over at sake i like the

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.280 
just for passing over at sake i like the
way<00:04:53.370> that<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:54.180> composition<00:04:54.750> feels<00:04:55.020> on

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
way that the the composition feels on

this<00:05:12.480> is<00:05:12.660> just<00:05:12.840> a<00:05:12.900> little<00:05:13.460> it's<00:05:14.460> not<00:05:14.670> in<00:05:14.790> the

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
this is just a little it's not in the

in<00:05:19.320> a<00:05:19.380> tree<00:05:19.680> again<00:05:20.670> I<00:05:21.710> think<00:05:22.710> it's<00:05:22.800> a<00:05:22.860> lizard

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160

but<00:05:23.510> not<00:05:24.510> much<00:05:24.720> to<00:05:24.900> say<00:05:25.080> about<00:05:25.230> the<00:05:25.500> image<00:05:25.740> here

is really not much going on it's just

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.960 
is really not much going on it's just
it's<00:05:27.960> like<00:05:28.230> a<00:05:28.440> snapshot<00:05:28.800> of<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.460> lizard<00:05:29.640> in<00:05:29.940> a

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
it's like a snapshot of the lizard in a

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.150 
it's like a snapshot of the lizard in a
tree<00:05:30.270> don't<00:05:30.960> really<00:05:31.260> know<00:05:31.410> what<00:05:31.650> else<00:05:31.830> to<00:05:32.010> tell
