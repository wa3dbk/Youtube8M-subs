00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.450
 Only that there is no Hello 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.870
 Nayoro city 17th place 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.429
 I am there 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:11.169
 It is also because 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:14.579
 January 21, 2011 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:17.579
 The day when Ei Chi always lined up 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:23.289
 dvd and cd are currently to be released 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.029
 It is Uzushi Urushiano Debishibashi 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.029
 30th anniversary 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.719
 Activities and the number of houses that this ten year spreads quite 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.940
 Ten people were not done 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.160
 Though it has been late 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.990
 Good luck a little this year 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.150
 Let's move 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.320
 How to 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.570
 I am thinking 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.930
 The night before 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.750
 New song circle inside 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.640
 I rely on the same song, so I'm happy to open the very first day 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.400
 It is called a good month ahead 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.960
 It is after 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.420
 Bossa Nova and such 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.370
 30's or 2's before 40's 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.540
 Finally high 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.130
 Do you say that you can shake the bat 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.090
 Pacific and protest statement 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.310
 A boy who seems to sue as it is 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.480
 It's not that full moon, but it's small and it's small 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.190
 Explain how 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.870
 I sang a feeling 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.540
 Please listen to it once 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.540
 This year marks the 30th anniversary 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.270
 If it is such a monster is forbidden 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.660
 I am thinking 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.990
 Yeah 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.710
 Near 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.850
 At a sporting festival 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.850
 I think it's vulgar when you come to play 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.130
 From now on 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.960
 I will wear red 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.190
 If you do not play the plate play 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.729
 There is no integrated materials balance while looking at the balance 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.720
 After the business flow chart I lose 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.620
 Incorrect 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.730
 We deliver on the other hand 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.540
 Hayakawa
