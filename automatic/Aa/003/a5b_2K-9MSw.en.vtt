oh yeah just a follow-up on another
couple<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:09.000> lives<00:00:09.150> have<00:00:09.330> done<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.690> was<00:00:10.559> sent<00:00:10.860> a

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
couple of lives have done I was sent a

couple of lives have done I was sent a
bread<00:00:11.550> knife<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.790> do<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.500> again<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.530> don't<00:00:13.710> like

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
bread knife to do and again I don't like

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.060 
bread knife to do and again I don't like
doing<00:00:14.880> serrations<00:00:15.360> but<00:00:16.109> what<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.230> did<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.740> I

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
doing serrations but what I did is I

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.420 
doing serrations but what I did is I
said<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:18.230> set<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.350> edge<00:00:19.439> pro<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.920> recalled

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
said I set the edge pro and I recalled

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.470 
said I set the edge pro and I recalled
the<00:00:20.699> tips<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.650> teeth<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.210> didn't<00:00:24.210> retouch

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
the tips of the teeth I didn't retouch

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.000 
the tips of the teeth I didn't retouch
you<00:00:24.630> inside<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.080> carbon<00:00:25.350> steel<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.650> -<00:00:25.740> okay

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
you inside the carbon steel up - okay

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.670 
you inside the carbon steel up - okay
but<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.730> just<00:00:26.789> put<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.720> new<00:00:27.990> angle<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.410> about

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
but I just put in a new angle it's about

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.370 
but I just put in a new angle it's about
I<00:00:29.070> think<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> 40<00:00:29.970> degree<00:00:30.029> angle<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
I think it's a 40 degree angle on the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.290 
I think it's a 40 degree angle on the
very<00:00:31.560> tips<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.099> teeth<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
very tips of the teeth and on the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.910 
very tips of the teeth and on the
backside<00:00:33.600> then<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.840> went<00:00:34.079> almost<00:00:34.350> flash<00:00:36.890> to<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
backside then I went almost flash to the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.330 
backside then I went almost flash to the
steel<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.629> just<00:00:39.629> D<00:00:39.809> board<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.620> very<00:00:40.860> very<00:00:41.100> tips

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
steel I just D board the very very tips

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.250 
steel I just D board the very very tips
of<00:00:41.460> all<00:00:41.579> these<00:00:41.760> teeth<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.690> tips<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.020> all<00:00:43.140> of

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
of all these teeth so the tips of all of

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.950 
of all these teeth so the tips of all of
these<00:00:43.379> teeth<00:00:43.620> are<00:00:43.800> very<00:00:44.219> very<00:00:44.399> sharp<00:00:44.730> now<00:00:45.030> so

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
these teeth are very very sharp now so

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.979 
these teeth are very very sharp now so
that<00:00:46.230> should<00:00:46.410> give<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.710> better<00:00:47.160> kind<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
that should give it a better kind of

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.770 
that should give it a better kind of
chance<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.140> make<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.469> chisel<00:00:50.250> or<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.399> sawtooth

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
chance to make it a chisel or a sawtooth

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.959 
chance to make it a chisel or a sawtooth
so<00:00:51.780> they<00:00:51.960> should<00:00:52.170> cause<00:00:52.410> well<00:00:52.680> into<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> hard

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
so they should cause well into a hard

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.410 
so they should cause well into a hard
crust<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.570> bread<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:56.670> chipping<00:00:57.090> true<00:00:57.270> that

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
crust of bread and chipping true that

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.970 
crust of bread and chipping true that
there<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.020> cut<00:00:58.710> way<00:00:58.890> down<00:00:59.039> through<00:00:59.250> okay<00:01:00.980> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
there and cut way down through okay the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.979 
there and cut way down through okay the
next<00:01:02.160> one<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.239> same<00:01:03.449> group<00:01:03.629> names<00:01:03.840> are

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
next one of the same group names are

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.649 
next one of the same group names are
sent<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.949> one<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.250> these<00:01:05.309> Whaler<00:01:06.119> Spanish

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
sent is one of these Whaler Spanish

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.210 
sent is one of these Whaler Spanish
knives<00:01:06.920> now<00:01:08.420> do<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.450> careful<00:01:09.890> taking<00:01:10.890> over<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
knives now do be careful taking over the

sheets the letter the keepers could

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.690 
sheets the letter the keepers could
guess<00:01:14.760> cause<00:01:15.590> don't<00:01:16.590> put<00:01:17.009> your<00:01:17.130> hand<00:01:17.310> around

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
to the spine of the sheet and draw the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.010 
to the spine of the sheet and draw the
knife<00:01:22.560> out<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.950> way<00:01:23.570> okay<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.840> quite<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
knife out that way okay this is quite a

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.600 
knife out that way okay this is quite a
chunky<00:01:25.409> knife<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:25.920> see<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
chunky knife you can see the the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.480 
chunky knife you can see the the
thickness<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.030> fine<00:01:27.299> there<00:01:27.890> so<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.920> put<00:01:29.280> along

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
thickness is fine there so I put along

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.890 
thickness is fine there so I put along
the<00:01:29.640> IDM<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:31.049> belt<00:01:31.229> sander<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.770> thin<00:01:32.490> out<00:01:32.900> that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the IDM the belt sander to thin out that

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.740 
the IDM the belt sander to thin out that
primary<00:01:34.350> bevel<00:01:34.530> slightly<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.509> put<00:01:36.689> it

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
primary bevel slightly and then I put it

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.539 
primary bevel slightly and then I put it
on<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> edge<00:01:37.020> Pro<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.439> put<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> micro

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
on the edge Pro and I put a like a micro

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.640 
on the edge Pro and I put a like a micro
bevel<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.909> 20<00:01:39.150> degrees<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:40.350> very<00:01:40.500> front

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
bevel of 20 degrees on the very front

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.810 
bevel of 20 degrees on the very front
toes<00:01:41.299> so<00:01:42.299> because<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.930> depth<00:01:43.820> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
toes so because of the depth the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.069 
toes so because of the depth the
difference<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.210> depth<00:01:45.390> between<00:01:45.540> here<00:01:45.990> and

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
difference in depth between here and

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.920 
difference in depth between here and
here<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.040> angle<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.340> slightly<00:01:47.520> thicker<00:01:48.060> here

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
here the angle is slightly thicker here

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.990 
here the angle is slightly thicker here
it's<00:01:49.140> 10<00:01:49.290> 20<00:01:49.350> degrees<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.070> closer<00:01:50.369> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
it's 10 20 degrees but it's closer to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.590 
it's 10 20 degrees but it's closer to
the<00:01:51.090> spine

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the spine

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.249 
the spine
so<00:01:52.560> that's<00:01:52.740> slightly<00:01:52.920> thicker<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:54.780> out<00:01:55.049> here

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
so that's slightly thicker and out here

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.800 
so that's slightly thicker and out here
it's<00:01:55.409> slightly<00:01:55.500> finer<00:01:56.450> which<00:01:57.450> isn't<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.719> bad

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
it's slightly finer which isn't a bad

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.190 
it's slightly finer which isn't a bad
thing

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
thing

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.620 
thing
so<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:58.979> chopping<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.880> slicing<00:01:59.969> at<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.509> kind

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
so for chopping and slicing at that kind

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.550 
so for chopping and slicing at that kind
of<00:02:00.689> stuff

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.990 

trying<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:08.619> do<00:02:08.710> this<00:02:08.830> like<00:02:09.070> I<00:02:09.310> can't<00:02:09.640> watch<00:02:09.820> the

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
trying to do this like I can't watch the

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
accidentally and damaged the tip so I

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.350 
accidentally and damaged the tip so I
reground<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.500> tip<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:45.700> actually<00:03:46.030> wasn't<00:03:46.209> that

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
badly damaged so the sharpening when I

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.250 
badly damaged so the sharpening when I
sharpen<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:48.880> first<00:03:49.090> took<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.780> lot<00:03:49.959> of<00:03:50.080> damage

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
sharpen it first took a lot of damage

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.199 
sharpen it first took a lot of damage
out<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:50.860> then<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.400> was<00:03:51.519> able<00:03:51.670> to<00:03:51.700> drop<00:03:51.940> the

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
out and then I was able to drop the

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.690 
out and then I was able to drop the
spine<00:03:52.870> down<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:53.410> meet<00:03:53.530> edge<00:03:53.709> I<00:03:53.950> prefer<00:03:54.489> not<00:03:54.640> to

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
spine down to meet edge I prefer not to

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.820 
spine down to meet edge I prefer not to
grind<00:03:54.940> away<00:03:55.150> edge<00:03:55.540> I'd<00:03:56.110> like<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.380> keep<00:03:56.500> as<00:03:56.680> much

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
grind away edge I'd like to keep as much

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.220 
grind away edge I'd like to keep as much
length<00:03:57.100> on<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:58.269> cutting<00:03:58.540> edge<00:03:58.630> as<00:03:58.840> possible

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
length on the cutting edge as possible

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.670 
length on the cutting edge as possible
at<00:03:59.350> all

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
at all

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.310 
at all
so<00:04:00.400> I<00:04:00.430> grind<00:04:00.730> from<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.090> spine<00:04:01.330> from<00:04:01.600> both<00:04:01.870> kind

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
so I grind from the spine from both kind

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.250 
so I grind from the spine from both kind
of<00:04:02.350> here<00:04:03.030> damn<00:04:04.030> so<00:04:04.450> I<00:04:04.480> have<00:04:04.600> a<00:04:04.660> gradual<00:04:05.050> curve

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
of here damn so I have a gradual curve

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.640 
of here damn so I have a gradual curve
that<00:04:05.530> comes<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:05.950> meet<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.850> tip<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.330> just<00:04:08.019> remake

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
that comes to meet the tip I just remake

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.930 
that comes to meet the tip I just remake
that<00:04:08.890> point<00:04:10.530> because<00:04:11.530> this<00:04:11.680> is<00:04:11.739> vg10<00:04:12.280> vg-10<00:04:12.760> is

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
that point because this is vg10 vg-10 is

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.550 
that point because this is vg10 vg-10 is
a<00:04:12.970> really<00:04:13.330> really<00:04:13.480> hard<00:04:13.600> steel<00:04:14.050> and<00:04:14.290> should<00:04:14.440> be

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
a really really hard steel and should be

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.759 
a really really hard steel and should be
hardened<00:04:15.630> fairly<00:04:16.630> high<00:04:16.810> on<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:17.260> Rockwell

hardened fairly high on the Rockwell

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:18.870 
hardened fairly high on the Rockwell
scale<00:04:18.010> I<00:04:18.310> just

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
scale I just

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.150

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
grain structure I'd say whoever did the

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.840 
grain structure I'd say whoever did the
heat<00:04:31.390> treat<00:04:31.630> on<00:04:31.810> this<00:04:32.370> has<00:04:33.370> done<00:04:33.550> a<00:04:33.610> really

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
heat treat on this has done a really

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.820 
heat treat on this has done a really
decent<00:04:34.000> job<00:04:34.330> took<00:04:34.720> it<00:04:34.870> down<00:04:34.990> went<00:04:35.440> up<00:04:35.560> through

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
decent job took it down went up through

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.510 
decent job took it down went up through
the<00:04:35.980> grits<00:04:36.160> and<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.430> diamond<00:04:36.700> plates<00:04:36.940> I<00:04:38.520> did

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
the grits and the diamond plates I did

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.890 
the grits and the diamond plates I did
it<00:04:39.610> with<00:04:39.820> these<00:04:40.690> polishing<00:04:41.410> tapes<00:04:42.870> they're<00:04:43.870> a

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
it with these polishing tapes they're a

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.550 
it with these polishing tapes they're a
3m<00:04:44.530> polishing<00:04:45.040> tape<00:04:45.870> that's<00:04:46.870> I<00:04:47.080> think<00:04:47.320> that's

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
3m polishing tape that's I think that's

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.760 
3m polishing tape that's I think that's
one<00:04:47.830> micron<00:04:48.250> and<00:04:48.840> then<00:04:49.840> I<00:04:49.930> strapped<00:04:50.200> us<00:04:50.380> on<00:04:50.590> the

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
one micron and then I strapped us on the

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.330 
one micron and then I strapped us on the
long<00:04:50.860> straight<00:04:50.980> or<00:04:51.220> strop<00:04:51.430> again<00:04:51.730> and<00:04:53.190> I'm<00:04:54.190> not

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
long straight or strop again and I'm not

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.860 
long straight or strop again and I'm not
sure<00:04:54.460> this<00:04:54.640> really<00:04:55.030> doesn't<00:04:55.480> even<00:04:55.510> give<00:04:55.780> an

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
sure this really doesn't even give an

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.000 
sure this really doesn't even give an
idea<00:04:56.110> of<00:04:56.290> how<00:04:58.050> really<00:04:59.050> really<00:04:59.410> sharp<00:04:59.650> this<00:04:59.830> is

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010
