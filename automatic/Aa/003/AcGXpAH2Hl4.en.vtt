00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.290 
you're familiar with some of the other

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.600 
you're familiar with some of the other
items<00:00:22.439> we<00:00:22.710> have<00:00:22.860> that<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.220> came<00:00:23.369> up<00:00:23.460> with<00:00:23.550> that

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
items we have that we came up with that

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.730 
items we have that we came up with that
had<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> cage<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.300> protect<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.869> what<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.500> does

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
had a cage to protect it what this does

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.320 
had a cage to protect it what this does
clearly<00:00:26.070> there's<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.700> cage<00:00:26.910> around<00:00:26.939> a

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
clearly there's a cage around a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.450 
clearly there's a cage around a
helicopter<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.590> looks<00:00:28.860> like<00:00:28.920> what<00:00:29.190> it<00:00:29.280> does

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
helicopter so it looks like what it does

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.060 
helicopter so it looks like what it does
but<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.119> also<00:00:30.180> rolls<00:00:30.600> in<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.050> case<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.890> those

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
but it also rolls in that case so those

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.189 
but it also rolls in that case so those
two<00:00:32.309> things<00:00:32.550> first<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.449> most<00:00:33.570> important<00:00:34.080> it

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199 
two things first and most important it

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:35.900 
two things first and most important it
introduces<00:00:34.530> an<00:00:34.710> entirely<00:00:35.070> new<00:00:35.340> play<00:00:35.550> pattern

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
introduces an entirely new play pattern

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.420 
introduces an entirely new play pattern
for<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.090> kid<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.930> second<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.680> probably<00:00:38.220> not

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
for the kid in a second and probably not

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.220 
for the kid in a second and probably not
important<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.910> parents<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.809> means<00:00:40.050> that

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
important for the parents it means that

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.869 
important for the parents it means that
it<00:00:40.320> survives<00:00:40.680> any<00:00:40.920> crashes<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.580> don't<00:00:41.610> know<00:00:41.790> if

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
it survives any crashes I don't know if

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.100 
it survives any crashes I don't know if
you've<00:00:41.970> ever<00:00:42.059> seen<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.360> young<00:00:42.600> kid<00:00:42.780> play<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
you've ever seen a young kid play the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.950 
you've ever seen a young kid play the
helicopter<00:00:43.650> has<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:44.129> max<00:00:44.489> model<00:00:44.909> hits<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
helicopter has a max model hits the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.600 
helicopter has a max model hits the
ceiling<00:00:46.140> comes<00:00:46.680> back<00:00:46.890> down<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.159> it<00:00:47.430> might<00:00:47.580> be

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
ceiling comes back down and it might be

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.759 
ceiling comes back down and it might be
broken<00:00:48.150> so<00:00:48.330> this<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:48.989> more<00:00:49.170> durable<00:00:49.379> let's

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
broken so this is more durable let's

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.410 
broken so this is more durable let's
walk<00:00:49.920> over<00:00:50.070> here<00:00:52.970> here's<00:00:53.970> the<00:00:54.089> new<00:00:54.180> play

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
walk over here here's the new play

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:04.610 
walk over here here's the new play
pattern<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:54.960> have<00:01:02.960> it<00:01:03.960> also<00:01:04.110> rolls<00:01:04.440> on

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
pattern that we have it also rolls on

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.670 
pattern that we have it also rolls on
the<00:01:04.710> floor<00:01:04.949> rolls<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.670> ceiling

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:31.810 

so<00:01:10.680> does<00:01:10.890> all<00:01:11.340> those<00:01:11.550> things<00:01:30.470> in<00:01:31.470> stores

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
so does all those things in stores

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.760 
so does all those things in stores
pretty<00:01:32.820> much<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.930> standard<00:01:34.080> retail<00:01:34.500> price<00:01:34.680> is

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
pretty much the standard retail price is

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.790 
pretty much the standard retail price is
going<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.950> be<00:01:35.010> 44<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:37.530> look<00:01:38.340> for<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.520> coming
