00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:16.070
 and although I wanted to know one 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:23.640
 made a difference and I am always 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:26.579
 Left wraps left right now 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.980
 We also can try a lot now 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:33.829
 not the significant difference 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.829
 notice me again and again 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.290
 apply 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.480
 a Swedish wants you now 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.560
 even very briefly show my still 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.240
 marshal plan now on a hand 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:58.020
 I 'm drawn there we want to go 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:01.220
 if the video has been wrapped it is 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:06.119
 So that's the two experimental objects 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:12.350
 Brinker is not all which size he 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:14.780
 with 0 4 , the windings entered and 84 cm 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.280
 what came out of it 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.210
 as children yes that is the goal of the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.210
 last time 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:29.510
 yes, let's go first 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:32.220
 normal against - a pencil 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.729
 I do not now stand at the setting 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.930
 be and watch the whole street 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:45.390
 to trust yes about it at good 12 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:49.439
 volt to exactly 12 12 volts and 550 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.590
 milliampere ca the candlestick thereby 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.980
 Now do not move, it was the 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.900
 transistors 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:10.710
 let them times is now only times against 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:10.710
 cluj is the fact it came in ok 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.069
 What a traffic light really does 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:28.079
 too much 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:34.469
 now take off the trek from mixa 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:37.530
 attitude but everything at the 12th 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:39.689
 Volt not quite 200 billion prices 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:45.329
 but almost back to the 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:49.709
 he did not even have me with 1 sg 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:52.849
 twelve because soon salomo will leave 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:03:03.389
 this is a 22 at lambach 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:03:06.949
 just look mama are three more what 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.949
 she has or is not anymore 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:24.180
 the money not blue so would have 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.180
 reasonably and is 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:37.150
 a support it is clear we do 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:39.099
 but even a cable ran it better still 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:45.480
 less leaving the rest spam guilty 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:49.120
 is so high that it goes beside it 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:53.409
 just to show it anyway 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.690
 direction we have to go now once 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:04:08.140
 why a luminosity with the 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:11.290
 also living can be so beautiful if you know 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:25.380
 yes nothing more is second dare of 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:28.240
 55 billion recently 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.930
 I can now have another game 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:38.680
 Eismann am tall rules first time glad 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:41.970
 milliamps and milliamps go now 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.970
 I again on the 50th 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:55.300
 5 Let's turn up even more 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:09.680
 only 25 volts 12 million 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:12.830
 So as I said I can only right 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.370
 and left wrapped so if you are now 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.840
 over develop 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.900
 you just have to mouser I can 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.910
 she told me julie he takes wrap 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.370
 a wire in my case now 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.740
 a whole more than 60 wrap 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:31.069
 developed in a ring around and then 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:39.710
 on average so I know you 2 x 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:45.740
 80 cm wrap each other middle altona is 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:48.530
 that's why it's important for you to cut 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.500
 so by the 80's the kick here 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:57.139
 above there I have no procedure I show 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:06:01.969
 really it is 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:04.400
 do not own I strive with the 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:05.539
 stole medium times smaller and with 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.960
 a good decrease 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:14.800
 I started here with them now 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:19.099
 at the beginning of the day, we do not care 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.550
 Cut off, so to speak , and then together 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:22.520
 rotate 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:27.560
 everywhere we dietz so match 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:31.669
 immediately wrapped and then whether the boys 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:35.560
 collectors jersey plus up to now 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:35.560
 on the bagno still english
