00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
to be holding the comb at a outward

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.469 
to be holding the comb at a outward
projectile<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.700> basically<00:01:18.180> you're<00:01:18.330> going<00:01:18.420> to

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
along the side and we'll sort of spin

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.800 
along the side and we'll sort of spin
him<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.320> little<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.159> side<00:01:23.340> here<00:01:23.810> you'll

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
him a little to the side here you'll

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.600 
him a little to the side here you'll
take<00:01:25.020> out<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.439> section<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.220> way<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.400> can

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
take out the section so that way you can

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.429 
take out the section so that way you can
see<00:01:26.880> where<00:01:27.090> your<00:01:27.240> start<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.720> your<00:01:27.810> end<00:01:28.049> points

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
see where your start and your end points

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.130 
see where your start and your end points
are<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.189> clipper<00:01:29.490> comb<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:31.049> will

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
are on the clipper comb and you will

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.319 
are on the clipper comb and you will
then<00:01:31.290> take<00:01:31.470> your<00:01:31.650> clippers

then take your clippers

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.700 
then take your clippers
you<00:01:33.329> will<00:01:33.450> then<00:01:33.630> holding<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.229> at<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.439> steady

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
you will then holding it at a steady

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.429 
you will then holding it at a steady
angle<00:01:35.189> lay<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> Clipper<00:01:36.450> straight<00:01:36.869> down<00:01:37.140> and

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
angle lay the Clipper straight down and

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.990 
angle lay the Clipper straight down and
run<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.189> across<00:01:40.100> across<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.310> comb<00:01:41.520> here<00:01:41.850> so

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
run it across across the comb here so

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.060 
run it across across the comb here so
that<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.240> has<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> nice<00:01:42.780> flat<00:01:43.170> even<00:01:43.560> edge<00:01:43.740> that's

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
that it has a nice flat even edge that's

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.219 
that it has a nice flat even edge that's
why<00:01:44.220> these<00:01:44.280> combs<00:01:44.729> are<00:01:44.909> designed<00:01:45.299> with<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> flat

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
why these combs are designed with a flat

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.050 
why these combs are designed with a flat
surface<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.189> not<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> raised<00:01:47.759> surface

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
surface on it and not a raised surface

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.880 
surface on it and not a raised surface
so<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.570> way<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.930> get<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.110> nice<00:01:49.320> even<00:01:49.560> cut

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
so that way you can get a nice even cut

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.249 
so that way you can get a nice even cut
and<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.790> as<00:01:50.939> you're<00:01:51.090> going<00:01:51.240> up<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.810> once<00:01:52.140> you

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
and so as you're going up so once you

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.469 
and so as you're going up so once you
make<00:01:52.409> your<00:01:52.560> initial<00:01:52.799> cut<00:01:53.220> as<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:54.000> continue<00:01:54.450> to

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
make your initial cut as you continue to

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.510 
make your initial cut as you continue to
go<00:01:54.689> upward<00:01:55.170> creating<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.829> sort<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.250> box

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
go upward creating this sort of a box

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.819 
go upward creating this sort of a box
effect<00:01:57.060> you'll<00:01:57.869> be<00:01:58.020> able<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.229> see<00:01:58.469> where<00:01:58.740> you

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
effect you'll be able to see where you

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.700 
effect you'll be able to see where you
will<00:01:58.979> then<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.340> able<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.579> add<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.500> take<00:02:01.500> off

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
will then be able to add and take off

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.499 
will then be able to add and take off
and<00:02:01.950> still<00:02:02.250> stay<00:02:02.490> within<00:02:02.520> your<00:02:03.030> angle

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
and still stay within your angle

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.859 
and still stay within your angle
creating<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:04.530> straight<00:02:05.009> up<00:02:05.570> cut<00:02:06.570> across

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
creating that straight up cut across

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.770 
creating that straight up cut across
area<00:02:07.459> to<00:02:08.459> be<00:02:08.550> able<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.789> be<00:02:09.330> able<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.539> create

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
area to be able to be able to create

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.180 
area to be able to be able to create
that<00:02:09.989> box<00:02:10.289> because<00:02:10.619> that's<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.950> goal<00:02:11.160> of

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
that box because that's the goal of

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.490 
that box because that's the goal of
using<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.849> flat<00:02:12.450> top<00:02:12.690> comb<00:02:12.930> as<00:02:13.140> your

create that flat top effect and you just

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.780 
create that flat top effect and you just
