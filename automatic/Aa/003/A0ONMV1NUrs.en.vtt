00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
off more BTUs and the motive puts out

off more BTUs and the motive puts out
there<00:01:55.499> all<00:01:55.619> fan<00:01:55.889> cooled<00:01:56.299> you<00:01:57.299> can<00:01:57.329> run<00:01:57.599> them

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
there all fan cooled you can run them

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.300 
there all fan cooled you can run them
for<00:01:57.899> as<00:01:57.959> long<00:01:58.139> as<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.409> want<00:01:58.649> as<00:01:58.829> long<00:01:58.919> as<00:01:59.219> you

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
have electricity you can run them for

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.659 
have electricity you can run them for
hours<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.169> can<00:02:01.319> fill<00:02:01.499> up<00:02:01.649> 20<00:02:02.009> trucks<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.429> a<00:02:02.490> row

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:02.669

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
that the motor will never get hot so you

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.270 
that the motor will never get hot so you
can<00:02:10.229> run<00:02:10.380> it<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.679> run<00:02:11.009> it

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
can run it and run it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.740

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
them out a small one like this does not
