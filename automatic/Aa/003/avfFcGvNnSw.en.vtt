and<00:00:05.670> for<00:00:06.600> this<00:00:06.720> I've<00:00:06.930> switched<00:00:07.170> over<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.620> some

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
and for this I've switched over to some

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.100 
and for this I've switched over to some
bean<00:00:08.010> bags<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.580> I'm<00:00:09.269> gonna<00:00:09.450> break<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.900> trick

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
bean bags and I'm gonna break the trick

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.709 
bean bags and I'm gonna break the trick
down<00:00:10.290> for<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.740> little<00:00:10.830> bit<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:12.120> pieces

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
down for you a little bit in pieces

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.230 
down for you a little bit in pieces
let's<00:00:12.960> use<00:00:13.200> two<00:00:13.710> different<00:00:13.889> colored<00:00:14.490> bean

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
let's use two different colored bean

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.120 
let's use two different colored bean
bags<00:00:15.540> for<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:16.020> okay

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
bags for this okay

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.220 
bags for this okay
the<00:00:17.670> trick<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.060> basically<00:00:18.270> gonna<00:00:18.810> look<00:00:18.990> like

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
the trick is basically gonna look like

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.849 
the trick is basically gonna look like
this<00:00:20.779> where<00:00:21.779> you're<00:00:21.900> gonna<00:00:21.960> claw<00:00:22.350> two<00:00:22.619> balls

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
this where you're gonna claw two balls

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.950 
this where you're gonna claw two balls
out<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.279> air<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.670> then<00:00:24.449> keep<00:00:24.689> juggling

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
out of the air and then keep juggling

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.150 
out of the air and then keep juggling
now<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.710> first<00:00:26.090> step<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:28.410> claw<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.769> two

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
now the first step is to claw the two

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.710 
now the first step is to claw the two
balls<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.609> you're<00:00:29.880> gonna<00:00:29.970> have<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.240> third<00:00:30.480> ball

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
balls so you're gonna have a third ball

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.030 
balls so you're gonna have a third ball
here<00:00:31.019> but<00:00:31.230> what's<00:00:31.380> gonna<00:00:31.500> happen<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.949> you're

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
here but what's gonna happen is you're

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.500 
here but what's gonna happen is you're
gonna<00:00:32.099> throw<00:00:32.489> them<00:00:32.669> up<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:32.969> you're<00:00:33.390> gonna

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
gonna throw them up and you're gonna

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.510 
gonna throw them up and you're gonna
cloth<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.290> two<00:00:34.469> balls<00:00:34.739> down<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.130> there's

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
cloth the two balls down and there's

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.060 
cloth the two balls down and there's
gonna<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.760> one<00:00:35.880> left<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.380> gonna<00:00:37.500> go<00:00:37.739> one

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
gonna be one left so it's gonna go one

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.340 
gonna be one left so it's gonna go one
two<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.760> you're<00:00:39.030> gonna<00:00:39.120> throw<00:00:40.079> them<00:00:40.230> up

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
two like that you're gonna throw them up

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.260 
two like that you're gonna throw them up
in<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> air<00:00:40.559> one<00:00:40.920> two<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.160> usually<00:00:41.670> do<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.210> with

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
in the air one two I usually do it with

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.840 
in the air one two I usually do it with
a<00:00:42.329> little<00:00:42.629> bit<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.129> snap<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.430> because

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
a little bit of a snap like that because

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.819 
a little bit of a snap like that because
it<00:00:45.000> gives<00:00:45.030> gives<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.809> little<00:00:45.930> more<00:00:46.110> pop<00:00:46.410> and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
it gives gives it a little more pop and

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.229 
it gives gives it a little more pop and
you<00:00:47.399> claw<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.270> pop<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.960> claw<00:00:49.289> now

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
you claw like that so pop and claw now

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.750 
you claw like that so pop and claw now
the<00:00:51.239> way<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.449> set<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:51.989> up<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:53.520> put<00:00:53.730> a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the way you set this up is you put a

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.189 
the way you set this up is you put a
ball<00:00:53.969> here<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.539> balls<00:00:54.750> are<00:00:54.870> gonna<00:00:54.989> go<00:00:55.170> up

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
ball here and the balls are gonna go up

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.630 
ball here and the balls are gonna go up
in<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.649> air<00:00:55.829> kind<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.530> a<00:00:58.530> triangle<00:00:59.250> kind<00:00:59.520> of

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
in the air kind of in a triangle kind of

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.389 
in the air kind of in a triangle kind of
pattern<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.800> you<00:01:01.800> definitely<00:01:02.039> want

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
pattern like that you definitely want

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.600 
pattern like that you definitely want
them<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.969> fly<00:01:03.239> up<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.570> air<00:01:04.129> with<00:01:05.129> one<00:01:05.339> ball

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
them to fly up in the air with one ball

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.570 
them to fly up in the air with one ball
on<00:01:05.640> top<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:07.200> two<00:01:07.409> balls<00:01:07.650> underneath<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.400> it's

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
on top and two balls underneath so it's

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.359 
on top and two balls underneath so it's
gonna<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:10.010> like<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:12.590> one<00:01:13.590> ball<00:01:13.830> definitely

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
gonna be like that one ball definitely

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.920 
gonna be like that one ball definitely
protrudes<00:01:14.850> higher<00:01:15.119> than<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> others<00:01:15.720> so

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
protrudes higher than the others so

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.740 
protrudes higher than the others so
what's<00:01:16.830> gonna<00:01:16.950> happen<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.520> your<00:01:18.240> claw<00:01:18.509> those

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
what's gonna happen is your claw those

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.570 
what's gonna happen is your claw those
two<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.439> catch<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.979> remaining<00:01:20.430> one

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
two and you catch the remaining one

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.490 
two and you catch the remaining one
you're<00:01:21.090> gonna<00:01:21.150> claw<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.630> bottom<00:01:22.049> two<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.350> this

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
you're gonna claw the bottom two in this

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.649 
you're gonna claw the bottom two in this
case<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.920> two<00:01:23.100> red<00:01:23.310> ones<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> red

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
case the two red ones and then the red

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.539 
case the two red ones and then the red
and<00:01:24.780> black<00:01:24.930> one<00:01:25.259> we're<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:25.950> gonna<00:01:26.250> catch

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
and black one we're just gonna catch

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.399 
and black one we're just gonna catch
into<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.939> pattern<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.420> it's<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:27.720> claw<00:01:28.110> claw

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
into the pattern so it's up claw claw

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.530 
into the pattern so it's up claw claw
and<00:01:28.680> catch<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.369> fast<00:01:29.640> trick<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.210> takes<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
and catch it's a fast trick it takes a

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.380 
and catch it's a fast trick it takes a
little<00:01:30.689> bit<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.930> work

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
little bit of work

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.030 
little bit of work
but<00:01:33.390> if<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.630> work<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.439> focus<00:01:34.740> on

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
but if you work on it and you focus on

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.980 
but if you work on it and you focus on
it<00:01:35.990> it's<00:01:36.990> up<00:01:37.290> down<00:01:37.560> down<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.570> like<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.780> and

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
it it's up down down and like that and

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.050 
it it's up down down and like that and
you<00:01:40.140> claw<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.530> right<00:01:40.890> hand<00:01:41.220> first<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.759> pull

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
you claw the right hand first and pull

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.399 
you claw the right hand first and pull
it<00:01:42.210> down<00:01:42.420> because<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.750> gives<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.170> enough

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
it down because that gives you enough

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.389 
it down because that gives you enough
time<00:01:43.759> to<00:01:45.439> basically<00:01:46.439> one<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.920> these<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.220> gonna

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
time to basically one of these is gonna

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.889 
time to basically one of these is gonna
hit<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.610> floor<00:01:47.820> when<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> do<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.479> trick<00:01:48.720> but

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
hit the floor when I do the trick but

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.929 
hit the floor when I do the trick but
you'll<00:01:49.020> see<00:01:49.259> you're<00:01:50.070> clawing<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.520> right<00:01:50.700> hand

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
you'll see you're clawing the right hand

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.340 
you'll see you're clawing the right hand
first<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.479> gives<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.810> enough<00:01:52.049> time<00:01:52.320> to

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
first and that gives you enough time to

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.469 
first and that gives you enough time to
grab<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.220> red<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.520> black<00:01:53.670> one<00:01:54.439> so<00:01:55.439> with<00:01:56.040> just

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
grab that red and black one so with just

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.760 
grab that red and black one so with just
the<00:01:57.479> right<00:01:57.630> hand<00:01:57.899> you're<00:01:58.110> doing<00:01:58.380> that

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
the right hand you're doing that

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.929 
the right hand you're doing that
okay<00:01:59.460> kind<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.600> hard<00:02:00.780> trick<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.140> do<00:02:01.939> slow

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
okay kind of a hard trick to do slow

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.859 
okay kind of a hard trick to do slow
motion<00:02:04.610> but<00:02:05.610> that's<00:02:05.820> how<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.119> goes<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:06.630> up

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
motion but that's how it goes it's up

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.619 
motion but that's how it goes it's up
down<00:02:07.530> down<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.310> then<00:02:08.489> catch<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.000> top<00:02:09.209> one<00:02:09.450> in

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
down down and then catch the top one in

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.660 
down down and then catch the top one in
that<00:02:10.289> triangle<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:10.979> that's<00:02:11.190> how<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.400> do<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
that triangle and that's how you do the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.100 
that triangle and that's how you do the
clawing<00:02:12.239> tricks

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
clawing tricks

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.560 
clawing tricks
start<00:02:13.340> into<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.370> juggling<00:02:14.790> pattern<00:02:14.850> one<00:02:15.390> more

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
start into a juggling pattern one more

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.900 
start into a juggling pattern one more
time<00:02:15.860> this<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:16.920> what<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.250> going<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.460> look<00:02:17.610> like

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.840 

and<00:02:21.890> that's<00:02:22.890> how<00:02:23.070> you<00:02:23.130> do<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.310> claw<00:02:23.580> Trek

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
and that's how you do the claw Trek

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.180 
and that's how you do the claw Trek
start
