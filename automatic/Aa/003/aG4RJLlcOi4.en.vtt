version for now so if you get the white
version<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.880> can't<00:00:30.029> get<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> black<00:00:30.390> version

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
version you can't get the black version

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.220 
version you can't get the black version
and<00:00:30.810> basic<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.890> just<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.700> recap<00:00:33.000> $300<00:00:33.899> you

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
and basic and so just to recap $300 you

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.040 
and basic and so just to recap $300 you
get<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.530> console<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.640> gamepad<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.390> my

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
get the console and the gamepad in my

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.410 
get the console and the gamepad in my
opinion<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.860> white<00:00:38.340> version<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.090> Wii<00:00:39.239> U

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
opinion the white version of the Wii U

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.200 
opinion the white version of the Wii U
shows<00:00:40.110> marks<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.040> dirt<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.520> lot<00:00:41.760> more<00:00:41.969> than<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
shows marks and dirt a lot more than the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.880 
shows marks and dirt a lot more than the
black<00:00:42.390> version<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.379> might<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.530> something

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
black version so that might be something

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.799 
black version so that might be something
you<00:00:43.950> want<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.129> consider<00:00:44.420> kind<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.510> whenever

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
you want to consider kind of whenever

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.170 
you want to consider kind of whenever
you<00:00:45.960> play<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.530> grime<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.550> dirt<00:00:47.760> just<00:00:48.030> gets

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
you play a grime and dirt just gets

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.819 
you play a grime and dirt just gets
around<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> controls<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.170> around<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.500> ports

350<00:02:45.090> like<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.020> mentioned<00:02:46.320> before<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.709> white

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
350 like I mentioned before the white

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.740 
350 like I mentioned before the white
version<00:02:47.100> does<00:02:47.490> gather<00:02:47.820> dirt<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.300> little<00:02:48.330> more

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
version does gather dirt a little more

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.720 
version does gather dirt a little more
than<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.470> black<00:02:49.740> version<00:02:50.010> does<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.490> think

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
than the black version does and I think

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.880 
than the black version does and I think
the<00:02:50.790> black<00:02:51.000> looks<00:02:51.240> a<00:02:51.360> lot<00:02:51.600> more<00:02:51.720> sleek<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.290> the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
the black looks a lot more sleek of the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.130 
the black looks a lot more sleek of the
camera<00:02:53.880> also<00:02:54.270> sticks<00:02:54.570> out<00:02:54.720> like<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.930> sore<00:02:55.110> thumb

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
camera also sticks out like a sore thumb

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.870 
camera also sticks out like a sore thumb
on<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.560> white<00:02:55.680> version<00:02:55.890> but<00:02:56.490> on<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.700> black

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
on the white version but on the black

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.190 
on the white version but on the black
version<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.330> just<00:02:57.480> fits<00:02:57.690> right<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:57.990> and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
version it just fits right in and

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.110 
version it just fits right in and
everything<00:02:58.860> just<00:02:58.950> looks<00:02:59.160> very<00:02:59.220> sleek<00:02:59.760> I'm

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
everything just looks very sleek I'm

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.770 
everything just looks very sleek I'm
very<00:03:00.360> nice

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
very nice

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.540 
very nice
the<00:03:01.080> white<00:03:01.200> version<00:03:01.350> looks<00:03:01.620> nice<00:03:01.800> as<00:03:01.950> well<00:03:02.070> but

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
the white version looks nice as well but

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.860 
the white version looks nice as well but
in<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:02.790> case<00:03:03.030> I'm<00:03:03.300> going<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.450> prefer<00:03:03.600> the

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
in this case I'm going to prefer the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.960 
in this case I'm going to prefer the
black<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.860> black<00:03:05.040> only<00:03:05.280> comes<00:03:05.640> for<00:03:05.880> the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
black and the black only comes for the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.430 
black and the black only comes for the
deluxe<00:03:06.270> and<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.600> white<00:03:06.810> is<00:03:06.959> only<00:03:07.140> for<00:03:07.350> the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
deluxe and the white is only for the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.230 
deluxe and the white is only for the
