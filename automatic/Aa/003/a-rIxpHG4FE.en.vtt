00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.870
 there is also very little you really 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:04:01.439
 what is it really worth to sort then 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.409
 soon comes to the end a cable for 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:07.340
 iphone and to charge my phone 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:10.020
 and what to load them in their car 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:15.580
 so 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:20.320
 to eat is various job 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.960
 platelet thyroxine because I have 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.970
 thyroid problems so we are 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.860
 never too sure I have to take a 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.940
 every morning so here I am full of 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.040
 clappers with me in case 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.050
 I will forget to learn one morning and 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.060
 that I remember during the day 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.100
 my old plate of my old 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.660
 the phone cover that I 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.910
 should strangers elsewhere and then then 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.800
 a pixi pigment that I received in london 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.690
 as a gift when I was bought from 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.220
 when I went to buy stuff 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.880
 at pixi I still have not released 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.710
 place and then then the last thing 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.380
 interesting is this so that's 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.940
 a kit that I keep with a little bit of 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.860
 makeup finally i'm going to show this 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.210
 that there is in but basically that's it and 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:06.100
 in the background these are strains of 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.400
 stores I think that at a bit of the 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:12.580
 currency there is also the plate 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.200
 identifying my bag who was falling 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.860
 a few years ago but here I am 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.690
 keep in the bottom of my bag 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.380
 and then yes no thionville packs 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.810
 pills of city pills 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.240
 this is then via a small kits 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.800
 it's a plastic empathy kit 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.540
 4 kitson it's not on the web or toil 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.520
 yeah here she is super cute and 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:40.360
 which is worse practices and in 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:45.250
 so I keep useful and less and 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:48.460
 at least quickly it a sanitizing gel 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.770
 so cjg the protections are reims age 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.169
 because because when we take the 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.840
 public transport or that ben here 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.729
 it's always it's always useful 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.250
 the caudalie beauty spray that's good 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:04.270
 when for example tonight with steph on 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.590
 going a remington events and I do not want 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.100
 see the time to redo my makeup 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.590
 so he will be here since this morning and if I 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.990
 freshen a little binger case for a few 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:18.150
 this loan is like that after I have to 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:21.710
 new good looking so then a 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:24.510
 small role gives since their oil 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.340
 Therapeutic finally it's basically it's a 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.400
 anti stress that we put at the level of 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.610
 wrists at the temples and it smells 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.700
 pretty strong and his senses and that's supposed 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:38.790
 to make one more Zen 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.050
 then the blush pixi because yes 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.790
 that's it at the end of the day if I have to 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:45.660
 to make up in fact the only make-up 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:47.700
 What I have is a bluff and a mascara 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.050
 so jean gets up a little bit overflowed 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.670
 and then I put a shot of mascara and 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.840
 a little bluff and I think that 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.570
 is enough to refresh 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:58.560
 to refresh a makeup not need 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:07:00.000
 remake of a tune with 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.490
 fountain etc 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.090
 Well, I'm bored so that's it 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:10.400
 boom bass line for lips a spray 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:14.630
 oral aquafresh in samples of 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:18.840
 serum knows what it's called 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:21.810
 it's intensive biphasic clarity is 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:24.720
 so useful buffers here you know 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.370
 all that is basically there it's all 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.920
 who is in my 50th now he is 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.140
 empty you see a little there the size there 

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.220
 comes with a handle like this is 

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.590
 really it is super convenient 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.390
 I plan to redeem a goal that the one 

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.890
 one at the end of his life in the months 

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:41.010
 come in black so 

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:43.880
 so here I am rejoicing and at a 

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.880
 next cat
