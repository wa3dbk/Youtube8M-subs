Dubai recently got a request to test the
speaker<00:00:08.849> quality<00:00:09.059> on<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.540> new<00:00:09.690> iPhone<00:00:09.900> 4<00:00:10.440> and

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
loudness for that matter and I know that

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.379 
loudness for that matter and I know that
is<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.380> big<00:00:13.620> deal<00:00:13.830> when<00:00:14.190> choosing<00:00:14.700> any<00:00:14.940> type<00:00:15.210> of

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
is a big deal when choosing any type of

is a big deal when choosing any type of
cell<00:00:15.599> phone<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.320> am<00:00:16.740> just<00:00:17.160> going<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.400> point<00:00:17.580> out

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
cell phone I am just going to point out

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.359 
cell phone I am just going to point out
that<00:00:18.260> the<00:00:19.260> earpiece<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.869> tad<00:00:21.869> low<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:23.100> might

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
that the earpiece is a tad low it might

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.250 
that the earpiece is a tad low it might
be<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> little<00:00:23.789> bit<00:00:24.000> difficult<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.480> hear<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.080> a

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
be a little bit difficult to hear in a

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.849 
be a little bit difficult to hear in a
very<00:00:25.470> noisy<00:00:25.710> environment<00:00:26.779> however<00:00:27.859> that

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
very noisy environment however that

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.500 
very noisy environment however that
could<00:00:28.980> always<00:00:29.099> be<00:00:29.310> solved<00:00:29.699> with<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.060> headset

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
could always be solved with the headset

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.620 
could always be solved with the headset
and<00:00:30.890> you<00:00:31.890> know<00:00:31.980> it's<00:00:32.219> not<00:00:32.399> terrible<00:00:33.090> if<00:00:33.390> you're

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
and you know it's not terrible if you're

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.330 
and you know it's not terrible if you're
in<00:00:35.000> pretty<00:00:36.000> much<00:00:36.120> low<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.840> moderate<00:00:37.590> ambient

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
in pretty much low to moderate ambient

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.660 
in pretty much low to moderate ambient
noise<00:00:39.140> but<00:00:40.140> anyway<00:00:40.530> why<00:00:40.710> don't<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.950> test<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
noise but anyway why don't I test the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.209 
noise but anyway why don't I test the
ringing<00:00:41.969> volume<00:00:42.420> now<00:00:42.600> for<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> full<00:00:43.649> full

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
ringing volume now for the full full

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.750 
ringing volume now for the full full
speaker<00:00:44.550> volume<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.750> I'm<00:00:45.809> going<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.140> call

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
speaker volume so I'm going to call

00:00:46.760 --> 00:01:07.000 
speaker volume so I'm going to call
Apple<00:00:49.879> and<00:00:50.879> raise<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.750> speaker<00:00:52.289> volume<00:01:05.840> and

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
Apple and raise the speaker volume and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.380 
Apple and raise the speaker volume and
basically<00:01:08.010> that's<00:01:08.250> how<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> speaker<00:01:09.030> would

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
basically that's how the speaker would

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.429 
basically that's how the speaker would
sound<00:01:09.979> quality<00:01:10.979> with<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.750> regular<00:01:12.750> person<00:01:13.229> not

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
sound quality with a regular person not

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.340 
sound quality with a regular person not
an<00:01:13.560> automated<00:01:14.070> response<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.600> usually<00:01:15.900> pretty

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
an automated response is usually pretty

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.760 
an automated response is usually pretty
clear<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.250> clarity<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.880> pretty<00:01:18.119> good<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:19.170> now

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
clear the clarity is pretty good so now

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.510 
clear the clarity is pretty good so now
I'm<00:01:19.799> going<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.280> test<00:01:20.549> say<00:01:22.070> music<00:01:23.070> right<00:01:23.280> here

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
and I will test the song that I usually

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.960

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
do for a lot of my test videos this one

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:38.510 
do for a lot of my test videos this one
by<00:01:30.119> Van<00:01:30.329> Halen<00:01:30.560> put<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.770> out

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.710 

and<00:01:39.520> honestly<00:01:39.910> it<00:01:40.570> is<00:01:40.840> loud<00:01:41.650> enough<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
and honestly it is loud enough the

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.870 
and honestly it is loud enough the
speaker<00:01:44.140> on<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.590> new<00:01:44.680> iPhone<00:01:44.890> 4<00:01:45.340> definitely

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
speaker on the new iPhone 4 definitely

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.180 
speaker on the new iPhone 4 definitely
is<00:01:45.970> improved<00:01:46.450> from<00:01:46.750> 3GS<00:01:47.410> it's<00:01:47.740> a<00:01:47.860> little<00:01:48.100> bit

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
is improved from 3GS it's a little bit

is improved from 3GS it's a little bit
louder<00:01:48.430> than<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:48.940> previous<00:01:49.390> models<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:51.100> it's

louder than the previous models and it's

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.760 
louder than the previous models and it's
also<00:01:51.430> clear<00:01:52.410> partially<00:01:53.410> due<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.680> fact

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
also clear partially due to the fact

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.920 
also clear partially due to the fact
that<00:01:54.220> it's<00:01:54.340> no<00:01:54.490> longer<00:01:54.670> internal<00:01:55.420> we<00:01:55.540> now<00:01:55.690> have

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
that it's no longer internal we now have

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.390 
that it's no longer internal we now have
these<00:01:56.550> external<00:01:57.550> speakers<00:01:58.060> on<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.360> bottom
