00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
could be opened so we have to extract

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.939

video part of the FLV file and for that
we<00:00:27.180> can<00:00:27.420> use<00:00:27.449> two<00:00:27.930> programs<00:00:28.560> for<00:00:28.980> example

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.999 
as if sfk that's from Sony Vegas that's
not<00:06:29.080> needed<00:06:29.610> the<00:06:30.610> FLV<00:06:31.090> file<00:06:31.570> was<00:06:32.110> decomposed

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:33.009 
not needed the FLV file was decomposed

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:36.960 
not needed the FLV file was decomposed
into<00:06:33.669> the<00:06:34.389> audio<00:06:34.990> audio<00:06:35.979> and<00:06:36.250> video<00:06:36.610> part

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
into the audio audio and video part

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.689 
into the audio audio and video part
without<00:06:37.630> direct<00:06:38.080> recompression<00:06:38.919> and<00:06:39.400> it<00:06:40.330> was

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 
without direct recompression and it was

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:46.379 
without direct recompression and it was
recombined<00:06:42.699> using<00:06:43.690> amp<00:06:44.350> into<00:06:45.130> an<00:06:45.280> mp4<00:06:46.030> file

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:46.389 
recombined using amp into an mp4 file

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:51.120 
recombined using amp into an mp4 file
and<00:06:46.720> this<00:06:47.650> mp4<00:06:48.400> file<00:06:48.789> although<00:06:49.389> the<00:06:49.570> size<00:06:50.050> is<00:06:50.949> a

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
and this mp4 file although the size is a

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.490 
and this mp4 file although the size is a
little<00:06:51.490> bit<00:06:51.639> different

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:00.220 

the<00:06:55.040> FLV<00:06:55.490> file<00:06:56.030> is<00:06:57.100> 49<00:06:58.100> megabytes<00:06:58.580> and<00:06:58.910> mp4<00:06:59.870> is

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:00.230 
the FLV file is 49 megabytes and mp4 is

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.060 
the FLV file is 49 megabytes and mp4 is
48<00:07:01.010> so<00:07:01.430> one<00:07:02.210> megabyte<00:07:02.720> is<00:07:02.900> different<00:07:03.380> the

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.070 
48 so one megabyte is different the

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.280 
48 so one megabyte is different the
content<00:07:04.640> should<00:07:05.030> be<00:07:05.210> the<00:07:05.630> same

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.290 
content should be the same

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.750 
content should be the same
probably<00:07:07.280> the<00:07:07.430> container<00:07:08.210> of<00:07:08.570> the<00:07:08.720> file<00:07:09.760> makes

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:10.760 
probably the container of the file makes

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.890 
probably the container of the file makes
the<00:07:10.970> size<00:07:11.660> difference<00:07:13.030> so<00:07:14.030> you<00:07:14.060> can<00:07:14.180> open<00:07:14.540> the

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:14.900 
the size difference so you can open the

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.210 
the size difference so you can open the
FLV<00:07:15.890> file<00:07:16.310> in<00:07:16.610> Sony<00:07:16.910> Vegas<00:07:17.110> by<00:07:18.110> extracting<00:07:18.770> the

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.220 
FLV file in Sony Vegas by extracting the

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.360 
FLV file in Sony Vegas by extracting the
two<00:07:19.640> audio/video<00:07:20.570> parts<00:07:20.960> from<00:07:21.830> it<00:07:22.040> and

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.370 
two audio/video parts from it and

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.780 
two audio/video parts from it and
recognize<00:07:23.410> recombining<00:07:24.410> it<00:07:24.710> into<00:07:25.250> an<00:07:25.370> mp4

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:25.790 
recognize recombining it into an mp4

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:31.330 
recognize recombining it into an mp4
format<00:07:27.520> okay<00:07:28.520> thank<00:07:28.850> you<00:07:28.970> bye<00:07:29.300> bye
