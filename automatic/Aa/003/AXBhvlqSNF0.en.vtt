00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.030
 difficulty for it 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.370
 There I tell you about different news of 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.989
 photography and activities that I do 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.109
 around this exciting world 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.480
 as the photograph we are going to see today 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.250
 I bring a video about how to spend 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.580
 our contacts that we have in the 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.890
 apple cloud in icloud to a device 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.720
 android and right now I'm using a 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.090
 android as main phone one in 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.539
 the g2 that you can find 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.490
 ok if on my YouTube channel and when I gave 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:18.409
 the step of jumping to android I found 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.420
 with me in my gmail account not 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.939
 I had just saved contacts with what 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.159
 which I could hardly call anyone since 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.350
 there were no contacts on the phone 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.810
 Then I was forced to see how 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.140
 I managed to get the phones through 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.750
 I had in the icloud apple cloud to 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.859
 an android without being left without doing one 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.049
 by one and there with different methods and I 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.000
 the one I used and the one I like the most is 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.310
 which I will explain to you what 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.200
 first thing we're going to do is go to the 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.300
 icloud dotcom page 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.730
 I already have it here 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.260
 on safari and we go to icloud.com 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.260
 we invented our paper there 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.409
 and password 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.109
 once we enter we go to contacts 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.929
 and in contacts we will select all the 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:14.580
 contacts and let's go to the appointment street this 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.960
 and we give expo export locate 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.010
 we give 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.930
 and we'll have the file exported to 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.060
 site where we have by default in this 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.750
 case I in safari I have it in downloads 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.840
 and we have the file here as you see 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.330
 vkr of icloud is worth having that file 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.710
 not what we're going to do is go to our 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.780
 gmail account mmmm 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.750
 I already have my email 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.710
 and password and within gmail we are going to 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.470
 go to contacts in contacts we deploy 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:50.910
 this bar and we give you to import 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:54.030
 contacts here select file let's go 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.460
 to downloads we would choose this file and 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.370
 him and we would give him to import I do not do it 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.880
 because I already have the I already have it done and 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.870
 we would have all our contacts 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.760
 in our gmail account and already once 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.400
 that are in gmail if we went to our 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.800
 Android device we would have in the 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.110
 schedule those contacts that we had in 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.630
 icloud with our your phone if 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.160
 We have photos with photos and also if 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.890
 We also have email from 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.830
 that email contact 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.220
 you have already seen fast simple and as 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.330
 I would say in bricomanÃ­a for the whole family 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.680
 this is all for today 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.680
