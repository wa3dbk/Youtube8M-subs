see all of these different long file

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.179 
see all of these different long file
names<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:18.060> bunch<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.420> what<00:01:18.960> are<00:01:19.110> called

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
names and a bunch of what are called

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.100 
names and a bunch of what are called
documents<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.850> aren't<00:01:21.090> actually<00:01:21.420> actually<00:01:21.810> I

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
documents but aren't actually actually I

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.710 
documents but aren't actually actually I
happen<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> pick<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.740> cache<00:01:23.130> file<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.450> see

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
happen to pick a cache file so I can see

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.080 
happen to pick a cache file so I can see
this<00:01:24.900> one<00:01:25.080> interestingly<00:01:25.409> enough<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:26.400> many

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
this one interestingly enough but many

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.330 
this one interestingly enough but many
of<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> files<00:01:27.570> here<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.680> won't<00:01:28.890> actually<00:01:29.130> be

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
of the files here you won't actually be

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.910 
of the files here you won't actually be
able<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.670> open<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:31.320> says<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.830> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
able to open so this says it's the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.060 
able to open so this says it's the
document<00:01:32.400> if<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.729> try<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.000> open<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.680> it<00:01:34.680> won't<00:01:34.920> be

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
document if I try to open it it won't be

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.630 
document if I try to open it it won't be
able<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.509> there<00:01:36.509> we<00:01:36.600> go<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.799> could<00:01:38.100> install

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
able to there we go so I could install

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.700 
able to there we go so I could install
Xcode<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.570> really<00:01:39.840> get<00:01:39.960> into<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.590> know

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
Xcode and really get into you know

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.350 
Xcode and really get into you know
trying<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.100> hack<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.460> file<00:01:41.670> if<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.939> wanted<00:01:42.210> to

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
trying to hack that file if I wanted to

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.789 
trying to hack that file if I wanted to
but<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:42.750> probably<00:01:43.020> really<00:01:43.409> not<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.740> be

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
but it's probably really not going to be

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.789 
but it's probably really not going to be
a<00:01:43.860> lot<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.130> fun<00:01:44.310> for<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.320> then

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
a lot of fun for you and if it is then

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.109 
a lot of fun for you and if it is then
you<00:01:47.159> probably<00:01:47.460> already<00:01:47.640> know<00:01:47.880> what<00:01:47.909> you're

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
you probably already know what you're

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.679 
you probably already know what you're
