00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.460

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:31.019

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.180
 tin of condensed milk and a spoonful of 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.180

 to loosen the grains well to be well 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.379
 When it's time to cook, you'll go 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.840

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.280

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.930
