should<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.630> think<00:01:22.170> that's<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.350> biggest

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
should so I think that's the biggest

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.899 
should so I think that's the biggest
thing<00:01:22.680> just<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.189> know<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.460> mindset<00:01:23.759> of

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
thing just you know it's the mindset of

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.219

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
the kids have taken a one week at a time

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.289 
the kids have taken a one week at a time
and<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:26.040> know<00:01:26.130> again<00:01:26.310> we're<00:01:26.759> not<00:01:26.939> talent

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299
