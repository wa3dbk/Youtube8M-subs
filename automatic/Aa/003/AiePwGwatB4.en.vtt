punching<00:03:10.230> Tim<00:03:10.560> Bradley<00:03:11.209> it's<00:03:12.209> my<00:03:12.660> belief<00:03:12.840> that

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
punching Tim Bradley it's my belief that

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.650 
punching Tim Bradley it's my belief that
because<00:03:14.459> honestly<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:14.880> scored<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.450> fight<00:03:15.630> a

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
because honestly I scored the fight a

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.800 
because honestly I scored the fight a
draw<00:03:16.020> so<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:16.860> saw<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.340> Tim<00:03:17.610> was<00:03:18.180> doing<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.630> lot

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
draw so I saw that Tim was doing a lot

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.160 
draw so I saw that Tim was doing a lot
of<00:03:18.870> great<00:03:19.230> things<00:03:19.940> defensively<00:03:20.940> but<00:03:21.900> when<00:03:22.050> you

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
of great things defensively but when you

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.430 
of great things defensively but when you
said<00:03:22.459> dialed<00:03:23.459> him<00:03:23.610> in<00:03:23.880> do<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:24.570> feel<00:03:24.810> that<00:03:24.989> he

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
said dialed him in do you feel that he

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.280 
said dialed him in do you feel that he
kind<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.830> knows<00:03:26.220> Manny<00:03:26.610> now<00:03:26.880> anyway<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:28.170> know

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
kind of knows Manny now anyway you know

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.440 
kind of knows Manny now anyway you know
there's<00:03:28.530> also<00:03:28.800> a<00:03:29.280> three-part<00:03:29.940> question<00:03:29.970> and

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
there's also a three-part question and

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.150 
there's also a three-part question and
he<00:03:30.810> also<00:03:30.989> did<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.470> lot<00:03:31.860> of<00:03:31.890> great<00:03:32.130> things

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
he also did a lot of great things

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.880 
he also did a lot of great things
defensively<00:03:32.630> but<00:03:33.630> offensively<00:03:34.260> i<00:03:34.410> think<00:03:34.800> is

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
defensively but offensively i think is

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.080 
defensively but offensively i think is
where<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.040> lot<00:03:35.100> of<00:03:35.220> people<00:03:35.310> felt<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:35.820> he

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
where a lot of people felt that he

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.000 
where a lot of people felt that he
didn't<00:03:36.330> do<00:03:36.510> enough<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:37.170> get<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.500> first<00:03:37.709> fight

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
didn't do enough to get that first fight

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.979 
didn't do enough to get that first fight
is<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:38.910> something<00:03:39.120> you're<00:03:39.330> planning<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:39.780> go

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
is that something you're planning you go

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.650 
is that something you're planning you go
