input<00:00:32.989> configuration<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.890> for<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.340> you're

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
input configuration so for this you're

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.290 
input configuration so for this you're
going<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.640> want<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.850> make<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.329> order<00:00:37.020> controls

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
going to want to make the order controls

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.420 
going to want to make the order controls
to<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.510> maps<00:00:40.200> out<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> drawer<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
to the maps out to the drawer to the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.430 
to the maps out to the drawer to the
control<00:00:41.700> pad<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.450> ups<00:00:42.629> downs<00:00:42.809> left<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.290> right

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
control pad the ups downs left and right

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.010 
control pad the ups downs left and right
so<00:00:43.620> I'll<00:00:43.680> use<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.100> left<00:00:44.640> analog<00:00:44.850> stick<00:00:45.030> these

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
so I'll use the left analog stick these

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.720 
so I'll use the left analog stick these
all<00:00:46.230> these<00:00:46.530> will<00:00:46.739> be<00:00:46.770> dumping<00:00:47.129> different<00:00:47.579> but

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
all these will be dumping different but

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.250 
all these will be dumping different but
just<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.059> example<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.600> default<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
just for this example I default to the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.560 
just for this example I default to the
water<00:00:49.410> space<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.219> up<00:00:50.629> left<00:00:51.629> down<00:00:52.230> right<00:00:53.120> so<00:00:54.120> now

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
water space so up left down right so now

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.090 
water space so up left down right so now
to<00:00:54.960> work<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.320> out<00:00:55.500> you've<00:00:55.710> got<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.890> look<00:00:55.980> at

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
to work this out you've got to look at

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.790 
to work this out you've got to look at
your<00:00:56.280> buttons<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.510> your<00:00:57.780> controller<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.649> your

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
your buttons on your controller and your

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.560 
your buttons on your controller and your
buttons<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.640> right-hand<00:01:00.120> side<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
buttons on the right-hand side of the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.389 
buttons on the right-hand side of the
screen<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:01.050> little<00:01:01.649> bit<00:01:01.829> confusing<00:01:02.190> because

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
screen a little bit confusing because

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.889 
screen a little bit confusing because
they're<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> bit<00:01:02.789> messed<00:01:02.969> around<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.690> they're

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
they're a bit messed around but they're

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.469 
they're a bit messed around but they're
basically<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.320> opposites<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.830> each<00:01:04.949> other<00:01:05.129> so

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
basically the opposites of each other so

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.929 
basically the opposites of each other so
B<00:01:06.479> would<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:08.210> would<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.420> B<00:01:10.100> Y<00:01:11.100> would<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.640> X

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
B would be a a would be B Y would be X

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.960 
B would be a a would be B Y would be X
and<00:01:12.390> X<00:01:12.810> would<00:01:13.110> be<00:01:13.229> Y<00:01:14.900> start<00:01:15.900> B<00:01:16.049> start<00:01:16.970> select

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
and X would be Y start B start select

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.450 
and X would be Y start B start select
will<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.119> select<00:01:18.830> left<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.040> right<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.430> just

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
will be select left and right I just

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.630 
will be select left and right I just
used<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:22.220> left<00:01:23.220> bumper<00:01:23.670> right<00:01:24.450> bumper<00:01:24.509> and

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
used the left bumper right bumper and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.109 
used the left bumper right bumper and
don't<00:01:26.640> worry<00:01:26.850> about<00:01:26.909> these<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:28.080> hit<00:01:28.320> OK<00:01:29.119> so

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
can just use your control pad normally

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.230 
can just use your control pad normally
one<00:02:08.740> player<00:02:08.979> game<00:02:09.039> you<00:02:09.460> can<00:02:09.640> use<00:02:09.820> two<00:02:09.970> players

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.070 
one player game you can use two players
as<00:02:10.420> well<00:02:10.450> if<00:02:10.720> you<00:02:10.840> map<00:02:10.990> two<00:02:11.140> controllers<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.710> it

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
as well if you map two controllers to it

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.630 
as well if you map two controllers to it
but<00:02:14.080> yeah<00:02:14.260> that's<00:02:14.440> pretty<00:02:14.620> much<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:15.250> know

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640
