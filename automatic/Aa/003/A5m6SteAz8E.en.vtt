partnership<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.840> were<00:01:30.960> reminding<00:01:31.409> ourselves

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
partnership we were reminding ourselves

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.350 
partnership we were reminding ourselves
if<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.009> want<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.220> connect<00:01:32.490> or<00:01:32.670> last<00:01:32.970> we<00:01:33.180> don't

follow so we connect we connect in a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.120 
follow so we connect we connect in a
relaxed<00:01:37.079> manner<00:01:37.140> and

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
relaxed manner and

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.710 
relaxed manner and
we<00:01:39.189> trust<00:01:39.430> our<00:01:39.580> followers<00:01:40.060> like<00:01:40.240> I'm<00:01:40.420> really

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
we trust our followers like I'm really

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.539 
we trust our followers like I'm really
always<00:01:40.960> thinking<00:01:41.409> about<00:01:41.500> initiating<00:01:41.979> cheese

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
always thinking about initiating cheese

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.310 
always thinking about initiating cheese
follow-through<00:01:43.119> we<00:01:43.360> finish<00:01:43.659> together<00:01:44.020> or<00:01:44.229> we

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
follow-through we finish together or we

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.539 
follow-through we finish together or we
move<00:01:44.530> on<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.830> something<00:01:45.130> else

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
move on to something else

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.370 
move on to something else
so<00:01:45.880> if<00:01:46.030> our<00:01:46.119> basics<00:01:46.570> are<00:01:46.689> pretty<00:01:46.900> relaxed

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
so if our basics are pretty relaxed

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.719 
so if our basics are pretty relaxed
we're<00:01:47.500> relying<00:01:47.770> on<00:01:47.950> that<00:01:48.070> bounce<00:01:48.280> right<00:01:48.490> there

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
we're relying on that bounce right there

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.219 
we're relying on that bounce right there
and<00:01:49.240> then<00:01:49.810> move<00:01:50.350> on<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:50.560> fishtails<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.600> we're

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
and then move on the fishtails and we're

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.960 
and then move on the fishtails and we're
reminding<00:01:53.799> ourselves<00:01:53.890> Sola<00:01:54.399> dancing<00:01:54.850> what

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
reminding ourselves Sola dancing what

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.630 
reminding ourselves Sola dancing what
our<00:01:55.090> arms<00:01:55.450> look<00:01:55.659> like<00:01:55.930> because<00:01:56.170> we<00:01:57.070> could

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
our arms look like because we could

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.820 
our arms look like because we could
takes<00:01:57.909> up<00:01:58.119> and<00:01:58.750> lean<00:01:58.960> every<00:01:59.229> moment<00:01:59.590> of<00:01:59.649> this

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
takes up and lean every moment of this

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.510 
takes up and lean every moment of this
but<00:02:00.789> we<00:02:01.539> trust<00:02:01.810> our<00:02:01.960> partner<00:02:02.280> all<00:02:03.280> right
