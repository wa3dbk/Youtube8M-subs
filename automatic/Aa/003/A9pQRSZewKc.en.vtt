00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
but this is my little trick to getting

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.040 
but this is my little trick to getting
all<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.019> juice<00:03:59.200> out

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
all the juice out

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.070 
all the juice out

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
and as you can see I am squeezing it the

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.140 
and as you can see I am squeezing it the
cut<00:04:03.260> side<00:04:03.500> up<00:04:03.710> so<00:04:03.980> that<00:04:04.280> I<00:04:04.310> can<00:04:04.490> catch<00:04:04.700> any<00:04:05.000> of

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
cut side up so that I can catch any of

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.880 
cut side up so that I can catch any of
the<00:04:05.270> seeds<00:04:05.540> that<00:04:05.690> might<00:04:05.930> want<00:04:06.080> to<00:04:06.200> pop<00:04:06.410> out<00:04:06.650> and

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
the seeds that might want to pop out and

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.370 
the seeds that might want to pop out and
get<00:04:07.700> into<00:04:07.880> our<00:04:08.120> hummus<00:04:08.480> because<00:04:08.840> we<00:04:09.170> wouldn't

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
get into our hummus because we wouldn't

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.960 
get into our hummus because we wouldn't

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
and I mean that's a little iffy for him

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.040 
and I mean that's a little iffy for him
and<00:05:43.220> we<00:05:44.220> don't<00:05:44.400> put<00:05:44.910> it<00:05:45.000> in<00:05:45.090> here<00:05:45.360> so<00:05:45.600> the<00:05:45.870> kids

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
and we don't put it in here so the kids

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.270 
and we don't put it in here so the kids
will<00:05:46.200> still<00:05:46.350> eat<00:05:46.500> this<00:05:46.740> with<00:05:46.950> the<00:05:47.040> peanut

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
will still eat this with the peanut

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.620 
will still eat this with the peanut
butter<00:05:47.370> and<00:05:47.610> it<00:05:47.670> still<00:05:47.850> has<00:05:47.940> a<00:05:47.970> great<00:05:48.330> flavor

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
butter and it still has a great flavor

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.660 
butter and it still has a great flavor
but<00:05:49.320> we<00:05:49.410> don't<00:05:49.590> have<00:05:49.680> the<00:05:49.830> added<00:05:50.130> chop<00:05:50.490> of

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670 
but we don't have the added chop of

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.060 
but we don't have the added chop of
those<00:05:50.820> peanuts<00:05:51.510> on<00:05:51.660> top<00:05:51.800> I'm<00:05:52.800> going<00:05:52.950> to<00:05:53.010> go

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
those peanuts on top I'm going to go

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.280 
those peanuts on top I'm going to go
ahead<00:05:53.160> and<00:05:53.340> close<00:05:53.520> this<00:05:53.760> now<00:05:53.870> before<00:05:54.870> I<00:05:54.900> add

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
ahead and close this now before I add

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.110 
ahead and close this now before I add
the<00:05:55.320> last<00:05:55.710> ingredient<00:05:55.890> which<00:05:56.430> is<00:05:56.610> our<00:05:56.760> olive

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
the last ingredient which is our olive

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.070 
the last ingredient which is our olive
oil<00:05:57.330> I'm<00:05:57.390> going<00:05:57.420> to<00:05:57.570> go<00:05:57.630> ahead<00:05:57.690> and<00:05:57.840> give<00:05:57.930> it<00:05:57.990> a

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
oil I'm going to go ahead and give it a

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.140 
oil I'm going to go ahead and give it a
few<00:05:58.230> pulses<00:05:58.290> to<00:05:58.830> get<00:05:58.920> it<00:05:59.040> going<00:05:59.340> and<00:05:59.490> then

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
few pulses to get it going and then

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.730 
few pulses to get it going and then
we'll<00:06:00.330> slowly<00:06:00.480> drizzle<00:06:01.050> in<00:06:01.080> the<00:06:01.230> olive<00:06:01.320> oil

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
we'll slowly drizzle in the olive oil

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.530 
we'll slowly drizzle in the olive oil
it's<00:06:01.980> about<00:06:02.100> a<00:06:02.160> third<00:06:02.550> of<00:06:02.700> a<00:06:02.760> cup<00:06:02.940> of<00:06:03.090> olive<00:06:03.270> oil

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
it's about a third of a cup of olive oil

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.950 
it's about a third of a cup of olive oil
and<00:06:04.430> the<00:06:05.430> reason<00:06:05.760> why<00:06:05.910> I<00:06:05.940> like<00:06:06.240> to<00:06:06.420> pulse<00:06:06.660> it<00:06:06.840> in

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
and the reason why I like to pulse it in

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.710
