the<00:00:51.719> idea<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.949> little<00:00:53.250> device<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.890> whoo

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the idea of this little device is a whoo

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.760 
the idea of this little device is a whoo
a<00:00:55.920> cheaper<00:00:56.520> solution<00:00:56.969> than<00:00:57.420> ABS<00:00:57.930> brakes<00:00:58.289> it

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
a cheaper solution than ABS brakes it

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.209 
a cheaper solution than ABS brakes it
works<00:00:59.010> differently<00:00:59.520> than<00:00:59.609> ABS<00:01:00.120> brakes<00:01:00.449> but

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
works differently than ABS brakes but

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.189 
works differently than ABS brakes but
the<00:01:02.219> idea<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.449> can't<00:01:03.690> lock<00:01:03.989> up

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
the idea is is that you can't lock up

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.590 
the idea is is that you can't lock up
your<00:01:04.229> tires<00:01:04.619> because<00:01:05.309> we<00:01:05.610> all<00:01:05.790> know<00:01:06.060> when

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
your tires because we all know when

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.179 
your tires because we all know when
we're<00:01:06.750> going<00:01:06.900> down<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> road<00:01:07.439> if<00:01:07.710> you've

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
we're going down the road if you've

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.980 
we're going down the road if you've
ridden<00:01:08.520> very<00:01:09.210> long<00:01:09.479> at<00:01:09.659> all

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
ridden very long at all

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.690 
ridden very long at all
you've<00:01:10.799> slammed<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> brakes<00:01:11.760> before<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
you've slammed on the brakes before and

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.120 
you've slammed on the brakes before and
somebody<00:01:14.700> pulled<00:01:14.909> out<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.150> front<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.479> you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
somebody did something stupid and you've

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.469 
somebody did something stupid and you've
got<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> handful<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.860> brake<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:21.060> put<00:01:21.360> your

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.840 
what it keeps from happening is is the
caliper<00:02:03.140> locking<00:02:04.140> down<00:02:04.320> on<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.610> rotor

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
caliper locking down on the on the rotor

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.570 
caliper locking down on the on the rotor
which<00:02:06.719> when<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.200> occurs<00:02:07.619> when<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.160> does<00:02:08.340> lock

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
which when that occurs when it does lock

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.830 
which when that occurs when it does lock
down<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.060> locks<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> tires<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:10.349> lose<00:02:10.560> control

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
down it locks the tires you lose control

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.960 
down it locks the tires you lose control
this<00:02:11.989> keeps<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:12.920> from<00:02:13.099> locking<00:02:13.489> up<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.760> same

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
this keeps it from locking up the same

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.990 
this keeps it from locking up the same
idea<00:02:14.360> as<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.870> pulsing<00:02:15.550> effect<00:02:16.550> that<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:16.819> get

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
idea as the pulsing effect that you get

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.670 
idea as the pulsing effect that you get
with<00:02:17.599> ABS<00:02:18.110> brakes

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
with ABS brakes

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.710 
with ABS brakes
this<00:02:19.010> doesn't<00:02:19.370> pulse<00:02:19.610> it<00:02:19.910> just<00:02:20.180> keeps<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.540> from

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
this doesn't pulse it just keeps it from

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.690 
this doesn't pulse it just keeps it from
being<00:02:20.989> able<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.230> lock<00:02:21.440> up<00:02:21.709> but<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.400> stops

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
being able to lock up but it stops

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.550 
being able to lock up but it stops
