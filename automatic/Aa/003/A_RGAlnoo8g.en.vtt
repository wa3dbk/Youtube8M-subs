personal preference I'm a very very
recent<00:04:03.930> convert<00:04:04.739> to<00:04:05.370> brass<00:04:06.260> much<00:04:07.260> of<00:04:07.410> that

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
recent convert to brass much of that

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.559 
recent convert to brass much of that
brass<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:07.889> never<00:04:08.069> go<00:04:08.160> back<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.459> glass<00:04:08.669> as<00:04:09.030> this

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
brass you never go back to glass as this

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.619 
brass you never go back to glass as this
old<00:04:09.959> saying<00:04:10.230> goes<00:04:11.150> but<00:04:12.150> that's<00:04:12.359> mainly

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
old saying goes but that's mainly

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.020 
old saying goes but that's mainly
because<00:04:12.900> I<00:04:13.519> think<00:04:14.519> it<00:04:15.030> gives<00:04:15.180> me<00:04:15.329> more<00:04:15.569> sustain

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
because I think it gives me more sustain

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.430 
because I think it gives me more sustain
we'll<00:04:18.030> talk<00:04:18.180> about<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.450> technique<00:04:18.840> in<00:04:19.289> a

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
we'll talk about the technique in a

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.330 
we'll talk about the technique in a
little<00:04:19.650> while<00:04:20.090> but<00:04:21.410> the<00:04:22.410> idea<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.800> slide<00:04:23.160> is

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
little while but the idea of slide is

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.310 
little while but the idea of slide is
that<00:04:23.490> you're<00:04:23.610> not<00:04:23.789> actually<00:04:24.080> pressing<00:04:25.080> down

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
that you're not actually pressing down

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.740 
that you're not actually pressing down
on<00:04:25.349> the<00:04:25.590> strings<00:04:25.949> that's<00:04:26.130> one<00:04:26.430> one<00:04:27.000> main<00:04:27.330> kind

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
on the strings that's one one main kind

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.980 
on the strings that's one one main kind
of<00:04:27.840> principle<00:04:28.320> and<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:29.389> find<00:04:30.389> with<00:04:30.570> brass<00:04:30.780> that

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
of principle and I find with brass that

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.550 
of principle and I find with brass that
you<00:04:31.110> don't<00:04:31.380> need<00:04:31.740> to<00:04:31.800> push<00:04:32.310> in<00:04:32.580> as<00:04:33.539> much<00:04:34.320> you

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
you don't need to push in as much you

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.290 
you don't need to push in as much you
kind<00:04:35.099> of<00:04:35.190> need<00:04:35.370> to<00:04:35.400> put<00:04:35.639> a<00:04:35.669> little<00:04:35.849> bit<00:04:35.970> fresh

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
kind of need to put a little bit fresh

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.890 
kind of need to put a little bit fresh
one<00:04:36.479> on<00:04:37.010> glass

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
one on glass

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.230 
one on glass
so<00:04:39.110> get<00:04:39.260> sustained<00:04:39.710> only<00:04:40.520> a<00:04:40.580> tiny<00:04:40.790> bit<00:04:40.940> there's

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
so get sustained only a tiny bit there's

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.330 
so get sustained only a tiny bit there's
not<00:04:41.360> really<00:04:41.540> much<00:04:41.720> in<00:04:41.780> it<00:04:42.110> but<00:04:42.260> this<00:04:42.949> is<00:04:43.130> quite

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
not really much in it but this is quite

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.540 
not really much in it but this is quite
a<00:04:43.370> heavy<00:04:43.940> this<00:04:44.449> is<00:04:44.510> a<00:04:44.630> heavy<00:04:45.050> brass<00:04:45.350> slide<00:04:46.100> and

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
a heavy this is a heavy brass slide and

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.659 
a heavy this is a heavy brass slide and
it's<00:04:49.550> probably<00:04:49.970> designed<00:04:51.130> for<00:04:52.130> use<00:04:52.340> on<00:04:52.490> the

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
it's probably designed for use on the

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.260 
it's probably designed for use on the
third<00:04:53.510> finger<00:04:54.370> this<00:04:55.370> is<00:04:55.430> another<00:04:55.790> thing<00:04:56.090> as

well you see slide players some will use

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.400 
well you see slide players some will use

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
their their full finger put the slide on

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.590 
their their full finger put the slide on
a<00:05:00.440> full<00:05:00.680> finger<00:05:01.130> some<00:05:01.669> use<00:05:01.850> a<00:05:01.880> third<00:05:02.210> some<00:05:02.510> will

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
a full finger some use a third some will

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.170 
a full finger some use a third some will
even<00:05:02.660> use<00:05:02.810> their<00:05:03.080> second<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:06.699> again<00:05:07.699> that's

even use their second and again that's
just<00:05:08.300> down<00:05:08.510> to<00:05:08.630> personal<00:05:08.810> preference<00:05:09.580> one<00:05:10.580> of

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
just down to personal preference one of

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.310 
just down to personal preference one of
the<00:05:10.760> benefits<00:05:11.240> of<00:05:11.389> using<00:05:11.510> your<00:05:11.690> full<00:05:11.900> finger

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
the benefits of using your full finger

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.560 
the benefits of using your full finger
is<00:05:12.500> that<00:05:12.830> you've<00:05:12.979> got<00:05:13.220> these<00:05:13.400> three<00:05:14.330> fingers

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
is that you've got these three fingers

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.680 
is that you've got these three fingers
free<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.280> play<00:05:16.280> chords<00:05:16.610> if<00:05:16.940> you<00:05:17.030> so<00:05:17.240> wish<00:05:17.479> but

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
free to play chords if you so wish but

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.020 
free to play chords if you so wish but
you<00:05:17.720> can<00:05:17.870> also<00:05:18.020> do<00:05:18.290> that<00:05:18.700> if<00:05:19.700> you've<00:05:19.850> got<00:05:20.000> a

you can also do that if you've got a

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.240 
you can also do that if you've got a
slide<00:05:20.300> on<00:05:20.330> your<00:05:20.540> third<00:05:20.750> finger<00:05:21.020> so<00:05:21.410> again

different thicknesses obviously now I

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.990 
different thicknesses obviously now I
quite<00:06:35.090> like<00:06:35.419> to<00:06:35.450> be<00:06:36.020> able<00:06:36.169> to<00:06:36.380> see<00:06:37.190> the<00:06:37.520> end<00:06:37.729> of

quite like to be able to see the end of
my<00:06:38.060> full<00:06:38.960> finger<00:06:39.470> because<00:06:39.889> that<00:06:40.039> helps<00:06:40.400> you

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
my full finger because that helps you

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.460 
my full finger because that helps you
gauge<00:06:40.700> your<00:06:41.150> pitching<00:06:41.630> so<00:06:41.930> and<00:06:42.229> that's

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 
gauge your pitching so and that's

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.290 
gauge your pitching so and that's
another<00:06:42.680> thing<00:06:42.919> to<00:06:43.039> consider<00:06:43.220> is<00:06:43.550> the<00:06:43.910> length

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
another thing to consider is the length

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.270 
another thing to consider is the length
of<00:06:44.510> it<00:06:44.660> because<00:06:45.440> you're<00:06:45.530> not<00:06:45.680> always<00:06:45.919> you're

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
of it because you're not always you're

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.890 
of it because you're not always you're
not<00:06:46.430> going<00:06:46.580> to<00:06:46.639> be<00:06:46.760> kind<00:06:47.030> of<00:06:47.090> barring<00:06:47.539> all<00:06:47.719> the

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
not going to be kind of barring all the

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.430 
not going to be kind of barring all the
way<00:06:48.020> across<00:06:48.289> the<00:06:48.469> fretboard

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
way across the fretboard

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.100 
way across the fretboard
all<00:06:49.530> the<00:06:49.710> time<00:06:50.510> so<00:06:51.510> that's<00:06:51.630> the<00:06:51.750> first<00:06:51.960> thing

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
all the time so that's the first thing

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.230 
all the time so that's the first thing
to<00:06:52.290> consider<00:06:52.410> is<00:06:52.890> you<00:06:53.550> know<00:06:53.670> try<00:06:53.910> out<00:06:53.940> a<00:06:54.120> few

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
to consider is you know try out a few

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.180 
to consider is you know try out a few
different<00:06:54.500> varieties<00:06:55.500> of<00:06:55.530> my<00:06:55.710> friends<00:06:56.130> that
