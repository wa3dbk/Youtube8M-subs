00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.130
 a tonic sound 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.080
 the mitotic spindle in one of the 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.450
 most important structures that 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:18.240
 participate in the process of mitosis 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.029
 as we will remember is a process of 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.450
 cell division in that from a 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.550
 exactly two cells are formed 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.550
 equal in their genetic endowment 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.490
 for this it is necessary in the first place 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.310
 a process of material replication 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.700
 genetic in this way for each 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.010
 chromosome there will be two identical copies 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.070
 of information called chromatic 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.550
 sisters 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.579
 later in the division process 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.129
 these fast ones will separate and each one 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.829
 will look towards one of the poles of the 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:01.200
 cell so that in the two cells 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.200
 daughters there is the same genetic endowment 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.720
 one of the fundamental stages of the 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.900
 mitosis is the phase 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.990
 this is the stage in which chromatic 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.270
 sisters are separated to go to form the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.549
 two new series 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.280
 for this to happen is necessary in 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.229
 first place that the chromosomes are 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.079
 locate in the equatorial plane of the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.000
 cells oriented with a chromatin 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:31.790
 sister towards each of the poles 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.030
 in this way chromatics can be 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.650
 separated by the middle and each one can 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.500
 migrate to a different mode 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.280
 this will ensure not only that every cell 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.860
 have the same number of chromatics but 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.540
 that also these chromatic have the same 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.630
 identity 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.030
 that is to say and 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.969
 both daughter cells will have exactly 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.009
 the same genome between them and at the same time 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.009
 the same genome as the mother cell 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.079
 and this process can occur correctly 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.470
 involving a necessary 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:12.080
 structure called mitotic course 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.960
 the mitotic spindle in terms of its 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.550
 molecular structure corresponds to a 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.550
 molecule called micro tune 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.410
 the microtubules are a part 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.010
 important of what we know as a site 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.920
 skeleton is to say a protein fiber 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.010
 which will have major importance in 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.390
 give shape and support to the series 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:43.500
 will be built from monomers a 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.319
 protein called tubulin which will go 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.430
 joining one to another to form 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:53.660
 finally a long and thick thread and 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.510
 with form the micro tour 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.460
 the microtubules in the cells are 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.920
 they organize from a center 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.260
 micro tour organizer formed 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.980
 mainly by bed tuning 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.460
 the center inside contains two 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.670
 structures called centers 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.750
 which participate in the training of 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.750
 all hard books 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.120
 the totality of microtubules that 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.610
 they fulfill some function in the cell 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.950
 will have its origin in this center 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.620
 organizers and from this one 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.510
 will begin to synthesize it towards the 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.959
 periphery 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.810
 in the case also of the mitotic spindle of 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.510
 so that in a cell in mitosis there will be 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.659
 a microtubule organizing center in 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.610
 each of the poles so that the envelope 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.930
 the topical clip may emerge from there 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.930
 towards the equatorial plane 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.359
 we realize then that during the 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:57.040
 mitosis the mitotic spindle will fulfill 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:04:00.250
 mainly with three functions 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.810
 as stated above it will originate from 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.719
 a microtubule organizing center 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.939
 that will be in each of the poles 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:10.240
 therefore there will be two centers 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:14.220
 organizers synthesizing michetti 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.730
 and this will be mainly of three types 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.280
 first the mitotic spindle 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.250
 promotional in this indicator figure in 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:27.620
 celestial color will be the one that joins 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.680
 directly to the chromatic brothers 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.680
 in this way when the mitotic spindle 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.590
 chromosomes contract and turn towards 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.590
 the chromatic organizers 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.340
 they will separate and migrate towards 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.340
 different poles 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.580
 however there are also two others 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.249
 types of microtubules that have great 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.339
 importance 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:53.649
 first interpolate is in 

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:56.289
 this figure are indicated in color 

00:04:53.649 --> 00:05:00.160
 orange tree that will have the function of 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:03.880
 slide one over the other 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.220
 will help the lengthening of the cell already 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.710
 have to push the poles to be 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.260
 move away from each other 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:15.460
 besides this they will have special function 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.580
 the astral mystic uses indicated in 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.479
 this figure in green 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.909
 and will grow towards the periphery pushing 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.370
 the membrane of the cell and making it 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:29.680
 grow sideways favoring 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:33.550
 also the stretching of these 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.310
 in this way at the time of separating 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.070
 two daughter cells already exist at a 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.759
 important distance between both cores 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:45.490
 that will allow the partition of the cell 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:48.780
 in half without damaging any of the 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.780
 structures that compose it
