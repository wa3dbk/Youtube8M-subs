00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.470
 of eros is an engine prototype 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.980
 rotary endothermic which has obtained i 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.050
 European and international Italian pct 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.539
 the invention has two power take-offs 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.160
 that allow it to be connected either 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.160
 right-handed and left-handed 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.540
 two lids enclose all the 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.540
 engine components in one body 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.350
 under the cover a copper membrane 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.800
 isolates the part lubricated by the oil from 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.180
 the central one containing the rotors the 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.280
 operating system of the 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.930
 shutters that touch the surface 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.870
 of the rotors reducing to the minimum the 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.270
 friction allows the rotors to work 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.860
 completely dry 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.110
 the motor develops at the same time 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.020
 two complete work cycles 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.950
 opposite each half turn then 4 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.950
 expansions around 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.400
 for clarity we can divide each 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.000
 work cycle in nine phases in the first 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.670
 phase 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.800
 the air coming from the turbine 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.750
 highlighted in blue enters the engine 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.200
 from both titles through the two 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.200
 pipelines 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.930
 in the second phase the rotation of the two 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.070
 External rotors compress the air making 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.210
 compressed air b highlighted in blue 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.580
 when the air pressure b 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.979
 tablet exceeds air pressure 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.290
 contained in the inlet tube the valve 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.290
 a plate opens up to let it flow 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.550
 the compressed air is then 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.740
 stored in the upper chamber 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:11.840
 of the mushroom loading valve in the 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.300
 fourth phase as soon as the valve opens 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.490
 one side and the compressed air escapes 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.680
 from the crack that is created between the base 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.850
 of the oven and the rotor nose in 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.950
 movement 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.020
 air b compressed flowing along the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.810
 central rotor throat provides for 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.090
 exhaust gas cleaning in the fifth 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.880
 phase the base of the furnace is occluded 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.380
 completely from the rotor nose 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.410
 this allows the accumulation of the area v 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.240
 tablet inside the oven in the 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.490
 sixth phase as soon as the valve is 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.040
 closes the first injector sprays the 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.470
 fuel in the oven and immediately after 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.980
 the spark that causes it is triggered 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.980
 the first outbreak 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.250
 at this point the glowing air 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.380
 highlighted in red pours into the 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.590
 central rotor providing a strong one 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.840
 thrust when the hump of the rotor 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.090
 central discovers the second injector 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.590
 the fuel is sprayed 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.760
 car lights up because of the high 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.380
 temperature 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.600
 the second outbreak increases considerably 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.790
 the pushing pressure 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.830
 in the last phase the incandescent area ad 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.989
 high pressure shown in yellow 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.360
 it is conveyed to the exhaust pipe 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.880
 by rotating the central rotor 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.930
 and hot gas and impression are 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.930
 conveyed to the turbine 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.770
 the pia roast motor uses three 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.390
 oil circuits to guarantee a 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.970
 correct lubrication of parts a 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.350
 contact and at the same time cool 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.380
 the parts most subject to the high 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.380
 temperatures 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.320
 in the first circuit the oil enters the two 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.900
 tanks placed at the top 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.330
 lower part of the engine crossing it 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.600
 transversely so as to contribute to the 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.700
 central rotor cooling in the 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.340
 second circuit the oil provides to 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.270
 internal rotor cooling 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.670
 entering from one side in the part 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.120
 upper and protruding from the bottom 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.100
 opposite part as shown in the figure 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.530
 in the third circuit 3 sprayers 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.650
 spray the shutters with oil so as to 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.630
 cool them lubricate the oil continues 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.730
 his path and is expelled from the 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.500
 exhaust channel located in the part 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.500
