00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 on 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.140
 Servus people and welcome to one 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.600
 another video here on a channel 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:20.189
 today I will show you as you do 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.320
 Buy cinema 4d for free and legally 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.960
 the whole thing works though 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.490
 only if he is student or student since it 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.159
 But it does not matter whether from Germany 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.970
 Austria Switzerland or other 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:35.790
 Countries come most countries 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:42.420
 So work okay, we are looking at 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.250
 those times on the website of maxim so 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.550
 Here we go on order and on the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.350
 students version logically here 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.870
 We have the system requirements license 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.000
 server so skillless things skillfully through 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.910
 the functions of cinema 4d of the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.780
 I look at the new version 11 14 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.490
 unfortunately in English there are two 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.680
 I have to say it right away 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.289
 gives the free version 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.880
 and there are students and teachers 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:10.049
 version 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.799
 that means you have the advantages here 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:18.619
 that you are rendering the network here 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.869
 you can use serial numbers 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.329
 series nomen dependent plugins you have 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.560
 the support of x-oom and he gets the 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:29.249
 discounts on the updates yes the whole 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.799
 I think you need a student 

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:34.740
 not the way the version 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:39.399
 then suddenly mine for three years 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:43.340
 18 months so one and a half years 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:46.100
 and he gets the complete 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.170
 scope of services of cinema 4d studio 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.850
 except network rendering 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.289
 which he probably would not do anyway 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.020
 will ask because I do not appreciate 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.869
 that he has more than one pc or 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.170
 several connected pcs and like her 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.219
 you can see is the cinema 4d studio the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.390
 best version so the most expensive 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:09.200
 I do not know exactly how much 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.209
 In any case , it costs you number four 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.530
 are very good product not only for 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.450
 Beginner so above all for 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.010
 advanced 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.840
 So now he clicks here and you 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.790
 Forgets to do likewise for free 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.590
 you want to choose your country yes 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.450
 some where it works as I said 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.940
 switzerland austria and germany must 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.579
 It of course we give course because 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.410
 many more so if it is a country 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:39.980
 not here then click here 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:41.599
 check your local distribution exactly 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.299
 I do not know what's going on, so I want to go on 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.000
 times in my case Austria click out 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.410
 on further then this one has the 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.489
 Data protection 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.769

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.660
 everything already done 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.920

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.050
 enter 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.150
 that means here creates a new here 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.260
 account so it would not have one 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.420

 I have ten different teachers 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.709
 endanger or less and then you have to 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.709
 You still 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.730
 yes I think that's actually 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.910
 everything that may indicate would have to be 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.370

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.420
 not that you can believe me everything 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.790
 choose voluntarily 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:36.860

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:38.930
 few days to have the looked at 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.270
