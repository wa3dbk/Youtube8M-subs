00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.740
 test in this tutorial is going to be this 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:21.270
 heart that you see here 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.990
 favorite because this heart attends 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.910
 truly improvised but they all download 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.460
 I will teach everything as the system ready 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:35.960
 and Maria gave the look they saw this is a 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.370
 mario's attempt that did not go to case 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.530
 we're even going to start with this 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.199
 tutorial 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.500
 the first thing that makes this heart 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.740
 Lets put 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.730
 2 here the two 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.730
 and how do you see it 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:02.080
 50 inches we put 2 up red 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.080
 next we put black 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.770

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.820
 red red 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.060
 that's so it looks pixelated and everything 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.060
 that 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.900
 and we put another one like 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.149
 and those that that thing that is 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:41.550
 by day and is in case it also failed in the 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:43.890

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.180
 before the new trains and we do the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.909
 quarter 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:53.469
 so easy and it was taught 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.469
 because the heart 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.180
 and good to continue everything to follow 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.630

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:33.319

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.450
 little black box 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:28.360
 easy and simple to not be a 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:36.390
 sculpture that put so adornment or something 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:36.390
 So simple with 50 block shapes 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:49.079
 so good 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:51.880
