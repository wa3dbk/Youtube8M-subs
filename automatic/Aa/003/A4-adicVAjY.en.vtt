00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
waxing so I actually haven't gotten my

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.039 
waxing so I actually haven't gotten my
brows<00:01:16.320> done<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.890> quite<00:01:17.729> some<00:01:18.030> time<00:01:18.330> me<00:01:18.509> but<00:01:18.720> I'm

brows done in quite some time me but I'm

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.810 
brows done in quite some time me but I'm
trying<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.380> grow<00:01:19.560> them<00:01:19.740> out<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> bit<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.520> well

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
trying to grow them out a bit as well

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.580 
trying to grow them out a bit as well
because<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.600> feel<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:21.990> they<00:01:22.170> look<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.439> little

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
because I feel like they look a little

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.469 
because I feel like they look a little
bit<00:01:22.799> thin<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.729> don't<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:24.030> like<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
bit thin and I don't really like the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.620 
bit thin and I don't really like the
shape<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.869> my<00:01:25.049> brows<00:01:25.290> um<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:26.220> would<00:01:26.610> prefer<00:01:27.119> if<00:01:27.479> I

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
shape of my brows um I would prefer if I

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.569 
shape of my brows um I would prefer if I
have<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> little<00:01:28.170> bit<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.619> higher<00:01:28.860> arch<00:01:29.189> brow

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
