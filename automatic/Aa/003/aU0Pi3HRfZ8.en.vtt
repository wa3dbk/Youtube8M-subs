00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.680 
oh the music is pretty loud and it's
drowning<00:02:12.500> out<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.769> narration<00:02:13.660> actually<00:02:14.660> I

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
drowning out the narration actually I

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.809 
drowning out the narration actually I
find<00:02:14.959> that<00:02:15.140> music<00:02:15.500> in<00:02:15.680> general<00:02:16.040> always<00:02:16.580> seems

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
find that music in general always seems

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.789 
find that music in general always seems
to<00:02:16.910> be<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.120> little<00:02:17.480> too<00:02:17.720> loud<00:02:17.959> when<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.230> first<00:02:18.530> add

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
to be a little too loud when I first add

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.370 
to be a little too loud when I first add
it<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.190> timeline<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:20.630> I<00:02:20.660> typically<00:02:21.140> like

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
it to the timeline so I typically like

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.880 
it to the timeline so I typically like
to<00:02:21.410> reduce<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.010> volume<00:02:22.310> of<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.610> entire<00:02:22.940> track

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
to reduce the volume of the entire track

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.559 
to reduce the volume of the entire track

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
should do it

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.420

and find the point where I want the
music<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.300> start<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.690> get<00:02:54.780> quieter<00:02:55.550> which<00:02:56.550> is

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
music to start to get quieter which is

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.450 
music to start to get quieter which is
right<00:02:57.090> about<00:02:57.270> here<00:02:57.830> that's<00:02:58.830> where<00:02:59.070> I<00:02:59.100> want<00:02:59.340> to

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
right about here that's where I want to

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.390 
right about here that's where I want to
add<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.820> first<00:03:00.000> audio<00:03:00.510> point<00:03:01.100> again<00:03:02.100> like

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
add the first audio point again like

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.850 
add the first audio point again like
we've<00:03:02.550> seen<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:02.970> previous<00:03:03.150> videos<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:04.500> do<00:03:04.650> that

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
we've seen in previous videos to do that

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.750 
we've seen in previous videos to do that
right<00:03:05.610> click<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.090> choose<00:03:06.360> add<00:03:06.600> audio<00:03:07.080> point

next<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:08.850> have<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.180> add<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.330> second<00:03:09.960> audio<00:03:10.230> point

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
next I have to add a second audio point

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.680 
next I have to add a second audio point
one<00:03:11.220> that<00:03:11.430> will<00:03:11.550> let<00:03:11.730> me<00:03:11.850> transition<00:03:12.540> the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
one that will let me transition the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.650 
one that will let me transition the
volume<00:03:13.020> level<00:03:13.350> I'll<00:03:13.670> add<00:03:14.670> that<00:03:14.850> point<00:03:15.150> here

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
volume level I'll add that point here

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.680 
volume level I'll add that point here
and<00:03:16.070> then<00:03:17.070> drag<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.520> down<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.760> here<00:03:18.270> or<00:03:18.450> so

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
and then drag it down to here or so

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.300 
and then drag it down to here or so
which<00:03:19.530> should<00:03:19.740> be<00:03:19.860> quiet<00:03:20.130> enough<00:03:21.890> to<00:03:22.890> review

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
which should be quiet enough to review

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.730 
which should be quiet enough to review
we<00:03:23.730> just<00:03:23.970> added<00:03:24.180> two<00:03:24.570> separate<00:03:25.050> audio<00:03:25.320> points

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
we just added two separate audio points

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.670 
we just added two separate audio points
and<00:03:25.890> drop<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.850> volume<00:03:27.000> from<00:03:27.480> one<00:03:27.720> point<00:03:27.990> to

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
and drop the volume from one point to

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.559 
and drop the volume from one point to
the<00:03:28.710> next<00:03:29.120> now<00:03:30.120> let's<00:03:30.330> listen<00:03:30.480> again

ah<00:03:40.870> very<00:03:41.870> nice<00:03:42.110> if<00:03:42.819> I<00:03:43.819> scroll<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.390> right

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
ah very nice if I scroll to the right

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.390 
ah very nice if I scroll to the right
you'll<00:03:44.900> see<00:03:44.989> that<00:03:45.349> the<00:03:45.440> song<00:03:45.650> maintains<00:03:46.160> that

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
you'll see that the song maintains that

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.059 
you'll see that the song maintains that
low<00:03:46.640> volume<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.300> rest<00:03:47.510> of<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.750> way<00:03:48.069> that

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
low volume the rest of the way that

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.040 
low volume the rest of the way that
could<00:03:49.220> work<00:03:49.370> although<00:03:49.670> I<00:03:50.360> think<00:03:50.510> I<00:03:50.870> would

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
could work although I think I would

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.290 
could work although I think I would
rather<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.500> song<00:03:51.739> fade<00:03:52.099> out<00:03:52.250> completely<00:03:52.300> at

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
rather the song fade out completely at

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.620 
rather the song fade out completely at
the<00:03:53.660> end<00:03:54.220> this<00:03:55.220> is<00:03:55.430> as<00:03:55.550> easy<00:03:55.700> as<00:03:56.000> clicking<00:03:56.269> the

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
the end this is as easy as clicking the

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.710 
the end this is as easy as clicking the
fade-out<00:03:57.019> button<00:03:57.560> in<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:57.950> Audio<00:03:58.220> tab<00:03:58.599> see<00:03:59.599> how

it<00:03:59.840> fades<00:04:00.019> to<00:04:00.260> silence<00:04:00.410> now<00:04:00.800> let's<00:04:01.670> listen<00:04:01.849> one

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
it fades to silence now let's listen one

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.480 
it fades to silence now let's listen one
last<00:04:02.569> time

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.910 

for<00:04:06.300> this<00:04:06.390> demonstration<00:04:06.690> let's<00:04:07.320> just

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
for this demonstration let's just

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.100 
for this demonstration let's just
perform<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.520> simple<00:04:08.910> subtraction<00:04:09.090> problem

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.620 

perfect<00:04:14.340> well<00:04:15.340> that's<00:04:15.940> all<00:04:16.120> for<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.359> audio

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
perfect well that's all for the audio

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.199 
perfect well that's all for the audio
series<00:04:17.019> but<00:04:17.829> before<00:04:18.160> I<00:04:18.190> go<00:04:18.489> I<00:04:18.729> want<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.090> give

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
series but before I go I want to give
