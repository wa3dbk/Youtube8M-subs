trestle<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.410> tied<00:00:40.710> into<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.160> mainline

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
trestle that tied into the mainline

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.180 
trestle that tied into the mainline
probably<00:00:42.719> been<00:00:42.899> closed<00:00:43.260> for<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:44.239> would<00:00:45.239> say

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
probably been closed for I would say

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.770 
probably been closed for I would say
probably<00:00:47.190> 70<00:00:47.879> or<00:00:48.090> 80<00:00:48.660> years<00:00:48.809> anyways<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:50.780> they

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
probably 70 or 80 years anyways but they

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.569 
probably 70 or 80 years anyways but they
didn't<00:00:52.050> tear<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.260> out<00:00:52.469> which<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.280> what<00:00:53.460> they

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
didn't tear it out which is what they

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.709 
didn't tear it out which is what they
would<00:00:53.760> usually<00:00:53.910> do<00:00:55.940> they've<00:00:56.940> cleaned<00:00:57.300> out<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
would usually do they've cleaned out the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.630 
would usually do they've cleaned out the
access<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.620> little<00:00:58.770> bit<00:00:58.949> easier<00:00:58.980> to

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
access so it's a little bit easier to

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.910 
access so it's a little bit easier to
get<00:01:00.420> at<00:01:01.070> but<00:01:02.510> you<00:01:03.510> know<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> nice<00:01:03.920> railroad

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
get at but you know a nice railroad

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.080 
get at but you know a nice railroad
trestle<00:01:05.960> that<00:01:09.920> all<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.100> local<00:01:11.430> artists<00:01:11.909> like

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
trestle that all the local artists like

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.910 
trestle that all the local artists like
to<00:01:13.130> do<00:01:14.130> their<00:01:14.310> handiwork<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:15.650> they've<00:01:16.650> used

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
to do their handiwork on they've used

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.789 
to do their handiwork on they've used
some<00:01:17.040> nice<00:01:18.200> fluorescent<00:01:19.200> colors<00:01:20.570> and

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
some nice fluorescent colors and

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.929 
some nice fluorescent colors and
actually<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.920> last<00:01:23.520> time<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.790> was<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.060> here<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.310 

railroad<00:01:27.939> ties<00:01:28.090> were<00:01:28.329> on<00:01:28.509> the<00:01:28.720> ties<00:01:28.960> but

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
railroad ties were on the ties but

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.810 
railroad ties were on the ties but
they're<00:01:29.500> now<00:01:29.649> gone<00:01:29.920> so<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:30.189> makes<00:01:30.369> it<00:01:30.460> easier

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
they're now gone so it makes it easier

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.899 
they're now gone so it makes it easier
to<00:01:31.030> walk<00:01:31.270> on<00:01:31.540> it<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.920> fishermen<00:01:36.430> blow<00:01:36.700> me

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
to walk on it so fishermen blow me

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.920 
to walk on it so fishermen blow me
watching<00:01:37.810> me<00:01:38.110> video<00:01:39.390> kind<00:01:40.390> of<00:01:40.450> walking<00:01:40.840> across

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
watching me video kind of walking across

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.169 
watching me video kind of walking across
the<00:01:41.350> trestle<00:01:41.619> here<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:44.580> take<00:01:45.580> it<00:01:45.610> into<00:01:45.850> where

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
the trestle here and take it into where

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.300 
the trestle here and take it into where
the<00:01:46.330> main<00:01:46.509> line<00:01:46.750> is<00:01:48.390> CSX<00:01:49.390> runs<00:01:49.659> on<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:51.130> main

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
the main line is CSX runs on the main

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:59.969 
the main line is CSX runs on the main
line<00:01:51.549> now<00:01:58.200> I'm<00:01:59.200> sure<00:01:59.440> this<00:01:59.619> is<00:01:59.770> a<00:01:59.799> great

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
line now I'm sure this is a great

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.210 
line now I'm sure this is a great
hangout<00:02:00.549> for<00:02:00.789> locals<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:02.350> see<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:03.039> local

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
hangout for locals to see the local

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.809 
hangout for locals to see the local
artists<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:04.350> it's<00:02:05.350> interesting<00:02:05.619> that<00:02:05.860> here's

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
artists and it's interesting that here's

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:12.350 
artists and it's interesting that here's
a<00:02:06.880> good<00:02:07.090> example<00:02:08.280> they'd<00:02:09.280> like<00:02:09.549> to<00:02:09.729> use

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.309 

fluorescent<00:02:13.360> paint<00:02:13.540> which<00:02:13.840> makes<00:02:14.140> it

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
fluorescent paint which makes it

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.210 
fluorescent paint which makes it
interesting

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.789 

so<00:02:18.220> maybe<00:02:18.760> Josh<00:02:19.090> will<00:02:19.330> see<00:02:19.510> this<00:02:19.799> YouTube

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
so maybe Josh will see this YouTube

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.780 
so maybe Josh will see this YouTube
video<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.459> see<00:02:22.420> its<00:02:22.540> name<00:02:22.720> in<00:02:22.900> lights
