is<00:00:30.380> it<00:00:30.410> for<00:00:30.529> firefighters<00:00:31.310> when<00:00:31.910> they<00:00:32.029> turn<00:00:32.210> up

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
is it for firefighters when they turn up

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.120 
is it for firefighters when they turn up
to<00:00:32.599> events<00:00:33.350> like<00:00:33.380> this<00:00:33.590> they've<00:00:33.800> had<00:00:33.950> their

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
to events like this they've had their

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.729 
to events like this they've had their
training<00:00:34.610> and<00:00:34.760> they<00:00:35.420> know<00:00:35.570> how<00:00:35.600> to<00:00:35.780> deal<00:00:36.710> with

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
training and they know how to deal with

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.440 
training and they know how to deal with
fires<00:00:37.130> and<00:00:37.399> a<00:00:37.430> half<00:00:37.640> deal<00:00:37.850> with<00:00:38.000> casualties

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
fires and a half deal with casualties

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.600 
fires and a half deal with casualties
but<00:00:38.750> presumably<00:00:39.290> these<00:00:39.650> kind<00:00:39.950> of<00:00:40.070> scenes<00:00:40.340> is

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
but presumably these kind of scenes is

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.540 
but presumably these kind of scenes is
very<00:00:40.910> difficult<00:00:41.480> for<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:42.290> firefighters

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
very difficult for the firefighters

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.640 
very difficult for the firefighters
