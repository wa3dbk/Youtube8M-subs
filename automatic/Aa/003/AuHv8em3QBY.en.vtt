let's do let's do second part of the
boysson<00:02:49.720> trailer

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
boysson trailer

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.580 
boysson trailer
it's<00:02:52.480> basically<00:02:52.960> six<00:02:53.710> cars<00:02:54.450> but<00:02:55.470> there<00:02:56.470> is

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
it's basically six cars but there is

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.580 
it's basically six cars but there is
some<00:02:56.800> possibility<00:02:57.280> that<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:57.820> can<00:02:57.970> put<00:02:58.590> seven

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
some possibility that you can put seven

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.970 
some possibility that you can put seven
on<00:02:59.830> it<00:03:00.310> if<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.330> will<00:03:01.540> put<00:03:01.990> some<00:03:02.230> small<00:03:02.500> one<00:03:02.770> on

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
on it if you will put some small one on

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.600 
on it if you will put some small one on
the<00:03:03.070> belly<00:03:03.340> of<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:04.720> trailer<00:03:05.140> so<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:06.070> will

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
the belly of the trailer so you will

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.360 
the belly of the trailer so you will
have<00:03:06.760> one<00:03:07.000> here<00:03:07.360> another<00:03:07.570> one<00:03:08.040> third<00:03:09.040> one

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
have one here another one third one

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.390 
have one here another one third one
fourth<00:03:10.410> fifth<00:03:11.410> six<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.520> seven<00:03:12.970> but<00:03:13.720> but

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
fourth fifth six and seven but but

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.090 
fourth fifth six and seven but but
usually<00:03:15.400> we<00:03:15.520> are<00:03:15.610> putting<00:03:15.880> six<00:03:16.330> on<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:17.100> just

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
usually we are putting six on it just

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.550 
usually we are putting six on it just
because<00:03:18.460> of<00:03:18.640> weight<00:03:18.910> we<00:03:19.360> don't<00:03:19.930> want<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.350> be

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
because of weight we don't want to be

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.330 
because of weight we don't want to be
over<00:03:21.160> weighted<00:03:24.210> so<00:03:25.210> not<00:03:25.480> much<00:03:25.720> rust<00:03:26.170> at<00:03:27.100> all

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
over weighted so not much rust at all

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.230 
over weighted so not much rust at all
just<00:03:27.820> some<00:03:28.320> some<00:03:29.320> regular<00:03:29.980> grass<00:03:30.880> maybe

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
just some some regular grass maybe

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.700 
just some some regular grass maybe
because<00:03:31.750> of

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.320 

because<00:03:37.710> it's<00:03:37.860> old<00:03:38.070> it's<00:03:38.490> not<00:03:38.580> bring<00:03:38.940> new<00:03:39.120> one

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
because it's old it's not bring new one

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.730 
because it's old it's not bring new one
but<00:03:40.230> overall<00:03:41.750> everything<00:03:42.750> is<00:03:42.900> good<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:43.170> rails

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
but overall everything is good so rails

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.940 
but overall everything is good so rails
