special<00:01:35.070> at<00:01:35.520> chemists<00:01:36.180> warehouse<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.990> think<00:01:37.140> it

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
special at chemists warehouse I think it

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.560 
special at chemists warehouse I think it
was<00:01:37.320> like<00:01:37.470> for<00:01:37.770> four<00:01:38.430> dollars<00:01:38.579> four<00:01:39.240> or<00:01:39.390> five

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
was like for four dollars four or five

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.690 
was like for four dollars four or five
dollars<00:01:40.009> so<00:01:41.009> if<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.280> someone<00:01:41.490> who<00:01:41.610> has

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
dollars so if you have someone who has

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.389 
dollars so if you have someone who has
curly<00:01:42.090> hair<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.810> would<00:01:43.500> suggest<00:01:43.920> using<00:01:44.220> this

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
curly hair I would suggest using this

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.770 
curly hair I would suggest using this
because<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.729> usually<00:01:44.909> straighten<00:01:45.630> my<00:01:45.750> hair

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
because I usually straighten my hair

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.730 
because I usually straighten my hair
I've<00:01:46.079> got<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> GHD<00:01:46.890> straightener<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.960> had<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> I

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
I've got a GHD straightener I had a I

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.859 
I've got a GHD straightener I had a I
think<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.189> Tresemme<00:01:50.759> heat<00:01:51.090> protectant<00:01:51.810> spray

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
think a Tresemme heat protectant spray

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.530 
think a Tresemme heat protectant spray
that's<00:01:52.380> crack<00:01:52.680> didn't<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:53.729> anything<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:54.360> this

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
that's crack didn't do anything but this

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.609 
that's crack didn't do anything but this
is<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.200> spray<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:55.530> each

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
is like you have to spray it in each

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.170 
is like you have to spray it in each
section<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.399> going<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.640> take<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.000> bit

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
section so it is going to take a bit

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.280 
section so it is going to take a bit
longer<00:01:57.210> um<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.079> my<00:01:58.409> hair<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.899> pass<00:02:00.899> I
