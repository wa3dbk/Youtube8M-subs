 costa rica is plenty of fresh coconut 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.360

 extra virgin cold pressed and 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.039
 when we leave that country. 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:49.530

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.059
 access to these wonderful products 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.010

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.570
 coconut which has been a 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:09.000

 skin and that means you do not 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.700
 longer have to choose between creams and 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:49.000
 lotions filled with chemical components 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.220
 all that's wrong 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.299
 What you're only looking for coconut oil 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.519

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.230
 skin to hit takes the number 4 other 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.980
 use for coconut oil is 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.989
 buchicho or is the pollen is simply 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.519
 rinse your mouth or rinse some 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.000
 times with coconut oil this is a 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.980
 age-old practice for your health 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.519

 tea with the cast is good for health 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.889
 we know that there are many partnerships 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:24.069
 so on the back some close the eye on 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.879
 same area you would do with a vowel 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.639
 something 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:31.060
 the batteries will stick in the strange look 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.950
 When you look I play it's perfect for 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.920
 this the porter also you acid 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:40.299
 lauric virus kills bacteria and fungi 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.940
 is not related to the mining of the number 5 that 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.099
 it may be a bit surprising plus the 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.049
 Coconut oil helps in weight loss is 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.819
 That's right, I know it's difficult. 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.040
 accept the idea that an oil 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.199
 can help someone lose weight but already 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.209
 it has been proven that coconut oil reduces 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.750
 hunger and so it may be that you eat 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.069
 any less 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.290
 Furthermore if you want to end 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.500
 that sweet desire of the moment 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.479
 in when it comes take a tablespoon of 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.489
 extra virgin coconut oil 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:08.590
 coconut oil contains chains and 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.840
 large medium and short 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.370
 they have proven to reduce 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.530
 overweight 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.139
 it also helps digestion in the function 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.940
 thyroid and an endocrine system 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.739
 one of the facts hide or on oil of 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.960
 coconut is that it is speeding up our 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.910
 metabolism because it is no longer 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.060
 this also results in the paranÃ¡ 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.620

 we have heard this question several times and 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.590
 we always advise the same thing as 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.300
 you buy an extra organic version 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.820
 virgin and thoughtful and cold 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.100
 the extra virgin version is not hydrogen and 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.080
 is not hydrogenated does not have cholesterol 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.720
 nor does it change trance as a general rule 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.720
 always look at the packaging of products with 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.680
