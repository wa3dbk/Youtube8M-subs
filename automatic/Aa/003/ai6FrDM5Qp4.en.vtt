first<00:04:58.310> website<00:04:59.310> so<00:04:59.669> this<00:04:59.850> is<00:04:59.940> our<00:05:00.060> first

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.190 
first website so this is our first
website<00:05:00.690> as<00:05:00.780> you<00:05:00.840> can<00:05:01.050> see<00:05:01.639> the<00:05:02.639> server<00:05:03.200> is

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
website as you can see the server is

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
website as you can see the server is
running<00:05:04.370> everything<00:05:05.370> is<00:05:05.490> working<00:05:06.450> fine<00:05:06.800> so<00:05:07.800> if

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
running everything is working fine so if

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.120 
running everything is working fine so if
you<00:05:08.370> go<00:05:08.640> back<00:05:08.880> to<00:05:09.440> the<00:05:10.440> application<00:05:12.830> that's<00:05:13.830> it

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
you go back to the application that's it

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.150 
you go back to the application that's it
really<00:05:14.450> so<00:05:15.450> you<00:05:15.510> can<00:05:16.020> had<00:05:16.289> it<00:05:16.500> can<00:05:17.010> add<00:05:17.130> a

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
really so you can had it can add a

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.260 
really so you can had it can add a
button<00:05:17.750> can<00:05:18.750> add<00:05:19.530> about<00:05:19.860> in<00:05:20.130> our<00:05:20.430> text<00:05:21.000> field

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
button can add about in our text field

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.520 
button can add about in our text field
and<00:05:22.250> if<00:05:23.250> you<00:05:23.430> click<00:05:23.760> on<00:05:23.820> a<00:05:24.600> debug<00:05:25.200> start

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
and if you click on a debug start

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.370 
and if you click on a debug start
without<00:05:25.800> debugging<00:05:25.860> and<00:05:27.020> we<00:05:28.020> should<00:05:28.200> be<00:05:28.320> able

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
without debugging and we should be able

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.070 
without debugging and we should be able
to<00:05:28.530> see<00:05:28.860> the<00:05:29.760> controls<00:05:30.150> that<00:05:30.330> we've<00:05:30.539> placed<00:05:30.840> on

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
to see the controls that we've placed on

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.680 
to see the controls that we've placed on
it<00:05:31.200> so<00:05:31.470> it's<00:05:32.280> a<00:05:32.370> very<00:05:32.580> simple<00:05:32.910> way<00:05:33.150> to<00:05:33.210> build<00:05:33.570> a

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
it so it's a very simple way to build a

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.290 
it so it's a very simple way to build a
website<00:05:33.930> and<00:05:34.440> in<00:05:35.039> the<00:05:35.220> in<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:35.760> next<00:05:35.880> video

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
we're going to be going deeper into this

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.060 
we're going to be going deeper into this
