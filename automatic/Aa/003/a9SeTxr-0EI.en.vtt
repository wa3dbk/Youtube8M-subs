00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
how it condenses down because I think

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.710 
how it condenses down because I think
it's<00:04:36.640> important<00:04:37.090> it<00:04:37.180> saves<00:04:37.360> a<00:04:37.450> lot<00:04:37.480> of<00:04:37.600> space

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
it's important it saves a lot of space

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.130 
it's important it saves a lot of space
and<00:04:39.030> just<00:04:40.030> not<00:04:40.150> as<00:04:40.270> much<00:04:40.420> packaging<00:04:40.900> it's<00:04:41.020> not

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
and just not as much packaging it's not

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.050 
and just not as much packaging it's not
a<00:04:41.170> hassle<00:04:41.380> so<00:04:43.440> all<00:04:44.440> right<00:04:44.560> so<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:44.860> just

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060
