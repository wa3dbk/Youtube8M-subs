00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.370
 which explains a little 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.900

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.710
 braided 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.690
 to greatly improve the resistance the 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.430
 port is a usb to make it compatible 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.600
 with all the fish and also comes 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.129
 Gold plating to improve the 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.580
 connectivity and data transfer 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.290
 we connect it and we will see that it is reproached 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.110
 of a very beautiful orange color 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.310
 we see here on the sides the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.240
 lateral forgiveness 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:22.020
 and the top part just 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.430
 in the wheel we see that it has a selector 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.140
 of country that is also retro illuminates 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.040
 to go up and down the country 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:33.270
 we also see that it is red orange 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.880
 blue and purple this tells us that we have 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.700
 selected to 4000 beige 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.479
 we will be able to change 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.719
 the sensor that is optical is a vague 30 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.179
 50 a dedicated sensor specially for 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:49.310
 gaming surfers the bottom part of the 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.140
 mouse where it slides over 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.909
 the carpet are quite wide and that 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.189
 it will improve us very much 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.229
 moving the mouse so 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.350
 fast and fluid 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.049
 we see that the mat is made of rubber 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.530
 which will also improve the grip of 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.709
 she with our finger 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.050
 the internal memory is 128 cas not 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.760
 it will work very well 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.530
 to conceive through software and 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.600
 well the top part of the mouse is the 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.510
 rubber effect ruber effect which also 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.160
 It serves to improve the grip of the mouse 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.380
 per se 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.470
 we see that it has an ambidextrous shape 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.000
 that will make us choose the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.500
 mouse with both the right hand and with 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.910
 the left but the side buttons 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.620
 on the left we can only 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.900
 use them in case we use the 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.750
 right hand and squeeze with the thumb 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.450
 since with the left hand it is enough 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.920
 complicated to tighten these buttons very 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.160

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.840
