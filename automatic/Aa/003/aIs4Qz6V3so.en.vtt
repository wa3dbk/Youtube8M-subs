00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.370
 so hello almost next episode of five 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.990
 things in minecraft you do not have yet 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.580
 I knew we must know each other today 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.990
 one I'm late and I have 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.730
 again, the future will be picked out 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.060
 could be interesting again now 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.369
 tuned 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.150
 how many of the things I'm about to do 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.529
 we show you have to 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.420
 write the comments and if you are 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.369
 have good ideas from lingen too 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.810
 otherwise I know someone writes 7 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.939
 comments if you are good come 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.600
 not in sequence with it and let 's go 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.760
 The first thing is sweet 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.469
 bacon signs the 1.8 one can 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.239
 disclose wet sponges and if you can 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.160
 then never fired with a lover once 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.860
 comes out a dry sponge and the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.210
 Bucket fills with water 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.620
 let wet sponges dry 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.270
 open it is as far as it was not possible 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.309
 Of course I had to do that already 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.199
 Special feature the water can be given to the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.140
 Remove the sponge and keep it in 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.059
 form of a bucket so alaba came in 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.710
 the water is always gone now 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.870
 and this is going through here once 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.070
 and if that went through then 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.020
 We get here a water bucket out 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.090
 that did not actually know that 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.680
 Do not catch water like that before 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.869
 clearly one thing the teachers do 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.979
 and it's melted again 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.619
 Actually, everything does not necessarily have to be 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:22.320
 It really should be a lama, too 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:24.750
 if so what can an okay then go 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.479
 you get something once that is one 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.009
 really cool thing and continue 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.110
 the next thing is slapping 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.490
 Openness and he writes you when you are 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.100
 can set about a box a blog 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.030
 the victim including no items record 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.200
 boxes are made in such cases 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.579
 it is clear we closed 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.820
 that is not the case then 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.770
 you can still click on it but also 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.680
 no hoffer off or even grandpa 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.420
 can not draw anything from it anyway 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.460
 the hoppers grad nothing in it but in the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.310
 crate is here when I just mark 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.490
 even the box with the metadata wood 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.850
 Actually there is no stone in it 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.130
 dismantle 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.540
 now is pulled out and now pulls 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.250
 she and the corresponding one 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.170
 work out something about it 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.750
 I can see what's out of the closet again 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.530
 do not click and it will not work anymore 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.500
 pulled out 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.530
 I'm not really that true 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.670
 included in the calculation 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.230
 The next thing is from Leine 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.020
 sign how to change ringsport 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.800
 and always kill the portal on the spot 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.510
 same height 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.240
 that's true, too, I 've got myself 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.610
 had a normal world where also the 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.770
 fifth test world was and there are the 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.240
 Often things change and died 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.400
 Here we have an advantage 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.320
 that has drilled deep into the ground 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.030
 heartily also once deep into the ground 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.070
 bored a friend would have too 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.680
 be somewhere 1 on the corresponding 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.180
 height and yes no matter what image around it 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.560
 flat world then those would be in the air 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.450
 lie 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.040
 it always comes to an altitude of 64 all here 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.980
 another down I am grateful bock 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.620
 65 but actually correct ender 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.120
 Portal living always at the same height 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.350
 after changing killed throat 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.870
 moment the next thing is from juana 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.400
 stubble stubble you do not fierce 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.170
 knew when you got out of the oven 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.360
 example glass presses in this inventory 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.950
 then it's off the ledge below 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.900
 sorted it from right to left 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.549
 usually things get collected from 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.519
 left to right and I decided that 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.709
 never made me so aware and yes 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.299
 actually a normal one collects completely 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.799
 tallies from left to right are 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.440
 the bar forints from the one field after 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.209
 the other through markus out if I 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.980
 But now things are open, for example 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.380
 Gathering his sex in first sex 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.310
 from right to left and smaller 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.150
 rotate exchange in it 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.890
 as I just tested myself of it 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.630
 actually only in ovens 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.060
 That's why it does not go that straight 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.500
 cool found and have sun tickles only at 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.760
 However, crates is the same effect 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.900
 does not even have to be glass 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.040
 but can be other items too 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.810
 Of course, take this stone 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.950
 the single clique that sometimes from 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.530
 right to left, I'm honest 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.530
 Not suspected at the beginning but one 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.579
 little illogical I believe that one time 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.530
 it goes from one to the other 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.590
 direction than other market is 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.180
 to collect the other way around is from the left 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.560
 to the right when such crate raushole 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.130
 feels right to left 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.660
 OK 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.580
 the last one for today is from christian 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.550
 productions weatherford person views 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.140
 minecraft my card is sitting and then the 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.520
 head between h drives you change 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.130
 automatically in the first person view 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.829
 sometimes done quite differently and she is 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.590
 me a g5 and every time we do 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.660
 I pass by with the camera in 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.990
 my high end in there was something 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.520
 actually got the christmas money out 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.220
 but yes, even if I am so marco small me 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.350
 every time in front of my face is 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.210
 not quite carsten but the camera 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:40.500
 offers pushed to the head then pressed 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.180
 I would say who it again 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.220
 have been for today i go fast 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.150
 out before a war trauma as centrifugal 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:51.630
 it was cool and with the hopper 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.010
 the sponge spell of history I 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.370
 definitely not come at all 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.130
 see 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.510
 despite everything, I would say that reading 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.889
 you next part when you say goodbye 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.690
 They like to come in if they are good 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.820
 next you follow it with a dazzle 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.510
 and then how much of what you liked 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.729
 in the comments 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.729
 See you next cards and chips 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.820
 there
