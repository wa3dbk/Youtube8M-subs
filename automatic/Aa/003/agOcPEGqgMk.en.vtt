00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
just smooth it out and then you would

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.880 
just smooth it out and then you would
have<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.390> sit<00:01:57.570> underneath<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.079> dryer<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:58.649> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
have to sit underneath the dryer but the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.289 
have to sit underneath the dryer but the
best<00:01:59.100> thing<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> would<00:01:59.759> say<00:01:59.909> while<00:02:00.180> you're

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
best thing that I would say while you're

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.569 
best thing that I would say while you're
growing<00:02:00.509> out<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> perm<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.250> straighten

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
growing out a perm is just to straighten

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.260 
growing out a perm is just to straighten
those<00:02:02.909> ends<00:02:03.540> with<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.680> brush<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.820> blow<00:02:06.000> dryer

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
those ends with a brush and a blow dryer

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.449 
those ends with a brush and a blow dryer
or<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.930> can<00:02:07.110> also<00:02:07.409> chemically<00:02:07.890> help<00:02:08.280> it

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
or you can also chemically help it

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.910 
or you can also chemically help it
loosen<00:02:08.970> up<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.390> little<00:02:09.569> bit<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:09.959> think<00:02:10.289> it's

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
loosen up a little bit I think it's

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.580 
loosen up a little bit I think it's
actually<00:02:11.129> kind<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.670> nifty<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.270> nice<00:02:12.810> what

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
actually kind of nifty and nice what

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.170 
actually kind of nifty and nice what
you<00:02:13.680> have<00:02:13.860> like<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.069> little<00:02:14.250> bit<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.489> a<00:02:14.640> wave<00:02:14.879> or

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
you have like a little bit of a wave or

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.240 
you have like a little bit of a wave or
the<00:02:15.330> straightness<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.989> then<00:02:16.319> like<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.010> waves

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
the straightness and then like the waves

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.729 
the straightness and then like the waves
down<00:02:17.730> here<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.269> actually<00:02:18.390> give<00:02:19.200> us<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.440> really

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
down here it actually give us a really

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.210 
down here it actually give us a really
good<00:02:19.890> kind<00:02:20.519> of<00:02:20.610> silhouette<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.569> you<00:02:22.560> can<00:02:22.739> use

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
good kind of silhouette and you can use

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.449 
good kind of silhouette and you can use
a<00:02:23.519> cream<00:02:23.910> perm<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.599> kind<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:24.900> pull<00:02:25.170> out<00:02:25.459> what

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
a cream perm to kind of pull out what

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.250 
a cream perm to kind of pull out what
perm<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.970> there<00:02:27.209> but<00:02:27.660> just<00:02:27.810> make<00:02:28.050> sure<00:02:28.230> that

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
perm is there but just make sure that

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.559 
perm is there but just make sure that
the<00:02:28.620> active<00:02:29.010> ingredient<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:29.879> still<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.330> same

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
the active ingredient is still the same

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.930 
the active ingredient is still the same
which<00:02:31.319> is<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.500> ammonium<00:02:32.209> thiocyanate<00:02:34.790> in<00:02:35.790> a

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
which is the ammonium thiocyanate in a

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.850 
which is the ammonium thiocyanate in a
perm<00:02:36.299> you<00:02:36.930> need<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.170> make<00:02:37.319> sure<00:02:37.349> that<00:02:37.530> that

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
perm you need to make sure that that

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.000 
perm you need to make sure that that
perm<00:02:38.129> is<00:02:38.340> still<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.790> same<00:02:39.560> otherwise<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.890> will

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
perm is still the same otherwise it will

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.490 
perm is still the same otherwise it will
snap<00:02:41.430> off<00:02:41.670> because<00:02:41.940> sodium<00:02:42.690> hydroxide<00:02:43.349> which

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
snap off because sodium hydroxide which

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.150 
snap off because sodium hydroxide which
is<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.709> relaxer<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:45.260> ammonium<00:02:46.260> loudly<00:02:46.620> which

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
is a relaxer and ammonium loudly which

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.199 
is a relaxer and ammonium loudly which
is<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.400> perm<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:48.060> two<00:02:48.269> together<00:02:48.500> make<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:50.209> Nair

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
is the perm the two together make a Nair

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.509 
is the perm the two together make a Nair
concoction<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.709> hair<00:02:52.890> will<00:02:53.040> break<00:02:53.190> off

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
concoction and the hair will break off

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.080 
concoction and the hair will break off
at<00:02:53.910> where<00:02:54.329> that<00:02:54.569> connection<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.940> that<00:02:56.940> is

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
at where that connection is and that is

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.600 
at where that connection is and that is
what<00:02:57.440> you<00:02:58.440> would<00:02:58.620> do<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:58.829> make<00:02:59.099> your<00:02:59.370> hair<00:02:59.579> look

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
nice growing out of perm my name is Mark

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.890 
nice growing out of perm my name is Mark
