looking over some of the fines the yard

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.870 
looking over some of the fines the yard
definitely<00:02:36.660> looks<00:02:36.840> better<00:02:36.959> in<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.500> section

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
definitely looks better in that section

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.229 
definitely looks better in that section
and<00:02:38.880> it<00:02:39.030> did<00:02:39.209> before<00:02:43.640> if<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.760> look<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.120> the

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
and it did before if you look in the

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.580 
and it did before if you look in the
neighbor's<00:02:45.810> yard

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
neighbor's yard

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.390 
neighbor's yard
you<00:02:47.310> can<00:02:47.610> season<00:02:47.970> some<00:02:48.269> impressions<00:02:49.400> one

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
you can season some impressions one

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:58.110 
you can season some impressions one
there<00:02:54.290> one<00:02:55.290> there

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.920 

one<00:02:58.810> there<00:02:59.400> it's<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.519> good<00:03:00.700> way<00:03:00.940> of<00:03:00.970> telling

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
one there it's a good way of telling

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.729 
one there it's a good way of telling
where<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.250> holes<00:03:03.250> were<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:05.170> if<00:03:05.319> you<00:03:05.410> look<00:03:05.590> in

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
where the holes were and if you look in

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.640 
where the holes were and if you look in
the<00:03:05.830> far<00:03:06.250> neighbor's<00:03:06.940> yard<00:03:07.239> you<00:03:08.200> didn't<00:03:08.470> see

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
the far neighbor's yard you didn't see

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.610 
the far neighbor's yard you didn't see
that<00:03:09.090> there's<00:03:10.090> also<00:03:10.269> a<00:03:10.480> pattern<00:03:10.750> going<00:03:11.440> back

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
that there's also a pattern going back

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.820 
that there's also a pattern going back
that<00:03:11.890> way

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
that way

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.330 
that way
so<00:03:14.830> by<00:03:15.450> looking<00:03:16.450> at<00:03:16.780> these<00:03:16.930> depressions<00:03:17.709> in

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
so by looking at these depressions in

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.589 
so by looking at these depressions in
the<00:03:20.370> yards<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.489> can<00:03:21.640> sometimes<00:03:22.120> tell<00:03:22.390> where

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
the yards you can sometimes tell where

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.490 
the yards you can sometimes tell where
the<00:03:22.720> pretty<00:03:23.440> bits<00:03:23.739> were<00:03:25.170> looking<00:03:26.170> down<00:03:26.319> the

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
the pretty bits were looking down the

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.280 
the pretty bits were looking down the
other<00:03:26.650> direction<00:03:27.069> you<00:03:27.750> can<00:03:28.750> see<00:03:28.780> a<00:03:28.989> depression

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
other direction you can see a depression

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.729 
other direction you can see a depression
and<00:03:29.769> it's<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:29.920> pretty<00:03:30.160> good<00:03:30.400> indication<00:03:30.880> that<00:03:31.120> a

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
and it's a pretty good indication that a

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.539 
and it's a pretty good indication that a
later<00:03:32.880> pit<00:03:33.880> was<00:03:34.090> there<00:03:35.040> usually<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.160> earlier

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
later pit was there usually the earlier

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.520 
later pit was there usually the earlier
ones<00:03:36.760> were<00:03:37.000> filled<00:03:37.660> in<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.900> world<00:03:38.079> with<00:03:38.200> clay

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
ones were filled in the world with clay

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.210 
ones were filled in the world with clay
and<00:03:38.860> didn't<00:03:39.280> settle<00:03:39.819> quite<00:03:40.120> as<00:03:40.299> much<00:03:40.540> but<00:03:41.220> it's

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
so take that in consideration let's get

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.589 
so take that in consideration let's get
a<00:04:11.230> couple<00:04:11.470> of<00:04:11.500> these<00:04:11.590> bottles<00:04:12.040> out<00:04:12.540> now<00:04:13.540> I

a couple of these bottles out now I

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.710 
a couple of these bottles out now I
spread<00:04:14.019> out<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.849> milk<00:04:15.849> bottles<00:04:16.299> these<00:04:16.570> are

supposed to rain tonight I figured the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.339 
supposed to rain tonight I figured the
easiest<00:04:25.180> way<00:04:25.360> to<00:04:25.389> do<00:04:25.570> this<00:04:25.720> to<00:04:25.930> spread<00:04:26.169> them

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
easiest way to do this to spread them

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:31.290 
easiest way to do this to spread them
out<00:04:26.500> and<00:04:27.479> let<00:04:28.479> the<00:04:28.630> rain<00:04:29.440> do<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.770> job<00:04:30.180> come<00:04:31.180> out
