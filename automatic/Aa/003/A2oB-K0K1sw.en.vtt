and<00:02:41.630> metal<00:02:41.959> file<00:02:42.350> to<00:02:42.799> clean<00:02:43.070> up<00:02:43.190> all<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.459> edges

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
and metal file to clean up all the edges

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.970 
and metal file to clean up all the edges
now<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.209> should<00:02:44.570> have<00:02:44.600> nine<00:02:45.079> metal<00:02:45.560> pieces

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
now you should have nine metal pieces

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.900 
now you should have nine metal pieces
that<00:02:46.130> look<00:02:46.310> like<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.150> already

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
that look like so and already

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.850 
that look like so and already
be<00:02:48.030> bent<00:02:48.300> let's<00:02:48.840> start<00:02:49.110> with<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.320> main<00:02:49.500> finger

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
be bent let's start with the main finger

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.650 
be bent let's start with the main finger
section<00:02:50.250> take<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.640> three-quarter<00:02:51.240> inch<00:02:51.390> pipe

or a broom handle and bend the pieces

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.520 
or a broom handle and bend the pieces
around<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.180> like<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.960> help<00:02:55.140> bend<00:02:55.380> your

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
around it like so to help bend your

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.020 
around it like so to help bend your
metal<00:02:55.740> into<00:02:55.950> shape<00:02:56.160> try<00:02:56.460> using<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.880> rubber

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
metal into shape try using a rubber

metal into shape try using a rubber
hammer<00:02:57.390> when<00:02:57.720> you're<00:02:57.840> done<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.050> your<00:02:58.320> piece

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
hammer when you're done and your piece

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.140 
hammer when you're done and your piece
looks<00:02:58.800> like<00:02:59.010> this<00:02:59.220> repeat<00:02:59.850> for<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.090> other

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
looks like this repeat for the other

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.040 
looks like this repeat for the other
three<00:03:00.600> pieces

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
three pieces

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.560 
three pieces
next<00:03:01.530> take<00:03:01.710> your<00:03:01.740> fingertip<00:03:02.640> piece<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.210> using

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
next take your fingertip piece and using

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.540 
next take your fingertip piece and using
a<00:03:03.660> similar<00:03:04.050> technique<00:03:04.500> but<00:03:05.070> a<00:03:05.100> slightly

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
a similar technique but a slightly

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.390 
a similar technique but a slightly
narrower<00:03:06.300> pipe<00:03:06.870> shape<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.740> metal<00:03:07.980> like<00:03:08.130> so

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
narrower pipe shape the metal like so

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.910 
narrower pipe shape the metal like so
finish<00:03:08.910> up<00:03:09.090> by<00:03:09.330> rounding<00:03:09.930> out<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.230> tips<00:03:10.500> on<00:03:10.710> an

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
finish up by rounding out the tips on an

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.430 
finish up by rounding out the tips on an
elbow<00:03:11.430> joint<00:03:11.460> with<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.090> rubber<00:03:12.390> hammer<00:03:12.660> like<00:03:13.110> so

elbow joint with a rubber hammer like so

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.710 
elbow joint with a rubber hammer like so
at<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:13.920> stage<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:14.370> decided<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:15.000> distress<00:03:15.450> all

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
at this stage I decided to distress all

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.990 
at this stage I decided to distress all
my<00:03:15.990> metal<00:03:16.320> this<00:03:16.500> is<00:03:16.710> totally<00:03:17.280> optional<00:03:17.430> but<00:03:17.820> if

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
my metal this is totally optional but if

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.730 
my metal this is totally optional but if
you<00:03:18.030> want<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.540> can<00:03:18.690> use<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.840> benzene<00:03:19.320> torch

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
you want you can use a benzene torch

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.100 
you want you can use a benzene torch
like<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.130> did<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.490> distress<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.420> crap<00:03:21.810> out<00:03:22.080> of

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
like I did and distress the crap out of

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.930 
like I did and distress the crap out of
it<00:03:22.380> now<00:03:22.620> we<00:03:22.680> need<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:22.980> connect<00:03:23.310> all<00:03:23.490> the<00:03:23.730> metal

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
it now we need to connect all the metal

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.940 
it now we need to connect all the metal
pieces<00:03:24.300> together<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:25.050> you'll<00:03:25.410> need<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.710> drill

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
pieces together so you'll need to drill

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.280 
pieces together so you'll need to drill
some<00:03:26.190> holes<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.640> find<00:03:27.120> some<00:03:27.570> double<00:03:28.020> cap

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
some holes and find some double cap

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.710 
some holes and find some double cap
rivets<00:03:28.980> drill<00:03:29.460> holes<00:03:29.760> in<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.060> finger<00:03:30.360> pieces

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
rivets drill holes in the finger pieces

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.450 
rivets drill holes in the finger pieces
where<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.960> joints<00:03:31.290> meet<00:03:31.530> where<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.130> fingers

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
where the joints meet where the fingers

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.970 
where the joints meet where the fingers
attach<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.120> backplate<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:33.780> three<00:03:34.710> holes

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
attach to the backplate and three holes

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.890 
attach to the backplate and three holes
to<00:03:35.220> attach<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.700> backplate<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.690> leather

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
to attach the backplate to the leather

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.460 
to attach the backplate to the leather

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
glove

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.050 
glove
next<00:03:37.920> just<00:03:38.040> rivet<00:03:38.490> everything<00:03:38.910> together

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
next just rivet everything together

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.510 
next just rivet everything together
using<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.780> table<00:03:40.170> vise<00:03:40.350> to<00:03:40.830> set<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.220> rivets

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
using a table vise to set the rivets

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.430 
using a table vise to set the rivets
like<00:03:41.880> so<00:03:42.150> now<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.510> should<00:03:42.960> have<00:03:42.990> a<00:03:43.110> pretty

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
like so now you should have a pretty

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.800 
like so now you should have a pretty
impressive<00:03:43.740> looking<00:03:44.250> metal<00:03:44.670> gauntlet<00:03:45.330> thingy

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
impressive looking metal gauntlet thingy

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.690 
impressive looking metal gauntlet thingy
to<00:03:46.140> add<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.530> pieces<00:03:46.770> that<00:03:47.070> will<00:03:47.220> hold<00:03:47.460> your

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
to add the pieces that will hold your

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.940 
to add the pieces that will hold your
fingers<00:03:48.090> in<00:03:48.240> place<00:03:48.510> cut<00:03:49.080> some<00:03:49.320> small<00:03:49.500> strips

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
fingers in place cut some small strips

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.949 
fingers in place cut some small strips
from<00:03:50.130> your<00:03:50.340> metal<00:03:50.580> sheet<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:51.030> hot<00:03:51.630> glue<00:03:51.930> them

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
from your metal sheet and hot glue them

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.540 
from your metal sheet and hot glue them
in<00:03:52.200> place<00:03:52.230> like<00:03:53.040> so

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
in place like so

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.949 
in place like so
adding<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:53.970> leather<00:03:54.150> glove<00:03:54.450> is<00:03:54.660> pretty

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
adding the leather glove is pretty

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.020 
adding the leather glove is pretty
self-explanatory<00:03:55.350> but<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.370> will<00:03:56.610> point<00:03:56.880> out

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
self-explanatory but I will point out

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.970 
self-explanatory but I will point out
that<00:03:57.240> I<00:03:57.270> use<00:03:57.480> my<00:03:57.660> torch<00:03:58.020> and<00:03:58.260> some<00:03:58.440> scissors<00:03:58.830> to

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
that I use my torch and some scissors to

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.130 
that I use my torch and some scissors to
distress<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.730> glove<00:04:00.120> but<00:04:00.540> if<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.840> want<00:04:00.990> to<00:04:01.050> be

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
distress the glove but if you want to be

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.750 
distress the glove but if you want to be
more<00:04:01.320> safe<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:01.800> could<00:04:01.920> use<00:04:02.100> black<00:04:02.310> paint

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
more safe you could use black paint

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.610 
more safe you could use black paint
instead<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.390> burning<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.780> glove<00:04:04.050> the<00:04:04.410> last

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
instead of burning the glove the last

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.680 
instead of burning the glove the last
step<00:04:04.920> was<00:04:05.100> adding<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.490> claws<00:04:05.820> themselves<00:04:06.510> I

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
step was adding the claws themselves I

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.690 
step was adding the claws themselves I
decided<00:04:07.170> to<00:04:07.290> make<00:04:07.440> my<00:04:07.590> blades<00:04:07.830> out<00:04:07.980> of<00:04:08.130> plastic

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
decided to make my blades out of plastic

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.400 
decided to make my blades out of plastic
instead<00:04:09.150> of<00:04:09.209> metal<00:04:09.330> because<00:04:09.870> they<00:04:10.140> would<00:04:10.290> be

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
instead of metal because they would be

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.920 
instead of metal because they would be
safer<00:04:10.830> and<00:04:10.950> easier<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.760> shape<00:04:12.030> very<00:04:12.480> similar

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
safer and easier to shape very similar

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.720 
safer and easier to shape very similar
to<00:04:13.080> how<00:04:13.200> I<00:04:13.230> made<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.650> Wolverine<00:04:14.100> claws

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
to how I made the Wolverine claws
