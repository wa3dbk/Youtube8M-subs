00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
sounds pretty clear it's not it sounds a

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.750 
sounds pretty clear it's not it sounds a
little<00:02:43.530> bit<00:02:43.650> like<00:02:43.800> serious<00:02:44.250> voice<00:02:44.370> I'm<00:02:44.610> not

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.040 
sure if it's exactly the same voice they
do<00:02:46.620> use<00:02:47.070> right<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:48.240> updating<00:02:48.720> us<00:02:48.840> while

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
do use right so it is updating us while

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:57.650 
do use right so it is updating us while
we<00:02:49.200> go<00:02:54.410> that's<00:02:55.410> what<00:02:55.710> we<00:02:55.890> will<00:02:56.100> do

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
we go that's what we will do

we go that's what we will do
so<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.650> was<00:02:58.680> saying<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.910> voice

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
so like I was saying the voice

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.000 
so like I was saying the voice

system that plugs it into your car I

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.430 
system that plugs it into your car I
recommend<00:03:11.370> doing<00:03:11.490> that<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.660> not<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:13.050> loud

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
recommend doing that it is not that loud

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.230 
recommend doing that it is not that loud
if<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.770> have<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.070> radio<00:03:14.370> on<00:03:14.430> I'm<00:03:14.760> not<00:03:14.940> so<00:03:15.210> sure

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
obviously not gonna do that because I

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.800 
obviously not gonna do that because I
don't<00:03:17.550> want<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.730> play<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.000> conquer<00:03:18.360> any<00:03:18.510> music
