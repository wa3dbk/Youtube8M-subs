answer<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.790> main<00:01:09.970> color<00:01:10.240> belt<00:01:10.710> wings<00:01:11.710> are<00:01:12.299> a

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
answer the main color belt wings are a

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.349 
answer the main color belt wings are a
main<00:01:13.750> feature<00:01:14.080> of<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.549> design<00:01:15.820> this<00:01:16.030> felt

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:16.359 
main feature of the design this felt

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:17.789 
main feature of the design this felt
there's<00:01:16.539> no<00:01:16.719> wings<00:01:16.990> involved<00:01:17.590> in<00:01:17.679> the

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
there's no wings involved in the

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.950 
there's no wings involved in the
designers<00:01:18.250> belt<00:01:18.520> I<00:01:18.729> think<00:01:19.329> mainly<00:01:19.570> because

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
designers belt I think mainly because

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.380 
designers belt I think mainly because
the<00:01:20.890> exhibition<00:01:21.460> is<00:01:21.490> full<00:01:21.789> of<00:01:21.880> high<00:01:22.060> flyers

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
the exhibition is full of high flyers

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.569 
the exhibition is full of high flyers
you<00:01:22.929> know<00:01:23.049> they<00:01:23.229> were<00:01:23.289> doing<00:01:23.799> midair<00:01:24.280> they're

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
you know they were doing midair they're

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.520 
you know they were doing midair they're
doing<00:01:24.939> moves<00:01:25.299> of<00:01:25.479> top<00:01:25.749> rope<00:01:25.990> and<00:01:26.109> stuff<00:01:26.380> like

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
doing moves of top rope and stuff like

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.310 
doing moves of top rope and stuff like
that<00:01:26.590> so<00:01:26.920> I<00:01:27.340> think<00:01:27.759> that's<00:01:28.119> why<00:01:29.049> they've

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
that so I think that's why they've

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.899 
that so I think that's why they've
incorporated<00:01:29.679> the<00:01:30.100> wings<00:01:30.340> on<00:01:30.909> this<00:01:31.299> design<00:01:32.909> it

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
incorporated the wings on this design it

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.679 
incorporated the wings on this design it

mind<00:02:05.109> the<00:02:05.619> actual<00:02:05.950> designers<00:02:06.490> felt<00:02:06.819> so<00:02:07.270> the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
mind the actual designers felt so the

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.090 
mind the actual designers felt so the
thing<00:02:07.719> that<00:02:07.929> gets<00:02:08.050> me<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.470> most<00:02:08.500> though<00:02:08.950> is

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
thing that gets me the most though is

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.300 
thing that gets me the most though is
the<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.690> font<00:02:11.080> on<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.350> banners<00:02:11.860> where<00:02:12.190> it

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
the the font on the banners where it

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.449 
the the font on the banners where it
says<00:02:12.459> division<00:02:13.000> champion<00:02:13.569> I<00:02:14.340> think<00:02:15.340> it

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
says division champion I think it

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.190 
says division champion I think it
deserves<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:15.910> little<00:02:16.090> bit<00:02:16.209> out<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.360> place<00:02:16.569> if

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
deserves a little bit out of place if

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.720 
deserves a little bit out of place if
they<00:02:17.680> did<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.160> different<00:02:18.910> font<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:20.470> know

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
they did a different font and you know

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.180 
they did a different font and you know
move<00:02:21.730> there<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.900> words<00:02:23.140> elsewhere<00:02:23.800> and

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
move there the words elsewhere and

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.340 
move there the words elsewhere and
put<00:02:24.490> them<00:02:24.580> in<00:02:24.700> their<00:02:24.820> banner<00:02:25.060> then<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.780> think

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
put them in their banner then I think

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.530 
put them in their banner then I think
you<00:02:26.500> would<00:02:27.010> have<00:02:27.040> looked<00:02:27.250> 10<00:02:28.000> times<00:02:28.270> better

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
you would have looked 10 times better

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.410 
you would have looked 10 times better
but<00:02:28.990> I<00:02:29.230> think<00:02:29.740> just<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.070> placement<00:02:30.370> or<00:02:30.820> you

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
but I think just the placement or you

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.790 
but I think just the placement or you
know<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.660> word<00:02:31.840> division<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.590> world

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
know the word division and the world

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.760 
know the word division and the world
champion<00:02:33.400> kind<00:02:34.120> of<00:02:34.360> throws<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.440> off<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.590> little

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
champion kind of throws it off a little

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.000 
champion kind of throws it off a little
bit<00:02:36.390> other<00:02:37.390> than<00:02:37.600> um<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:38.020> actually<00:02:38.530> don't<00:02:38.890> mind

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
bit other than um I actually don't mind

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.570 
bit other than um I actually don't mind

it I don't watch TNA but I actually
don't<00:02:43.030> mind<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:44.020> look<00:02:44.410> of<00:02:44.530> this<00:02:44.620> but<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:44.980> like

don't mind the look of this but I like

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.480 
don't mind the look of this but I like
the<00:02:45.430> stylized<00:02:46.210> blow<00:02:46.570> but<00:02:47.410> then<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:47.710> can't

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
the stylized blow but then you can't

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.160 
the stylized blow but then you can't
really<00:02:48.640> see<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:49.030> glow<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.300> kind<00:02:49.510> of<00:02:49.570> reminds

much<00:03:53.980> of<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.280> side<00:03:54.459> place<00:03:54.670> you<00:03:54.790> can<00:03:54.880> see<00:03:55.000> about

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
much of the side place you can see about

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.930 
much of the side place you can see about
half<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.570> side<00:03:55.780> plate<00:03:56.050> from<00:03:56.410> what<00:03:56.590> I<00:03:56.650> can<00:03:56.680> see

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
half the side plate from what I can see

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.240 
half the side plate from what I can see
it's<00:03:58.050> gonna<00:03:59.050> be<00:03:59.440> a<00:04:00.840> free<00:04:01.840> player<00:04:02.110> yeah<00:04:02.890> they

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
it's gonna be a free player yeah they

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.500 
it's gonna be a free player yeah they
would<00:04:03.370> have<00:04:03.489> showed<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.820> full<00:04:04.000> belt<00:04:04.209> off<00:04:04.330> in

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
would have showed the full belt off in

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.310 
would have showed the full belt off in
front<00:04:04.750> of<00:04:04.959> five<00:04:05.140> but<00:04:05.380> I<00:04:05.410> could<00:04:05.680> be<00:04:05.709> wrong<00:04:06.000> but

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
front of five but I could be wrong but

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.780 
front of five but I could be wrong but
the<00:04:08.320> side<00:04:08.530> plates<00:04:08.769> would<00:04:08.920> be<00:04:09.070> a<00:04:09.100> bit<00:04:09.370> big<00:04:09.580> so

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
the side plates would be a bit big so

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.729 
the side plates would be a bit big so
I'm<00:04:10.660> guessing<00:04:10.870> it's<00:04:11.140> a<00:04:11.230> free<00:04:11.440> player<00:04:12.390> again

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
I'm guessing it's a free player again

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.050 
I'm guessing it's a free player again
kind<00:04:14.739> of<00:04:14.860> shares<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.280> same<00:04:15.459> aspect<00:04:15.970> you<00:04:16.030> got
