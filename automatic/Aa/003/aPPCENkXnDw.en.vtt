divider versus my old bag which was 14

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.440 
divider versus my old bag which was 14
individual<00:01:24.420> dividers<00:01:25.020> one<00:01:25.290> for<00:01:25.470> each<00:01:25.560> club<00:01:26.450> so

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
individual dividers one for each club so

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.420

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
to the range to group everything so it's

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.410 
to the range to group everything so it's
not<00:01:36.630> crunched<00:01:37.020> up<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.320> there<00:01:37.610> but<00:01:38.610> there<00:01:39.270> are

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
not crunched up in there but there are

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.060 
not crunched up in there but there are
there<00:01:40.020> are<00:01:40.079> some<00:01:40.350> negatives<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.890> know<00:01:41.009> you

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
there are some negatives you know you

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.700 
there are some negatives you know you
get<00:01:41.369> stuff<00:01:42.049> slamming<00:01:43.049> into<00:01:43.200> each<00:01:43.350> other<00:01:43.560> if

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
get stuff slamming into each other if

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.609 
get stuff slamming into each other if
it's<00:01:43.860> too<00:01:44.070> loose<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.689> it'll<00:01:46.500> be

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
it's too loose and so it'll be

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.730 
it's too loose and so it'll be
interesting<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:47.100> transition<00:01:47.939> from<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.740> say

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
interesting to transition from that say
