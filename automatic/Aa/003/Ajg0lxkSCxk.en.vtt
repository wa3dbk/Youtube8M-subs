be able to taunt him I thought that

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.770 
be able to taunt him I thought that
being<00:01:06.700> able<00:01:06.789> to<00:01:06.880> talk<00:01:07.060> klefki<00:01:07.390> was<00:01:07.600> really

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
being able to talk klefki was really

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.480 
being able to talk klefki was really
really<00:01:07.899> important<00:01:08.289> and<00:01:08.439> finally<00:01:09.100> he<00:01:09.250> tran

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
really important and finally he tran

because<00:01:09.670> it<00:01:09.759> deals<00:01:09.909> with<00:01:10.060> sizzle<00:01:10.509> it<00:01:10.750> deals

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
because it deals with sizzle it deals

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.319 
because it deals with sizzle it deals
with<00:01:11.109> klefki<00:01:11.439> and<00:01:11.799> even<00:01:12.729> if<00:01:12.850> it's<00:01:12.969> in<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.179> rain

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
with klefki and even if it's in the rain

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:14.880 
with klefki and even if it's in the rain
I<00:01:13.359> can<00:01:13.659> stall<00:01:13.840> that<00:01:13.960> rain<00:01:14.170> would<00:01:14.289> protect<00:01:14.619> and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
I can stall that rain would protect and

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.080 
I can stall that rain would protect and
then<00:01:15.009> I<00:01:15.070> can<00:01:15.219> try<00:01:15.399> and<00:01:15.460> get<00:01:15.579> some<00:01:15.729> damage<00:01:15.969> off

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
then I can try and get some damage off

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.370 
then I can try and get some damage off
with<00:01:16.240> Heatran<00:01:16.479> so<00:01:16.600> that<00:01:16.719> was<00:01:16.810> my<00:01:16.840> that<00:01:17.170> was<00:01:17.259> my

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
with Heatran so that was my that was my

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.620 
with Heatran so that was my that was my
logic<00:01:17.710> that<00:01:18.280> was<00:01:18.399> my<00:01:18.549> idea<00:01:18.850> of<00:01:19.060> why<00:01:19.329> I<00:01:19.359> did<00:01:19.600> that

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
logic that was my idea of why I did that

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.539 
logic that was my idea of why I did that
I<00:01:19.990> did<00:01:20.140> lead<00:01:20.590> off<00:01:20.770> with<00:01:21.039> heat<00:01:21.280> random

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
I did lead off with heat random

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.039 
I did lead off with heat random
thunderous<00:01:21.880> I<00:01:21.969> did<00:01:22.119> predict<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:22.539> klefki<00:01:22.749> lead

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
thunderous I did predict a klefki lead

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.480 
thunderous I did predict a klefki lead
and<00:01:23.259> I<00:01:23.469> thought<00:01:23.649> that<00:01:23.710> a<00:01:23.890> scissor<00:01:24.130> lead<00:01:24.340> was

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
and I thought that a scissor lead was

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.649 
and I thought that a scissor lead was
actually<00:01:24.759> quite<00:01:24.850> likely<00:01:25.119> against<00:01:25.509> my<00:01:25.600> team

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
actually quite likely against my team

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.749 
actually quite likely against my team
and<00:01:25.929> he<00:01:26.259> ended<00:01:26.499> up<00:01:26.590> leading<00:01:26.859> klefki<00:01:27.310> sizzle

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
and he ended up leading klefki sizzle

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.219 
and he ended up leading klefki sizzle
which<00:01:27.880> could<00:01:28.179> not<00:01:28.359> have<00:01:28.479> gone<00:01:28.600> better<00:01:28.659> this<00:01:29.109> is

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
which could not have gone better this is

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.200 
which could not have gone better this is
the<00:01:29.350> perfectly<00:01:29.920> match<00:01:30.130> up<00:01:30.310> for<00:01:30.460> me<00:01:30.579> now<00:01:31.149> the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
the perfectly match up for me now the

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.090 
the perfectly match up for me now the
thing<00:01:31.539> about<00:01:31.569> sizzle<00:01:32.049> is<00:01:32.229> it<00:01:32.499> can<00:01:32.799> actually

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
thing about sizzle is it can actually

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.169 
thing about sizzle is it can actually
beat<00:01:33.700> heat<00:01:34.090> ran<00:01:34.329> with<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.460> superpower<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.999> I

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
beat heat ran with the superpower and I

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.059 
beat heat ran with the superpower and I
was<00:01:37.329> worried<00:01:37.600> about<00:01:37.689> klefki<00:01:37.990> like<00:01:38.350> thunder

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
was worried about klefki like thunder

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:40.709 
was worried about klefki like thunder
wave<00:01:39.159> my<00:01:39.340> heatran<00:01:39.700> getting<00:01:39.999> fully<00:01:40.240> paralyzed

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
wave my heatran getting fully paralyzed

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.020 
wave my heatran getting fully paralyzed
and<00:01:40.960> then<00:01:41.619> being<00:01:42.130> knocked<00:01:42.369> out<00:01:42.490> by<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.700> sizzle

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
and then being knocked out by the sizzle

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.099 
and then being knocked out by the sizzle
I<00:01:43.119> thought<00:01:43.299> that'd<00:01:43.479> be<00:01:43.569> a<00:01:43.600> really<00:01:43.780> really<00:01:43.929> bad

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
I thought that'd be a really really bad

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:45.179 
I thought that'd be a really really bad
thing<00:01:44.350> to<00:01:44.469> happen<00:01:44.590> so<00:01:44.829> I<00:01:44.859> went<00:01:45.009> with<00:01:45.100> a

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
thing to happen so I went with a

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.010 
thing to happen so I went with a
completely<00:01:45.579> safe<00:01:45.939> play<00:01:46.179> I<00:01:46.389> wasn't<00:01:46.869> about<00:01:46.960> to

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
completely safe play I wasn't about to

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.809 
completely safe play I wasn't about to
get<00:01:47.229> haxed<00:01:47.530> and<00:01:47.679> I<00:01:47.920> went<00:01:48.069> for<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.249> protect<00:01:48.609> and

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
get haxed and I went for the protect and

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.270 
get haxed and I went for the protect and
then<00:01:48.999> the<00:01:49.149> taunt<00:01:49.420> on<00:01:49.659> to<00:01:49.960> klefki<00:01:50.259> I<00:01:50.590> ended<00:01:51.249> up

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
then the taunt on to klefki I ended up

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.499 
then the taunt on to klefki I ended up
apps<00:01:51.490> me<00:01:51.670> in<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:51.850> club<00:01:51.969> key<00:01:52.119> so<00:01:52.210> I<00:01:52.270> could<00:01:52.329> have

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
apps me in the club key so I could have

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.209 
apps me in the club key so I could have
just<00:01:52.689> taunt<00:01:52.899> it<00:01:53.049> and<00:01:53.200> then<00:01:53.289> he<00:01:53.439> waved<00:01:53.649> and<00:01:53.859> I

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
just taunt it and then he waved and I

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:55.169 
just taunt it and then he waved and I
would<00:01:54.340> have<00:01:54.429> been<00:01:54.520> actually<00:01:54.880> in<00:01:54.939> a<00:01:54.999> better

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
protect Heatran just to get this sort of

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.000 
protect Heatran just to get this sort of
safe<00:02:44.630> switch<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.260> was<00:02:45.380> a<00:02:45.440> pretty<00:02:45.590> safe<00:02:45.770> switch

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
safe switch it was a pretty safe switch

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.410 
safe switch it was a pretty safe switch
for<00:02:46.160> me<00:02:46.220> he<00:02:46.370> goes<00:02:46.490> for<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.730> up<00:02:46.880> by<00:02:47.090> onto

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
for me he goes for the up by onto

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.520 
for me he goes for the up by onto
Heatran<00:02:47.720> that<00:02:47.870> was<00:02:47.960> a<00:02:47.990> little<00:02:48.050> bit<00:02:48.230> obvious

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
Heatran that was a little bit obvious

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.870 
Heatran that was a little bit obvious
and<00:02:48.650> then<00:02:49.070> he<00:02:49.190> actually<00:02:49.310> goes<00:02:49.520> for<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.730> ice

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
and then he actually goes for the ice

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.940 
and then he actually goes for the ice
beam<00:02:50.150> onto<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.600> thunderous<00:02:50.990> slot<00:02:51.230> which<00:02:51.680> in

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
beam onto the thunderous slot which in

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.010 
beam onto the thunderous slot which in
hindsight<00:02:52.400> was<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.000> little<00:02:53.300> obvious<00:02:53.390> but<00:02:53.720> it

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
hindsight was a little obvious but it

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.420 
hindsight was a little obvious but it
ended<00:02:54.260> up<00:02:54.380> working<00:02:54.530> out<00:02:54.770> just<00:02:54.830> fine<00:02:55.100> because

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
ended up working out just fine because

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.710 
ended up working out just fine because
it<00:02:55.580> doesn't<00:02:55.790> do<00:02:55.850> much<00:02:55.970> damage<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.330> Big<00:02:56.540> Mama

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
it doesn't do much damage to Big Mama

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.570 
it doesn't do much damage to Big Mama
it's<00:02:56.870> not<00:02:56.990> a<00:02:57.020> very<00:02:57.260> very<00:02:57.530> strong<00:02:57.680> move<00:02:58.250> I'm

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
it's not a very very strong move I'm

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.040 
it's not a very very strong move I'm
gonna<00:02:58.760> go<00:02:58.910> into<00:02:59.090> Scrooge<00:02:59.390> here<00:02:59.660> instead<00:02:59.990> of

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
gonna go into Scrooge here instead of

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.030 
gonna go into Scrooge here instead of
heat<00:03:00.200> trend<00:03:00.410> because<00:03:00.530> obviously<00:03:00.710> he's

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
heat trend because obviously he's

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.500 
heat trend because obviously he's

spanning earth piles on my Heatran I'm

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.000 
spanning earth piles on my Heatran I'm
not<00:03:02.780> about<00:03:02.990> to<00:03:03.050> reveal<00:03:03.350> that<00:03:03.530> shocker<00:03:03.770> Barry

not about to reveal that shocker Barry
just<00:03:04.370> yet<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.910> wasn't<00:03:05.360> actually<00:03:05.420> too

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
buried this battle at all until it was

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.360 
buried this battle at all until it was
absolutely<00:03:08.360> needed<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.110> be<00:03:09.230> revealed<00:03:09.560> if<00:03:10.250> it

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
absolutely needed to be revealed if it

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.460 
absolutely needed to be revealed if it
came<00:03:10.670> down<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.970> that<00:03:11.150> but<00:03:11.690> anyway<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:12.230> Big

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
came down to that but anyway the Big

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.960 
came down to that but anyway the Big
Mama<00:03:12.650> goes<00:03:12.800> from<00:03:12.950> protect<00:03:13.250> also<00:03:13.610> at<00:03:13.820> that

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
Mama goes from protect also at that

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.490 
Mama goes from protect also at that
point<00:03:14.210> I<00:03:14.300> was<00:03:14.420> practicing<00:03:14.900> for<00:03:15.050> best<00:03:15.170> of<00:03:15.290> three

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
point I was practicing for best of three

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.990 
point I was practicing for best of three
I<00:03:15.650> know<00:03:15.830> that<00:03:16.190> all<00:03:16.310> these<00:03:16.430> matches<00:03:16.730> were<00:03:16.820> best

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
I know that all these matches were best

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.610 
I know that all these matches were best
of<00:03:17.120> one<00:03:17.240> but<00:03:17.420> if<00:03:17.570> you<00:03:17.750> can<00:03:17.870> avoid<00:03:17.959> revealing<00:03:18.350> an

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
of one but if you can avoid revealing an

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.320 
of one but if you can avoid revealing an
item<00:03:18.860> like<00:03:18.890> chaka<00:03:19.220> Barry<00:03:19.430> it's<00:03:19.820> a<00:03:19.910> really<00:03:20.150> good

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
item like chaka Barry it's a really good

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.910 
item like chaka Barry it's a really good
thing<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.540> do<00:03:20.690> for<00:03:20.720> best<00:03:20.989> of<00:03:21.110> threes<00:03:21.350> so<00:03:21.770> he

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
thing to do for best of threes so he

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.080 
thing to do for best of threes so he
ends<00:03:22.070> up<00:03:22.100> getting<00:03:22.220> fully<00:03:22.520> paralyzed<00:03:22.880> with<00:03:22.970> his

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
ends up getting fully paralyzed with his

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.400 
ends up getting fully paralyzed with his
google<00:03:23.360> which<00:03:23.450> really<00:03:23.660> does<00:03:23.840> suck<00:03:24.200> and

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
google which really does suck and

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.350 
google which really does suck and
obviously<00:03:25.130> i<00:03:25.220> protect<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.670> kanga<00:03:25.970> sconce<00:03:26.209> and

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
obviously i protect the kanga sconce and

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.820 
obviously i protect the kanga sconce and
nothing<00:03:26.600> happens<00:03:26.870> to<00:03:27.020> that<00:03:27.140> he's<00:03:27.530> going<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.739> go

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
nothing happens to that he's going to go

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.229 
nothing happens to that he's going to go
for<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:27.980> earth<00:03:28.100> part<00:03:28.310> onto<00:03:28.489> kanga<00:03:28.820> again

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
for the earth part onto kanga again

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.880 
for the earth part onto kanga again
which<00:03:29.690> i<00:03:29.840> think<00:03:29.930> was<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.290> good<00:03:30.440> play<00:03:30.620> on<00:03:30.650> his

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
which i think was a good play on his

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:31.930 
which i think was a good play on his
part<00:03:30.950> because<00:03:31.340> he<00:03:31.370> needs<00:03:31.580> to<00:03:31.640> get<00:03:31.730> as<00:03:31.850> much

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
part because he needs to get as much

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.360 
part because he needs to get as much
damage<00:03:32.150> off<00:03:32.360> in<00:03:32.450> kangra<00:03:32.660> as<00:03:32.930> he<00:03:33.410> can<00:03:33.709> but<00:03:34.250> at

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
damage off in kangra as he can but at

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.470 
damage off in kangra as he can but at
the<00:03:34.430> same<00:03:34.640> time<00:03:34.850> he's<00:03:35.000> allowing<00:03:35.239> me<00:03:35.360> to

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
the same time he's allowing me to

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.760 
the same time he's allowing me to
powerup<00:03:35.750> punch<00:03:35.810> is<00:03:36.050> Hydra<00:03:36.290> gone<00:03:36.440> pretty<00:03:36.560> much

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
powerup punch is Hydra gone pretty much

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.860 
powerup punch is Hydra gone pretty much
free<00:03:37.100> because<00:03:37.610> goodra<00:03:37.940> isn't<00:03:38.180> doing<00:03:38.390> much<00:03:38.540> and

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
free because goodra isn't doing much and

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.930 
free because goodra isn't doing much and
it<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:39.590> paralyzed<00:03:40.220> as<00:03:40.400> well<00:03:40.550> so<00:03:40.700> there<00:03:40.850> was

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
it is paralyzed as well so there was

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.220 
it is paralyzed as well so there was
that<00:03:41.030> chance<00:03:41.360> of<00:03:41.540> being<00:03:41.660> fully<00:03:41.840> paralyzed

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
that chance of being fully paralyzed

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.080 
that chance of being fully paralyzed
which<00:03:42.770> obviously<00:03:43.220> is<00:03:43.430> hacks<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:43.880> it<00:03:43.940> really

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
which obviously is hacks and it really

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.170 
which obviously is hacks and it really
does<00:03:44.239> suck<00:03:44.510> but<00:03:44.750> he<00:03:45.500> ends<00:03:45.739> up<00:03:45.830> going<00:03:46.040> for<00:03:46.580> he

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
does suck but he ends up going for he

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.460 
does suck but he ends up going for he
fends<00:03:47.600> off<00:03:47.660> flinching<00:03:48.110> with<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.260> Google

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
fends off flinching with the Google

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.170 
fends off flinching with the Google
because<00:03:48.530> I<00:03:48.709> faked<00:03:48.890> it<00:03:49.010> out<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.340> I<00:03:49.940> get<00:03:50.120> the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
because I faked it out and I get the

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.550 
because I faked it out and I get the
power<00:03:50.390> punch<00:03:50.630> on<00:03:50.810> to<00:03:50.930> his<00:03:51.020> hydrant<00:03:51.410> and<00:03:51.440> he

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
power punch on to his hydrant and he

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.960 
power punch on to his hydrant and he
goes<00:03:51.739> for<00:03:51.950> the<00:03:52.010> switch<00:03:52.280> he<00:03:52.610> goes<00:03:52.760> from<00:03:52.850> this

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
goes for the switch he goes from this

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.130 
goes for the switch he goes from this

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
because I thought that was my best play

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.920 
because I thought that was my best play
I<00:04:22.490> was<00:04:22.760> really<00:04:23.060> hoping<00:04:23.210> it<00:04:23.570> would<00:04:23.690> knock<00:04:23.810> it

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
I was really hoping it would knock it

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.180 
I was really hoping it would knock it
out<00:04:24.020> but<00:04:24.169> it<00:04:24.260> does<00:04:24.380> live<00:04:24.620> with<00:04:24.740> a<00:04:24.770> sliver<00:04:25.070> of

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
out but it does live with a sliver of

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.590 
out but it does live with a sliver of
health<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.580> it<00:04:25.910> is<00:04:26.060> going<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.240> be<00:04:26.270> able<00:04:26.360> to<00:04:26.510> get

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
health and it is going to be able to get

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.140 
health and it is going to be able to get
a<00:04:26.630> dark

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
a dark

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.689 
a dark
off<00:04:27.500> first<00:04:28.500> of<00:04:28.650> all<00:04:28.710> his<00:04:28.919> calf<00:04:29.160> key<00:04:29.370> is<00:04:29.550> gonna

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699

thunder<00:04:30.060> wave<00:04:30.180> my<00:04:30.509> kangaskhan<00:04:31.110> I<00:04:31.259> thought

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
thunder wave my kangaskhan I thought

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.040 
thunder wave my kangaskhan I thought
that<00:04:31.800> was<00:04:31.919> a<00:04:31.979> bit<00:04:32.100> of<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.250> mistake<00:04:32.580> as<00:04:33.210> a<00:04:33.270> play<00:04:33.780> I

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
that was a bit of a mistake as a play I

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.629 
that was a bit of a mistake as a play I
thought<00:04:34.590> maybe<00:04:34.650> light<00:04:35.160> screen<00:04:35.400> would<00:04:35.550> have

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
thought maybe light screen would have

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.370 
thought maybe light screen would have
been<00:04:35.729> better<00:04:35.850> or<00:04:36.090> I<00:04:36.120> don't<00:04:36.360> know<00:04:36.509> I<00:04:36.750> I<00:04:37.050> don't

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
been better or I don't know I I don't

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.540 
been better or I don't know I I don't
think<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:37.620> was<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.770> best<00:04:37.860> play<00:04:38.039> ever<00:04:38.070> but

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
think it was the best play ever but

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.950 
think it was the best play ever but
anyway<00:04:38.789> he<00:04:38.970> goes<00:04:39.090> with<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.330> dark<00:04:39.479> pulse<00:04:39.660> on<00:04:39.870> to

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960

obviously<00:05:04.410> I<00:05:04.440> have<00:05:04.590> overheat<00:05:05.010> I<00:05:05.190> could<00:05:05.490> just

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
obviously I have overheat I could just

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.279 
obviously I have overheat I could just
hit<00:05:05.820> overheat<00:05:06.270> straight<00:05:06.570> onto<00:05:06.720> klefki<00:05:07.050> I

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
hit overheat straight onto klefki I

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:08.719 
hit overheat straight onto klefki I
decided<00:05:07.740> to<00:05:07.860> go<00:05:07.949> into<00:05:08.070> thunderous<00:05:08.430> I'm<00:05:08.550> not

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
decided to go into thunderous I'm not

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.000 
decided to go into thunderous I'm not
quite<00:05:09.000> sure<00:05:09.030> why<00:05:09.539> I<00:05:09.810> think<00:05:10.199> to<00:05:10.289> taunt<00:05:10.530> it<00:05:10.740> but

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
quite sure why I think to taunt it but

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.650 
quite sure why I think to taunt it but
it<00:05:11.220> wasn't<00:05:11.370> my<00:05:11.550> best<00:05:11.699> play<00:05:11.970> he<00:05:12.150> drowned<00:05:12.449> was<00:05:12.539> by

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
it wasn't my best play he drowned was by

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.939 
it wasn't my best play he drowned was by
far<00:05:12.690> my<00:05:12.930> best<00:05:13.110> play<00:05:13.440> it<00:05:13.560> would've<00:05:13.710> killed<00:05:13.830> it

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
far my best play it would've killed it

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.700 
far my best play it would've killed it
that<00:05:14.070> turn<00:05:14.570> so<00:05:15.570> I<00:05:15.600> end<00:05:15.780> up<00:05:15.870> actually<00:05:16.050> wasting<00:05:16.620> a

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
that turn so I end up actually wasting a

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.350 
that turn so I end up actually wasting a
turn<00:05:16.919> here<00:05:17.160> he<00:05:17.550> goes<00:05:17.669> for<00:05:17.820> the<00:05:17.910> file<00:05:18.060> plan<00:05:18.240> to

thunderous does nothing I go for another
school<00:05:20.400> and<00:05:20.610> I<00:05:20.880> end<00:05:21.030> up<00:05:21.090> wasting<00:05:21.240> a<00:05:21.479> turn<00:05:21.630> as<00:05:21.780> i

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
have ended it in turn nine with a nice

over heat from heatran which i did have

over heat from heatran which i did have
in<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.169> back<00:05:31.320> it<00:05:31.500> was<00:05:31.530> completely<00:05:32.010> pointless

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
in the back it was completely pointless

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.730 
in the back it was completely pointless
and<00:05:32.639> a<00:05:32.970> bad<00:05:33.120> play<00:05:33.389> overall<00:05:33.960> just<00:05:34.320> silly

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
and a bad play overall just silly

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.010 
and a bad play overall just silly
silliness<00:05:35.550> silliness<00:05:36.150> and<00:05:36.210> wasting<00:05:36.599> time<00:05:36.780> but

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
silliness silliness and wasting time but

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.210 
silliness silliness and wasting time but
overall<00:05:37.260> there<00:05:37.440> was<00:05:37.530> no<00:05:37.650> way<00:05:37.770> he<00:05:37.800> could<00:05:37.979> beat

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
overall there was no way he could beat

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.070 
overall there was no way he could beat
me<00:05:38.370> so<00:05:38.520> it<00:05:38.610> didn't<00:05:38.760> really<00:05:38.789> matter<00:05:39.060> and<00:05:39.389> that

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
me so it didn't really matter and that

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.110 
me so it didn't really matter and that
was<00:05:40.320> the<00:05:40.440> end<00:05:40.470> of<00:05:40.770> round<00:05:40.979> for<00:05:41.280> that<00:05:41.699> put<00:05:41.910> me<00:05:42.030> at

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
was the end of round for that put me at

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.520 
was the end of round for that put me at
two<00:05:42.330> and<00:05:42.479> two<00:05:42.630> in<00:05:42.780> this<00:05:42.870> competition<00:05:43.139> and<00:05:43.470> I

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
two and two in this competition and I

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.710 
two and two in this competition and I
was<00:05:43.680> back<00:05:43.889> in<00:05:44.159> with<00:05:44.340> the<00:05:44.490> sliver<00:05:44.970> of<00:05:45.090> a<00:05:45.330> hope<00:05:45.570> of

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
was back in with the sliver of a hope of

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.570 
was back in with the sliver of a hope of
getting<00:05:46.110> into<00:05:46.380> top<00:05:46.620> cut<00:05:46.889> obviously<00:05:47.520> you

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
getting into top cut obviously you

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.189 
getting into top cut obviously you
needed<00:05:47.760> a<00:05:47.880> minimum<00:05:47.909> of<00:05:48.360> six<00:05:48.630> and<00:05:48.810> two<00:05:48.960> to<00:05:49.110> get

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 
needed a minimum of six and two to get

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:50.270 
needed a minimum of six and two to get
into<00:05:49.380> top<00:05:49.500> cut<00:05:49.710> and<00:05:49.830> you<00:05:49.889> need<00:05:50.010> to<00:05:50.159> have<00:05:50.250> good

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
into top cut and you need to have good

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.040 
into top cut and you need to have good
resistance<00:05:50.729> at<00:05:51.060> this<00:05:51.510> point<00:05:51.810> because<00:05:51.930> I've

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
resistance at this point because I've

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.899 
resistance at this point because I've
lost<00:05:52.260> two<00:05:52.470> games<00:05:52.650> in<00:05:52.800> a<00:05:52.860> row<00:05:52.889> early<00:05:53.460> on<00:05:53.490> I<00:05:53.789> was

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
lost two games in a row early on I was

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:55.339 
lost two games in a row early on I was
very<00:05:54.240> unlikely<00:05:54.599> to<00:05:54.810> end<00:05:54.990> up<00:05:55.110> with<00:05:55.139> good

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
very unlikely to end up with good

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:57.230 
very unlikely to end up with good
resistance<00:05:55.650> so<00:05:56.280> it<00:05:56.520> was<00:05:56.610> very<00:05:56.669> very<00:05:56.940> unlikely

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
resistance so it was very very unlikely

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.820 
resistance so it was very very unlikely
even<00:05:57.659> if<00:05:57.750> I<00:05:57.810> want<00:05:57.990> all<00:05:58.169> of<00:05:58.199> my<00:05:58.440> future<00:05:58.710> matches

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
even if I want all of my future matches

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.100 
even if I want all of my future matches
which<00:05:59.220> as<00:05:59.430> I've<00:05:59.669> said<00:05:59.760> before<00:05:59.849> I<00:06:00.210> did<00:06:00.690> not<00:06:00.900> do

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
which as I've said before I did not do

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.260 
which as I've said before I did not do
even<00:06:01.919> with<00:06:02.070> all<00:06:02.250> of<00:06:02.310> those<00:06:02.550> wins<00:06:02.760> I<00:06:02.940> probably

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
even with all of those wins I probably

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.180 
even with all of those wins I probably
still<00:06:03.599> wouldn't<00:06:03.750> med<00:06:03.930> top<00:06:04.110> card<00:06:04.320> but<00:06:04.620> it<00:06:04.860> was<00:06:05.130> a

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
still wouldn't med top card but it was a

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.710 
still wouldn't med top card but it was a
good<00:06:05.310> battle<00:06:05.460> against<00:06:05.789> Tom<00:06:05.940> I<00:06:06.060> really<00:06:06.449> enjoyed

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
good battle against Tom I really enjoyed

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.570 
good battle against Tom I really enjoyed
it<00:06:06.840> I<00:06:06.930> hope<00:06:06.960> you<00:06:07.289> guys<00:06:07.440> did<00:06:07.680> too<00:06:07.860> and<00:06:08.070> I<00:06:08.340> will<00:06:08.490> be
