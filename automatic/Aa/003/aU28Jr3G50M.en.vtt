at various places and transfer fuel over

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.330 
at various places and transfer fuel over
so<00:01:58.750> that<00:01:58.990> I<00:01:59.020> can<00:01:59.380> supplement<00:01:59.679> the<00:01:59.979> amount<00:02:00.220> of

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
so that I can supplement the amount of

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.419 
so that I can supplement the amount of
fuel<00:02:00.789> that's<00:02:00.939> actually<00:02:01.299> in<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.509> wing<00:02:01.780> tanks

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
fuel that's actually in the wing tanks

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.279 
fuel that's actually in the wing tanks
and<00:02:03.429> it's<00:02:04.000> not<00:02:04.179> always<00:02:04.390> easy<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.840> know<00:02:04.929> where

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
and it's not always easy to know where

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
starting to use electric fences which I

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.070 
starting to use electric fences which I
use<00:04:32.880> this<00:04:33.060> sometimes<00:04:33.330> when<00:04:33.930> it's<00:04:34.020> a

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
use this sometimes when it's a

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.010 
use this sometimes when it's a
particularly<00:04:34.500> loaded<00:04:35.490> area<00:04:35.790> with<00:04:35.910> bear<00:04:36.180> as

long<00:04:37.200> as<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.410> bear<00:04:37.620> had<00:04:37.890> lots<00:04:38.100> of<00:04:38.220> salmon<00:04:38.520> and

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
long as the bear had lots of salmon and

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.840 
long as the bear had lots of salmon and
they're<00:04:38.970> fat<00:04:39.150> and<00:04:39.180> happy<00:04:39.480> no<00:04:40.170> problems<00:04:40.710> but<00:04:41.010> if

actually<00:04:46.290> can<00:04:46.440> help<00:04:46.620> quite<00:04:46.800> a<00:04:46.830> bit<00:04:46.920> they<00:04:47.160> put

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
actually can help quite a bit they put

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.580 
actually can help quite a bit they put
out<00:04:47.400> about<00:04:47.490> 7,000<00:04:48.210> volts<00:04:48.330> off<00:04:48.600> of<00:04:48.810> 2<00:04:49.140> D<00:04:49.350> cell

batteries and can be

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.990 
batteries and can be
for<00:04:53.270> some<00:04:53.810> of<00:04:53.870> those<00:04:53.990> situations<00:04:54.669> this<00:04:55.669> is<00:04:55.820> my

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
for some of those situations this is my

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.890 
for some of those situations this is my
tool<00:04:56.270> kit<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:57.669> it's<00:04:58.669> pretty<00:04:58.940> minimal<00:04:59.150> but<00:04:59.720> I'm

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
tool kit and it's pretty minimal but I'm

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.600 
tool kit and it's pretty minimal but I'm
able<00:05:00.199> to<00:05:00.290> take<00:05:00.500> apart<00:05:00.860> just<00:05:01.160> about<00:05:01.310> everything

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
able to take apart just about everything

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.939 
able to take apart just about everything
on<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:01.970> airplane<00:05:02.449> and<00:05:02.720> work<00:05:03.620> on<00:05:03.800> it<00:05:03.889> from

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
on the airplane and work on it from

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.830 
on the airplane and work on it from
there<00:05:04.040> so<00:05:04.490> that's<00:05:04.729> another<00:05:05.270> important<00:05:05.690> thing

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
there so that's another important thing

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
being able to service the airplane this

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.439 
being able to service the airplane this
airplane<00:05:08.720> is<00:05:09.220> fabric<00:05:10.220> coated<00:05:10.550> unlike<00:05:11.210> the

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.189 
metal sheet metal on a lot of other
airplanes<00:05:13.460> the<00:05:14.060> advantage<00:05:14.389> of<00:05:14.479> that<00:05:14.540> is<00:05:14.930> it<00:05:15.110> is

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
airplanes the advantage of that is it is

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.900 
airplanes the advantage of that is it is
easy<00:05:15.470> to<00:05:15.590> repair<00:05:15.889> you<00:05:16.040> can<00:05:16.070> take<00:05:16.310> a<00:05:16.340> knife<00:05:16.550> cut

easy to repair you can take a knife cut

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.510 
easy to repair you can take a knife cut
it<00:05:16.940> down<00:05:17.210> and<00:05:17.570> then<00:05:18.350> materials<00:05:18.949> inside<00:05:19.250> if<00:05:19.430> you

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
it down and then materials inside if you

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.330 
it down and then materials inside if you
need<00:05:19.699> to<00:05:19.910> if<00:05:20.060> it's<00:05:20.180> an<00:05:20.270> emergency<00:05:20.690> to<00:05:20.990> get<00:05:21.139> out

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
need to if it's an emergency to get out

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.189 
need to if it's an emergency to get out
closer<00:05:22.340> to<00:05:22.580> a<00:05:22.610> repair<00:05:22.940> facility<00:05:23.419> you<00:05:23.930> can<00:05:24.050> also

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
closer to a repair facility you can also

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.250 
closer to a repair facility you can also
put<00:05:24.740> duct<00:05:25.039> tape<00:05:25.130> over<00:05:25.460> this<00:05:25.610> fabric<00:05:26.090> which<00:05:26.690> is

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
put duct tape over this fabric which is

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.170 
put duct tape over this fabric which is
very<00:05:27.770> nice<00:05:28.010> it's<00:05:28.400> basically<00:05:28.820> a<00:05:28.910> way<00:05:29.120> to

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
very nice it's basically a way to

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.120 
very nice it's basically a way to
recover<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:29.840> airplane<00:05:30.320> if<00:05:30.470> things<00:05:30.650> get<00:05:30.800> torn

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
recover the airplane if things get torn

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.370 
recover the airplane if things get torn
bent<00:05:31.510> and<00:05:32.510> that's<00:05:32.690> one<00:05:32.810> of<00:05:32.840> the<00:05:32.930> advantages<00:05:33.320> of

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
bent and that's one of the advantages of

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.029 
bent and that's one of the advantages of
the<00:05:33.530> Super<00:05:33.830> Cub<00:05:34.930> so<00:05:35.930> I'm<00:05:36.199> about<00:05:36.320> five<00:05:36.710> minutes

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
the Super Cub so I'm about five minutes

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.969 
the Super Cub so I'm about five minutes
from<00:05:37.220> heading<00:05:37.699> out<00:05:37.820> and<00:05:38.440> I'm<00:05:39.440> gonna<00:05:39.590> pretty

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
from heading out and I'm gonna pretty

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.529 
from heading out and I'm gonna pretty
much<00:05:40.070> take<00:05:40.250> a<00:05:40.280> direct<00:05:40.520> route<00:05:40.760> to<00:05:40.789> Alaska<00:05:41.389> this

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
much take a direct route to Alaska this

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.760 
much take a direct route to Alaska this
is<00:05:41.690> not<00:05:41.840> a<00:05:41.870> fast<00:05:42.139> airplane<00:05:43.060> among<00:05:44.060> its<00:05:44.210> other

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
is not a fast airplane among its other

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.379 
is not a fast airplane among its other
attributes<00:05:45.770> speed<00:05:46.039> is<00:05:46.220> not<00:05:46.370> one<00:05:46.550> of<00:05:46.580> them<00:05:46.760> so

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
attributes speed is not one of them so

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.760 
attributes speed is not one of them so
it'll<00:05:47.720> take<00:05:47.900> me<00:05:48.020> a<00:05:48.050> couple<00:05:48.080> days<00:05:48.289> to<00:05:48.560> get<00:05:48.620> up

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
it'll take me a couple days to get up

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.159 
it'll take me a couple days to get up
there<00:05:48.949> and<00:05:49.100> I'll<00:05:49.940> basically<00:05:50.360> go<00:05:50.510> as<00:05:50.720> far<00:05:50.960> as

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
there and I'll basically go as far as

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.500 
there and I'll basically go as far as
the<00:05:52.010> day<00:05:52.130> allows<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:52.729> daylight<00:05:53.060> to<00:05:53.419> the

the day allows the daylight to the

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.540 
the day allows the daylight to the
weather<00:05:53.690> and<00:05:54.160> you<00:05:55.160> have<00:05:55.280> to<00:05:55.370> be<00:05:55.430> very

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
weather and you have to be very

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
weather and you have to be very
adaptable<00:05:56.169> in<00:05:57.169> this<00:05:57.410> type<00:05:57.620> of<00:05:57.650> flying<00:05:58.479> and<00:05:59.479> if

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
adaptable in this type of flying and if

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.610 
adaptable in this type of flying and if
you<00:05:59.660> get<00:05:59.810> to<00:05:59.900> some<00:06:00.080> point<00:06:00.289> where<00:06:00.320> the<00:06:00.470> weather

you get to some point where the weather
closes<00:06:01.039> down<00:06:01.220> it's<00:06:01.520> snowing<00:06:01.910> or<00:06:02.030> foggy<00:06:02.240> then
