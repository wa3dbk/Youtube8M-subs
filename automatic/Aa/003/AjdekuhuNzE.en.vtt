00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.810 

the<00:00:41.180> first<00:00:41.540> step<00:00:41.960> is<00:00:42.260> to<00:00:42.740> waterproof<00:00:43.550> the

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
the first step is to waterproof the

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.850 
the first step is to waterproof the
inside<00:00:44.330> of<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.600> box<00:00:44.840> because<00:00:45.260> right<00:00:45.530> now<00:00:45.680> it's

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
inside of the box because right now it's

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.010 
inside of the box because right now it's
just<00:00:45.920> cardboard<00:00:46.400> when<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:47.330> bottom<00:00:47.810> isn't

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
just cardboard when the bottom isn't

just cardboard when the bottom isn't
quite<00:00:48.320> as<00:00:48.470> stable<00:00:48.650> as<00:00:48.890> you<00:00:48.950> need<00:00:49.100> it<00:00:49.190> to<00:00:49.310> be
