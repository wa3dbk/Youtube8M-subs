00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:11.379
 Hello everyone and welcome to the site 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:13.030
 or bodybuilding points like it's jérôme 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.349
 and fanny of chebaa protein that you 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.270
 presents the series the different 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.250
 hypertrophy methods in bodybuilding 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.720
 today an interesting method that 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.210
 will not have to be confused with 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.830
 super 7 1 this is the post fatigue 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.300
 so the super 7 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.780
 it had already been specified these two 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.039
 exercises of the same type chained during 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.910
 these two basic exercises to both 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.920
 analytical exercises 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.140
 while there on the post rettig we go 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.909
 chaining a basic exercise with a 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.399
 analytical exercise the goal it is 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:42.010
 clear it's oversubscribed a 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.719
 muscle precisely from a 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.550
 basic movement that like his name 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.170
 the indicated is polite muscular polite at 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.819
 and articulars today so it's 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.819
 offered his present in presentation 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:54.309
 sorry with the biceps so two 

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:55.629
 movements the heart biceps on the 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.949
 basic movement 10 repetitions 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.329
 Sarko plasmic conjunctival hypertrophy 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.930
 chained behind with a winner of 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.450
 concentration for really solicited the 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.360
 anterior brakka an outer part 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.310
 biceps brachial biceps if repetition 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.310
 so relatively good it's gone 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.220
 post fatigue then cost 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.600
 fatigue it's true there are different 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.830
 variants 1 I will not explain everything to 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.080
 the time but it's true that 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.750
 the way we want to work 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.130
 father profits have little changed the number of 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.720
 repetitions in this case on 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.159
 hypertrophy it is obvious that it will 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.180
 between six and twelve months I have you a 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.250
 nice little variation 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.780
 since we will do more repetitions 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.100
 on the movement of the aser a tiny 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.590
 little bit about green energy exercise 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.330
 analytic so it's to vary the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.039
 hypertrophy method I show you 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.560
 two exercises a rather classic 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.979
 the basic exercise in this case in 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.759
 biceps as their altern alternates biceps 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.200
 alternating girl alter 10 repetitions 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.270
 connective hypertrophy sarko ranking 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.440
 because being led pretty much there then 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.020
 follow immediately 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.450
 relatively heavy 6 to him this is the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.890
 repetition on a biceps pulleys 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.929
 vis-à-vis before that one is interesting 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.970
 since I'm going to come and shoot my 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.290
 arm back to really solicit 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.909
 brachial biceps it's very interesting 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.650
 and bring back behind the ears so 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.849
 do not forget safety on the dumbbells 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.680
 play flex 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.000
 I come to get me here I think we 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.040
 to our relations 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.260
 I obviously keep my knees 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.790
 slightly bent then I'll go back 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.790
 with a slight rotation arm 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.210
 always marked a little lighter so much 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.470
 worse if they stop him so much to 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.470
 really solicited 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.150
 blow up 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.420
 attention the phase also explains 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.180
 important that the manager his letters 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.220
 I'm not relaxing my arms already for 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.920
 avoid a rocking motion while 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.069
 simply written too to protect themselves 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.590
 of the injury of the tian too fast of the 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.590
 right biceps 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.350
 and in the back bodyguard a man 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.670
 when we have not moved 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.490
 I will tell you that I already feel very 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.900
 very well I rest before always 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.550
 security position this time I'm going 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.870
 look for it a little visas not screw 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.910
 need to charge because there I you 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.500
 ensures that it's going to hurt me very much 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.300
 I will do but if it succeeds the 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.190
 petition I advance slightly 1 I 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.890
 protect my back I really spend them 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.310
 arm behind the head and I take 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.310
 release 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.870
 breath and always surface 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.870
 concentric 5 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:59.849
 nothing yet some second and 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:01.379
 last I recap 10 repetitions this 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.090
 mandate can go in blank and 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.819
 the ubisque ulation repetitions on 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.900
 you base 70% pretty much the rn6 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.760
 seaweed repetition on movement 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.260
 analytic knowing that even though I 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.310
 did my basic move before I did 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.500
 will not be 80% 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.079
 I will certainly be at about 70% 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.500
 of marracq maximum edition but saw the 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.940
 tired 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.989
 today by basic movements I 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.989
 current against iron 6-8
