impact<00:02:24.379> series<00:02:24.769> case<00:02:25.689> so<00:02:26.689> that<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:26.930> is<00:02:27.019> it

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
impact series case so that it is it

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.349 
impact series case so that it is it
looks<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.530> bit<00:02:27.620> uh<00:02:27.680> it<00:02:28.400> does<00:02:28.760> have<00:02:28.970> that<00:02:29.120> same

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:29.359 
looks a bit uh it does have that same

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.289 
looks a bit uh it does have that same
design<00:02:29.659> all<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.959> impact<00:02:30.290> series<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:31.090> side<00:02:32.090> is

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
design all the impact series the side is

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.910 
design all the impact series the side is
really<00:02:32.450> really<00:02:32.870> thin<00:02:33.140> so<00:02:33.409> when<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:33.680> grip<00:02:33.890> it

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920

I've<00:03:38.440> been<00:03:38.830> wanting<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.190> try<00:03:39.370> for<00:03:39.700> a<00:03:39.730> while

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
I've been wanting to try for a while

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.740 
I've been wanting to try for a while
I've<00:03:40.510> been<00:03:40.959> interested<00:03:41.920> in<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.310> most<00:03:42.750> this

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
I've been interested in the most this

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.570 
I've been interested in the most this
case<00:03:43.989> is<00:03:44.140> really<00:03:44.349> thin<00:03:44.590> guys<00:03:44.800> so<00:03:45.280> it's

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
case is really thin guys so it's

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.130 
case is really thin guys so it's
basically<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.180> two-piece<00:03:46.510> case<00:03:46.690> of<00:03:46.870> hybrid

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
basically a two-piece case of hybrid

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.839 
basically a two-piece case of hybrid
case<00:03:47.290> silicone<00:03:47.590> in<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:47.980> inside<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.580> then<00:03:48.760> the

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
case silicone in the inside and then the

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.250 
case silicone in the inside and then the
hard<00:03:49.030> on<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.360> outside<00:03:49.390> it's<00:03:49.840> like<00:03:49.959> a<00:03:49.989> reverse

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
hard on the outside it's like a reverse

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.500 
hard on the outside it's like a reverse
of<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:51.370> defender<00:03:51.880> sup<00:03:52.120> with<00:03:52.239> less<00:03:52.390> protection

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
of the defender sup with less protection

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.559 
of the defender sup with less protection
and<00:03:55.510> let's<00:03:55.900> see<00:03:56.580> so<00:03:57.580> hybrid<00:03:57.880> case<00:03:58.120> got<00:03:58.420> this

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
and let's see so hybrid case got this

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.420 
and let's see so hybrid case got this
like<00:03:58.750> matte<00:03:59.019> plastic<00:03:59.319> finish<00:03:59.860> with<00:04:00.190> otterbox

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
like matte plastic finish with otterbox

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.539 
like matte plastic finish with otterbox
on<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.790> back<00:04:00.940> this<00:04:01.480> is<00:04:01.629> very<00:04:01.870> thin<00:04:02.370> it<00:04:03.370> makes

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
on the back this is very thin it makes

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:04.979 
on the back this is very thin it makes
these<00:04:03.700> for<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:03.940> iphone<00:04:04.269> too<00:04:04.450> so<00:04:04.660> you<00:04:04.780> get<00:04:04.900> the

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
these for the iphone too so you get the

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.070 
these for the iphone too so you get the

might<00:05:09.789> actually<00:05:09.970> be<00:05:10.210> the<00:05:10.389> case<00:05:10.539> I<00:05:10.690> might<00:05:10.840> be

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
might actually be the case I might be

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.390 
might actually be the case I might be
using<00:05:11.139> because<00:05:11.440> it<00:05:11.560> is<00:05:11.680> it's<00:05:11.919> not<00:05:12.070> even<00:05:12.310> that

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
using because it is it's not even that

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.909 
using because it is it's not even that
it's<00:05:12.520> not<00:05:12.669> that<00:05:12.729> bulky<00:05:13.270> this<00:05:14.260> is<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:14.530> probably

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
it's not that bulky this is the probably

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.490 
it's not that bulky this is the probably
the<00:05:15.010> thinnest<00:05:15.520> either<00:05:16.389> the<00:05:16.539> impact<00:05:16.930> series<00:05:17.320> or

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
the thinnest either the impact series or

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.029 
the thinnest either the impact series or
the<00:05:18.690> commuter<00:05:19.690> series<00:05:19.840> or<00:05:20.200> the<00:05:20.229> dinner<00:05:20.710> out<00:05:20.979> of

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
the commuter series or the dinner out of

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:22.320 
the commuter series or the dinner out of
the<00:05:21.130> two<00:05:21.340> one<00:05:21.460> of<00:05:21.550> these<00:05:21.669> two<00:05:21.940> are<00:05:22.030> the<00:05:22.150> thinner

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
the two one of these two are the thinner

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.690 
the two one of these two are the thinner
ones<00:05:22.690> but<00:05:23.289> the<00:05:23.440> commuter<00:05:23.680> series<00:05:23.889> is<00:05:24.250> like<00:05:24.400> in

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
ones but the commuter series is like in

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.240 
ones but the commuter series is like in
the<00:05:24.910> middle<00:05:25.060> of<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.630> impact<00:05:26.440> series<00:05:26.740> and<00:05:26.950> the

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
the middle of the impact series and the

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.300 
the middle of the impact series and the
defender<00:05:28.180> series<00:05:28.300> i<00:05:28.510> would<00:05:28.630> say<00:05:28.780> so<00:05:29.160> so<00:05:30.160> far

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
defender series i would say so so far

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.830 
defender series i would say so so far
this<00:05:30.460> might<00:05:30.610> looks<00:05:30.970> like<00:05:31.120> it<00:05:31.240> might<00:05:31.360> be<00:05:31.389> one<00:05:31.780> of

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
this might looks like it might be one of

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.870 
this might looks like it might be one of
