wires that are running from the battery
tray<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.189> trigger<00:00:26.640> down<00:00:26.939> there<00:00:27.300> but<00:00:28.230> they

do disconnect you'll notice there's a

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.330 
do disconnect you'll notice there's a
little<00:00:29.849> plug<00:00:30.510> over<00:00:30.869> here<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:32.070> can<00:00:32.189> just

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
little plug over here you can just

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.250 
little plug over here you can just
disconnect<00:00:32.579> those<00:00:32.880> two<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.020> shells

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
disconnect those two and have the shells

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.090 
disconnect those two and have the shells
separate<00:00:35.070> from<00:00:35.460> each<00:00:35.790> other<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.660> wonderful

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
separate from each other it's wonderful

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.660 
separate from each other it's wonderful
this<00:00:38.850> shell<00:00:39.210> disconnects<00:00:39.899> from<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.440> side<00:00:40.739> by

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
this shell disconnects from this side by

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.840 
this shell disconnects from this side by
way<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:41.969> three<00:00:42.570> small<00:00:42.870> screws<00:00:43.170> over<00:00:43.440> here<00:00:43.890> that

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
way of three small screws over here that

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.310 
way of three small screws over here that
I<00:00:44.879> took<00:00:45.000> out<00:00:45.270> from<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.660> inside<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.170> shell

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
I took out from the inside of the shell

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.290 
I took out from the inside of the shell
and<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:47.219> other<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:47.550> comes<00:00:47.760> out<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.149> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
and the other one comes out it's just a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.490 
and the other one comes out it's just a
little<00:00:48.450> more<00:00:48.570> labor-intensive<00:00:48.809> because<00:00:49.350> this

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
little more labor-intensive because this

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.090 
little more labor-intensive because this
is<00:00:49.620> where<00:00:49.770> all<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.010> your<00:00:50.489> guts<00:00:50.850> are<00:00:51.800> first<00:00:52.800> up

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
is where all of your guts are first up

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.400 
is where all of your guts are first up
the<00:00:53.789> rocket<00:00:54.270> launcher<00:00:54.539> because<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.870> know<00:00:55.110> it's

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
the rocket launcher because I know it's

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.439 
the rocket launcher because I know it's
kind<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.770> well<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.850> everyone's<00:00:57.149> review

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
kind of well it's for everyone's review

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.369 
kind of well it's for everyone's review
it<00:00:57.600> kind<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.780> seems<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.199> thing<00:00:58.350> that

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
it kind of seems like the thing that

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.900 
it kind of seems like the thing that
needs<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> little<00:00:58.710> more<00:00:58.890> oomph<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.370> now<00:00:59.550> we<00:00:59.609> can

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
needs a little more oomph and now we can

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.750 
needs a little more oomph and now we can
see<00:01:00.180> why<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.559> weak<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:03.320> can<00:01:04.320> literally

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
see why it is so weak I can literally

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.469 
see why it is so weak I can literally
jiggle<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:07.140> plunger<00:01:07.920> head<00:01:08.100> inside<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.299> this

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
jiggle the plunger head inside of this

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.000 
jiggle the plunger head inside of this
massive<00:01:10.020> tube<00:01:11.659> just<00:01:12.659> increasing<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> seal<00:01:13.770> on

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
massive tube just increasing the seal on

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.190 
massive tube just increasing the seal on
this<00:01:14.280> should<00:01:14.820> increase<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.240> power<00:01:15.600> because

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
this should increase the power because

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.590 
this should increase the power because
you'll<00:01:16.350> have<00:01:16.470> more<00:01:16.920> compression<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.970> it

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
you'll have more compression and it

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.390 
you'll have more compression and it
won't<00:01:18.750> lose<00:01:18.960> as<00:01:19.140> much<00:01:19.290> air<00:01:19.590> when<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.979> go<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.189> go

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
won't lose as much air when you go to go

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.330 
won't lose as much air when you go to go
to<00:01:20.790> thunk<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:22.500> only<00:01:22.680> thing<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.979> I'm<00:01:23.070> worried

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
to thunk the only thing that I'm worried

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.910 
to thunk the only thing that I'm worried
about<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.549> when<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.030> go<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.210> prime<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.740> is

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
about is when you go to prime it this is

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.210 
about is when you go to prime it this is
gonna<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.220> sucking<00:01:26.640> air<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.979> because<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.130> not

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
gonna be sucking air in because it's not

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.789 
gonna be sucking air in because it's not
really<00:01:29.460> gonna<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.990> anywhere<00:01:30.990> else<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.320> pull

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
really gonna have anywhere else to pull

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.499 
really gonna have anywhere else to pull
area<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.159> guess<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.520> got<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.790> little<00:01:33.000> gap<00:01:33.299> up

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
area I guess it's got this little gap up

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.460 
area I guess it's got this little gap up
here<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.590> whatever<00:01:35.930> someone<00:01:36.930> I'm<00:01:37.140> sure<00:01:37.320> we'll

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
here but whatever someone I'm sure we'll

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.080 
here but whatever someone I'm sure we'll
figure<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.860> out<00:01:37.920> smarter<00:01:38.579> than<00:01:38.670> I

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
figure that out smarter than I

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.420 
figure that out smarter than I
you<00:01:39.630> could<00:01:39.810> easily<00:01:39.930> there's<00:01:40.799> plenty<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.220> room

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
you could easily there's plenty of room

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.370 
you could easily there's plenty of room
in<00:01:41.549> here<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.790> put<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.420> Panther<00:01:42.869> internals

adapter guy but you'll notice it's just

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.240 
adapter guy but you'll notice it's just
one<00:02:32.460> big<00:02:32.670> piece<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:32.940> plastic<00:02:33.950> that's<00:02:34.950> kind<00:02:35.160> of

one big piece of plastic that's kind of

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.370 
one big piece of plastic that's kind of
interesting<00:02:35.790> how<00:02:36.180> they<00:02:36.330> did<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.660> guess<00:02:37.290> what

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
interesting how they did that guess what

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.690 
interesting how they did that guess what
the<00:02:37.530> limited<00:02:37.860> space<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.220> they<00:02:38.310> have<00:02:38.490> they

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
the limited space that they have they

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.390 
the limited space that they have they
did<00:02:39.030> what<00:02:39.180> they<00:02:39.270> could<00:02:39.950> anyway<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.160> rest<00:02:41.250> of

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
did what they could anyway the rest of

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.270 
did what they could anyway the rest of
the<00:02:41.460> blaster<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:42.030> your<00:02:42.270> standard<00:02:43.160> what<00:02:44.160> we've

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
the blaster is your standard what we've

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.620 
the blaster is your standard what we've
come<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.460> expect<00:02:44.580> at<00:02:44.910> least<00:02:45.060> in<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.210> last<00:02:45.330> year

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
come to expect at least in the last year

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.680 
come to expect at least in the last year
or<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:45.780> for<00:02:46.350> flywheel<00:02:46.890> setups<00:02:47.640> with<00:02:47.850> all<00:02:48.330> these

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
or so for flywheel setups with all these

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.420 
or so for flywheel setups with all these
crazy<00:02:49.080> mechanisms<00:02:49.710> for<00:02:49.920> locking<00:02:50.310> out<00:02:50.400> the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
crazy mechanisms for locking out the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.650 
crazy mechanisms for locking out the
trigger<00:02:50.730> you've<00:02:50.940> got<00:02:51.090> your<00:02:51.210> accelerator

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
trigger you've got your accelerator

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.700 
trigger you've got your accelerator
trigger<00:02:51.930> here<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.170> needs<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.410> come<00:02:52.500> down

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
trigger here that needs to come down

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.020 
trigger here that needs to come down
that<00:02:53.220> lowers<00:02:53.520> him<00:02:53.870> then<00:02:54.870> you've<00:02:55.050> got<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.350> clip

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
that lowers him then you've got the clip

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.820 
that lowers him then you've got the clip
which<00:02:57.030> needs<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.450> release<00:02:57.960> so<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.590> way<00:02:58.770> it

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
which needs to release so that way it

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:59.660 
which needs to release so that way it
knows<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.010> there's<00:02:59.190> something<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.550> there

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
knows that there's something in there

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.130 
knows that there's something in there
and<00:02:59.880> then<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.270> can<00:03:00.420> actually<00:03:00.540> do<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.780> trigger

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
and then you can actually do a trigger

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.040 
and then you can actually do a trigger
pull<00:03:01.460> without<00:03:02.460> that<00:03:02.880> in<00:03:03.120> there<00:03:03.300> or<00:03:03.840> without

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
pull without that in there or without

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.080 
pull without that in there or without
the<00:03:04.320> accelerator<00:03:04.860> in<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.310> won't<00:03:05.490> budge<00:03:05.790> at<00:03:05.970> all

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
the accelerator in it won't budge at all

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.720 
the accelerator in it won't budge at all
unless<00:03:06.390> you've<00:03:06.570> modified<00:03:06.960> it<00:03:07.640> but<00:03:08.640> yeah

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
unless you've modified it but yeah

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.760 
unless you've modified it but yeah
pretty<00:03:09.030> pretty<00:03:09.360> standard<00:03:10.050> stuff<00:03:10.350> in<00:03:10.500> here

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
pretty pretty standard stuff in here

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.860 
pretty pretty standard stuff in here
interesting<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.790> see<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.120> extra<00:03:12.600> space<00:03:12.840> that

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
interesting to see the extra space that

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.550 
interesting to see the extra space that
we<00:03:13.140> have<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.560> work<00:03:13.740> with<00:03:14.210> and<00:03:15.210> it<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.290> nice<00:03:16.530> that

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
we have to work with and it is nice that

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.220 
we have to work with and it is nice that
they've<00:03:17.090> you<00:03:18.090> know<00:03:18.120> they've<00:03:18.510> made<00:03:18.750> things<00:03:18.959> a

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
they've you know they've made things a

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.650 
they've you know they've made things a
little<00:03:19.380> bit<00:03:19.560> easier<00:03:19.740> for<00:03:20.370> at<00:03:20.910> least<00:03:21.090> painters

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
little bit easier for at least painters

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.100 
little bit easier for at least painters
to<00:03:21.959> work<00:03:22.140> with<00:03:22.380> which<00:03:22.650> i<00:03:22.890> think<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.280> nice<00:03:24.110> so
