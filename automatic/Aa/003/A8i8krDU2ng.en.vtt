um I had one open and here it is so this

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.100 
um I had one open and here it is so this
is<00:00:46.440> what<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> table<00:00:47.010> looks<00:00:47.039> like<00:00:47.340> it's<00:00:48.110> pink

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
is what the table looks like it's pink

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.869 
is what the table looks like it's pink
wrapper<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.710> just<00:00:49.950> has<00:00:50.100> these<00:00:50.309> really<00:00:50.640> pretty

yellow flowers um

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.209 
yellow flowers um
I<00:00:53.219> think<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.600> heavy<00:00:54.870> flow<00:00:55.590> they<00:00:55.949> have

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
I think on the heavy flow they have

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.860 
I think on the heavy flow they have
green<00:00:56.640> flowers<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> overnight

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
green flowers and on the overnight

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.080 
green flowers and on the overnight
they're<00:00:58.199> Orange<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.739> think<00:00:59.609> I'm<00:00:59.760> not<00:00:59.940> sure

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
they're Orange I think I'm not sure

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.030 
they're Orange I think I'm not sure
though<00:01:00.980> so<00:01:02.989> this<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.530> path<00:01:04.739> looks

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
though so this is what the path looks

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.250 
though so this is what the path looks
like<00:01:06.350> it's<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:08.790> exact<00:01:09.299> same<00:01:09.510> thing<00:01:09.810> as<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
like it's the exact same thing as the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.240 
like it's the exact same thing as the
always<00:01:10.680> infinity<00:01:12.020> except<00:01:13.020> they're<00:01:13.740> scented

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
always infinity except they're scented

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.580 
always infinity except they're scented
and<00:01:14.490> they<00:01:14.729> smell<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.630> good<00:01:16.220> it's<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:18.590> light

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and they smell so good it's a light

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.859 
and they smell so good it's a light
clean<00:01:20.130> set<00:01:21.140> but<00:01:22.140> they<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.409> smell<00:01:22.710> delicious

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
clean set but they just smell delicious

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.859 
clean set but they just smell delicious
so<00:01:25.070> here<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> wings<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:27.119> has<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> sticker

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
so here on the wings it has a sticker

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.690 
so here on the wings it has a sticker
and<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.409> just<00:01:28.590> shows<00:01:28.860> which<00:01:29.189> way<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.670> front

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
and it just shows which way is the front

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.080 
and it just shows which way is the front
and<00:01:30.360> then<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.110> also<00:01:31.229> has<00:01:31.619> some<00:01:32.060> purple<00:01:33.060> flowers

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
and then it also has some purple flowers

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.620 
and then it also has some purple flowers
and<00:01:33.659> designs<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.040> wings<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:36.299> sticker

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
and designs on the wings and on sticker

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.300 
and designs on the wings and on sticker
and<00:01:37.909> these<00:01:38.909> feel<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.960> soft<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.950> they're<00:01:41.100> super

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and these feel so soft and they're super

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.679 
and these feel so soft and they're super
squishy<00:01:41.700> too<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.380> they<00:01:43.380> also<00:01:43.770> seem<00:01:44.689> super

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.160 
flexible and I think these would be
really<00:01:49.229> comfortable

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
really comfortable

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:58.969
