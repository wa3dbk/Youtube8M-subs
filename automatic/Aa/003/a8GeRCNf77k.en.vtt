00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.340
 hello good to all and sicam before people 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.500
 let's put ourselves here today on the map 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.390
 this one of the ruins because for me it is 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.020
 important with regard to what is the 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.850
 history of extinction of aliens 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.680
 look good I was here looking at the 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.750
 map because the ruins were here and in 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.560
 a principle because I did not know if hector 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.150
 Aztecs if this was beyond, but seeing 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.010
 this head here that I was talking about 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.070
 with less than you know my friend me nine 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.250
 Mexicans as it turns out that this 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.850
 head is the Olmec 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.250
 and the Olmec this civilization was the 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.410
 first the first one that was before the 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.440
 Mayas and the Aztecs 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:57.370
 these heads represent the 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.199
 Olmec civilization worth them 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.309
 they used many volcanic stones and 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:06.470
 that then commercialized a lot with 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.020
 minerals from land 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.400
 volcanic is not why you see here the 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.430
 volcanoes would be the background 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.590
 Well, I wanted to say a more or less 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.690
 well that the origin of this map of 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.720
 where does it come from because many 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.970
 surely it will have happened like me 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.390
 you will have made a little head 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.979
 not a mess and well, what do they have to 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.009
 see the Olmecs with all this history 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.250
 of those of the aliens of those of 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.250
 extinction 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.890
 in my point of view it is as always 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.680
 you know I can make a mistake but good 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.060
 here we are all for our opinion 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.420
 and I want to show you this 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.130
 look at this well, you know what it is 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.630
 the predictor not the image of predator 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.150
 because this image is here you go to 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.060
 say good this is that they give you in 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.730
 multiplayer the streak is there you get the 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.850
 predator but that goes further goes 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.500
 beyond that simple streak 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.709
 well that they did here a 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:13.120
 monument to the predator this according to my 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:15.270
 point of view and think if the Olmecs 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.620
 they were before the Aztecs and the Mayans 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:24.070
 and as you already know in the cinematics of 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.400
 extinction you see the calendar and not only 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.360
 the cinematic but otherwise on the map 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.900
 night falls the Aztec calendar is seen 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.490
 making reference to the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.080
 apocalypse that I was going to see worth 11 of the 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.190
 5 apocalypse 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.530
 well then 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.810
 I believe that from the first moment 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.380
 Olmecs already knew of the existence of 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.320
 these beings 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.320
 remember how good you know they are 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.120
 cryptids but before those cryptids 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.760
 that were inside the earth 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.730
 living 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.480
 they had to come from somewhere 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.400
 from where outside the earth 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.330
 aliens were aliens in a 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.080
 principle and I think that this monument 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.080
 what they did here was due to that 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.769
 to what they saw that these 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.590
 beings that this this civilization saw 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:24.519
 before they went inside the 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.650
 earth those cristinos is worth I think that 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.170
 It could be that way, I think I could 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.810
 be like that then they saw these 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.450
 beings and they made this monument 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.879
 here you see the calendar up here 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.750
 as if that were not a prophecy 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:43.209
 here you see again these again 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.180
 remains of the cristinos that what 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.129
 they were here that they died 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.099
 who killed them looks like they were 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.840
 Here, too, the 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.140
 they had to kill him because if you can not 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.930
 supposedly yes 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.890
 they would have killed them not, or maybe 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.350
 they became extinct this civilization 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.990
 civilization was extinguished by this 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.510
 aliens for these critics we are 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.120
 talking about this is a game it's worth 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.830
 it's not reality but good talking 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.560
 of the game because it could have been like that 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:22.430
 here you see him again they made him another 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:26.360
 they made monuments to this these 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:31.400
 aliens here to the predictor predator 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.980
 you looked here people here you have my point 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.940
 in view of what all this is that 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:40.310
 surely they saw them coming and 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.750
 that's why they put him there they did 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.610
 the monuments 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.620
 here it is seen again as a kind of 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.190
 altar again you see those heads 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:52.040
 there you see again there that cryptic 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.960
 there again it would be the remains 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.730
 of the cristinos and posts in the nest 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.770
 this good that you already know that we give and 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.880
 hurt us he got that from the eggs a 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.100
 egg devastation but good 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.160
 here is in the ruin here is your 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.920
 possible connection his I think about his 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.720
 direct connection with what is the 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.120
 history of extinction 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.980
 what do you think you give like 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.980
 subscribe and until the next video
