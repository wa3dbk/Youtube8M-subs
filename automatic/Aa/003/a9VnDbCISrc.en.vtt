00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.680 
parallel parking a big rig is often it's
yeah<00:02:50.890> it's<00:02:51.250> kind<00:02:51.459> of<00:02:51.519> cruel<00:02:51.790> actually<00:02:52.330> do<00:02:52.450> you

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
know cuz everything goes the opposite

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.110 
know cuz everything goes the opposite
direction<00:03:07.360> of<00:03:07.780> course<00:03:08.019> so<00:03:08.230> it's<00:03:08.350> like<00:03:08.530> really

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
like practicing it but I've accomplished

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.819 
like practicing it but I've accomplished
it<00:03:18.940> twice<00:03:19.239> so<00:03:19.540> I'm<00:03:19.780> just<00:03:19.959> I'm<00:03:20.140> just<00:03:20.200> running

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
it twice so I'm just I'm just running

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.890 
it twice so I'm just I'm just running
with<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:21.010> that's<00:03:21.610> that's<00:03:21.910> enough<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.660> do<00:03:22.810> it

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
with that that's that's enough to do it

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.360 
with that that's that's enough to do it
twice<00:03:22.989> when<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.650> leave<00:03:23.829> them<00:03:23.980> when<00:03:24.130> you<00:03:26.370> do

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
twice when you leave them when you do

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.800 
twice when you leave them when you do
you<00:03:27.459> think<00:03:27.670> from<00:03:27.910> an<00:03:28.000> environment<00:03:28.540> where<00:03:28.690> that

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
you think from an environment where that

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.420 
you think from an environment where that
would<00:03:28.959> be<00:03:29.079> a<00:03:29.110> thing<00:03:29.410> that<00:03:29.470> I<00:03:29.769> do<00:03:29.860> you<00:03:30.310> know<00:03:30.400> I
