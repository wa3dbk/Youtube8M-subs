00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
deltoid which is the shoulder right here

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.890 
deltoid which is the shoulder right here
and<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:35.369> tricep<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:35.790> tends<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.450> be<00:01:36.570> where<00:01:36.780> we

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
and the tricep this tends to be where we

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.130 
and the tricep this tends to be where we
get<00:01:37.079> chunks<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.970> fascia<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.329> look<00:01:39.840> like
