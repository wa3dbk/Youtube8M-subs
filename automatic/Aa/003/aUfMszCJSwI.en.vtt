so<00:05:15.750> for<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.110> interactive<00:05:16.470> towel<00:05:16.830> we<00:05:17.250> have

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
so for the interactive towel we have

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.540 
so for the interactive towel we have
more<00:05:17.789> benefit<00:05:18.330> since<00:05:18.570> here<00:05:18.900> for<00:05:19.620> example<00:05:20.010> so

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
more benefit since here for example so

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.420 
more benefit since here for example so
for<00:05:20.760> the<00:05:20.849> Windows<00:05:21.210> Phone<00:05:21.449> and<00:05:21.690> the<00:05:22.139> slaves<00:05:22.470> in

for the Windows Phone and the slaves in

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.120 
for the Windows Phone and the slaves in
those<00:05:23.639> devices<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:25.139> third-party<00:05:25.560> developer

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
those devices the third-party developer

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.400 
those devices the third-party developer
just<00:05:26.400> into<00:05:26.820> denying<00:05:27.510> one<00:05:27.870> version<00:05:28.260> of<00:05:28.320> the

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
just into denying one version of the

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.159 
just into denying one version of the
Windows<00:05:28.710> Phone<00:05:29.099> inter<00:05:29.820> interface<00:05:30.419> and<00:05:30.690> then

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
Windows Phone inter interface and then

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.170 
Windows Phone inter interface and then
directly<00:05:31.680> switch<00:05:32.010> down<00:05:32.190> to<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:32.699> interactive

directly switch down to the interactive
tile<00:05:33.539> interface<00:05:34.020> that<00:05:34.620> saves<00:05:34.979> more<00:05:35.280> color<00:05:35.550> for

tile interface that saves more color for
the<00:05:35.970> third-party<00:05:36.360> developer<00:05:37.050> so<00:05:37.680> in<00:05:37.889> this<00:05:38.039> way

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
the third-party developer so in this way

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.460 
the third-party developer so in this way
we<00:05:38.639> can<00:05:38.760> also<00:05:38.880> leverage<00:05:39.180> in<00:05:39.539> tactile<00:05:39.990> as<00:05:40.229> the

we can also leverage in tactile as the
