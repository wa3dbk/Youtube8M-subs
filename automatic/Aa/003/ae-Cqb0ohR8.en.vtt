00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.979
 good these methods still did not live well 

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:06.290
 it seems that today begins the day 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:07.879
 pretty strong on the subject of on the subject 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.290
 of the rumors thing that I did not like in 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:10.670
 one part I like the other I do not 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.410
 would like them to be confirmed because the 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.490
 truth is that the rumor that comes now 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.440
 the truth is that it would be quite 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.530
 interesting good this morning we have 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.150
 had the rumor of joy fourth redemption 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.670
 not an image that seems to be emerging 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.070
 from nothing by the network and good seems to be 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.970
 that a new image has also emerged 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.650
 from jak and daxter 44 that is basically 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.180
 as they call it in the image image 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.190
 you have the description as I say it would be a 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.319
 game for playstation 4 and it would be 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.329
 developed again by naughty dog ​​in 

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:40.489
 the image is quite similar in the 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.860
 appearance to the previous photo as shown 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.790
 before joy keep 21s 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.130
 how to say this picture from outside 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.280
 of television as it seems or something by the 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.710
 Not crooked style also with an appearance 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.630
 well a bit of filtration what more 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.250
 doubt a little the truth more doubt 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.200
 enough because you can only do it can 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.420
 having done anybody the truth is a 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.070
 more and that may have done any 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.630
 editor so a little competent not for 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.630
 be a way is not very difficult to 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.220
 make in the 21st century on the internet like this 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.900
 How good I think in these times 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.420
 trusting in this kind of thing is pretty 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.100
 difficult but good I'm here to 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.420
 inform from type of things and the truth 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.550
 that is hitting pretty hard in 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.200
 internet what are so many 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.060
 images because both one game and another 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.660
 Well, it would be nice to have them 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.160
 back and more than anything and four the 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.750
 true that jak and daxter has been a 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.490
 saga that I liked a lot and good 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.250
 You know my passion for naughty dog 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.560
 done yes yes I will decide maybe 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.000
 between xbox one crisis in four pieces 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.040
 will make the difference of naughty dog 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.820
 not the games that are going to take and 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.490
 they really are 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.040
 those that really are worth it 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.150
 not always many always much more 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.100
 where to choose and such but good 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.690
 basically, it's a developer that 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.390
 love since its inception do not record 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.130
 disco tlax ter uncharted and this 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.979
 last of the stanzas has been incredible 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.540
 good for those who know him 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.880
 jak and daxter basically because the 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.920
 first in proportion of platforms not 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.440
 it's just not with a touch a little bit 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.510
 child in dialogues and such the 2 little no 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.770
 had dialog much more adults has not 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.690
 changed a little bit a bit 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.400
 radical turning unless some 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.980
 in a third-person shooter and 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.050
 giving a little touch of sandbox 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.610
 without forgetting the platforms a little 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.130
 not that they would leave like this a little and well 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.250
 the 3 is something similar to 2 no and good 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.540
 because it is already 4 as it would be because I do not know no 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.940
 you know nothing about the game basically 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.980
 we can put the images the logo and 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.720
 that would go out for dams are four like that 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.430
 that we must not expect good is 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.019
 then the only thing I can say the only 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.610
 that touches but we are sure that now 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.380
 very many people are becoming 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.630
 nails possibly because they are waiting 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.190
 the game anxiously we will not see to see if 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.470
 announces it I do not think so 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.960
 filtration has been this way does it 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.530
 hours needed 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.260
 in announcing it or not announcing it I do not know if 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.910
 will be decided to do it in gamescom or in 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.230
 some other videogame fair but 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.640
 well we have to wait like I go back to 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.630
 repeat and nothing the next motion 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.630
 video will be close to all
