00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
by itself male Jets obviously a fighter

by itself male Jets obviously a fighter
jet<00:01:55.380> type<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.950> vehicle<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:57.210> bezera<00:01:57.659> who

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
jet type of a vehicle and the bezera who

jet type of a vehicle and the bezera who
knows<00:01:58.020> what<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.259> would<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.710> I'm<00:01:58.890> assuming<00:01:59.250> it

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
knows what that would be I'm assuming it

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.380 
knows what that would be I'm assuming it
would<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.520> some<00:01:59.729> sort<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.969> an<00:02:00.090> attack

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
would be some sort of an attack

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.139 
would be some sort of an attack
helicopter<00:02:00.740> maybe<00:02:01.740> something<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.880> know<00:02:03.119> a

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
helicopter maybe something like I know a

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.280 
helicopter maybe something like I know a
lot<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.360> people<00:02:03.420> were<00:02:03.630> throwing<00:02:03.810> around<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
lot of people were throwing around the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.670 
lot of people were throwing around the
hunter<00:02:05.479> who<00:02:06.479> knows<00:02:06.659> exactly<00:02:06.960> what<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.469> could

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
hunter who knows exactly what this could

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.440 
hunter who knows exactly what this could
be<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.310> said<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.610> Hydra<00:02:08.940> was<00:02:09.060> already

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
be but like I said the Hydra was already

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
be but like I said the Hydra was already
in<00:02:09.629> san<00:02:09.899> andreas

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.020 
in san andreas
doesn't<00:02:12.470> really<00:02:12.530> make<00:02:13.280> it<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:13.610> out<00:02:13.820> of<00:02:13.970> the

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
doesn't really make it that out of the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.520 
doesn't really make it that out of the
thing<00:02:14.270> that<00:02:14.480> they<00:02:14.660> would<00:02:14.810> try<00:02:15.020> to<00:02:15.080> bring<00:02:15.380> an

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
thing that they would try to bring an

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.670 
thing that they would try to bring an
old-school<00:02:16.190> vehicle<00:02:16.610> into<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.240> new<00:02:17.510> GTA<00:02:18.410> 5

old-school vehicle into the new GTA 5

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.260 
old-school vehicle into the new GTA 5
because<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.340> know<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.730> lot<00:02:19.880> of<00:02:19.940> people<00:02:20.060> really

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
because I know a lot of people really

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.810 
because I know a lot of people really
like<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.900> older<00:02:21.290> vehicles<00:02:21.740> they<00:02:22.340> like<00:02:22.520> seeing

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
like the older vehicles they like seeing

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.760 
like the older vehicles they like seeing
old<00:02:23.060> things<00:02:23.390> in<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.810> new<00:02:23.990> game<00:02:24.230> see<00:02:24.530> what<00:02:24.650> it

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
old things in the new game see what it

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.560 
old things in the new game see what it
would<00:02:24.890> be<00:02:24.920> like<00:02:25.100> you<00:02:25.610> know<00:02:25.760> like<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:26.090> brand-new

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
would be like you know like a brand-new

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.110 
would be like you know like a brand-new
version<00:02:26.810> of<00:02:27.140> it<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:27.700> doesn't<00:02:28.700> surprise<00:02:29.090> me

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
version of it so doesn't surprise me

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.090 
version of it so doesn't surprise me
that<00:02:29.360> there<00:02:29.720> would<00:02:29.870> be<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:30.020> sort<00:02:30.440> of<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.590> replica

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
that there would be a sort of a replica

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.950 
that there would be a sort of a replica
or<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.430> remake<00:02:31.970> of<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.360> particular<00:02:32.600> vehicle

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
or a remake of the particular vehicle

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.590 
or a remake of the particular vehicle
that<00:02:33.260> was<00:02:33.350> already<00:02:33.590> in<00:02:33.830> GTA<00:02:34.640> san<00:02:34.940> andreas<00:02:34.970> so

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
that was already in GTA san andreas so

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.449 
that was already in GTA san andreas so
that's<00:02:36.260> pretty<00:02:36.470> interesting<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:37.070> note<00:02:37.250> as

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
that's pretty interesting to note as

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.460 
that's pretty interesting to note as
well<00:02:37.730> as<00:02:37.940> going<00:02:38.390> down<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.690> list<00:02:38.840> here<00:02:39.140> Navy

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.960 
green teal pink red bag so not too sure
exactly<00:02:47.750> what<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.110> would<00:02:48.470> mean<00:02:48.790> but<00:02:49.790> if<00:02:49.910> I

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
exactly what that would mean but if I

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.760 
exactly what that would mean but if I
had<00:02:50.090> to<00:02:50.180> take<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.360> wild<00:02:50.570> guess<00:02:50.690> maybe<00:02:51.380> it<00:02:51.620> has<00:02:51.739> to

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
had to take a wild guess maybe it has to

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.670 
had to take a wild guess maybe it has to
do<00:02:52.070> with<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.910> type<00:02:53.150> of<00:02:53.320> parachute<00:02:54.320> that<00:02:54.500> you

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
do with the type of parachute that you

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.670 
do with the type of parachute that you
have<00:02:54.920> once<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:56.750> know<00:02:56.900> are<00:02:56.959> in<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.350> actual

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
have once you you know are in the actual

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.110 
have once you you know are in the actual
flight<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.280> you<00:02:58.340> have<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.610> eject<00:02:58.730> or

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
flight and you have to eject or

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.340 
flight and you have to eject or
something<00:02:59.420> like<00:02:59.510> that<00:02:59.570> I'm<00:02:59.810> assuming<00:03:00.140> that's

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
something like that I'm assuming that's

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.500 
something like that I'm assuming that's
what<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.739> would<00:03:00.830> be<00:03:00.860> but<00:03:01.250> pretty<00:03:02.000> interesting

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
what it would be but pretty interesting

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.270 
what it would be but pretty interesting
to<00:03:02.630> note<00:03:02.810> that<00:03:02.840> they<00:03:03.200> are<00:03:03.470> adding<00:03:03.800> more<00:03:03.980> stuff

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
to note that they are adding more stuff

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.920 
to note that they are adding more stuff
for<00:03:04.970> this<00:03:05.590> particular<00:03:07.180> flight<00:03:08.180> school<00:03:08.540> now<00:03:08.720> my

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
for this particular flight school now my

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.300 
for this particular flight school now my
guess<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.380> I<00:03:09.470> believe<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.950> this<00:03:10.070> would<00:03:10.280> be

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
guess is I believe that this would be

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.550 
guess is I believe that this would be
added<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.910> story<00:03:11.450> mode<00:03:11.720> for<00:03:11.959> some<00:03:12.140> reason<00:03:12.500> I

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
added to story mode for some reason I

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.170 
added to story mode for some reason I
just<00:03:12.590> have<00:03:12.860> a<00:03:12.890> hunch<00:03:13.100> it's<00:03:13.670> gonna<00:03:13.820> be<00:03:14.000> for

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
just have a hunch it's gonna be for

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.090 
just have a hunch it's gonna be for
story<00:03:14.450> mode<00:03:14.630> if<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:14.959> doesn't<00:03:15.170> get<00:03:15.470> happen<00:03:15.920> but

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
story mode if it doesn't get happen but

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.920 
story mode if it doesn't get happen but
you<00:03:16.610> know<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:17.120> fact<00:03:17.330> that<00:03:17.390> they<00:03:17.540> keep<00:03:17.690> adding

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
you know the fact that they keep adding

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.900 
you know the fact that they keep adding
more<00:03:18.080> files<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.950> this<00:03:19.100> whole<00:03:19.280> pilot<00:03:19.670> school

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
more files to this whole pilot school

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.090 
more files to this whole pilot school
thing<00:03:20.150> when<00:03:20.630> I<00:03:20.660> first<00:03:20.959> made<00:03:21.410> this<00:03:21.620> video<00:03:21.950> in

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
thing when I first made this video in

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.160 
thing when I first made this video in
the<00:03:22.160> one<00:03:22.310> point<00:03:22.549> 13<00:03:22.940> you<00:03:23.510> know<00:03:23.630> it<00:03:23.780> was<00:03:23.900> kind<00:03:23.959> of

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
the one point 13 you know it was kind of

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.479 
the one point 13 you know it was kind of
still<00:03:24.380> raw<00:03:24.620> there<00:03:24.890> wasn't<00:03:25.130> really<00:03:25.190> too<00:03:25.459> much

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
still raw there wasn't really too much

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.640 
still raw there wasn't really too much
to<00:03:25.880> it<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:26.480> now<00:03:26.600> there's<00:03:26.720> more<00:03:26.840> files<00:03:27.350> so

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
to it and now there's more files so

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.100 
to it and now there's more files so
maybe<00:03:27.860> it<00:03:28.100> is<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.760> beginning<00:03:28.910> of<00:03:29.360> them<00:03:29.600> adding

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
maybe it is the beginning of them adding
