this<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.879> that's<00:00:53.970> why<00:00:54.120> they<00:00:54.239> run<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.629> long

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:10.270 
this is and that's why they run so long
because<00:00:55.080> they're<00:00:55.320> running<00:00:55.559> half<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.920> RPM

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.620 

there's<00:01:11.280> your<00:01:11.430> tank<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.150> still<00:01:12.420> there

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
there's your tank and it's still there

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.690 
there's your tank and it's still there
Wow<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.619> don't<00:01:13.799> use<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:13.920> very<00:01:14.100> much<00:01:14.250> because<00:01:14.580> you

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
Wow I don't use it very much because you

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.950 
Wow I don't use it very much because you
know<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.909> power<00:01:15.060> does<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.240> glide<00:01:15.479> much<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
know the power does the glide much and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.990 
know the power does the glide much and
they<00:01:16.020> say<00:01:16.140> events<00:01:16.470> for<00:01:16.650> hours<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.550> gallon<00:01:17.910> of

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
they say events for hours on a gallon of

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.660 
they say events for hours on a gallon of
fuel<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.990> that'll<00:01:19.320> use<00:01:19.410> a<00:01:19.440> lot<00:01:19.620> of<00:01:19.650> fuel<00:01:19.800> and<00:01:20.250> so

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
fuel so that'll use a lot of fuel and so

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.620 
fuel so that'll use a lot of fuel and so
that<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.910> great<00:01:21.090> investment

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
that was a great investment

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.780

oh yeah silver is fine it's like you

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.130 
oh yeah silver is fine it's like you
know<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.060> doesn't<00:01:24.390> get<00:01:24.510> old<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.930> as<00:01:25.110> a

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
know that doesn't get old that as a

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.570 
know that doesn't get old that as a
great<00:01:25.410> shelf<00:01:25.650> life<00:01:25.830> that's<00:01:26.070> my<00:01:26.190> diesel<00:01:26.490> is

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
great shelf life that's my diesel is

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.710 
great shelf life that's my diesel is
just<00:01:26.730> the<00:01:26.850> only<00:01:26.970> kind<00:01:27.300> of<00:01:27.360> thing<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.570> have

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
just the only kind of thing to have

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.480 
just the only kind of thing to have
because<00:01:28.020> gasoline<00:01:28.710> doesn't<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> shelf

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
because gasoline doesn't have a shelf

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.530
