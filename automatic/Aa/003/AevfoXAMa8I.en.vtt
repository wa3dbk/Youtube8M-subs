00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.630
 hello youtube friends as they are is 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.089
 because I'm fine I'm I'm topics 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:10.209
 two with the first tutorial to keep 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:12.789
 as you see in the update out of 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:15.190
 this new block this can only be 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.470
 get in the creative in the south just like 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.920
 no but some friends 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.670
 and I discovered a glitch 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.380
 for survival you can get it 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:33.180
 look at the following way 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.140
 get it that way they put 4 blocks 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.520
 A) Yes 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.520
 then put one here 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.210
 A) Yes 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.870
 because then later here we remove this is what 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.120
 what do we put 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.640
 a piston we remove another block 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.920
 here we put a block of these 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.019
 stone here we put two pistons and it got me 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.600
 forgot to put me the bucket or can we 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.230
 also a bucket of water in the bucket 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.170
 of water we put here 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:15.510
 ok here we put redstone 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.310
 and here we put this block that 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.320
 busy occupied forcibly this 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.560
 block because if you put this is not going to 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.170
 power only if you put this on this 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.540
 block here then two stone blocks 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.070
 here 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.370
 and here you put a torch 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.270
 and then here you put a torch as you see 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.400
 already the block came out and could thus be able 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.770
 chop it and you can have the amount of 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.440
 blocks that you want for those who 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:49.240
 They did not understand how he can return to 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:52.320
 do they put four blocks like this online 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.490
 straight then you put one like that 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.610
 then well other blocks in the blocks 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.660
 next and then little these two 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.229
 blocks you put a dispense an expelled 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.060
 like one of this mobile I forgot 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:13.040
 this 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:17.420
 here you put a block here you put the 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:21.110
 pistons two pistons here to the side be 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:26.390
 here you put water 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:29.090
 and here we put the remains and in these two 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.460
 pistons that are on the side we put 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.480
 stone 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:37.830
 here we put in this 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.629
 piston put in this block that is this 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.780
 block because if they put this is not going to 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.020
 power 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.900
 which is preferably this in this 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.760
 block is what I told them in this and this 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:55.560
 piston here they put a torch 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.510
 and here also put another torch already 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.549
 Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not work 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.340
 sometimes works on this side but the 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.160
 function or remove 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.360
 the management of the right or side side 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.459
 left where they had put the 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.980
 changes in the place registers puts 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.099
 the torch here put again the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.040
 block and the torch right now it did not work out 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.430
 because because of the rights and it came out and 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.150
 that 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.150
 and well
