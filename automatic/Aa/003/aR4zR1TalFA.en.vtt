there we go a little more like a chain

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.920 
there we go a little more like a chain
now<00:01:59.490> we're<00:01:59.610> gonna<00:01:59.700> go<00:01:59.880> back<00:01:59.909> into<00:02:00.270> object<00:02:00.420> mode

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.630 

then<00:02:03.930> I'm<00:02:04.020> gonna<00:02:04.170> zoom<00:02:04.409> out<00:02:04.619> using<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.460> mouse

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
then I'm gonna zoom out using the mouse

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.859 
then I'm gonna zoom out using the mouse
wheel<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.259> I<00:02:07.259> am<00:02:07.380> going<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.710> hit<00:02:08.069> shift<00:02:08.610> D<00:02:09.149> to

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
wheel and I am going to hit shift D to

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.559 
wheel and I am going to hit shift D to
create<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> duplicate<00:02:10.730> now<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:12.030> drag<00:02:12.330> this

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
create a duplicate now I can drag this

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.410 
create a duplicate now I can drag this
out<00:02:13.310> hit<00:02:14.310> shift<00:02:14.670> D<00:02:14.849> again<00:02:15.590> drag<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.739> out<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.420> so

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
out hit shift D again drag it out and so

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.820 
out hit shift D again drag it out and so
on<00:02:18.599> until<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:19.019> have<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.230> amount<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.560> links

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
on until you have the amount of links

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.240 
on until you have the amount of links
you<00:02:19.950> want<00:02:21.050> at<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.290> point<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.680> could<00:02:22.800> also

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
you want at this point you could also

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.280 
you want at this point you could also
for<00:02:24.030> each<00:02:24.180> if<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.599> wanted<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.900> bend<00:02:25.110> this

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
for each if you wanted to bend this

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.860 
for each if you wanted to bend this
chain<00:02:25.590> or<00:02:25.890> do<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.790> know<00:02:26.850> not<00:02:27.510> just<00:02:27.690> a

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
chain or do it and you know not just a

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.509 
chain or do it and you know not just a
straight<00:02:28.140> line<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.769> could<00:02:28.890> use<00:02:29.040> transform

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
straight line you could use transform

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.130 
straight line you could use transform
properties<00:02:30.060> by<00:02:30.209> selecting<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:30.900> on<00:02:30.989> your

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
properties by selecting and on your

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.039 
properties by selecting and on your
keyboard<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.769> then<00:02:32.280> use<00:02:32.459> rotations<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.450> move

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
keyboard and then use rotations and move

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.600 
keyboard and then use rotations and move
your<00:02:34.170> object<00:02:34.560> around<00:02:34.799> and<00:02:35.010> basically<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.489> can

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
your object around and basically you can

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.610 
your object around and basically you can
make<00:02:35.640> like<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:35.940> bent<00:02:36.239> chain<00:02:36.569> I<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:37.410> recently

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
make like a bent chain I just recently

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.229 
make like a bent chain I just recently
made<00:02:37.980> one<00:02:38.130> for<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.370> pocket<00:02:38.760> watch<00:02:38.850> or<00:02:39.120> whatever

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
made one for a pocket watch or whatever

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.330 
made one for a pocket watch or whatever
you<00:02:39.480> want<00:02:39.660> now<00:02:40.410> we're<00:02:40.590> gonna<00:02:40.680> need<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.100> change

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
you want now we're gonna need to change

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.970 
you want now we're gonna need to change
the<00:02:41.670> rotation<00:02:41.819> on<00:02:42.299> some<00:02:42.569> of<00:02:42.690> these<00:02:42.860> so<00:02:43.860> it

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
the rotation on some of these so it

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.100 
the rotation on some of these so it
makes<00:02:44.160> sense<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.640> looks<00:02:45.000> correct<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:45.600> I'm

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
makes sense and looks correct so I'm

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.220 
makes sense and looks correct so I'm
gonna<00:02:46.200> select<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.620> second<00:02:46.980> one<00:02:47.010> hit<00:02:47.430> hotkey<00:02:47.910> n

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
gonna select the second one hit hotkey n

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.660 
gonna select the second one hit hotkey n
bring<00:02:49.230> up<00:02:49.290> my<00:02:49.380> transform<00:02:49.860> properties<00:02:50.430> and

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
bring up my transform properties and

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.910 
bring up my transform properties and
rotate<00:02:51.420> on<00:02:51.630> X<00:02:52.130> 90<00:02:53.130> degrees<00:02:54.530> same<00:02:55.530> thing<00:02:55.769> with

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
rotate on X 90 degrees same thing with

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.099 
rotate on X 90 degrees same thing with
the<00:02:56.010> fourth<00:02:56.250> one<00:02:56.400> rotate<00:02:57.330> on<00:02:57.480> X<00:02:57.690> 90<00:02:58.140> degrees

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
the fourth one rotate on X 90 degrees

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.479 
the fourth one rotate on X 90 degrees
and<00:03:01.109> now<00:03:01.320> if<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.590> look<00:03:01.739> around<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.100> camera

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
and now if you look around in camera

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.789 
and now if you look around in camera
view<00:03:02.549> see<00:03:03.420> we<00:03:03.570> basically<00:03:03.840> have<00:03:04.109> a<00:03:04.140> chain<00:03:04.970> so

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
view see we basically have a chain so

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.140 
view see we basically have a chain so
now<00:03:07.799> we're<00:03:07.980> gonna<00:03:08.100> go<00:03:08.310> down<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:08.519> split<00:03:09.030> our
