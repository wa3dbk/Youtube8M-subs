more<00:00:33.489> personal<00:00:34.489> sense<00:00:34.820> than<00:00:35.150> a<00:00:35.180> technical

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
sense about the computer and what it was

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.010 
sense about the computer and what it was
like<00:00:39.830> to<00:00:40.400> use<00:00:40.550> one<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.030> there<00:00:41.780> were<00:00:41.870> things

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
like to use one and there were things

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.430 
like to use one and there were things
that<00:00:42.230> I<00:00:42.440> I<00:00:42.680> resented<00:00:43.220> about<00:00:43.489> computers<00:00:43.970> I

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
that I I resented about computers I

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.960 
that I I resented about computers I
resented<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:46.040> fact<00:00:46.070> that<00:00:46.310> I<00:00:46.430> had<00:00:46.550> to<00:00:46.670> sit<00:00:46.850> down

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
resented the fact that I had to sit down

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.920 
resented the fact that I had to sit down
to<00:00:47.180> use<00:00:47.300> them<00:00:47.510> I<00:00:48.550> resented<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:50.030> fact<00:00:50.329> that<00:00:50.660> I

to use them I resented the fact that I

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.870 
to use them I resented the fact that I
was<00:00:51.050> using<00:00:51.260> a<00:00:51.410> hundred<00:00:51.590> year<00:00:51.829> old<00:00:51.860> advice<00:00:52.550> to

was using a hundred year old advice to

was using a hundred year old advice to

that I was using that it was denying
that<00:01:00.079> I<00:01:00.140> had<00:01:00.290> a<00:01:00.320> body<00:01:00.530> of<00:01:00.710> any<00:01:00.860> kind<00:01:01.160> and<00:01:03.250> that

that I had a body of any kind and that

that I had a body of any kind and that
it<00:01:04.520> wasn't<00:01:04.729> perceptual<00:01:05.390> it<00:01:05.630> was<00:01:05.750> all<00:01:05.869> sort<00:01:06.320> of

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
it wasn't perceptual it was all sort of

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.510 
it wasn't perceptual it was all sort of
symbolic<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:07.840> I<00:01:08.840> looked<00:01:09.110> at<00:01:09.440> I<00:01:09.830> was<00:01:10.009> trying<00:01:10.430> to

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
symbolic and I looked at I was trying to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.790 
symbolic and I looked at I was trying to
find<00:01:11.119> out<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.420> best<00:01:11.600> way<00:01:11.810> of<00:01:11.840> making<00:01:12.380> a

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
find out the best way of making a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.090 
find out the best way of making a
computer<00:01:13.009> and<00:01:13.490> I<00:01:14.770> started<00:01:15.770> thinking<00:01:16.070> that

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
computer and I started thinking that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.460 
computer and I started thinking that
artists<00:01:16.670> had<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.540> best<00:01:17.750> relationship

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
artists had the best relationship

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.899 
artists had the best relationship
artists<00:01:18.830> and<00:01:18.950> musicians<00:01:19.100> had<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:19.729> best

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
artists and musicians had the best

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.320 
artists and musicians had the best
relationships<00:01:20.630> with<00:01:20.810> their<00:01:20.930> tools<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:21.590> I

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
relationships with their tools so I

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.930 
relationships with their tools so I
started<00:01:23.799> thinking<00:01:24.799> about<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.400> arts<00:01:25.700> and

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
started thinking about the arts and

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.410 
started thinking about the arts and
taught<00:01:26.119> a<00:01:26.150> class<00:01:26.330> for<00:01:26.690> artists<00:01:27.049> to<00:01:28.119> use<00:01:29.119> the

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
taught a class for artists to use the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.390 
taught a class for artists to use the
computer<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:32.290> then<00:01:33.290> I<00:01:33.320> just<00:01:33.650> started<00:01:34.310> getting

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
computer and then I just started getting

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.320 
computer and then I just started getting
more<00:01:34.700> interested<00:01:35.240> in<00:01:35.600> not<00:01:36.320> teaching<00:01:37.330> anything

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
more interested in not teaching anything

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.170 
more interested in not teaching anything
in<00:01:38.659> the<00:01:38.750> normal<00:01:39.080> sense<00:01:39.380> but<00:01:40.250> in<00:01:40.400> communicating

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
in the normal sense but in communicating

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.289 
in the normal sense but in communicating
the<00:01:41.659> essence<00:01:42.080> of<00:01:42.520> computers<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:43.759> trying<00:01:44.210> to

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
the essence of computers and trying to

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.789 
the essence of computers and trying to
make<00:01:44.450> it<00:01:44.600> so<00:01:44.750> that<00:01:44.900> you<00:01:44.990> would<00:01:45.110> experience<00:01:45.470> a

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
make it so that you would experience a

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.450 
make it so that you would experience a
computer<00:01:46.250> rather<00:01:46.520> than<00:01:46.900> wanting<00:01:47.900> to<00:01:47.990> use

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
computer rather than wanting to use

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.660 
computer rather than wanting to use
do<00:01:49.360> something<00:01:49.750> efficient<00:01:50.170> with<00:01:50.350> it<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:50.799> that

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
do something efficient with it and that

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.780 
do something efficient with it and that
that<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:53.049> essentially<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.770> role<00:01:53.890> of<00:01:54.460> an

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
that is essentially the role of an

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.240 
that is essentially the role of an
artist<00:01:55.119> to<00:01:55.600> express<00:01:55.990> something<00:01:56.260> and<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:57.100> was

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
artist to express something and I was

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.700 
artist to express something and I was
thinking<00:01:57.430> almost<00:01:57.880> of<00:01:58.240> expressing<00:01:58.869> the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
thinking almost of expressing the

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.450 
thinking almost of expressing the
computer<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.250> same<00:02:00.490> way<00:02:00.729> that<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:02.460> religious

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
computer the same way that the religious

computer the same way that the religious
painters<00:02:03.850> would<00:02:04.119> express<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.690> scripture<00:02:05.080> I

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
painters would express the scripture I

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.600 
painters would express the scripture I
technological<00:02:07.000> positive<00:02:07.479> I<00:02:07.690> love<00:02:07.960> the

technological positive I love the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.680 
technological positive I love the
possibilities<00:02:09.610> of<00:02:09.759> Technology<00:02:10.360> I<00:02:10.390> didn't

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
possibilities of Technology I didn't

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.979 
possibilities of Technology I didn't
love<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:11.050> fact<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.770> what<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:13.450> in<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.810> first

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
love the fact of what so in the first

image on the screen their image was them
and<00:03:21.299> they<00:03:22.299> expected<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:22.989> do<00:03:23.140> things<00:03:23.410> in<00:03:23.650> the

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
is it starts to suggest the kinds of

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.589 
is it starts to suggest the kinds of
things<00:05:40.780> that<00:05:40.930> we'll<00:05:41.230> be<00:05:41.470> able<00:05:41.920> to<00:05:42.010> do

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:47.899 

it's<00:05:45.990> what<00:05:46.409> I've<00:05:46.529> done<00:05:46.740> is<00:05:46.949> or<00:05:47.189> peddle<00:05:47.759> my

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
it's what I've done is or peddle my

technical skills doing computer graphics

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.839 
technical skills doing computer graphics
for<00:05:54.229> companies<00:05:55.229> like<00:05:55.379> Pratt<00:05:56.219> &amp;<00:05:56.339> Whitney<00:05:56.610> this

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
for companies like Pratt &amp; Whitney this

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.399 
for companies like Pratt &amp; Whitney this
particular<00:05:57.419> effect<00:05:57.749> is<00:05:57.899> a<00:05:57.929> matter<00:05:58.110> of<00:05:58.199> fact

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
particular effect is a matter of fact

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.850 
particular effect is a matter of fact
I've<00:05:58.679> applied<00:05:58.949> to<00:05:59.429> the<00:05:59.520> flow<00:05:59.789> of<00:06:00.619> gas<00:06:01.619> through

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
I've applied to the flow of gas through

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.939 
I've applied to the flow of gas through
jet<00:06:02.129> engines<00:06:02.550> and<00:06:02.809> applied<00:06:03.809> to

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:03.949 
jet engines and applied to

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.559 
jet engines and applied to
mathematically<00:06:04.949> model<00:06:05.309> data<00:06:05.490> so<00:06:05.939> you<00:06:05.999> can<00:06:06.330> see

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:06.569 
mathematically model data so you can see

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:08.989 
mathematically model data so you can see
this<00:06:07.259> follow<00:06:07.619> and<00:06:08.009> know<00:06:08.189> that<00:06:08.369> all<00:06:08.550> the<00:06:08.759> paths

00:06:08.989 --> 00:06:08.999 
this follow and know that all the paths

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:11.540 
this follow and know that all the paths
being<00:06:09.270> taken<00:06:09.749> are<00:06:10.339> scientifically<00:06:11.339> correct

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
being taken are scientifically correct

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.399 
being taken are scientifically correct
so<00:06:12.059> you're<00:06:12.209> looking<00:06:12.300> at<00:06:12.599> it's<00:06:12.990> a<00:06:13.080> way<00:06:13.259> of

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:13.409 
so you're looking at it's a way of

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:16.699 
so you're looking at it's a way of
visualizing<00:06:14.270> scientific<00:06:15.270> information<00:06:15.709> since

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:16.709 
visualizing scientific information since

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:19.820 
visualizing scientific information since

84 Catherine Henrickson is over here
he's<00:06:19.979> been<00:06:20.159> working<00:06:20.490> with<00:06:20.699> me<00:06:20.879> and<00:06:21.229> has<00:06:22.229> done

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 
he's been working with me and has done

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:26.089 
he's been working with me and has done
much<00:06:23.759> of<00:06:23.819> the<00:06:23.999> technical<00:06:24.509> work<00:06:24.539> and<00:06:25.099> she's

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
much of the technical work and she's

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:28.609 
much of the technical work and she's
been<00:06:26.599> responsible<00:06:27.599> for<00:06:28.050> a<00:06:28.080> lot<00:06:28.439> of<00:06:28.469> the

00:06:28.609 --> 00:06:28.619 
been responsible for a lot of the

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:31.209 
been responsible for a lot of the
advances<00:06:29.129> that<00:06:29.159> we<00:06:29.490> had<00:06:30.449> in<00:06:30.719> the<00:06:30.809> way<00:06:30.930> of

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:31.219 
advances that we had in the way of

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:34.219 
advances that we had in the way of
hardware<00:06:32.219> and<00:06:32.369> software<00:06:32.430> especially<00:06:33.029> in<00:06:33.389> the

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
hardware and software especially in the

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:37.519 
hardware and software especially in the
perception<00:06:34.770> end<00:06:34.949> and<00:06:35.729> so<00:06:36.389> this<00:06:36.659> is<00:06:36.869> it's

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:37.529 
perception end and so this is it's

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:39.290 
perception end and so this is it's
always<00:06:37.830> been<00:06:38.039> a<00:06:38.069> little<00:06:38.459> bit<00:06:38.610> like<00:06:38.819> making<00:06:39.240> a

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
always been a little bit like making a

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.759 
always been a little bit like making a
movie<00:06:39.449> if<00:06:39.809> you<00:06:39.959> think<00:06:40.199> about<00:06:40.409> what<00:06:40.649> the

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:40.769 
movie if you think about what the

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:42.709 
movie if you think about what the
ultimate<00:06:40.919> ambition<00:06:41.249> here<00:06:41.909> is<00:06:42.149> is<00:06:42.479> something

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:42.719 
ultimate ambition here is is something

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:48.350 
ultimate ambition here is is something
that<00:06:42.930> is<00:06:43.639> would<00:06:44.639> have<00:06:45.409> interactive<00:06:47.360> animation

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
that is would have interactive animation

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.929 
that is would have interactive animation
not<00:06:48.839> animation<00:06:49.499> but<00:06:49.709> interactive<00:06:50.309> animation

00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:50.939 
not animation but interactive animation

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:53.749 
not animation but interactive animation
that<00:06:51.149> was<00:06:51.300> sensitive<00:06:51.899> to<00:06:52.169> what<00:06:52.379> not<00:06:53.309> just<00:06:53.339> what

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 
that was sensitive to what not just what

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:55.670 
that was sensitive to what not just what
was<00:06:53.879> going<00:06:53.909> on<00:06:54.360> in<00:06:54.539> the<00:06:54.659> environment<00:06:54.930> but<00:06:55.409> what

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
was going on in the environment but what

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.480 
was going on in the environment but what
would<00:06:55.830> in<00:06:56.309> a<00:06:56.459> static<00:06:56.849> sense<00:06:57.110> but<00:06:58.309> what<00:06:59.309> was

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
would in a static sense but what was

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.199 
would in a static sense but what was
going<00:06:59.669> on<00:07:00.529> say<00:07:01.529> in<00:07:01.740> a<00:07:01.800> person<00:07:02.249> responding<00:07:03.089> to<00:07:03.180> a

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:03.209 
going on say in a person responding to a

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:06.739 
going on say in a person responding to a
person<00:07:03.659> as<00:07:03.779> terrain<00:07:04.199> instant<00:07:04.949> by<00:07:05.069> instant<00:07:05.749> so

person as terrain instant by instant so

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:08.089 
person as terrain instant by instant so
you're<00:07:06.899> really<00:07:07.019> talking<00:07:07.259> almost<00:07:07.559> about<00:07:07.919> AI

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:08.099 
you're really talking almost about AI

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:12.559 
you're really talking almost about AI
and<00:07:09.619> in<00:07:10.619> fact<00:07:10.919> it<00:07:11.129> says<00:07:11.279> realistically<00:07:12.059> AI<00:07:12.240> as

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:12.569 
and in fact it says realistically AI as
