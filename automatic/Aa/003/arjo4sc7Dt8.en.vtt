 in vincennes for the price of luxembourg 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.310
 an international event which 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.789
 dispute over the 2100 meters of the great 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.760
 track 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.080
 they will be fifteen from amiens this 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.699
 price of luxembourg is simply 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.740
 the antechamber of the price of america 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.570
 we have a nice tray already your 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.100
 impression on this very beautiful test 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.600
 test so discuss traditionally 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.860
 on 2100 meters the day before the price 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.879
 of america to some competitors who 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.379
 are starting from this test which 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.210
 was also engaged in america 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.739
 we often run this test because 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.690
 we could not run america fault 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.950
 gains or even some mistakes 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.170
 means we have horses here that have 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.420
 participated in bays and will therefore 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.590
 evolve here with great chances 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.120
 while in the price of america that 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.010
 would have had only secondary chance 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.420
 even sells names change but hey 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.320
 besides the holy pier which was to 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.750
 run this test 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.160
 finally ends up in the price 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.699
 of america and so much the better for his 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.400
 entourage 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.740
 after having the result of a link on 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.420
 waiting for your selection then my 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.540
 selection I placed on track 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.760
 piraten number 6 backfire on 15 chelsea 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.880
 Bokolo 10 ground arrived read the number 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.130
 3 a girl of love on the 7th of 8 beckmann 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.229
 the global manhattan and the 5 vagabond 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.570
 mag is your favorite the swiss one 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.100
 track piraten had made us cry 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.869
 whole France in this event the year 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.180
 spent this year wanting to buy you 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.770
 put it in the lead he finished 6th 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.210
 last year with jason beck we 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.650
 announced it as a phenomenon when it 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.119
 arrived in France and joe if he had 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.650
 been maybe a little jump with him 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.579
 he had taken at his word what had been 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.840
 said that he had been told that it was a 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.790
 very good be it was downgraded 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.229
 in this kind of ordeal he had gone 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.880
 before a problem is that there was 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.530
 more oil in the tank 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.659
 in the straight line and he had asked 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.130
 to blow it had finished that 6th good he 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.149
 has since bought the same horse 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.470
 by the way a little against the current 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.270
 since he had made the arrival 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.909
 of the European Union on 3000 m then 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.320
 we not expect it at all they 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.700
 had finished second from 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.920
 gravel tray that was precisely 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.689
 on that distance that was elsewhere 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.610
 beaten that day by a ladies girl in 1 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.990
 who also in this test 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.789
 the times are excellent and able 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.110
 to trot 11 burglary he has the 6 der 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.950
 the car it will go quickly 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.810
 now it might be 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.430
 no worse to let a horse pass 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.599
 and coming from behind it's like that 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.319
 that he had done his two best 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.700
 performance in France you the opposite 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.980
 foreign competitors the 15 backfire 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.000
 she will be her second out on 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.349
 our soil but the first was 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.040
 really excellent it was written term 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.630
 continental 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.800
 it is also one of the references for 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.050
 this test since it's the same 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.510
 distance and chrono and references 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.800
 also an 18 it was a pretty fast 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.450
 exceptional backfire who were 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.660
 engaged in the price of america and who 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.430
 can not run to two competitors ready 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.970
 so we go to the second line with the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.130
 number 15 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.069
 but who says 15-10 leave behind the 6 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.349
 and the 6 c perfect hacking on 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.450
 is one behind the other and the horse 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.769
 which we will talk about after may have 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.230
 some disadvantages at his level 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.000
 number so the numbers are perfect the 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.569
 value of the spo form since did 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.459
 the business trip 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.599
 we have a lot of assets in our side 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.220
 a pool in continental 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.049
 finally the cabbage is really darien 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.489
 for the victory against turnbull dust 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.959
 who will be starting from the price first 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.569
 from the price of america quite 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.209
 a lot of very high value day there 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.230
 since also admiral sacha would have 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.180
 maybe a chance in the price 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.030
 of america if he had been able to participate in 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.190
 this test good we're still 12th 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.660
 line with the disc chelsea a lot in 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.190
 last place not very lucky antenna 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.450
 in two months we can say clearly that 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.700
 it was the note in the tenor of baune 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.200
 snatched a negative point that's his 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.030
 number behind the autostart he's in 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.859
 second line against like backfire 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.630
 now him the hall 10 then 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.980
 separately having to say what 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.359
 is very embarrassing it's the fact of leaving 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.650
 behind u2 the wheels ru of the airou 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.000
 among the horses of the first line 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.239
 it is the one who will leave the least 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.769
 so that may suggest that chelsea 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.540
 bokova end up in the rear guard 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.280
 his jockey are de rigueur obviously going 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.389
 try to get out of the rope the most 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.109
 quickly possible at least ends up in 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.639
 second thickness 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.900
 Now it goes to the fifth 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.910
 line is what he is capable of 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.139
 to get around the bunch is to get around 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.849
 horses like a tons stone flyer 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.109
 in my opinion no now it's 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.519
 maybe the possibility it can be 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.670
 a possibility for victory 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.630
 if he has the favorable circumstances 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.040
 okay in any case is said this one 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.109
 a lot we hold high enough in a 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.790
 selection the 3 sun arrives at the ivy 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.349
 low anyway it's for you the 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.000
 best French chance where we've been 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.560
 offensive in the price of belgium this is 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.849
 very rare to see philippe daugeard head 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.730
 and rope in the descent it was the case 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.810
 with sun laughed ah good 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.340
 final on demand and a little bit 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.440
 to blow to the tail of good 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.000
 statistics for almost 90% of 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.500
 success when the dates of the four to 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.570
 the success of this course 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.180
 go a good number behind the autostart 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.740
 it's the best French chance and 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.540
 it's probably even the sure blow to 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.960
 the arrival there is nothing against it in 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.670
 reality 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.590
 good if it's still small 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.810
 flat nar must you have 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.490
 mentioned just now where can have 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.630
 a hard race but they were 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.010
 horses that are going to be the first 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.330
 chances of the america price so we can 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.190
 still do not blame him 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.900
 that day we had only been that 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.040
 charming had open quick we had had 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.060
 the year of evil which are the first 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.460
 chances of the price of america 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.330
 good it still leaves a chance for 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.160
 luxembourg the day before 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.170
 yeah of course after that it's just the 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.280
 lapse of recovery time which 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.960
 also worried a little philippe 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.220
 daugeard for this race but as 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.210
 you normally say it's true that 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.950
 this mare one does all her 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.690
 races we can count on her a 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.290
 daughter of a dead number 7 has tried 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.240
 trotting 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.440
 it worked well a first time 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.240
 then in the naked body it went wrong 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.070
 to her had problems of gait he 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.450
 do not stress too much with the trot 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.880
 mounted I feel but against 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.320
 2100 it's a distance she likes 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.880
 then returning to the key when 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.140
 we ran trot 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.480
 feels good warm it opens them a 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.430
 little bit and then nothing more nothing to 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.570
 prove on the distance since she 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.820
 had won I said just now 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.110
 the gravel plateau right in front 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.580
 the horses she's going to face here and 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.930
 the chrono was excellent halak at 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.800
 repeat that value well she's leaving with 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.720
 number 7 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.970
 we know she's coming he'll maybe 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.860
 do not have to do too much in this 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.940
 kind of test 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.770
 mehal obviously has a good chance if 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.330
 she enjoys a good course was going 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.160
 probably still below 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.540
 foreign competitors in his head good 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.370
 everything when the guard for the places 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.110
 then we will not forget our 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.430
 midfielder jean françois meyer 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.590
 was there the meeting of eric raffin 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:59.440
 eric raffin grosbois who will be the 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.640
 number 2 partner global manhattan 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.040
 weirich Saturday with departing from the price of 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.900
 luxembourg with beautiful manhattan to 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.220
 choice that you know well planned 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.450
 the opportunity to win in the spring with 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.610
 this good horse 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.310
 he has just run Europe very well and 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.930
 from the Côte d'Azur very good number 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.950
 So behind the car before I 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.020
 think it's a good thing though 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.040
 he passes a woman especially since he has 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:27.700
 been here 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:28.900
 I often said the ones on top of that 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.270
 on this four-yard course 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.370
 times and twice which once in 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:44.250
 iran being 11 to hear what 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:44.250
 you think about the nice driver 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.270
 global manhattan you have it up in 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.590
 seventh position after it had to be done 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.240
 choices for language but it's true 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.240
 that it's also a beautiful song and 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.590
 we are a refinery workshop he is not the 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.090
 first chance for victory but 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.710

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.120

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.760

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.770

 vincennes there will also be beckmann 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.530

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.420
 reduced field maybe in low 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.680
