spongy<00:00:04.080> bone<00:00:04.290> will<00:00:04.560> be<00:00:04.589> perhaps<00:00:05.160> over<00:00:05.370> here<00:00:07.370> we

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
spongy bone will be perhaps over here we

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:21.940 
spongy bone will be perhaps over here we
have<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:09.300> periosteum<00:00:14.839> the<00:00:15.839> endosteum

Dustin

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.890 

endosteum<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:30.070> then<00:00:30.340> all<00:00:30.699> these<00:00:31.090> each<00:00:31.449> one<00:00:31.720> of

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
endosteum and then all these each one of

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.630 
endosteum and then all these each one of
this<00:00:32.050> concentric<00:00:32.649> ring<00:00:32.860> is<00:00:33.100> a<00:00:33.129> hydration

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
this concentric ring is a hydration

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.439 
this concentric ring is a hydration
system<00:00:34.270> so<00:00:35.020> it's<00:00:35.199> the<00:00:35.320> same<00:00:35.559> here<00:00:35.980> so<00:00:36.280> we<00:00:37.270> have

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
system so it's the same here so we have

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.600 
system so it's the same here so we have
the<00:00:37.600> central<00:00:38.020> canal<00:00:38.970> and<00:00:39.970> we<00:00:40.870> can<00:00:41.079> see

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
the central canal and we can see

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.340 
the central canal and we can see
arteries<00:00:42.610> go<00:00:42.850> through<00:00:43.120> it<00:00:43.210> you<00:00:43.839> can<00:00:43.900> see<00:00:44.290> it

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
arteries go through it you can see it

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.860 
arteries go through it you can see it
when<00:00:44.800> in<00:00:44.920> vertical<00:00:45.430> and<00:00:46.239> then<00:00:46.420> we<00:00:46.570> have<00:00:46.720> the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
when in vertical and then we have the

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.890 
when in vertical and then we have the
perforating<00:00:47.589> canals<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.980> across<00:00:51.900> the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
perforating canals going across the

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.930 
perforating canals going across the
horizontal<00:00:53.530> ones<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:55.059> then<00:00:56.010> each<00:00:57.010> layer<00:00:57.550> as

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
horizontal ones and then each layer as

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.600 
horizontal ones and then each layer as
you<00:00:58.000> hear<00:00:58.449> the<00:00:59.409> other<00:00:59.500> must<00:00:59.830> be<00:00:59.920> even<00:01:00.280> that<00:01:00.430> the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
you hear the other must be even that the

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.680 
you hear the other must be even that the
other<00:01:00.729> day

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
other day

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.330 
other day
each<00:01:01.960> of<00:01:02.199> those<00:01:02.379> is<00:01:02.769> the<00:01:03.040> Alamelu<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.979> it<00:01:06.130> has

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
each of those is the Alamelu and it has

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.550 
each of those is the Alamelu and it has
these<00:01:06.909> lines<00:01:07.210> here<00:01:07.479> let's<00:01:07.689> represent<00:01:08.020> the

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
these lines here let's represent the

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.789 
these lines here let's represent the
collagen<00:01:09.070> fibers<00:01:10.170> called<00:01:11.170> born<00:01:11.470> in<00:01:11.619> this

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
collagen fibers called born in this

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.560 
collagen fibers called born in this
direction<00:01:12.010> and<00:01:12.520> then<00:01:12.700> in<00:01:12.820> this<00:01:12.909> direction<00:01:12.970> and

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
direction and then in this direction and

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.840 
direction and then in this direction and
s<00:01:13.780> lamella<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:14.710> this<00:01:14.979> direction<00:01:15.430> and<00:01:15.520> natural

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
s lamella and this direction and natural

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.520 
s lamella and this direction and natural
and<00:01:15.970> so<00:01:16.150> so<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:19.030> one<00:01:19.270> of<00:01:19.390> these<00:01:19.509> spaces<00:01:19.900> is<00:01:20.350> the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
and so so if one of these spaces is the

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.039 
and so so if one of these spaces is the
lacunae<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.610> inside<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.180> lacunae<00:01:22.659> is<00:01:22.840> the

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
lacunae and inside the lacunae is the

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.080 
lacunae and inside the lacunae is the
ostracize<00:01:23.710> you<00:01:24.009> can<00:01:24.189> see<00:01:24.369> it<00:01:24.460> here<00:01:24.729> with<00:01:24.970> the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
ostracize you can see it here with the

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.330 
ostracize you can see it here with the
auspices<00:01:25.540> and<00:01:25.930> here<00:01:26.229> without<00:01:26.590> an<00:01:26.860> ostracize

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
auspices and here without an ostracize

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.020 
auspices and here without an ostracize
the<00:01:30.340> thing<00:01:30.999> that<00:01:31.329> would<00:01:31.420> be<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.950> osteocytes

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
the thing that would be the osteocytes

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.749 
the thing that would be the osteocytes
and<00:01:34.030> here<00:01:34.689> you<00:01:34.869> can<00:01:35.109> see<00:01:35.409> the<00:01:35.770> these<00:01:36.399> tiny

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
and here you can see the these tiny

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.510 
and here you can see the these tiny
lines<00:01:37.380> irrigating<00:01:38.380> from<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:38.829> lacunae<00:01:39.189> those

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
lines irrigating from the lacunae those

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:47.429 
lines irrigating from the lacunae those
are<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.939> canal<00:01:40.210> equals<00:01:45.210> data<00:01:46.210> that<00:01:46.719> would<00:01:46.899> yes

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
are the canal equals data that would yes

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.410 
are the canal equals data that would yes
that<00:01:47.679> would<00:01:47.829> transfer<00:01:48.340> communicates<00:01:49.149> with

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
that would transfer communicates with

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.120 
that would transfer communicates with
each<00:01:49.479> other<00:01:49.780> all<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.229> order<00:01:50.530> lacunae<00:01:50.950> and

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
each other all the order lacunae and

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.489 
each other all the order lacunae and
therefore<00:01:51.789> they<00:01:51.909> can<00:01:51.969> share<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.719> other<00:01:52.899> the

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:53.499 
therefore they can share the other the

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:55.739 
therefore they can share the other the
nutrients<00:01:54.249> and<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.579> oxygen<00:01:55.240> they<00:01:55.420> have<00:01:55.539> blood

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
nutrients and the oxygen they have blood

00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:00.750 
nutrients and the oxygen they have blood
and<00:01:55.810> all<00:01:56.109> that

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.740 

that<00:02:01.760> basically<00:02:02.180> it<00:02:02.720> on<00:02:03.020> this<00:02:03.380> one<00:02:03.590> of
