be telling another story it was actually

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.190

the<00:00:42.120> very<00:00:42.390> end<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.750> day<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.899> was<00:00:43.110> on<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
the very end of the day I was on a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.690 
the very end of the day I was on a
really<00:00:43.469> really<00:00:43.620> weird<00:00:43.860> schedule<00:00:44.190> like<00:00:44.610> I

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
really really weird schedule like I

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.100 
really really weird schedule like I
think<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:44.910> was<00:00:45.030> during<00:00:45.180> testing<00:00:45.930> everything

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
think it was during testing everything

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.380 
think it was during testing everything
like<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.710> classes<00:00:47.460> were<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> lot<00:00:48.180> longer

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
like that so classes were a lot longer

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.389 
like that so classes were a lot longer
so<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.050> my<00:00:49.170> fifth<00:00:49.590> period<00:00:49.950> class

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
so I was in my fifth period class

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.220 
so I was in my fifth period class
actually<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:51.329> everything<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.020> really

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
actually like everything was just really

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.569 
actually like everything was just really
switched<00:00:52.500> around<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.070> was<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.250> my<00:00:53.280> fifth
