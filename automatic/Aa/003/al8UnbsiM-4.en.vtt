00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 what we have here is what's called 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.550
 thing sleep socket socket where 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.509
 process is established and then we have 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.340
 there is a corresponding connector for installation 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.619
 video cards video like this special 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.220
 device special board which 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.050
 monitor is connected except for this 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.460
 here is the operational module 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:31.520
 memory installed yes we can easily 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.469
 take here please look very much like 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.350
 cartridge abedin conditionally speaking yes old 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.290
 if you remember here you see four 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.180
 sockets for installing RAM 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.680
 you can choose absolutely any nest 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.230
 wherever you want in 1 2 3 in 4 this is your right 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.239
 accordingly , we have a socket for 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.550
 CPU installation 1 piece 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.079
 you can't put the processor in another way 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.039
 because there is even special 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.170
 keys to process his way 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.570
 set as it should 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.450
 us the most 2 main chip on 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.250
 motherboard has two mine 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.909
 the main chip is called north 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.030
 bridge 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.310
 this is the chip under it 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.119
 metal radiator and there is still 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.650
 south bridge 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.380
 i.e. this chip is in 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.630
 bottom of the motherboard 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.830
 here is the south bridge in this case it is not 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.729
 supplied with radiator 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.040
 although of course modern maternal 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.549
 boards and still do with cooling 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.310
 even 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.090
 This chip besides this we have 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.100
 ports are all sorts of dawn and 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.640
 respectively the motherboard itself 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.920
 I will remind you what they are for and 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.850
 but also those who came for the first time today 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.680
 occupation for you this news will also be 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.299
 round nests are called eat in half 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.930
 and a way to connect the mouse and 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.899
 keyboard 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.810
 This is a USB port for connecting flash drives 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.450
 There are a lot of all kinds of usb and devices 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.200
 different everywhere abutments us printer and 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.119
 scanner and all kinds of webcams 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.819
 additionally dressed gadgets 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.330
 anti-fan and even slippers with 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.550
 heated from the usb port two work 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.090
 com-port we have here is it 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.180
 information input-output port has 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.360
 large lpt port to connect 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.739
 old type printers and scanners 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.519
 network card for cable connection 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.799
 network 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:32.959
 in order to connect this computer 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.970
 sound card connectors 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.840
 Well, respectively, here yes we have it 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.420
 us write nests this nest and the like 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.450
 once again for everyone's video card here 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.260
 taking advantage of for various controllers for 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.410
 old network sound cards and so 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.420
 further besides that we still have nests 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.110
 for connecting hard drives drives 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.739
 information 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.390
 it turns out to be such red things 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:05.790
 this is garden 1 sata 2 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:08.010
 there is a shower and a line of treatment 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.340
 reminding every interface we have 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.470
 used to connect 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.989
 Winchester and old type Sidiroma 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.750
 the old type in which one loop can 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:23.160
 install two software devices with us for 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:26.329
 connect the hard drives on the principle of one 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.420
 connector one line but it's in beauty 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:32.720
 remembered the topic of the last occupation 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.720
 now we have
