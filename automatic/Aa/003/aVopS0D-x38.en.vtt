00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:26.600
Gently falling snow stops me in my tracks

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:37.900
Never to feel my hand, lest I break it's beauty

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:50.300
A crying heart needs escape for having been forgotten

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.400
Once you understand the meaning of our smiles

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.300
Never look back again

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:18.000
Your tears will be covered by the snow and footprints behind you

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:42.400
I saw the remnants in the gentle sky waiting for morning

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:53.900
Never touched for the fear of loss

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:06.200
Are you stopped by a burden we had thought left to the past?

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.200
Rejected by the spring that lay deep within your heart

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.100
Left alone for all eternity

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:28.200
I'm digging up those footprints faded away from that time

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:36.000
There because you can't move on

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.800
Not knowing how to heal wounds that stick deep within your heart

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.200
Just never break your own commandments

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.500
Even with your head down and back against the wall

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.900
Open your redemption with a key that can't be bought

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.000
Once you understand the meaning of our smiles

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.800
Never look back again

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:32.900
Those footprints are now just a memory

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:42.000
Leading to the spring...
