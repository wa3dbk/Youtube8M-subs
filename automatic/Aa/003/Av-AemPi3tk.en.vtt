00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:21.090
 Cacaroto, I have not seen you in a long time. 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:24.480
 fight to show what you 've learned and a 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.430
 fantastic Aveiro circle 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.359
 I just realized that I'm no good at 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.359
 fight with the red bull 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.260
 This is the only one that can defeat I thought. 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.420
 who had finally outgrown cacaroto and 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.700
 in the end I could not surpass 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.520
 at first I thought I had an obligation to 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.489
 protect my loved ones and cause 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.920
 addition a power completely 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.600
 unknown question would put maybe 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.149
 you're right 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.399
 Now I really have to see before I 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.290
 he fought for everyone to submit to the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.210
 my wishes for fun 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.820
 It was a delight for me to kill people. 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.090
 and above all to strengthen my 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.090
 proud 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.470
 You were different, you did not fight only for 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.049
 winning has always exceeded the limits of 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.080
 their strength not to lose anyone for 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.270
 You never dared to kill your 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.189
 opponents 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.930
 I know why it never served to kill me. 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.460
 seems to finally understand that my 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.720
 heart there is a bit of feeling 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.820
 that humans have the idea that there is 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.360
 a generous skirt that likes a 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.360
 car 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.800
 You can make it, boy, you're the best. 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.270
 hearing is not working 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.390
 I'm going to kill you goku 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.500
 the grandpa band 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.390
 was the most powerful champion I have ever 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.390
 made 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:50.350
 is more powerful than I imagined 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.350
 I twisted a very strong demon.
