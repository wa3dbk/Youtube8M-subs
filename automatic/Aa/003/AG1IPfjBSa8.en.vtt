00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.860
 I do 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.860
 it is 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.460
 hi girls and boys have 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.680
 continued the special christmas video series 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.910
 with a video that is a bit special 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.580
 you have been very numerous and 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.170
 many to ask me but even if 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.310
 you will not have been many to me 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.980
 asked I would have done it anyway 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.199
 I've seen for a few days 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.430
 videos on youtube with 8 lists of 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.020
 personalized christmas lists for the 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.789
 family for friends and so I have 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.470
 decided to compile all of this into one 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.350
 tag so it's not really me who the 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.120
 creates but it's still my idea so here 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.559
 what was the idea then to mix a little 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.880
 all this to make a tag that I have 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.530
 decided to call the 'crisis' tag 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.300
 christmas list I will put the questions 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.829
 in info bar there are ten it's 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.600
 party we will start first with 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.920
 gift ideas for the family and the 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.489
 first question what are you 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.230
 offered to a sister then me that to my 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.270
 sister or sister in general I 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.790
 will make girls' dvd dvd 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.050
 the movie about blacks there because already 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.969
 it would bring back lots of memories 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.250
 especially this year the time I am 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.930
 am made to turn to chatelet and if not 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.280
 further down I find that there is really a 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.119
 beautiful performance of the actress 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:16.270
 main home more what is his name 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:18.709
 fatou traorÃ© or mendy or fatou 6 and 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.520
 finally I would really do the dvd of 

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:21.050
 girls bands because for me 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.190
 it's a very, very good movie 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.979
 second question what is 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.000
 you offered to a mom beats not for a 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.970
 Mom I would say that the perfect gift 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.050
 I do not know how to display objects 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.789
 I do not know I see lots of tickets on 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.810
 read in the subway and I did not read 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.950
 I do not know what it's about but I 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.000
 say that it can be really fun 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.250
 finally it's not the book looks like 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.229
 walk so yeah fitch is given to her 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.970
 mother is pretty cool what and more 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.140
 down and I believe she's film coming out 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.610
 in not very long 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.259
 so I think it's always 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.880
 good to offer the book before like that 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.319
 bah you hurt will tell her friends 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.550
 it free before and it's 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.460
 always deal with is always better not 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.650
 what would you offer a dad 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.450
 frankly it's a little old but me 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.880
 I will do it earlier the movie dvd 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.350
 brokeback mountain 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.460
 I do not know if you saw it but me 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.550
 I find there are still a lot of stuff 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.780
 what relationship with the relationship finally super 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.700
 I think it would make sense for me to 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.860
 offer you see under my father what 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.739
 finally here I do not know what do you 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.940
 offered your alice her a 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.709
 uncomplicated because of the blow 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.300
 find a trick someone who is mixed 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.319
 since it's for your darling 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.610
 so I do not know so I said 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.560
 so I noticed that here is a 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.150
 gift card from zara because I 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.860
 find that you can always find the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.540
 nice little rooms in this shop 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.190
 so yeah my gift idea is a 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.200
 10 euros gift card at zara for 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.700
 his bag rico then what are you 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.700
 would offer your housekeeper 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.290
 give us three gifts from your list of 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.940
 christmas this year 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.920
 bah actually suddenly as I have not 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.300
 partnership it was a bit hard of 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.680
 finally find I found my own 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.700
 gifts actually and not the gifts of 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.650
 partnerships so I could not do 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.640
 like the other youtube buzz of the coup 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.049
 it was a bit complicated but I 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.820
 still found three tricks from my 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.440
 list so for my stuff I'd like 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.269
 to have the chips what they have all that 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.280
 it really really super pro 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.360
 and super g on the skin I would love 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.750
 really also have a subscription to 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.980
 the year at spotify and a women's t-shirt 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.209
 thug I pass you see the mark with 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.890
 t-shirts with marc and women's 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.690
 thugs because I really find 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.579
 stylish what is the worst Christmas gift 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.860
 that you 're done ben actually I had 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.410
 offered an escape smartbox to the father of 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.190
 my ex three years ago and actually I 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.750
 did not know but actually it was 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.760
 disabled from the blow he could not 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.320
 use it I got bawled a 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.230
 good time I could not really 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.540
 know what finally in past it was a 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.350
 little weird his reaction 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.730
 so he still wanted to tell him 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.230
 that if he passes what looks at this 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.030
 video I will tell him that these forgotten 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.340
 on my side I forgave him there is no 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.290
 worry is from the past we can go back to 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.519
 zero 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.079
 what is the worst gift we made 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.790
 once it was two or three years ago 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.470
 I think I had been offered the iphone 4 in 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.540
 white while I had ordered it in 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.140
 warm good I'm not going to finally think Monday 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.930
 the week 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.459
 I rather talk about that but if you 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.400
 had the opportunity to have the callus 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.280
 your dreams you would take what I do not know 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.150
 it's complicated because suddenly I 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.410
 make a check there are plenty 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.610
 would ask for peace in the world I 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.270
 not asked for peace in the world because 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.310
 that low because I live in Paris and 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.990
 that ben me perso I do not care 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.500
 what are you finally going for your life you appear 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.760
 what's up there like that the thing 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.040
 really they would make dream at home 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.840
 will spend having a starbucks in 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.210
 her salon what what is the best 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.890
 gift that has made basel has made it 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.720
 will do a can deny the answer to this 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.430
 question but really I think it's 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.890
 sincere the best gift we have 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.450
 done is you so I turn this 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.370
 video you are almost 2000 and 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.810
 frankly I did not believe it at all 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.690
 when I started doing the videos 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.310
 is really the fact that you're here 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.810
 it's really a mutual love we 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.130
 returns and that it touches me a lot 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.020
 I never know how to thank you 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.250
 but it's really the most beautiful gift 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.250
 that we have never been able to do what 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.020
 so to thank you for being so 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.640
 many and because it's not Christmas that 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.080
 for me I decided to organize a game 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.110
 contest to make you win a 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.150
 autographed photo with me as a shot 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.860
 it's a bit complicated I meet 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.510
 people for now I say that the most 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.520
 simple was that the winner did 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.770
 send me a picture of him and I'll do 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.270

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.760
 contest 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.070
 it is necessary to answer the fate among 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.870
