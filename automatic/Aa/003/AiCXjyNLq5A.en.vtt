for<00:01:32.890> sure<00:01:34.290> because<00:01:35.290> it<00:01:35.530> is<00:01:35.680> running<00:01:36.010> wide<00:01:36.160> open

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.850

the magneto on here but got a little

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.780 
the magneto on here but got a little
more<00:01:43.510> work<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:43.810> do<00:01:43.930> on<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.140> throttle<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:45.700> it

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
more work to do on the throttle but it

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.920 
more work to do on the throttle but it
looks<00:01:45.940> like<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.150> John<00:01:46.360> Deere<00:01:46.570> is<00:01:46.600> alive<00:01:46.900> again

looks like the John Deere is alive again
very<00:01:47.530> much<00:01:47.710> alive<00:01:48.040> blew<00:01:48.850> out<00:01:49.000> a<00:01:49.030> little<00:01:49.240> bit<00:01:49.390> of

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
very much alive blew out a little bit of

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.500 
very much alive blew out a little bit of
smoke<00:01:50.370> it<00:01:51.370> acts<00:01:51.550> like<00:01:51.670> it's<00:01:51.970> going<00:01:52.300> to<00:01:52.360> run

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
smoke it acts like it's going to run

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.690 
smoke it acts like it's going to run
pretty<00:01:52.720> good<00:01:52.960> didn't<00:01:53.800> want<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.040> blow<00:01:54.280> it<00:01:54.460> up

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.320 

but<00:01:57.700> we<00:01:57.820> got<00:01:57.940> a<00:01:57.970> live<00:01:58.510> John<00:01:58.810> Deere<00:01:59.020> again
