other famous rabbits that you can think

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.799 
other famous rabbits that you can think
of<00:00:31.620> if<00:00:31.770> I<00:00:31.890> may<00:00:32.070> as<00:00:32.129> well<00:00:32.160> capture<00:00:32.580> this<00:00:32.809> looks

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
of if I may as well capture this looks

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.590 
of if I may as well capture this looks
like<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.309> mother<00:00:35.309> or<00:00:35.520> father<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.059> child<00:00:36.270> I

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
like a mother or father and child I

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.700 
like a mother or father and child I
would<00:00:36.870> expect<00:00:37.110> more<00:00:37.260> likely<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.620> be<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
would expect more likely to be the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.700 
would expect more likely to be the
mother<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.989> but<00:00:39.989> who<00:00:40.110> knows<00:00:40.260> maybe<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.680> just

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
mother and but who knows maybe it's just

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.100 
mother and but who knows maybe it's just
a<00:00:40.920> neighbor<00:00:41.460> or<00:00:41.640> am<00:00:42.290> an<00:00:43.290> auntie<00:00:43.680> or<00:00:43.770> something

but at the time I thought I may as well
get<00:01:48.200> back<00:01:48.920> focused<00:01:49.459> on<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.879> the<00:01:50.360> rabbit<00:01:50.719> and<00:01:50.860> I

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
get back focused on the the rabbit and I

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.630 
get back focused on the the rabbit and I
end<00:01:52.009> up<00:01:52.189> almost<00:01:52.959> falling<00:01:53.959> into<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:54.349> river<00:01:54.640> as

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
end up almost falling into the river as

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.160 
end up almost falling into the river as
I<00:01:55.700> can't<00:01:56.239> see<00:01:56.360> what<00:01:56.509> I'm<00:01:56.599> doing<00:01:56.629> what<00:01:57.049> I'm

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
I can't see what I'm doing what I'm

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.660 
I can't see what I'm doing what I'm
trying<00:01:57.409> to<00:01:57.530> focus<00:01:57.969> there<00:01:58.969> I<00:01:59.000> go<00:01:59.119> and

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.300 

eventually<00:02:04.670> I<00:02:05.030> we<00:02:06.019> stabilize<00:02:06.619> everything<00:02:06.859> I

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
eventually I we stabilize everything I

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.029 
eventually I we stabilize everything I
have<00:02:07.429> to<00:02:07.549> zoom<00:02:07.700> right<00:02:07.969> out<00:02:08.149> again<00:02:08.769> because<00:02:09.769> I'd

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
have to zoom right out again because I'd

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.180
