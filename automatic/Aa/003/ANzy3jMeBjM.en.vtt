00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 point of lens on the top market of 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.060
 range the citroën xm v6 24 valves 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.350
 exclusive finish 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.420
 we will see right away 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.049
 that she has in the belly and well here 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.980
 so the famous zpg 4 engine that team 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.210
 including the citroën xm v6 24 valves 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.060
 this engine is for a large part 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.279
 identical to the zpg engine especially 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.480
 with regard to the crankcase block 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.519
 cylinders the crankshaft the connecting rods the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.760
 shirts the segmentation and the pump to 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.399
 oil 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.070
 on the other hand, this engine has differences 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.110
 which are his own and which therefore carries 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.800
 on the cylinder heads on the camshafts 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.780
 on the pistons and on the distribution 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.340
 but first talk about the yokes 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.579
 cylinder heads has several pieces that 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.039
 we are interested first of all here a tree 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.840
 with cams in the lead which is driven by 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.710
 a chain waits for hydraulic hour to 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.640
 mechanical rearming then of this 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.830
 side of it the valves that are operated 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:07.049
 by pushers and rockers to 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.520
 catching up hydraulic play and finally 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.740
 you see it here we have this 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.260
 platinum which has the two axes of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.040
 rockers the first axis that supports 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.799
 the scorer cycles the admission and finally 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.350
 the second axis which only includes 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.800
 three one- piece fork rocker arms 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.680
 exhaust 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.450
 Here to finish I would say that 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.680
 regarding the tightening of the cylinder head 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.720
 to my goodness there is nothing 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.250
 particular to add a little word about 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.960
 the cooling circuit that in 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.510
 does not differ from the circuit of 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.200
 spj cooling with air option 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.660
 conditioned only by reheating 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.840
 two throttle bodies let's talk a bit about 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.780
 the exhaust a steel manifold 6 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.160
 in 1 with metex head for each 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.750
 breech but like the line 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.230
 exhaust drew from the front is 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.900
 longer 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.240
 a small catalyst light of allows the 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.650
 pre-treatment of gases in order to obtain the 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.810
 same temperature in both 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.420
 main catalysts case indeed to 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.450
 each cylinder head corresponds to a set 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.070
 catalysts are to oxygen finally know 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.710
 in case of repair of the line 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.830
 back we can split it here at this 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.230
 level there before the last pot the 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.970
 air intake circuit 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.700
 multisoupapes allows to realize a 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.080
 high performance filling at high speed 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.280
 only there is a disadvantage it's the 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.070
 lack of low-end torque 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.230
 we correct this drawback on this 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.230
 motor by an intake device 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.430
 special cellar 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.530
 admission to features 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.550
 acoustic variable 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.550
 what is the principle of 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.290
 operation of the range firstly 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.980
 we have a tubing that distributes 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.800
 the air to the different cylinders 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.010
 and which therefore comprises if leads three of 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.450
 each side on which are fixed 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.580
 injectors 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.890
 Here then above this lining 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.400
 is the the system itself 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.050
 from the cellar 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.780
 So how does it work 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.290
 this set thus formed comprises two 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.470
 elementary volumes 1 here and here 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.230
 a breech parent and these two volumes 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.530
 can be put in communication by 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:19.120
 by two short links that is there 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.800
 below and a longer here and these 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.390
 two links are equipped with shutters 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.980
 we see here another one below and 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.200
 his flocks are themselves driven by 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.240
 a calculator three cases one gets 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.940
 present and which will function and 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.810
 regime and the engine load then 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.060
 first case maximum torque ie 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:44.080
 up to 4000 rpm minutes both 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.240
 volumes will work separately with 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.100
 at their entry the two throttle bodies 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.780
 whose opening is ordered 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.650
 simultaneously by the accelerator 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.110
 second case it's the diet 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.700
 intermediate between 4000 and 5000 turns 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.620
 minute and that's the long km connection in 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.530
 communication both volumes 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.750
 finally third power figure 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.430
 maximum that is to say beyond 5000 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.110
 rpm 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:15.220
 both volumes will be put in 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.090
 communication by the short link for 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.480
 what is injection and 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.880
 ignition 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.180
 the new phoenix 4 system is a 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.060
 evolution of sbf enix 3b its functions 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.419
 additional sequential injection 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.070
 of gasoline cylinder per cylinder sensors 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.020
 reference cylinders that allows the 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.250
 calculators to lock on the cycle 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:39.080
 ignition 1 6 3 5 2 4 detection of 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.919
 rattling cylinder by cylinder 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.120
 piloting the cellar and finally capacity 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.849
 increased self-diagnosis system 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.120
 since it offers 32 default code instead 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.120
 of 21
