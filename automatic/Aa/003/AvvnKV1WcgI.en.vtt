00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hi, my name is Alfonso Slim and I am 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.180
 professor of the area of medicine 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.370
 traditional china disney I come to 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.190
 present the facial littÃ­n course 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.900
 acupuncture the question would be what is or 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.059
 what is the acupuncture face lift 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.440
 good to acupuncture face lift 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.270
 we also call it rejuvenation 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.130
 facial and it is one of the techniques 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.500
 therapeutic that today is more in 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.560
 vogue and is designed primarily for 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.109
 reduce minimize and correct wrinkles 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.420
 that appear all over our face and 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.940
 that evidently demonstrate the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.890
 evidence of our aging and not 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.500
 everyone likes to have wrinkles 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.239
 so what are the advantages if 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.940
 we do this facial littÃ­n course 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.940
 acupunctural good the student will be able 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.730
 then practice with these techniques in 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.500
 your patients or clients and one of the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.500
 things we can achieve is to increase 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.480
 the local collagen of the face what we 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.730
 it will give wrinkles filling too 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.699
 we can increase the elastin of our 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.520
 facial face and we will get a 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.360
 reaffirm the growth of facial tissue 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.300
 we will improve 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.580
 also the blood microcirculation 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.310
 and it will give us more shine on the face and 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.930
 So a more rejuvenated look 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.030
 results are very good are 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.830
 surprising with few sessions and the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.930
 advantage of the method is that it does not have 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.960
 no contraindication and therefore 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.390
 is devoid of side effects 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.230
 this course so that the whole world what 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.330
 can do 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.550
 very small needles will be used 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.590
 Korean hand paint and its injector 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.720
 manual so anyone but not 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.340

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.630
 which we will have 60 70 percent of 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.680
 practice and a 30 40 percent theory 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.420
 obviously as we want to increase the 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.940

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.420
 the results 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.890
