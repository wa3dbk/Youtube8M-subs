 to watch the match 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.200
 connects mcenroe to see how 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.240
 he plays it is certain there will be no 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.370
 surprise mcenroe will go to the net at 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.740
 black it will try to return the best 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.360
 possible 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:05.220

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.660
 he also heard ivan lendl jimmy 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.330
 connors to john mcenroe who just 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.900
 discuss a decision of the arbitrator then 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.000
 it costs 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.100
 I'm sick of you behaving like 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.520
 a kid you really have the mental age of 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.650
 my son you understood yes brett son 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.630

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.070
 but his father is 7 years older than john 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.990
 mcenroe and jimmy connors this is not going 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.590
 can withstand the space of a set 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.110
 the first after he will be opposed to a 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.160
 bomber who will spend 49 % of 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.640
 first service balls and 12th at 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.010
 total 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.690
 john mcenroe won four shutouts 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.280
 to qualify for the first time 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.840
 of his career for the finale of Roland 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:53.209
 garros the score 7-5 6-1 6-2 and for the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.209

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.290
 ivan lendl is right to say that this 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.250
 will be difficult Sunday this man is 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.250
