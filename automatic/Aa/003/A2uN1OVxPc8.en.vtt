 with the vegetable dye in red paste 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.929
 tulip is a favorite vegetable coloring 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.390
 to achieve this beautiful red color 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.310
 intense in the butter cream if not 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.200

 is regularly available in stores 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.580
 of pastry and cake decoration today 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.620
 I've spiced my cream 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.170
 butter with a little essence of 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.450
 cherry brandy liquor my cupcake goes 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.100
 to be cherry choco here we have 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.229
 some little silver sparkles 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.540
 about 2 millimeters that we're going to 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.460
 use in the centers of roses and today 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.080
 I'm going to use a disposable sleeve 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.540
 you do not have to use the 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.510
 disposable is simply what I 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.910
 I prefer to use today I will use it 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.600
 together with a wilton 2 nozzle 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:50.880
 this is 12 t and you can buy it in the 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.920
 most of the pastry shops 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.869
 so the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.700
 that I'm going to twist the top of my 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.039
 sleeve to keep all the frosting 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.200
 I'm going to hold it in my hand 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.329
 left because I'm right-handed I'm going to use 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.579
 my right hand to apply pressure to 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.009
 frosting can start right in the 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.200
 center of my co cake and I'm just going to 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.360
 apply moderate pressure will 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.640
 hold it in the middle while I squeeze 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.800
 for a couple of seconds very slowly I'm going 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.380
 squeezing to achieve a beautiful button 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.390
 of rose and then continue turning the 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.180
 frosting around on the outside 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.709
 when they get to the edge they start 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.370
 to stop pouring the glaze in 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.819
 direction down this way there 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.620
 They have their beautiful baked red rose 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.630
 now they must have noticed that no 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.209
 press my sleeve into the 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.269
 frosting, check that you simply leave 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.829
 that the icing fell on the cupcake 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.200
 right away I'm going to spray him over the 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.420
 little silver sparkles want to put those 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.280
 sparks as soon as they can so 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.890
 soon as the air touches the glaze 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.560
 it will begin to dry and form a 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.200
 thin crust if too dry 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.480
 Sparks do not go 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.730
 and I'm going to take two of my little leaves 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.099
 fondant can use one or two that 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.379
 it's totally up to you I'm going to 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.330
 push in the glaze alone 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.940
 until I feel that I have come right to 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.489
 cupcake here is one and here is the 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.310
 second so there are his two 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.760
 little leaves and here is your finished product 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.530

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.739
 make them from a variety of colors 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.799
