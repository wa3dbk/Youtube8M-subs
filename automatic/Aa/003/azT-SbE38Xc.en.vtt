a new account I'm not going to use my
old<00:05:52.740> one<00:05:52.949> with<00:05:53.099> like<00:05:53.280> 50<00:05:53.759> followers<00:05:53.940> I<00:05:54.330> think<00:05:54.539> I

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
old one with like 50 followers I think I

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.499 
old one with like 50 followers I think I
gotta<00:05:54.960> restart<00:05:55.440> from<00:05:55.530> scratch<00:05:56.270> everything<00:05:57.270> is

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:57.509 
gotta restart from scratch everything is

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.050 
gotta restart from scratch everything is
basically<00:05:57.660> starting<00:05:58.259> from<00:05:58.289> scratch<00:05:58.590> because

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
basically starting from scratch because

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.550 
basically starting from scratch because
what<00:06:00.060> happened<00:06:00.449> oh<00:06:02.240> yeah<00:06:03.240> so<00:06:04.080> I<00:06:04.199> guess<00:06:04.259> is

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
what happened oh yeah so I guess is

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.180 
what happened oh yeah so I guess is
under<00:06:04.949> this<00:06:05.160> video<00:06:05.400> is<00:06:06.270> just<00:06:06.389> an<00:06:06.660> introduction

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
under this video is just an introduction

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.860 
under this video is just an introduction
next<00:06:08.190> video<00:06:08.280> we'll<00:06:08.639> be<00:06:08.669> building<00:06:09.240> a<00:06:09.419> base<00:06:09.599> or

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
next video we'll be building a base or

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.540 
next video we'll be building a base or
traveling<00:06:10.320> or<00:06:10.410> something<00:06:10.740> that's<00:06:11.340> already

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
traveling or something that's already

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.969 
traveling or something that's already
know<00:06:11.729> not<00:06:11.940> sure<00:06:11.970> that's<00:06:12.330> boring<00:06:12.840> so<00:06:13.500> again<00:06:13.800> I

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 
know not sure that's boring so again I

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:15.740 
know not sure that's boring so again I
already<00:06:14.250> already<00:06:14.610> traveled<00:06:15.090> already<00:06:15.479> have

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
already already traveled already have

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.969 
already already traveled already have
like<00:06:15.840> home<00:06:16.259> I<00:06:16.440> just<00:06:16.620> gotta<00:06:16.800> make<00:06:17.280> you<00:06:18.949> say<00:06:19.949> I

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
like home I just gotta make you say I

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.790 
like home I just gotta make you say I
guess<00:06:20.280> I<00:06:20.430> was<00:06:20.699> building<00:06:20.970> a<00:06:21.180> base<00:06:21.300> I<00:06:21.690> guess<00:06:22.080> it

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
guess I was building a base I guess it

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.839 
guess I was building a base I guess it
would<00:06:22.949> probably<00:06:23.130> be<00:06:23.310> a<00:06:23.340> speed<00:06:23.699> build<00:06:23.970> baby

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:25.849 
would probably be a speed build baby

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:30.520 
would probably be a speed build baby
possibly<00:06:26.849> so<00:06:27.650> just<00:06:28.650> drop<00:06:29.039> by<00:06:29.220> on<00:06:29.400> the<00:06:29.520> server<00:06:29.729> I

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
possibly so just drop by on the server I

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.980 
possibly so just drop by on the server I
heard<00:06:31.530> the<00:06:31.949> owner<00:06:32.550> is<00:06:32.880> looking<00:06:33.000> for<00:06:33.300> stuff<00:06:33.539> if

I'll<00:07:20.759> be<00:07:21.090> up<00:07:21.180> on<00:07:21.389> this<00:07:21.630> ASAP<00:07:21.930> I<00:07:22.289> guess

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:24.350 
I'll be up on this ASAP I guess

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.620 
I'll be up on this ASAP I guess
and<00:07:25.350> um<00:07:25.620> shoes<00:07:25.920> when<00:07:26.430> when<00:07:26.880> i'm<00:07:27.000> done<00:07:27.180> my

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.630 
and um shoes when when i'm done my

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.350 
and um shoes when when i'm done my
computer<00:07:28.170> i'm<00:07:28.770> going<00:07:28.920> to<00:07:29.010> get<00:07:29.130> better<00:07:29.670> editing

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 
computer i'm going to get better editing

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.420 
computer i'm going to get better editing
software<00:07:30.900> because<00:07:31.320> it<00:07:31.560> it<00:07:31.770> just<00:07:31.830> doesn't<00:07:32.340> work

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:32.430 
software because it it just doesn't work

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.290 
software because it it just doesn't work
on<00:07:32.610> this<00:07:32.730> computer<00:07:33.230> so<00:07:35.000> editing<00:07:36.000> would<00:07:36.180> be<00:07:36.270> a

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300 
on this computer so editing would be a

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.300 
on this computer so editing would be a
lot<00:07:36.510> better<00:07:36.540> i'll<00:07:36.990> add<00:07:37.290> probably<00:07:37.800> motion<00:07:38.130> blur

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.310 
lot better i'll add probably motion blur

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.580 
lot better i'll add probably motion blur
I<00:07:38.610> don't<00:07:39.360> know<00:07:39.450> i'll<00:07:39.600> probably<00:07:39.840> do<00:07:40.020> a<00:07:40.050> test<00:07:40.380> if

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:40.590 
I don't know i'll probably do a test if

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.480 
I don't know i'll probably do a test if
you<00:07:40.620> guys<00:07:40.830> like<00:07:41.070> that<00:07:41.100> better<00:07:41.460> put<00:07:42.390> on<00:07:42.420> yeah

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:43.490 
you guys like that better put on yeah

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:57.030 
you guys like that better put on yeah
