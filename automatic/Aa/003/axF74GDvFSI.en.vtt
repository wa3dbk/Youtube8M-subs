love it and get to compete at a very
high<00:02:09.520> level<00:02:09.670> this<00:02:10.390> is<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:10.569> tough<00:02:11.110> league<00:02:11.350> to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
high level this is a tough league to

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.830 
high level this is a tough league to
play<00:02:11.770> in<00:02:11.920> but<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.640> forces<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.420> learn<00:02:13.810> how

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
play in but it forces you to learn how

the<00:02:16.409> field<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:16.859> would<00:02:17.519> also<00:02:17.640> say<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.260> out<00:02:19.260> of

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
the field I would also say that out of

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:20.780 
the field I would also say that out of
all<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.709> places<00:02:19.890> I've<00:02:20.159> been<00:02:20.189> in<00:02:20.459> my<00:02:20.549> coaching

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
all the places I've been in my coaching

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.300 
all the places I've been in my coaching
career<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:21.689> is<00:02:21.840> just<00:02:22.079> a<00:02:22.230> very<00:02:22.680> dedicated

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
career this is just a very dedicated

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.440 
career this is just a very dedicated
group<00:02:23.939> of<00:02:24.019> student<00:02:25.019> athletes<00:02:25.109> and<00:02:25.620> they

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
group of student athletes and they

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.390 
group of student athletes and they
really<00:02:27.450> want<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:28.409> achieve<00:02:28.739> everything<00:02:29.129> that

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
really want to achieve everything that

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.720 
really want to achieve everything that
they<00:02:29.489> possibly<00:02:29.670> can<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.980> think<00:02:32.099> that's<00:02:32.430> a

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
they possibly can and I think that's a

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.199 
they possibly can and I think that's a
hallmark<00:02:33.299> of<00:02:33.599> Bowden<00:02:33.930> in<00:02:34.500> general<00:02:35.459> but<00:02:35.939> it's

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
hallmark of Bowden in general but it's

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.490 
hallmark of Bowden in general but it's
also<00:02:36.420> something<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.900> I've<00:02:37.049> noticed<00:02:37.260> within

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
also something that I've noticed within

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.080 
also something that I've noticed within
the<00:02:37.680> team<00:02:37.829> and<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.099> makes<00:02:38.219> my<00:02:38.370> job<00:02:38.579> incredibly

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
the team and it makes my job incredibly

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.449 
the team and it makes my job incredibly
rewarding<00:02:39.269> to<00:02:39.750> coach<00:02:39.930> student<00:02:40.920> athletes<00:02:41.250> who

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
rewarding to coach student athletes who

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:49.540 
rewarding to coach student athletes who
have<00:02:41.489> that<00:02:41.819> mindset
