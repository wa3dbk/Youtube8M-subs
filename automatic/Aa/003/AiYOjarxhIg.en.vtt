00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.990 
head and you can breathe really well
throughout<00:02:19.220> then<00:02:19.430> it's<00:02:19.580> not<00:02:19.730> a<00:02:19.760> problem

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
throughout then it's not a problem

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.510 
throughout then it's not a problem
because<00:02:20.510> I'm<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.780> bit<00:02:20.990> claustrophobic<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.860> I'm

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
because I'm a bit claustrophobic and I'm

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.940 
because I'm a bit claustrophobic and I'm
quite<00:02:23.120> happy<00:02:23.300> tucked<00:02:24.050> away<00:02:24.200> in<00:02:24.320> my<00:02:24.410> local<00:02:24.680> show

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
quite happy tucked away in my local show

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.150 
quite happy tucked away in my local show
and<00:02:27.130> so<00:02:28.270> he<00:02:29.270> tries<00:02:29.630> like<00:02:29.870> it's<00:02:30.080> a<00:02:30.140> cool<00:02:30.380> mix<00:02:30.740> one

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
and so he tries like it's a cool mix one

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.940 
and so he tries like it's a cool mix one
so<00:02:31.490> supposedly<00:02:32.240> it's<00:02:32.540> mean<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:33.020> wick<00:02:33.920> moisture

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
so supposedly it's mean to wick moisture

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.400 
so supposedly it's mean to wick moisture
away<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:35.000> that's<00:02:35.300> meat<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.870> cool<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:36.200> down<00:02:36.260> a

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
away and that's meat to cool you down a

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.640 
away and that's meat to cool you down a
little<00:02:36.620> but<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:38.420> probably<00:02:38.990> does<00:02:39.230> get<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.500> little

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
little but it probably does get a little

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.100 
little but it probably does get a little
bit<00:02:39.890> but<00:02:40.220> because<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.790> is<00:02:41.720> I<00:02:41.870> mean<00:02:42.020> it

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
bit but because it is I mean it

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.530 
bit but because it is I mean it
is<00:02:42.230> thin<00:02:42.470> but<00:02:42.770> it<00:02:43.220> is<00:02:43.460> still<00:02:43.760> really<00:02:44.240> kinda

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
is thin but it is still really kinda

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.120 
is thin but it is still really kinda
bumpy<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:45.890> it's<00:02:46.820> fine<00:02:47.840> most<00:02:48.380> of<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.680> time<00:02:48.890> in

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
bumpy so it's fine most of the time in

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.880 
bumpy so it's fine most of the time in
Southeast<00:02:49.610> Asia<00:02:49.760> in<00:02:50.660> places<00:02:51.140> like<00:02:51.170> here<00:02:51.770> at

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
Southeast Asia in places like here at

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.220 
Southeast Asia in places like here at
the<00:02:51.980> moment<00:02:52.340> where<00:02:52.610> it's<00:02:52.700> 334<00:02:53.660> degrees<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:54.170> it

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
the moment where it's 334 degrees and it

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.890 
the moment where it's 334 degrees and it
doesn't<00:02:54.620> drop<00:02:54.800> alone<00:02:55.160> at<00:02:55.340> night<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:56.750> we've

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
sleep in it at all but in places

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.100
