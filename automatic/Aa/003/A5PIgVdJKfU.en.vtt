00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.850 

on<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.120> smaller<00:03:20.420> twist<00:03:20.900> in<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.320> front<00:03:21.680> I

on the smaller twist in the front I

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.680 
on the smaller twist in the front I

stay<00:03:23.960> in<00:03:24.140> place<00:03:24.470> they<00:03:24.890> were<00:03:24.950> small<00:03:25.340> enough<00:03:25.610> to

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
stay in place they were small enough to

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.360 
stay in place they were small enough to
be<00:03:25.820> able<00:03:25.940> to<00:03:26.150> hold<00:03:26.480> themselves<00:03:27.440> but<00:03:28.010> for<00:03:28.070> the

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
be able to hold themselves but for the

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.870 
be able to hold themselves but for the
back

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
back

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.880 
back
I<00:03:28.910> needed<00:03:29.360> a<00:03:29.450> rubberband<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.260> make<00:03:30.440> sure<00:03:30.680> they

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
I needed a rubberband to make sure they

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.670 
I needed a rubberband to make sure they
stayed<00:03:31.250> in<00:03:31.280> place<00:03:31.670> I<00:03:32.030> think<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.110> next<00:03:33.170> time<00:03:33.440> I

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
stayed in place I think the next time I

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.480 
stayed in place I think the next time I
put<00:03:33.890> rubber<00:03:34.100> bands<00:03:34.400> on<00:03:34.670> all<00:03:34.940> of<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.540> twists<00:03:36.020> I

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
put rubber bands on all of the twists I

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.010 
put rubber bands on all of the twists I
only<00:03:37.490> kept<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.850> twist<00:03:38.090> in<00:03:38.240> my<00:03:38.270> hair<00:03:38.540> one<00:03:38.780> day

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
only kept the twist in my hair one day

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.480 
only kept the twist in my hair one day
but<00:03:39.080> the<00:03:39.350> next<00:03:39.500> time<00:03:39.770> I'm<00:03:39.950> going<00:03:40.130> to<00:03:40.190> keep<00:03:40.370> them

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
but the next time I'm going to keep them

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.670 
but the next time I'm going to keep them
in<00:03:40.640> longer<00:03:41.150> because<00:03:41.780> there<00:03:41.960> are<00:03:42.050> so<00:03:42.410> many

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
in longer because there are so many

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.560 
in longer because there are so many
styles<00:03:42.950> that<00:03:43.280> I<00:03:43.400> could<00:03:43.610> do<00:03:43.760> with<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.060> twist<00:03:44.330> in

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
styles that I could do with the twist in

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.310 
styles that I could do with the twist in
my<00:03:44.840> hair<00:03:45.820> this<00:03:46.820> time<00:03:47.150> I<00:03:47.180> just<00:03:47.600> pinned<00:03:47.870> some<00:03:48.140> of

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
them up on the side to keep them out of

00:03:50.600 --> 00:04:05.940 
them up on the side to keep them out of
my<00:03:50.750> face
