00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
ball and came out and the next thing I

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.600 
ball and came out and the next thing I
knew<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:24.140> turned<00:01:24.500> around<00:01:24.649> on<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.159> ground<00:01:25.340> and

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
knew I turned around on the ground and

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.410 
knew I turned around on the ground and
dick<00:01:25.909> Malone<00:01:26.210> was<00:01:26.450> volume<00:01:26.810> is<00:01:27.049> clear<00:01:28.420> which

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
dick Malone was volume is clear which

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:37.420 
dick Malone was volume is clear which
was<00:01:29.600> great

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.540 

at<00:01:37.880> that<00:01:38.330> particular<00:01:38.450> time<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.550> significance

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
at that particular time the significance

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.150 
at that particular time the significance
or<00:01:40.760> the<00:01:40.790> relevance<00:01:41.270> of<00:01:41.390> it<00:01:41.650> didn't<00:01:42.650> even<00:01:42.800> come

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
or the relevance of it didn't even come

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.340 
or the relevance of it didn't even come
into<00:01:43.310> my<00:01:43.490> mind<00:01:43.730> because<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.720> ball<00:01:44.930> went<00:01:45.140> after

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
into my mind because the ball went after

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.800 
into my mind because the ball went after
a<00:01:45.380> throwing<00:01:45.860> then<00:01:46.640> leads<00:01:47.030> took<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.390> throw<00:01:47.600> and

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
a throwing then leads took the throw and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.720 
a throwing then leads took the throw and
so<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.170> game<00:01:48.380> went<00:01:48.590> on<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:49.430> that<00:01:49.700> just

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
so the game went on and so that just

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.060 
so the game went on and so that just
passed<00:01:50.270> on<00:01:50.480> it<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:51.080> was<00:01:51.260> just<00:01:51.470> became

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
passed on it it was just became

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.830 
passed on it it was just became
important<00:01:52.460> part<00:01:52.700> of<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:52.940> game<00:01:53.150> really<00:01:53.510> I'm

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
important part of the game really I'm

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.960 
important part of the game really I'm
and<00:01:54.440> then<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.650> television<00:01:55.130> come<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.520> start<00:01:55.880> to

and then the television come to start to
show<00:01:56.210> it<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:56.480> talk<00:01:56.720> about<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:57.110> then<00:01:57.980> I

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
show it and talk about it then I

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:06.170 
show it and talk about it then I
realized<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:59.600> know<00:01:59.630> what

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.420 

well<00:02:06.720> it's<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.900> best<00:02:07.020> double<00:02:07.380> silver<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
well it's the best double silver but the

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.820 
well it's the best double silver but the
best<00:02:08.610> see<00:02:08.820> of<00:02:08.910> no<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.390> made<00:02:09.930> a<00:02:09.960> better<00:02:10.229> one<00:02:10.350> I

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
best see of no I made a better one I

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.920 
best see of no I made a better one I
think<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.130> was<00:02:11.250> at<00:02:11.400> whole<00:02:11.550> city<00:02:11.850> he<00:02:12.570> was<00:02:12.690> two

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
think it was at whole city he was two

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.770 
think it was at whole city he was two
weeks<00:02:12.960> prior<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.970> but<00:02:14.970> again<00:02:15.090> yet<00:02:15.510> about

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
weeks prior to that but again yet about

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.250 
weeks prior to that but again yet about
a<00:02:15.840> crowd<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.970> 8,000<00:02:17.970> there<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.420> no<00:02:18.570> television

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
a crowd of 8,000 there and no television

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.250 
a crowd of 8,000 there and no television
and<00:02:19.440> that's<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:20.040> difference
