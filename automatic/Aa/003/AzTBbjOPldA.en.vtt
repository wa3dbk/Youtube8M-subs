00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
make that battery one of the solar panel

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.120 
make that battery one of the solar panel
batteries<00:00:21.750> there's<00:00:22.750> the<00:00:22.960> sump<00:00:23.910> there<00:00:24.910> see

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
batteries there's the sump there see

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.060 
batteries there's the sump there see
here's<00:00:27.130> the<00:00:27.190> regular<00:00:27.400> pump<00:00:27.880> right<00:00:28.090> here<00:00:28.360> I

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
here's the regular pump right here I

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.579 
here's the regular pump right here I
just<00:00:30.070> teed<00:00:30.640> off<00:00:30.670> of<00:00:31.150> the<00:00:31.589> copper<00:00:32.909> up<00:00:33.909> there<00:00:34.589> and

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:35.589 
just teed off of the copper up there and

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:37.919 
just teed off of the copper up there and
then<00:00:35.890> connected<00:00:36.609> it<00:00:36.730> and<00:00:36.909> then<00:00:37.059> reinforced

00:00:37.919 --> 00:00:37.929 
then connected it and then reinforced

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:39.750 
then connected it and then reinforced
this<00:00:38.229> because<00:00:38.530> that<00:00:38.559> sucker<00:00:38.949> was<00:00:39.069> wobbling<00:00:39.670> in

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
this because that sucker was wobbling in

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.059 
this because that sucker was wobbling in
the<00:00:39.789> wind<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:41.050> put<00:00:41.409> the<00:00:41.499> shut-off<00:00:41.739> right

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:42.069 
the wind and put the shut-off right

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:46.020 
the wind and put the shut-off right
there<00:00:42.569> now<00:00:43.569> as<00:00:43.749> you<00:00:43.899> can<00:00:43.989> see<00:00:44.909> it's<00:00:45.909> starting

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
there now as you can see it's starting

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.379 
there now as you can see it's starting
to<00:00:46.210> fill<00:00:46.389> up<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:47.489> hook<00:00:48.489> kind<00:00:48.789> of<00:00:48.879> quickly<00:00:49.149> here

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:49.389 
to fill up a hook kind of quickly here

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:54.539 
to fill up a hook kind of quickly here
so<00:00:50.819> we'll<00:00:52.739> we'll<00:00:53.739> wait<00:00:53.920> for<00:00:54.159> it<00:00:54.219> to<00:00:54.339> turn<00:00:54.489> on

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:54.549 
so we'll we'll wait for it to turn on

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:57.299 
so we'll we'll wait for it to turn on
but<00:00:55.499> they<00:00:56.499> set<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.829> floater

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
but they set the floater

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.840 
but they set the floater
so<00:00:58.059> that<00:00:58.269> way<00:00:59.249> because<00:01:00.249> if<00:01:00.370> you<00:01:00.459> need<00:01:00.609> the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
so that way because if you need the

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.930 
so that way because if you need the
floater<00:01:01.209> 3/4<00:01:02.100> 3/4<00:01:03.100> or<00:01:03.159> the<00:01:03.280> floater<00:01:03.519> to<00:01:03.789> be

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
floater 3/4 3/4 or the floater to be

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.359 
floater 3/4 3/4 or the floater to be
submerged<00:01:04.899> for<00:01:05.110> it<00:01:05.229> to<00:01:05.320> turn<00:01:05.469> on<00:01:05.649> or<00:01:06.009> turn<00:01:06.130> off

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
submerged for it to turn on or turn off

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.870 
submerged for it to turn on or turn off
or<00:01:07.299> turn<00:01:07.570> on<00:01:07.780> I<00:01:08.200> should<00:01:08.259> say<00:01:08.409> so<00:01:09.399> it's<00:01:09.579> so<00:01:09.729> up

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
or turn on I should say so it's so up

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.959 
or turn on I should say so it's so up
there<00:01:10.000> kind<00:01:10.210> of<00:01:10.270> quickly<00:01:10.659> but<00:01:11.110> well<00:01:12.039> we'll

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
there kind of quickly but well we'll

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.240 
there kind of quickly but well we'll
speed<00:01:13.240> it<00:01:13.360> up<00:01:13.450> here<00:01:13.479> a<00:01:13.659> little<00:01:13.810> bit<00:01:13.990> and<00:01:14.380> you

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
speed it up here a little bit and you

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.179 
speed it up here a little bit and you
might<00:01:15.579> not<00:01:15.700> hear<00:01:15.880> click<00:01:16.210> on<00:01:16.359> because<00:01:16.750> of<00:01:16.930> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
might not hear click on because of the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.899 
might not hear click on because of the
water<00:01:18.189> from<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.579> bucket<00:01:18.850> porn<00:01:20.579> when<00:01:21.579> you<00:01:21.729> do

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
water from the bucket porn when you do

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:42.719 
water from the bucket porn when you do
it<00:01:22.000> better

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.040 

okay<00:01:44.050> now<00:01:45.050> is<00:01:45.110> that<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.470> room<00:01:45.619> yet<00:01:47.050> Philips

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
okay now is that the room yet Philips

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.590 
okay now is that the room yet Philips
more<00:01:48.320> water<00:01:48.590> I<00:01:49.009> think<00:01:49.700> I<00:01:49.820> have<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.090> adjust<00:01:50.420> the

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
more water I think I have to adjust the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.990 
more water I think I have to adjust the
floater<00:01:50.900> a<00:01:51.020> little<00:01:51.290> bit<00:01:51.700> that<00:01:52.700> way<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:52.940> will

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
floater a little bit that way it will

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.280 
floater a little bit that way it will
turn<00:01:53.210> onto<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.479> tablet<00:01:53.869> sooner

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.290 
you can kind of see how fast that's
going<00:03:36.560> down<00:03:36.620> so<00:03:36.980> it's<00:03:37.280> empty<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:37.879> fairly

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
going down so it's empty and fairly

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.589 
going down so it's empty and fairly
quickly<00:03:39.099> okay<00:03:40.099> that<00:03:40.430> shutoff<00:03:40.879> now<00:03:41.239> you<00:03:41.299> can

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
quickly okay that shutoff now you can

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.089 
quickly okay that shutoff now you can
see<00:03:41.750> where<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:41.930> floaters<00:03:42.290> at<00:03:42.440> the<00:03:42.560> floater<00:03:42.799> on

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
see where the floaters at the floater on

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.259 
see where the floaters at the floater on
the<00:03:43.340> sump<00:03:43.580> pump<00:03:43.760> is<00:03:43.910> still<00:03:44.150> elevated<00:03:45.220> so<00:03:46.269> that

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
the sump pump is still elevated so that

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.119 
the sump pump is still elevated so that
way<00:03:47.510> I<00:03:47.750> can<00:03:48.049> go<00:03:48.140> ahead<00:03:48.230> and<00:03:48.349> turn<00:03:48.560> on<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.860> sump

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
way I can go ahead and turn on the sump

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:54.550 
way I can go ahead and turn on the sump
pump<00:03:49.220> now<00:03:52.540> watch<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.720> sump<00:03:53.959> pump<00:03:54.019> but<00:03:54.379> of

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
pump now watch the sump pump but of

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.620 
pump now watch the sump pump but of
course<00:03:54.860> it's<00:03:55.040> not<00:03:55.130> pump<00:03:55.430> will<00:03:55.610> pump<00:03:55.790> faster

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
course it's not pump will pump faster

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:10.210 
course it's not pump will pump faster
than<00:03:57.019> that<00:03:57.230> and<00:04:07.269> that's<00:04:08.269> it<00:04:08.660> and<00:04:08.980> when<00:04:09.980> I<00:04:10.010> was

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
than that and that's it and when I was

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.979 
than that and that's it and when I was
testing<00:04:10.610> it<00:04:10.700> the<00:04:10.819> first<00:04:11.060> time<00:04:11.360> while<00:04:11.750> it<00:04:11.870> was

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
testing it the first time while it was

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.479 
testing it the first time while it was
pumping<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:14.060> you<00:04:14.150> can<00:04:14.299> actually<00:04:14.420> see<00:04:15.310> you<00:04:16.310> can

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
pumping and you can actually see you can

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.340 
pumping and you can actually see you can
see<00:04:16.700> in<00:04:16.850> there<00:04:17.060> where<00:04:17.329> the<00:04:17.510> the<00:04:17.780> foot<00:04:18.049> or<00:04:18.169> the

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
see in there where the the foot or the

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.770 
see in there where the the foot or the
foot<00:04:18.560> valve<00:04:18.709> is<00:04:19.299> but<00:04:20.299> that's<00:04:20.479> going<00:04:20.660> to<00:04:20.720> be

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
foot valve is but that's going to be

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.320 
foot valve is but that's going to be
draining<00:04:20.989> for<00:04:21.320> a<00:04:21.350> little<00:04:21.530> bit<00:04:21.620> because<00:04:21.799> it's

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
draining for a little bit because it's

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.080 
draining for a little bit because it's
at<00:04:23.330> end<00:04:23.570> of<00:04:23.690> something<00:04:24.370> turn<00:04:25.370> on<00:04:25.580> for<00:04:25.850> a<00:04:25.880> while

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
at end of something turn on for a while

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.840 
at end of something turn on for a while
or<00:04:26.570> turned<00:04:27.080> off<00:04:27.200> for<00:04:27.440> a<00:04:27.470> while<00:04:27.590> but<00:04:28.310> you<00:04:28.669> can

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
or turned off for a while but you can

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.710 
or turned off for a while but you can
see<00:04:29.090> that<00:04:30.729> that<00:04:31.729> it's<00:04:31.910> sitting<00:04:32.240> pretty<00:04:32.450> good

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
see that that it's sitting pretty good

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.650 
see that that it's sitting pretty good
I've<00:04:33.229> got<00:04:33.440> about<00:04:33.560> another<00:04:34.270> six<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.510> eight

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
I've got about another six to eight

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
inches from the bottom of that foot

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.820 
inches from the bottom of that foot
valve<00:04:37.970> to<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:38.360> bottom<00:04:38.630> of<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.780> pump<00:04:39.050> and

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
valve to the bottom of the pump and

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.290 
valve to the bottom of the pump and
right<00:04:40.310> at<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.490> bottom<00:04:40.700> sump<00:04:41.000> where<00:04:41.210> all

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
right at the bottom sump where all

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.150 
right at the bottom sump where all
sediment<00:04:41.780> is<00:04:41.900> but<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.970> nice<00:04:44.120> thing<00:04:44.150> is<00:04:44.599> is

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
sediment is but the nice thing is is

sediment is but the nice thing is is
when<00:04:46.160> I<00:04:46.190> had<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:46.520> on<00:04:46.639> I<00:04:46.700> was<00:04:47.090> draining<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:47.630> five

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
when I had it on I was draining the five

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.300 
when I had it on I was draining the five
gallon<00:04:48.020> bucket<00:04:48.530> of<00:04:48.590> water<00:04:48.770> in<00:04:48.979> there<00:04:49.099> pretty

gallon bucket of water in there pretty
quickly<00:04:49.580> and<00:04:50.000> it<00:04:50.780> was<00:04:50.960> keeping<00:04:51.590> up<00:04:51.830> with<00:04:51.919> it

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
quickly and it was keeping up with it

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.790 
quickly and it was keeping up with it
with<00:04:52.190> no<00:04:52.340> problem<00:04:52.820> so<00:04:53.750> another<00:04:54.590> thing<00:04:54.620> I<00:04:54.740> don't

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
with no problem so another thing I don't

with no problem so another thing I don't
like<00:04:54.889> about<00:04:54.979> it<00:04:55.220> is<00:04:55.370> how<00:04:55.430> it<00:04:55.580> you<00:04:56.120> know<00:04:56.150> how<00:04:56.389> it
