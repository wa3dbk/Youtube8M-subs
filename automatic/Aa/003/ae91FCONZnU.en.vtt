00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
and there is in fact a video on their

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.750 
and there is in fact a video on their
site<00:00:26.359> and<00:00:26.390> you<00:00:26.750> have<00:00:26.900> to<00:00:27.050> do<00:00:27.170> it<00:00:27.350> but<00:00:27.800> me<00:00:28.609> my

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
site and you have to do it but me my

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.580 
site and you have to do it but me my
friend<00:00:29.000> but<00:00:29.119> found<00:00:29.510> that<00:00:29.599> kind<00:00:29.960> of<00:00:30.050> confusing

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
friend but found that kind of confusing

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.549 
friend but found that kind of confusing
so<00:00:30.740> this<00:00:30.890> is<00:00:31.010> my<00:00:31.220> way<00:00:31.400> of<00:00:31.430> doing<00:00:31.820> it<00:00:32.350> it<00:00:33.350> may<00:00:33.499> be

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
so this is my way of doing it it may be

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.020 
so this is my way of doing it it may be
slightly<00:00:33.889> hard<00:00:34.129> it<00:00:34.339> may<00:00:34.460> be<00:00:34.519> slightly<00:00:34.819> easier

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
slightly hard it may be slightly easier

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.479 
slightly hard it may be slightly easier
i<00:00:35.269> don't<00:00:35.539> know<00:00:35.659> maybe<00:00:35.960> exactly<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.530> same<00:00:36.710> but

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
i don't know maybe exactly the same but

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.069 
i don't know maybe exactly the same but
this<00:00:37.699> is<00:00:37.879> how<00:00:38.120> i<00:00:38.149> do<00:00:38.329> it<00:00:38.629> and<00:00:38.780> it<00:00:38.870> works

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
this is how i do it and it works

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.289 
this is how i do it and it works
perfectly<00:00:39.319> fine<00:00:39.859> so<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.850> first<00:00:40.999> thing<00:00:41.120> you

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:41.299 
perfectly fine so the first thing you

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:44.829 
perfectly fine so the first thing you
want<00:00:41.479> to<00:00:41.510> do<00:00:41.870> is<00:00:42.139> choose<00:00:43.010> your<00:00:43.159> custom<00:00:43.699> pack<00:00:44.359> so

want to do is choose your custom pack so

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:46.869 
want to do is choose your custom pack so
blue<00:00:45.170> one<00:00:45.379> is<00:00:45.589> number<00:00:45.920> one<00:00:46.039> red<00:00:46.370> ones<00:00:46.549> number

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879

blue one is number one red ones number
two<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:47.269> yellow<00:00:47.510> one<00:00:47.690> is<00:00:47.719> number<00:00:48.170> three<00:00:48.499> so

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
two and yellow one is number three so

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:51.189 
two and yellow one is number three so
I've<00:00:49.249> already<00:00:49.399> got<00:00:49.609> stuff<00:00:49.819> on<00:00:49.969> blue<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:50.690> red
