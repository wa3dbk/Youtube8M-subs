the<00:00:54.239> tips<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.629> his<00:00:54.750> toes<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.370> countering<00:00:56.370> and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the tips of his toes a countering and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.360 
the tips of his toes a countering and
handling<00:00:57.180> Thorazine<00:00:57.809> every<00:00:58.559> step<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.340> way

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
handling Thorazine every step of the way

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.849 
handling Thorazine every step of the way
but<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.940> was<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> very<00:01:00.210> tight<00:01:00.989> very<00:01:01.020> close

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
but it was a very tight very close

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.889 
but it was a very tight very close
battle<00:01:02.129> no<00:01:02.789> one<00:01:02.940> had<00:01:03.120> expansions<00:01:03.629> for<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
battle no one had expansions for the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.140 
battle no one had expansions for the
first<00:01:04.170> 15<00:01:04.710> minutes<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.159> think<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:06.030> was

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
first 15 minutes I think and it was

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.429 
first 15 minutes I think and it was
perhaps<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.780> strangest<00:01:08.000> Strange's

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
perhaps one of the strangest Strange's

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.080 
perhaps one of the strangest Strange's
matchups<00:01:10.439> I've<00:01:10.560> seen<00:01:10.799> apparently<00:01:11.729> Huck<00:01:11.939> is

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
matchups I've seen apparently Huck is

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.300 
matchups I've seen apparently Huck is
asking<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.600> cross<00:01:12.869> spots<00:01:13.200> only<00:01:13.409> thursday

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
asking is this cross spots only thursday

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.109 
asking is this cross spots only thursday
in<00:01:14.369> saying<00:01:14.670> no<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.890> actually<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.610> cross

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
in saying no but it actually is cross

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.780 
in saying no but it actually is cross
spots<00:01:18.450> only<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.930> cannot<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.710> an<00:01:19.950> ally<00:01:20.400> spawn

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
spots only you cannot have an ally spawn

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.719 
spots only you cannot have an ally spawn
here<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.110> perhaps<00:01:22.680> he<00:01:23.070> was<00:01:23.220> wondering<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:23.610> it

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
here so perhaps he was wondering if it

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.910 
here so perhaps he was wondering if it
was<00:01:23.820> only<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.240> vertical<00:01:25.020> cross<00:01:25.320> spawn<00:01:25.619> cross

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
was only a vertical cross spawn cross

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.520 
was only a vertical cross spawn cross
spawn<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:26.820> i<00:01:26.850> think<00:01:27.750> he<00:01:27.840> really<00:01:28.080> meant<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> say

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
spawn but i think he really meant to say

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.260 
spawn but i think he really meant to say
that<00:01:28.710> there<00:01:28.829> really<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.130> no<00:01:29.490> allies<00:01:29.970> spawn

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
that there really is no allies spawn

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.940 
that there really is no allies spawn
whatsoever<00:01:30.840> probably<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.799> quickly

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
whatsoever probably going to quickly

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.620 
whatsoever probably going to quickly
come<00:01:32.280> up<00:01:32.400> here<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.850> looks<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.090> Huck<00:01:33.390> will

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
come up here and it looks like Huck will

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.410 
come up here and it looks like Huck will
be<00:01:33.780> able<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.079> scout<00:01:34.920> out<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.549> location<00:01:36.210> in

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
be able to scout out this location in

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.510 
be able to scout out this location in
just<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.990> moment<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.070> doesn't<00:01:38.250> really

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
just a moment and it doesn't really

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.399 
just a moment and it doesn't really
matter<00:01:38.759> as<00:01:39.090> he<00:01:39.270> does<00:01:39.509> choose<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.869> correct

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
matter as he does choose a correct

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.499 
matter as he does choose a correct
scouting<00:01:40.860> order<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.310> order<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.939> try<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.119> find

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
scouting order in order to try to find

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.530 
scouting order in order to try to find
his<00:01:42.750> opponent<00:01:44.000> interestingly<00:01:45.000> enough

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
his opponent interestingly enough

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.749 
his opponent interestingly enough
thursday<00:01:46.049> not<00:01:46.320> going<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> refinery<00:01:47.460> once

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.700 
from Huck I believe he does have a lot
of<00:05:19.760> centuries<00:05:20.449> the<00:05:20.870> centuries<00:05:21.229> were<00:05:21.380> warped

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
of centuries the centuries were warped

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.340 
of centuries the centuries were warped
in<00:05:21.979> first<00:05:22.310> in<00:05:22.490> order<00:05:22.669> to<00:05:22.850> get<00:05:23.060> more<00:05:23.330> energy<00:05:23.570> we

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
in first in order to get more energy we

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.990 
in first in order to get more energy we
are<00:05:24.470> currently<00:05:24.620> running<00:05:25.130> off<00:05:25.430> of<00:05:25.460> five

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
are currently running off of five

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.990 
are currently running off of five
gateways<00:05:26.630> and<00:05:26.870> now<00:05:27.650> even<00:05:27.919> adding<00:05:28.430> a<00:05:28.520> robotics

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
gateways and now even adding a robotics

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.839 
gateways and now even adding a robotics
facility<00:05:29.169> the<00:05:30.169> SCB<00:05:30.590> did<00:05:30.860> scout<00:05:31.190> out<00:05:31.430> this<00:05:31.639> one

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:31.849 
facility the SCB did scout out this one

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:33.490

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
working in this one SCB gets destroyed

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.450 
working in this one SCB gets destroyed
just<00:05:38.539> in<00:05:38.720> time<00:05:38.960> as<00:05:39.229> more<00:05:39.620> and<00:05:39.800> more<00:05:39.860> stalkers

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
just in time as more and more stalkers

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.969 
just in time as more and more stalkers
are<00:05:40.610> still<00:05:40.880> being<00:05:41.210> added<00:05:41.660> five<00:05:42.440> centuries<00:05:42.770> i

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
are still being added five centuries i

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:44.409 
are still being added five centuries i
believe<00:05:43.370> Huck<00:05:43.610> is<00:05:43.760> going<00:05:43.940> to<00:05:44.000> wait<00:05:44.240> until

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
believe Huck is going to wait until

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.190 
believe Huck is going to wait until
these<00:05:44.630> centuries<00:05:44.900> have<00:05:45.349> and<00:05:46.090> perhaps<00:05:47.200> 150

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
these centuries have and perhaps 150

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.490 
these centuries have and perhaps 150
