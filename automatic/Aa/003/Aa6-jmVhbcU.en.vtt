00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
whole group of people that talks about

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.580 
whole group of people that talks about
the<00:00:17.340> idea<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.600> don't<00:00:18.840> need<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.230> take<00:00:19.410> any

the idea that you don't need to take any

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.370 
the idea that you don't need to take any
supplements<00:00:20.160> because<00:00:20.869> there's<00:00:21.869> plenty<00:00:22.140> in

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
supplements because there's plenty in

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.109 
supplements because there's plenty in
the<00:00:22.500> food<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:23.340> may<00:00:23.550> have<00:00:23.670> been<00:00:23.789> true<00:00:24.000> at<00:00:24.090> one

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.960 
the food that may have been true at one
time<00:00:24.539> but<00:00:25.289> it's<00:00:25.800> not<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.220> easy<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.580> do<00:00:26.730> anymore

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
time but it's not so easy to do anymore

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.439 
time but it's not so easy to do anymore
I<00:00:27.859> run<00:00:28.859> into<00:00:29.070> people<00:00:29.099> all<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.550> time<00:00:29.580> on<00:00:30.060> that

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:42.770 
isolated and that's that's a key point
that<00:00:42.030> we're<00:00:42.149> going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.300> talk<00:00:42.420> about<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.719> a

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
minute but you probably are going to

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.119 
minute but you probably are going to
find<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.020> difficult<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.530> find<00:00:46.739> everything

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
find it difficult to find everything

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.580 
find it difficult to find everything
that<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.430> need<00:00:47.730> out<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.300> your<00:00:48.600> food<00:00:48.809> now

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
that you need out of your food now

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.810 
that you need out of your food now
perhaps<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:50.190> you're<00:00:50.309> growing<00:00:50.520> your<00:00:50.789> own

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
perhaps if you're growing your own

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.840 
perhaps if you're growing your own
vegetables<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.780> you're<00:00:52.649> raising<00:00:53.489> your<00:00:53.699> own

beef or other animals that you may eat

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.330 
beef or other animals that you may eat

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
if you're aware of everything and you

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.760 
if you're aware of everything and you
cook<00:00:59.640> everything<00:00:59.940> yourself<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:01.500> don't<00:01:01.530> want

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
cook everything yourself we don't want

to<00:01:01.829> cook<00:01:01.949> too<00:01:02.160> much<00:01:02.309> we<00:01:02.550> want<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.820> have<00:01:02.910> things

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
to cook too much we want to have things

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.060 
to cook too much we want to have things
more<00:01:03.390> close<00:01:03.629> closely<00:01:04.500> aligned<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.979> their

more close closely aligned to their

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.030 
more close closely aligned to their
origin<00:01:05.519> but<00:01:06.290> you<00:01:07.290> probably<00:01:07.650> are<00:01:07.830> going<00:01:07.950> to

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
origin but you probably are going to

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.710 
origin but you probably are going to
find<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.400> hard<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.729> get<00:01:08.880> every<00:01:09.180> nutrient<00:01:09.570> that

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
find it hard to get every nutrient that

find it hard to get every nutrient that
you<00:01:09.810> need<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.170> amount<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.710> need

from<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.549> foods<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:12.540> can<00:01:12.689> talk<00:01:12.869> about<00:01:13.049> soil

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
from the foods we can talk about soil

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.530 
from the foods we can talk about soil
depletion<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.760> talk<00:01:14.939> about<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> fact

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
depletion we can talk about the fact

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.310 
depletion we can talk about the fact
that<00:01:15.830> industrial<00:01:16.830> food<00:01:17.189> growing<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.360> giving

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
that industrial food growing is giving

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.200 
that industrial food growing is giving
us<00:01:19.439> foods<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.860> aren't<00:01:20.070> very<00:01:20.280> nutritious<00:01:20.820> we

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
us foods that aren't very nutritious we

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.550 
us foods that aren't very nutritious we
can<00:01:21.330> talk<00:01:21.450> about<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.750> fact<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.020> organic

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
can talk about the fact that organic

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.230 
can talk about the fact that organic
foods<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:23.009> somewhere<00:01:23.400> around<00:01:23.520> six<00:01:23.939> times

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
foods have somewhere around six times

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.179 
foods have somewhere around six times
the<00:01:24.750> nutrient<00:01:25.140> density<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> what<00:01:26.070> you

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
the nutrient density of the what you

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.429 
the nutrient density of the what you
will<00:01:26.610> commonly<00:01:26.790> buy<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> supermarket<00:01:27.930> so

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
will commonly buy in the supermarket so

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.899 
will commonly buy in the supermarket so
it's<00:01:28.619> difficult<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.220> get<00:01:29.430> everything<00:01:29.729> you

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
it's difficult to get everything you

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.960 
it's difficult to get everything you
need<00:01:30.180> out<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:31.020> good<00:01:31.470> diet<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.610> know<00:01:32.670> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
need out of a good diet and I know that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.550 
need out of a good diet and I know that
because<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.360> do<00:01:33.479> testing<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.049> office<00:01:34.380> that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
because we do testing in the office that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.929 
because we do testing in the office that

indicates whether or not you've gotten
enough<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.509> nutrients<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.110> whether<00:01:37.259> or

enough of the nutrients and whether or

enough of the nutrients and whether or
not<00:01:37.439> you've<00:01:37.619> absorbed<00:01:37.950> them<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:39.000> may<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.299> a

factor as well a lot of the common foods

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.190 
factor as well a lot of the common foods
people<00:01:41.369> eat<00:01:41.670> these<00:01:41.909> days<00:01:42.180> don't<00:01:42.869> have

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
people eat these days don't have

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.899 
people eat these days don't have
nutrients<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.130> form<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.549> are<00:01:44.640> really

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
nutrients in a form that are really

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.090 
nutrients in a form that are really
easily<00:01:45.299> absorbed<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.409> there<00:01:46.560> can<00:01:46.710> be<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.860> lot<00:01:47.070> of

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
easily absorbed so there can be a lot of

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.469 
easily absorbed so there can be a lot of
things<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.460> interfere<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:47.939> your<00:01:48.180> getting

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
things that interfere with your getting

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.260 
things that interfere with your getting
your<00:01:48.570> nutrients<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.710> my<00:01:50.280> take<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.030> that

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
your nutrients so my take on it is that

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.700 
your nutrients so my take on it is that
you're<00:01:51.420> probably<00:01:51.810> not<00:01:52.170> going<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.500> get

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
you're probably not going to get

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.770 
you're probably not going to get
everything<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.369> need<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.909> out<00:01:54.659> of

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
everything that you need just out of

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.660 
everything that you need just out of
your<00:01:54.899> food<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:56.040> other<00:01:56.070> hand<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.490> don't

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
your food on the other hand I don't

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.969 
your food on the other hand I don't
think<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.939> need<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.149> take<00:01:57.450> grocery<00:01:58.380> bags<00:01:58.649> full

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
think you need to take grocery bags full

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.880 
think you need to take grocery bags full
of<00:01:59.250> supplements<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.960> really<00:02:01.649> key<00:02:01.860> on

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
of supplements you can really key on

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.690 
of supplements you can really key on
certain<00:02:02.790> things<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.640> way<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
certain things and have a way to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.609 
certain things and have a way to
understand<00:02:06.360> what<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.200> need<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.380> take

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
understand what it is you need to take

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.380 
understand what it is you need to take
there's<00:02:08.129> some<00:02:08.310> pretty<00:02:08.489> good<00:02:08.640> laboratory<00:02:09.239> work

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
there's some pretty good laboratory work

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.850 
there's some pretty good laboratory work
out<00:02:09.569> there<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.080> can<00:02:10.200> get<00:02:10.379> different

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
out there that you can get different

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.400 
out there that you can get different
ways<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.400> test<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.940> couple<00:02:12.330> ways<00:02:12.599> with<00:02:12.900> one

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
ways to test a couple ways with one

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.280 
ways to test a couple ways with one
a blood<00:02:13.740> test<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:14.580> allows<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.120> see<00:02:15.450> from

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
a blood test that allows you to see from

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.780 
a blood test that allows you to see from
the<00:02:16.410> response<00:02:16.710> of<00:02:16.860> certain<00:02:17.160> cells<00:02:17.370> whether

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
the response of certain cells whether

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.580 
the response of certain cells whether
you've<00:02:17.940> got<00:02:18.060> enough<00:02:18.330> nutrients<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:18.960> found<00:02:19.440> that

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
you've got enough nutrients I found that

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.410 
you've got enough nutrients I found that
to<00:02:19.740> be<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.860> pretty<00:02:20.100> good<00:02:20.280> tool<00:02:20.460> you<00:02:21.120> can

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
to be a pretty good tool you can

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.900 
to be a pretty good tool you can
actually<00:02:21.870> test<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.890> levels<00:02:23.190> in<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.490> blood<00:02:23.700> if

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
actually test the levels in the blood if

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.510 
actually test the levels in the blood if
you<00:02:24.030> more<00:02:24.690> accurately<00:02:25.470> test<00:02:25.740> what's<00:02:26.190> in<00:02:26.400> the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
you more accurately test what's in the

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.220 
you more accurately test what's in the
red<00:02:26.670> blood<00:02:26.880> cell<00:02:27.120> there<00:02:27.480> are<00:02:27.630> red<00:02:27.810> blood<00:02:27.990> cell

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
red blood cell there are red blood cell

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.290 
red blood cell there are red blood cell
analysis<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.130> can<00:02:29.160> do<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.970> can<00:02:30.150> do

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
analysis that you can do you can do

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.450 
analysis that you can do you can do
something<00:02:30.930> called<00:02:31.110> an<00:02:31.230> organic<00:02:31.620> acid<00:02:32.040> test<00:02:32.280> or

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
something called an organic acid test or

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.340 
something called an organic acid test or
a<00:02:32.490> urine<00:02:32.790> test<00:02:32.970> where<00:02:33.600> we<00:02:33.720> look<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.990> see<00:02:34.170> that

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
a urine test where we look to see that

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.510 
a urine test where we look to see that
certain<00:02:34.530> things<00:02:34.830> are<00:02:34.950> coming<00:02:35.160> out<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.370> the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
certain things are coming out in the

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.430 
certain things are coming out in the
urine<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:36.420> way<00:02:36.570> we<00:02:36.720> know<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.200> the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
urine that way we know that the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.200 
urine that way we know that the
nutrients<00:02:37.860> are<00:02:37.950> upstream<00:02:38.370> because<00:02:38.520> you'll

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
nutrients are upstream because you'll

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.060 
nutrients are upstream because you'll
get<00:02:39.660> different<00:02:39.900> things<00:02:40.110> if<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.680> didn't<00:02:40.980> have

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
get different things if you didn't have

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.920 
get different things if you didn't have
the<00:02:41.220> nutrients<00:02:41.580> available<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:42.480> create<00:02:42.810> the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
the nutrients available to create the

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.930 
the nutrients available to create the
right<00:02:43.080> end<00:02:43.320> products<00:02:43.710> of<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:43.890> if<00:02:44.490> we<00:02:44.760> can

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
right end products of that if we can

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.640 
right end products of that if we can
follow<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:45.960> there<00:02:46.200> are<00:02:46.260> different<00:02:46.560> ways

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
follow that so there are different ways

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.020 
follow that so there are different ways
to<00:02:46.890> look<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.220> see<00:02:47.400> if<00:02:47.550> you're<00:02:47.670> getting<00:02:47.850> the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
to look and see if you're getting the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.210 
to look and see if you're getting the
nutrients<00:02:48.750> into<00:02:48.930> your<00:02:49.050> body<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.470> find<00:02:50.040> most

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
nutrients into your body I find most

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.520 
nutrients into your body I find most
people<00:02:50.640> have<00:02:50.930> deficiency<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.050> their<00:02:52.200> even

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
people have deficiency in their even

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.400 
people have deficiency in their even
with<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.680> very<00:02:52.770> good<00:02:53.100> diet<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:54.410> considering

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
with a very good diet so considering

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.740 
with a very good diet so considering
what<00:02:55.530> most<00:02:55.740> Americans<00:02:56.220> eat<00:02:56.460> yeah<00:02:57.210> you<00:02:57.510> got<00:02:57.720> to

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
what most Americans eat yeah you got to

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.710 
what most Americans eat yeah you got to
take<00:02:57.990> supplements<00:02:58.460> but<00:02:59.460> I<00:02:59.730> would<00:03:00.390> say<00:03:00.690> that

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
take supplements but I would say that

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.540 
take supplements but I would say that
it's<00:03:01.080> good<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.320> key<00:03:01.710> in<00:03:01.890> on<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.250> things<00:03:02.460> that

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
it's good to key in on the things that

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.460 
it's good to key in on the things that
you<00:03:02.760> need<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.300> not<00:03:03.420> take<00:03:03.690> everything<00:03:03.870> on<00:03:04.350> the

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
you need and not take everything on the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.340 
you need and not take everything on the
shelf<00:03:04.790> so<00:03:05.790> use<00:03:06.090> some<00:03:06.300> testing<00:03:06.720> go<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.960> somebody

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
shelf so use some testing go to somebody

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.380 
shelf so use some testing go to somebody
who<00:03:07.500> has<00:03:07.710> some<00:03:07.950> knowledge<00:03:07.980> now<00:03:08.970> there's<00:03:09.180> also

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
who has some knowledge now there's also

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.060 
who has some knowledge now there's also
what<00:03:09.720> we<00:03:09.750> call<00:03:09.840> nutraceutical<00:03:10.680> treatment

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
what we call nutraceutical treatment

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.250 
what we call nutraceutical treatment
sometimes<00:03:12.030> instead<00:03:12.570> of<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.780> pharmaceutical

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
sometimes instead of a pharmaceutical

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.800 
sometimes instead of a pharmaceutical
drug<00:03:13.500> will<00:03:14.430> use<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.730> nutrient<00:03:15.390> in<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.630> much

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
drug will use a nutrient in a much

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.440 
drug will use a nutrient in a much
higher<00:03:16.020> dose<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:16.890> get<00:03:17.010> in<00:03:17.130> effect<00:03:17.459> so<00:03:18.000> it
