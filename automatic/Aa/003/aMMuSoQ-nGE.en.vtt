barrier<00:01:06.920> I<00:01:07.280> was<00:01:08.119> recommend<00:01:08.600> being<00:01:08.810> on<00:01:09.170> the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
barrier I was recommend being on the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.249 
barrier I was recommend being on the
right<00:01:09.530> side<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.160> when<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.149> steps<00:01:11.390> go<00:01:11.600> up<00:01:11.780> to

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
right side and when the steps go up to

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.280 
right side and when the steps go up to
do<00:01:12.410> the<00:01:12.950> knife<00:01:13.100> lunge<00:01:13.280> every<00:01:13.670> time<00:01:14.080> this<00:01:15.080> knife

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
do the knife lunge every time this knife

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.380 
do the knife lunge every time this knife
lunge<00:01:15.530> is<00:01:15.830> very<00:01:16.100> easy<00:01:16.369> so<00:01:16.850> you<00:01:16.880> should<00:01:17.090> get<00:01:17.270> on

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
lunge is very easy so you should get on

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.780 
lunge is very easy so you should get on
your<00:01:17.540> first<00:01:17.780> try<00:01:17.869> or<00:01:18.050> second<00:01:18.470> try<00:01:18.649> from<00:01:19.610> here

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
your first try or second try from here

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.639 
your first try or second try from here
it's<00:01:20.060> not<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.300> barrier<00:01:20.630> glitch<00:01:20.990> but<00:01:21.320> you<00:01:21.410> can<00:01:21.530> go

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
it's not a barrier glitch but you can go

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.920 
it's not a barrier glitch but you can go
to<00:01:21.710> many<00:01:21.950> other<00:01:22.100> spots<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:23.390> can<00:01:23.509> either<00:01:23.630> drop

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
to many other spots you can either drop

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.230 
to many other spots you can either drop
off<00:01:24.170> behind<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.740> boat<00:01:24.920> well<00:01:25.399> there<00:01:25.520> is<00:01:25.759> a<00:01:25.789> it

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
off behind the boat well there is a it

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.500 
off behind the boat well there is a it
is<00:01:26.300> a<00:01:26.450> barrier<00:01:26.780> glitch<00:01:27.050> or<00:01:28.000> you<00:01:29.000> can<00:01:29.150> sprint

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
is a barrier glitch or you can sprint

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.530 
is a barrier glitch or you can sprint
jump<00:01:29.750> and<00:01:30.020> go<00:01:30.140> prone<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:30.799> then<00:01:31.549> it<00:01:31.729> is<00:01:32.360> also

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
jump and go prone and then it is also

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.210 
jump and go prone and then it is also
another<00:01:33.020> barrier<00:01:33.440> glitch<00:01:33.619> which<00:01:33.830> are<00:01:33.979> showing

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
another barrier glitch which are showing

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.550 
another barrier glitch which are showing
the<00:01:34.340> video<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:34.970> then<00:01:35.659> if<00:01:35.810> you<00:01:35.900> go<00:01:36.049> backwards

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
the video and then if you go backwards

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.050 
the video and then if you go backwards
you<00:01:36.680> can<00:01:36.799> go<00:01:36.920> on<00:01:37.010> the<00:01:37.100> rock<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.580> then<00:01:37.700> go<00:01:38.030> back

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
you can go on the rock and then go back

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.359 
you can go on the rock and then go back
in<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:38.479> map<00:01:38.689> I<00:01:39.010> personally<00:01:40.010> think<00:01:40.130> that's<00:01:40.310> a

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
in the map I personally think that's a

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:41.590 
in the map I personally think that's a
good<00:01:40.520> glitch<00:01:40.760> because<00:01:40.970> you<00:01:41.119> can<00:01:41.240> get<00:01:41.330> it<00:01:41.479> back

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
good glitch because you can get it back

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.960 
good glitch because you can get it back
in<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.930> map<00:01:42.140> now<00:01:43.070> for<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.400> swimming<00:01:43.640> glitch

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
in the map now for the swimming glitch

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.969 
in the map now for the swimming glitch
you<00:01:44.570> just<00:01:44.750> need<00:01:44.900> to<00:01:44.960> go<00:01:45.110> forward<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:45.710> a<00:01:45.770> hold

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
you just need to go forward and a hold

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.380 
you just need to go forward and a hold
left<00:01:47.229> there<00:01:48.229> might<00:01:48.439> be<00:01:48.470> a<00:01:48.619> death<00:01:48.830> barrier

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
left there might be a death barrier

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.060 
left there might be a death barrier
depending<00:01:50.390> on<00:01:50.479> slow<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:50.810> go<00:01:51.110> so<00:01:51.979> I'd

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
depending on slow you go so I'd

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.520 
depending on slow you go so I'd
recommend<00:01:52.220> going<00:01:52.670> fast<00:01:53.060> now<00:01:53.960> you<00:01:54.020> can<00:01:54.259> shoot

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
recommend going fast now you can shoot

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.460 
recommend going fast now you can shoot
and<00:01:54.860> you<00:01:55.490> can<00:01:55.790> swim<00:01:56.060> but<00:01:56.990> you<00:01:57.140> are<00:01:57.200> very

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
and you can swim but you are very

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.410 
and you can swim but you are very
limited<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:58.009> swimming<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.640> you<00:01:59.000> do<00:01:59.119> freeze<00:01:59.390> a

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
limited to swimming and you do freeze a

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.410 
limited to swimming and you do freeze a
lot<00:02:00.100> although<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:01.280> is<00:02:01.400> pointless<00:02:01.820> it<00:02:02.119> is<00:02:02.150> the

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
lot although it is pointless it is the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.840 
lot although it is pointless it is the
first<00:02:02.600> swimming<00:02:03.200> glitch<00:02:03.470> on<00:02:03.680> call<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.640> dead

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
first swimming glitch on call the dead

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.249 
first swimming glitch on call the dead
so<00:02:05.659> I<00:02:05.689> think<00:02:05.960> it's<00:02:06.079> pretty<00:02:06.229> cool<00:02:07.750> it<00:02:08.750> is<00:02:08.929> also<00:02:09.110> a

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
so I think it's pretty cool it is also a

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.280 
so I think it's pretty cool it is also a
barrier<00:02:09.679> glitch<00:02:10.299> so<00:02:11.299> um<00:02:11.570> if<00:02:11.840> you<00:02:11.900> want<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:12.110> have

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
barrier glitch so um if you want to have

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.990 
barrier glitch so um if you want to have
a<00:02:12.320> second<00:02:12.680> controller<00:02:13.010> there<00:02:13.340> or<00:02:13.579> you<00:02:13.880> know
