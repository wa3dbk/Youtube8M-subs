00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:04.379
 He says that TV is made possible by CZ 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.150
 in addition 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.170
 welcome to haag vvv I view a special price of a book by 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.929
 toshiba 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.929
 We are also going to have two new motherboards with a harder chip 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.040
 We start with the new digital cable TV tuner from technicians 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.710
 my country of cuijkslag with colleague frank a question 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.800
 digital TV can watch something there so a bit tricky to walk on 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.769
 computers of year 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.209
 used to be worth a couple of tens due to a location error 

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.969
 all done 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.100
 Nowadays you have what does it mean that we have something different years later 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.649
 once again sold and pulled out even though it seems the problem is very bad 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:57.140
 low fat 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.970
 how the Dutch cable market works a little on timing in addition to his work 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.080
 all channels encrypted for all providers 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.210
 these little boys who uses special encryption nagravision 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.020
 there can be very brief about that is good and I then have for them 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.830
 fit 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.020
 and ziggo has you know how encryption and you can use that on your own 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.350
 you can also need a tuner was a smart card in can or at least one 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.659
 they needed at least a convertible 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.240
 but the smart card then 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.070
 but yes it can be dramatically plaque other can than can be that 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.310
 that falls most trainers in front of the TV that can even come to the flat offices 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.150
 You cannot use lindes 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.100
 then in the council among others and jessie j offers that and those who want 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.330
 Share with all issues solved and that was that 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.720
 Windows Media Center says that through the TV fabrics are part of almost all 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.230
 versions of windows 7 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.200
 the standard does not support digital cable television only for 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.590
 satellite and for this bp now but for digitenne 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.480
 and that for months to get talk there must be a formal must between the makers 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.680
 full of displacement against bsc a language image is mixed 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.980
 yes it is a bit like pretending to be a different type anyway 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.410
 being able to work in the meantime is all about the complicated story 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.490
 to do with much more to do that microsoft not officially supported 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.110
 is becoming 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.480
 by the cable farm include the Netherlands that would say would be like 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.710
 said that they are not supported for a long time 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.590
 and we also don't want to officially build in that minners the netherlands microsoft 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.580
 makes no sense anymore in dozens of phone calls from people who don't 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.550
 get talking 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.770
 if it is not microsoft itself so it is understandable though 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.889
 Fortunately there are also manufacturers who have you solve that 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:33.049
 that is a device made two years ago in the hague against tv de en ici 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.209
 a Christmas party 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.170
 but when I was always a lot taller 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.220
 ever another manufacturer who made mission site tuners believe that 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.150
 if the city that road but who are with their the business activities stop yes that 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.640
 may also be a bit restarted maybe we will all soon 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.300
 again what is the foundations of his house in yes marco janssen you can do it there too 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.389
 not really fake notification an hour play the tendency to come the so-called soft 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.449
 the other that means you get the power how you direct 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:03.599
 in soest on what and will feast for the coming weeks and yes that is delicious 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.029
 the purchase price of target of of alphacrypt mother who normally just need 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:09.329
 piece or a hundred euros to save you drive 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.769
 You see how smart card can make no sense and I have a while 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.279
 but yes who I live in your area needs a national register should one 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.930
 smart card that stated all standard its knife 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.180
 also view the HD variant too strong but completely off the map 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.540
 he would keep coming with the new version it is very clear it is one 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.420
 look a lot nicer yes it was a sign that everyone talks a lot 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.869
 able to say but beautiful that time mathias was still something 

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:37.189
 yes that would be for and what did the search on youtube do with the pandza 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.509
 middle class for plastic to pull if you further is a little sturdier 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.919
 and look at the back it's the differences and similarities 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.680
 This accusation is that the two are also the connections that means you 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.629
 this when the indoor extinguishing if you use the two now stops then counting in and 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.799
 I had driven a lamppost with it 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.829
 In addition, by the approaching pension or to television if you are still analog 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.600
 he could watch television and he dropped 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.850
 after he again 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.500
 the new device has one 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.810
 a separate adapter needed that he had that you get is not that competitor 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.340
 for the four o'clock b so that means everything in they have two then the sun 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.290
 have that you are against a strong team while that you just have two extra 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.659
 extra plugs 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:22.729
 and not only the big difference that has in seven after rest also turned around 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.509
 come for a soft that explained the cards of the ns in the goal of kj 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:28.580
 world of kpn for digitenne 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.360
 The rest is in stopping because when finding suitable for both digital 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.309
 cable TV 

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:34.729
 as the publicity 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.830
 and besides that it is also and it is she is full 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.949
 but in their own can better stop 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.159
 yes it is actually does not want to comply 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.569
 why the job are already i can offer fall for this club 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:47.479
 the ticket can enter the group directly 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.479
 but no in portfolio this is a piece of example to that when you put it in 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.229
 wanting to use it abroad might be slightly different encryption 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.879
 that you can come up with a when daniel can start after a 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:02.039
 An additional advantage is that everything has been given more space because it 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.009
 having this man stepped was a bit tricky for example that of that big one 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.120
 if you have teams for a cable and a cable connection, you don't always want that 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.409
 fit places and that is also a bit easier here 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:16.539
 know more about the about that feels like people will hopefully he comes back 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:20.469
 out of the corner Monday afternoon was not the case, the coupling of ideal is normal 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:22.240
 can be contested 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.150
 bravo single market make him out of the election that makes sense or you 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.039
 so I do not need so makhachkala directly in 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.740
 A hundred people would hope that in the future this would be a little officer 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.729
 so-called lucky goal announced that they will come with sidepots that they will 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.680
 unfortunately not the case 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.699
 yes maybe his site talked or said we use it 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.639
 it is what i wonder she is it is the new and old more expensive or cheaper 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.199
 then a few months that has been a time of mine of four decades 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:52.639
 and this one has a suggested retail price of 149 is a suggested retail price of 189 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:56.610
 and i must honestly say that for the dutch situation it actually 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.580
 since the spring 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.629
 the savings that four decades a few places that I attach because the team is 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:03.699
 then perhaps indeed if you can but you have it should not 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:04.710
 is needed 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.069
 and and the fact that it doesn't need extra power is that I even 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.550
 An advantage of the cheap country if you serve a media center is that too 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.949
 from yes i thought 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:16.289
 and to the goal they both have tested again and again 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:18.250
 by digital TV 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.230
 that may be the title there is no difference between what the greenhouse you do is the year 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.310
 forward the cable one at a trade show to Ghana the PC 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:29.400
 and that's for that matter the cote voters that this will be the installation 

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:33.770
 Also goes that something uses the will turn was 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.970
 what else a according to the new drivers and what was not the case before 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.749
 this for the first time 

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:43.499
 is that represents first name the kart sharing have technically answered the 

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:46.639
 meaning that the two can then connect a step system 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:50.040
 jansma and one of the two cards and then you can stop at with 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:53.840
 at the tuners all paid to that they view the village second made rich year 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.949
 simple use 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:58.300
 of the cartel in the first set starts if you insist that youtube channel work well 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.120
 We will do that perfect but good that we actually attach it to those I attach 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.729
 with new drivers is just as good as with 13 7 the spontaneous on you now again 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:06.699
 not needed 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:10.840
 and also tested again for a short time on the plan on an open system 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.300
 with and intel core i3 with integrated perfect 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.860
 Because it was a combination we had been in the PC advisory system for quite some time 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.830
 agadez do a short 3 system 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.389
 with both riders slightly among the members, the lingering ones are every 

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:27.419
 month so that for the people who say it would not work well 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:30.370
 but it can only have once again confirmed that put gets this 

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.479
 working week again considering the wealth of fine animals that I think am fit 

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:37.770
 Nicole Richie is a very fast enough to not get on HD channels 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.680
 those at ziggo have 40 hours at the station without problems and also retire if it's on 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.900
 the man tries to record the two programs at the same time 

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.889
 they record 

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:48.860
 it looks like a neat in a media center 

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.780
 so concluding that requirement there is happy that coninckplein is the only one and with that 

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:57.300
 also the best choice if you want to watch digital cable television media center 

00:07:57.939 --> 00:07:59.939
 and what you have to do saves you well 

00:07:59.939 --> 00:08:03.029
 that he has four tens of he threatens I heard one of the two still himself 

00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:05.120
 always on the economical and thereby the best choice
