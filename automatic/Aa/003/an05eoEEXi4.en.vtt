ec you can do any inversion you want
later<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:21.180> right<00:01:21.390> now<00:01:22.250> I'm<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.490> goes

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
later but for right now I'm and it goes

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.510 
later but for right now I'm and it goes
to<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.150> second<00:01:24.930> which<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.110> minor<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.689> be<00:01:28.520> d

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
to the second which is minor so it be d

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:39.950 
to the second which is minor so it be d
minor<00:01:30.479> 7<00:01:32.659> Dean<00:01:33.659> D<00:01:35.810> m.a.c<00:01:37.549> back<00:01:38.549> down<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
minor 7 Dean D m.a.c back down and the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.910 
minor 7 Dean D m.a.c back down and the
third<00:01:40.259> would<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.500> e<00:01:41.479> by<00:01:42.479> your<00:01:42.659> side<00:01:42.840> when<00:01:45.920> you

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
third would be e by your side when you

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.700 
third would be e by your side when you
have<00:01:47.189> F<00:01:47.720> major<00:01:48.720> 7<00:01:49.110> because<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
have F major 7 because it's the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.999 
have F major 7 because it's the
forthright<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:52.649> then<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:52.979> your

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
forthright and then you have your

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.090 
forthright and then you have your
dominant<00:01:53.579> 7th<00:01:54.210> chords<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.750> just<00:01:55.020> be<00:01:55.700> g7<00:01:58.100> and

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
dominant 7th chords so just be g7 and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.679 
dominant 7th chords so just be g7 and
that's<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.909> little<00:02:00.090> different<00:02:00.299> than<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
that's it's a little different than the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.359 
that's it's a little different than the
major<00:02:00.899> right<00:02:01.320> because<00:02:01.590> there's<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.860> flat<00:02:02.100> side

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
major right because there's a flat side

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:11.119 
major right because there's a flat side
of<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.810> then<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.700> G<00:02:05.700> B<00:02:06.600> D<00:02:10.039> when<00:02:11.039> you

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
of it so then you have G B D when you

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:18.350 
of it so then you have G B D when you
have<00:02:11.280> another<00:02:11.400> minor<00:02:11.790> 6<00:02:12.450> minor<00:02:13.020> 7<00:02:13.500> or<00:02:14.030> 8<00:02:15.030> 17<00:02:17.360> and

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
have another minor 6 minor 7 or 8 17 and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.000 
have another minor 6 minor 7 or 8 17 and
you<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:18.599> your<00:02:18.780> flat<00:02:19.470> 7<00:02:19.890> for<00:02:20.250> minor<00:02:20.849> 7<00:02:21.270> flat<00:02:21.300> 5

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
you have your flat 7 for minor 7 flat 5

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.830 
you have your flat 7 for minor 7 flat 5
which<00:02:23.010> has<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.280> matter<00:02:23.569> 73<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.450> starts<00:02:27.720> on

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
which has a matter 73 and that starts on

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:39.050 
which has a matter 73 and that starts on
be<00:02:27.989> so<00:02:28.349> mean<00:02:29.090> d<00:02:30.319> a<00:02:34.970> FB<00:02:36.590> fdp<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:38.129> then<00:02:38.700> just

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
be so mean d a FB fdp and then just

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:54.520 
be so mean d a FB fdp and then just
write<00:02:39.269> to<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.599> major
