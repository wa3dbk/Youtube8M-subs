00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.330
 finally arrived after a long time 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.389
 indeed long overflowing waiting of 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.550
 hype destiny is finally out and all 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.500
 enthusiasts immediately took courses at 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.050
 buy their copy to have 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.779
 finally the chance to try it 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.359
 I am among these and after this before 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.849
 week of play on the new title 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.929
 bungee I am ready to give you my first 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.239
 impressions 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.520
 but I want to clarify immediately why I have 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.910
 deliberately used the expression 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.530
 first impressions instead of review 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.450
 this is due to the fact that I am not 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.539
 I still feel ready to pass judgment 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.360
 so definitive and binding on this 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.700
 game indeed destiny is a broad title 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.800
 vast than most likely in 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.530
 coming months will change a lot thanks 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.170
 upon arrival of dlc and additional content 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.420
 it seems really premature at a distance 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.520
 in no week from the exit give a 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.500
 so that final judgment 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.869
 I can do what I'm going to do in the video of 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.820
 today it is communicating to you a little my first 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.770
 thoughts in short, what came to me 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.900
 in mind playing this game for the 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.790
 so first time I would start right 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.159
 of the thing that remained to me a little more 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.619
 impressed here is the plot the 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.330
 campaign that was immediately a little one 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.790
 of my question marks for how long 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.799
 regards this destiny because before 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.130
 launch had been shown a lot for 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.979
 regarding the classes the weapons the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.900
 multiplayer public events and so on 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.119
 etc. but had not been shown 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.490
 practically nothing or much 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.590
 little for what concerns the i 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.470
 characters the story like the missions 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.049
 they were connected to each other and what it is 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.610
 in short, he kept all this together 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.829
 and actually then also in the game 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.500
 complete I really found one 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.110
 in short, a very dull story 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.570
 non-existent plot the characters do not 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.119
 the are also not at all characterized 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.610
 our protagonist apart from a few 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.979
 little joke inside the game 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.259
 the characters almost never speak 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.349
 secondary and also are very few e 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.340
 meaningless and above all lacking 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.560
 let's say so 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.319
 the background what bungee has 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.360
 created in a row in short, such a universe 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.310
 so vast was not able to 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.230
 also recreate here in destiny 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.720
 because we simply talk about 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.330
 darkness of enemies 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.099
 we say so not too characterized 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.680
 which is not known for what strange reason 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.470
 act is not really second nor for 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.170
 regarding the narrative aspect 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.450
 and plot this latest bungee title is 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.209
 far below expectations 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.430
 having said this, I will continue talking about the 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.010
 cooperative sector that part of 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.140
 game on yours was the same as spades in place 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.120
 really much emphasis at the time of 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.880
 presentation of this last one 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.410
 title and in fact it is known as le 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.620
 emissions are fun to play 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.049
 with friends well structured enough 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.940
 long and above all I really appreciate the 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.430
 difficulty system that is a lot 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.110
 scalable and allows you to replay 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.480
 various missions over and over again for 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.579
 get better rewards maybe 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.040
 the only comment I can really make 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.980
 in this case it is the fact that to the state 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.350
 up to today and many today 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.720
 emissions are limited to one 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.609
 team consisting of three players e 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.040
 at least for my case 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.500
 the group I played with was high then 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.359
 much more numerous and therefore this 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.239
 limitation here you can bring 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.349
 behind only two friends in many 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.150
 occasions 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.880
 so let's say it involves the fact that 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.620
 someone can't play so here is 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.750
 this is perhaps the only comment I can 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.150
 I'd like to see maybe some 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.220
 mission with a number of players a 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.900
 at least four higher 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.209
 it happens in the majority of titles 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.139
 plaice and then last cooperative 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.609
 point the one concerning the multiplayer 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:59.010
 competitive also called the crucible 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.799
 in this case, things get complicated 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.230
 because even though in general here 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.370
 let's say so I don't mind more then 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.099
 much 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.530
 there are some inside 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.239
 really important flaws that second 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.060
 I am going to limit them a lot 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.760
 potential in the first place is really suffering 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.400
 from the connection factor 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.150
 I play destiny on playstation 4 or 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.400
 one with 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.160
 average Italian mission therefore not 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.340
 completely crappy but neither 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.229
 gifted here and I noticed that in 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.139
 lots of online games played in the 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:37.050
 competitive multiplayer there is a lag 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.699
 really very heavy and not those 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.400
 that maybe they won't let me into 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:44.550
 ovi doors move without you there 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.729
 really move but one delay 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.699
 background latency really very much 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:53.220
 annoying it happens very often that you shoot 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.870
 to an enemy the enemy should be 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.080
 dead but actually standing 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.389
 still for two three seconds it kills us and 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.699
 then followed he dies besides this 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.190
 I would also add a map design 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.729
 they are not all right 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.889
 very claustrophobic full of obstacles 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.440
 restricted without having us so great 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:16.440
 spaces maybe the only one you save is 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.539
 the lunar one also present in the alpha 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.190
 and then in the beta regarding 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:23.940
 all the others are really a lot 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:27.360
 closed many messed up and carry often 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.280
 to have two or four enemies on you 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.560
 at the same time he was born who come 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.050
 launch a little at random is often understood of 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.120
 die because you get involved in 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.169
 this in this mega baraonda without 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.840
 sense 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.240
 to serve as a condiment for all this 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.909
 icing on the cake if you prefer 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.889
 we also have small problems with 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:48.930
 balancing that afflict this 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.789
 competitive multiplayer starting 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.550
 precisely from the super loaded of the 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:56.639
 soccer player that is really too powerful 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.800
 and almost always guarantees at least two ifs 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:01.229
 not three kills and leaves no one 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.060
 type of escape for opposing players 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.789
 also regarding some as well 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.820
 We have weapons like snipers 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:10.979
 little too much relief and allow some 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.680
 killing too easy for not 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.900
 then talk about the automatic rifles you in 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.800
 many occasions thanks also to the area of 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.050
 we talked about before 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.449
 they kill with very few shots 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.530
 without leaving us in any time of 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:24.510
 reaction 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.430
 in conclusion then I don't want to be 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.020
 too harsh or negative in judging 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.820
 this destiny also because as I have 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.710
 said before is in my opinion too early 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.370
 to go out and give a concrete judgment 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.130
 defined 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.020
 however, given the great experience of spades 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.400
 and the great masterpieces he baked in 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.440
 past and especially the great ones 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.760
 expectations that were created around 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.710
 to this video game 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.630
 surely I was expecting something more 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.280
 here is what we have for now 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.620
 hands and in my opinion is a game from 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.870
 great potential but still not 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.669
 has been fully exploited must 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.160
 be corrected past and surely 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:58.080
 also expanded and with this also for 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.370
 today I would say that we can conclude myself 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.560
 I recommend leaving a nice like 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.210
 if you liked the videos to comment 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.010
 with your personal opinion of 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.560
 destiny to let me know what you think 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.270
 in these first estimates the game is of 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.400
 continues to suffer jima network for non 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.100
 miss so many other videos of destinies that 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.210
 not only every merck is here for today 

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.210
 all from the children
