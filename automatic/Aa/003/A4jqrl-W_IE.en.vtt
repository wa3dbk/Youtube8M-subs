00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.170 
mad at Guardian tight so here's a little

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.320 
mad at Guardian tight so here's a little
bit<00:05:56.410> of<00:05:56.500> information<00:05:56.770> about<00:05:57.340> how<00:05:57.730> to<00:05:57.760> run<00:05:58.060> guys

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
bit of information about how to run guys

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.060 
bit of information about how to run guys
in<00:05:58.360> case<00:05:58.630> you<00:05:58.810> don't<00:05:58.990> know<00:05:59.050> boost<00:05:59.500> attacking

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
in case you don't know boost attacking

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.940 
in case you don't know boost attacking
defense<00:06:00.490> relative<00:06:01.060> to<00:06:01.240> units<00:06:01.630> for<00:06:01.870> mainly<00:06:02.320> HP

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
defense relative to units for mainly HP

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.560 
defense relative to units for mainly HP
so<00:06:03.850> it's<00:06:04.000> kind<00:06:04.210> of<00:06:04.270> like<00:06:04.420> a<00:06:04.950> zerg<00:06:06.240> but<00:06:07.240> he<00:06:07.420> does

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
so it's kind of like a zerg but he does

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.080 
so it's kind of like a zerg but he does
attack<00:06:07.900> and<00:06:08.230> defense<00:06:08.620> instead<00:06:09.040> of<00:06:09.160> attack<00:06:09.460> so

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
attack and defense instead of attack so

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.290 
attack and defense instead of attack so
I<00:06:10.120> pretty<00:06:10.750> nice<00:06:10.990> but<00:06:11.740> uh<00:06:11.800> this<00:06:12.760> unit<00:06:13.180> is<00:06:13.240> a

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
I pretty nice but uh this unit is a

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.660 
I pretty nice but uh this unit is a
unique<00:06:13.810> unit<00:06:14.170> guys<00:06:14.320> I<00:06:14.620> actually<00:06:15.220> think<00:06:15.430> I'm

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.670 
unique unit guys I actually think I'm

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.160

dark<00:06:25.540> elemental<00:06:26.170> attack<00:06:26.470> all<00:06:26.830> enemies<00:06:27.310> and<00:06:27.760> in

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
dark elemental attack all enemies and in

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.120 
dark elemental attack all enemies and in
this<00:06:28.360> is<00:06:28.570> that<00:06:28.690> he<00:06:28.840> also<00:06:29.020> adds<00:06:29.350> poison<00:06:29.920> and

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
this is that he also adds poison and

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.060 
this is that he also adds poison and
weakness<00:06:30.760> effect<00:06:31.660> to<00:06:31.870> all<00:06:31.900> of<00:06:32.350> your<00:06:32.470> parties
