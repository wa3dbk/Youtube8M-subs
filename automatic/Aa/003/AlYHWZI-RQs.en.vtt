00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
because I knew the X arc would

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.539 
because I knew the X arc would
eventually<00:01:49.229> go<00:01:49.590> away<00:01:49.799> but<00:01:50.009> looks<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.430> was

quote-unquote Lord at the end here but

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.460 
quote-unquote Lord at the end here but
it<00:03:22.180> is<00:03:22.299> pretty<00:03:22.599> easy<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.900> beat<00:03:23.109> so<00:03:23.260> you<00:03:23.319> don't

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
it is pretty easy to beat so you don't

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.449 
it is pretty easy to beat so you don't
really<00:03:23.560> you<00:03:23.739> don't<00:03:23.889> really<00:03:24.010> got<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.310> worry

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
really you don't really got to worry

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.839 
really you don't really got to worry
about<00:03:24.700> that<00:03:26.010> wasn't<00:03:27.010> quite<00:03:27.130> sure<00:03:27.400> you<00:03:27.519> know<00:03:27.549> if

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
about that wasn't quite sure you know if

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.819 
about that wasn't quite sure you know if
you<00:03:27.970> had<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.239> push<00:03:28.480> one<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:28.930> then<00:03:29.019> run<00:03:29.349> or<00:03:29.620> what

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
you had to push one and then run or what

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.099 
you had to push one and then run or what
but<00:03:30.489> here<00:03:30.700> all<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:31.150> does<00:03:31.329> is<00:03:31.510> simply<00:03:31.810> just<00:03:31.959> open

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
but here all it does is simply just open

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.949 
but here all it does is simply just open
that<00:03:32.470> door<00:03:32.739> and<00:03:32.980> that's<00:03:33.819> it<00:03:34.120> I<00:03:34.269> can<00:03:34.780> hear

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
that door and that's it I can hear

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.020 
that door and that's it I can hear
another<00:03:35.079> door<00:03:35.620> open<00:03:36.069> so<00:03:36.190> I<00:03:36.220> wasn't<00:03:36.579> sure<00:03:36.730> if

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
another door open so I wasn't sure if

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.059 
another door open so I wasn't sure if
