00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.009
 everybody say when are you that? 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.240
 last time privately cycled 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.670
 So I 've got that is some years ago 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.820
 I got the bike 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.030
 But there was the euphoria and the will 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.289
 then not exactly the same but yes so it 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.119
 Definitely fun again though 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.699
 The track can sometimes be quite 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.619
 be nice here in the training camp 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.560
 you do at all so as to benefit 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.490
 the normal sport still something so 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.349
 I'm thinking right now in the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.340
 preparation is almost impossible because 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.500
 to do something extra because you 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.550
 just so broken and must indeed 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.050
 his little hurt the man 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.460
 He automatically gets along with him 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.640
 try to regenerate or 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.910
 get away and because he casually he 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.280
 an xbox or playstation what play 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.070
 You like what you do best 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.510
 can and he but that is clear because the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.420
 classic fifa basketball as well 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.809
 Formula 1 makes every amount of fun 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.219
 the razor yes one can say so in the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.899
 I'm not allowed to traffic like that 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.039
 That's why I prefer to do it 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.280
 an xbox good guide what do you think 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.990
 actually from the tour de france as 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.670
 habs looked at like but must now 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.420
 I say this did not work out because he did 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.659
 so what is then how is that what me 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.259
 most at his training camp 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.970
 So I have to say quite honestly 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.380
 actually makes me train really 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.360
 a lot of fun and I am also one 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.860
 he prefers to know more or longer 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.590
 but train on such a workout everything 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.049
 Okay again, it will not be today 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.970
 Our suit annoys most 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.060
 of course the heat here because you 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.320
 train at 35 to 40 degrees and there 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.500
 every turn is twice as hard and 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.229
 that this annoys me the most, but 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.369
 I say so much sun rather than rain 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.979
 is that the training camp with the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.689
 Colleagues are different than at home 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.610
 yes of course you see yourself 24 hours 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.439
 one day or another there may be over 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.570
 I'm so annoying but it is 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.020
 yes he still in a positive frame 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.780
 and yes, of course, one then tells oneself 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.040
 everything he has on his heart and 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.439
 some want to hear something then 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.810
 just then you have the ears on 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.409
 You also have to put through in the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.409
 stadium can 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:17.700
 what are you studying turn up the number 1 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.099
 the jersey but in the last season 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.680
 was not it how difficult that is 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.359
 so for you personally 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.769
 So I'm completely honest 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.609
 and open to me personally that is 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.459
 really hard 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:32.969
 I came here was me then 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.650
 stupidly injured and now in the 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.519
 Last season apparently had one 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.170
 fair chance hoped 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.599
 Of course the timo is very good 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.659
 had played solid his part played 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.799
 and I was also told that he was with 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.500
 a residential building in the preparation 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.659
 but I hope for a fair 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.790
 chance and if I'm the war I am 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.189
 voted relatively positive because I am myself 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.669
 Feel very good in training and 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.669
 I'm really fit again
