00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.430
 I am your old friend garacad with 111 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.780

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.870

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.890
 explain step by step because I did not like my good game tutorials for 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.290
 start choose either any character from your selection list we already did 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.120
 they will choose one of the towers of opponents 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.950
 when they have to fight against an opponent, let them lose the two brawn 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.670
 I recommend that if you want to lose fast choose the last storm 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.670
 acs 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.440
 here I am going to stop 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.490
 to be able to explain how to put the codes first the buttons that you have 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.090
 to touch the beach 1 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.220
 you have to touch the high mount button once twice the button 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.370
 hit low three times the lock button and four times the buttons 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.450
 low kick i 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.720
 high kicks 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.270
 and now the buttons that beach player 2 should touch must be played four times 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.900
 hit buttons to twente hit low three times the lock button two 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.720

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.610
 that came out people have to be in the order that I told them they can do it in 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.090
 anyone 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.270
 but at the beginning it may be that later it took off afterwards it might turn out to be 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.200
 easy 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.629
 now to say goodbye to him he showed a profile of the marq 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.059

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:14.869
