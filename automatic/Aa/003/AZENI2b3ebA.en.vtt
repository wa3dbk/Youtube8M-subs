inputs<00:01:47.759> going<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.000> be<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.270> right<00:01:48.390> hand

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
inputs going to be on the right hand

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.090 
inputs going to be on the right hand
side<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.200> if<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.409> want<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.649> make<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> things

side so if you want to make the things

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.219 
side so if you want to make the things
smaller<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.939> sticky<00:01:51.299> pistons<00:01:51.750> start<00:01:52.049> from

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
smaller the sticky pistons start from

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.690 
smaller the sticky pistons start from
the<00:01:52.350> right<00:01:52.380> hand<00:01:52.799> side<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.340> know<00:01:53.549> if<00:01:53.640> you

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the right hand side so you know if you

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.069 
the right hand side so you know if you
want<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.850> make<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.060> only<00:01:54.180> for<00:01:54.479> long<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:54.930> these

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
want to make it only for long then these

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.350 
want to make it only for long then these
sticky<00:01:55.439> pistons<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.070> go<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:57.090> let's<00:01:57.149> just

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
sticky pistons have to go so let's just

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.520 
sticky pistons have to go so let's just
put<00:01:57.509> those<00:01:57.600> back<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.110> then<00:01:58.200> we'll<00:01:58.320> start

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
put those back and then we'll start

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.289 
put those back and then we'll start
doing<00:01:58.740> redstone<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.700> next<00:01:59.820> we're<00:02:00.030> going<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.210> do

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
doing redstone so next we're going to do

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.060 
doing redstone so next we're going to do
is<00:02:00.390> go<00:02:00.630> up<00:02:00.659> one<00:02:01.110> block<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.590> then<00:02:01.710> put<00:02:01.920> in

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
is go up one block and then put in

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.720 
make the mine upside down so just put
some<00:02:34.500> upside<00:02:34.800> down<00:02:34.890> stairs<00:02:35.130> right<00:02:35.340> along<00:02:35.580> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
some upside down stairs right along the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.850 
some upside down stairs right along the
top<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:36.120> our<00:02:36.270> blocks<00:02:36.570> we<00:02:36.720> just<00:02:36.900> put<00:02:37.050> in<00:02:37.170> like

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
top of our blocks we just put in like

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.949 
top of our blocks we just put in like
that<00:02:38.100> now<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.030> reason<00:02:39.209> why<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.600> has<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.930> be

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
that now the reason why that has to be

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.720 
that now the reason why that has to be
upside<00:02:40.290> down<00:02:40.320> stairs<00:02:40.680> too<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.160> so<00:02:41.489> you<00:02:41.550> can

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
upside down stairs too and so you can

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.250 
upside down stairs too and so you can
open<00:02:41.970> up<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.090> chest<00:02:42.330> if<00:02:42.569> it's<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.810> normal<00:02:42.989> block

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
open up the chest if it's a normal block

chests next we're going to just put

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.410 
chests next we're going to just put
repeaters<00:02:47.220> going<00:02:47.459> into<00:02:47.670> all<00:02:47.820> these<00:02:48.000> bottom

along<00:04:06.090> all<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.390> tops<00:04:06.690> of<00:04:06.810> these<00:04:06.930> box<00:04:10.010> now

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
along all the tops of these box now

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.380 
along all the tops of these box now
we're<00:04:11.130> gonna<00:04:11.220> now<00:04:11.519> we're<00:04:11.790> gonna<00:04:12.030> know<00:04:12.209> why

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
we're gonna now we're gonna know why

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.420 
we're gonna now we're gonna know why
this<00:04:12.450> stair<00:04:12.900> has<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:13.380> be<00:04:13.500> here<00:04:13.829> now<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.280> reason

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
this stair has to be here now the reason

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.069 
this stair has to be here now the reason
why<00:04:14.609> the<00:04:14.670> stair<00:04:15.000> has<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.329> be<00:04:15.450> here<00:04:15.600> so<00:04:15.810> we<00:04:15.959> can

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
why the stair has to be here so we can

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.409 
why the stair has to be here so we can
go<00:04:16.200> up<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.500> block<00:04:16.739> from<00:04:17.400> our<00:04:17.609> dust<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.060> put<00:04:18.239> more

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
go up a block from our dust and put more

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.880 
go up a block from our dust and put more
dust<00:04:18.630> right<00:04:18.840> here<00:04:19.079> see<00:04:19.470> how<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.620> stays

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
dust right here see how it stays

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.830 
dust right here see how it stays
connected<00:04:20.190> if<00:04:20.489> this<00:04:20.669> was<00:04:20.849> a<00:04:20.880> normal<00:04:21.120> block

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
connected if this was a normal block

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.450 
connected if this was a normal block
right<00:04:22.019> here<00:04:22.049> it<00:04:22.349> would<00:04:22.530> this<00:04:23.039> connect

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
right here it would this connect

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.680 
right here it would this connect
these<00:04:23.580> two<00:04:23.789> we<00:04:24.030> don't<00:04:24.300> want<00:04:24.509> this<00:04:24.630> happening

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
these two we don't want this happening

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.170 
these two we don't want this happening
that's<00:04:25.560> why<00:04:25.800> we<00:04:25.949> put<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.340> subset<00:04:26.789> downstair

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
that's why we put a subset downstair

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.249 
that's why we put a subset downstair
here<00:04:27.449> so<00:04:27.870> they<00:04:28.050> stay<00:04:28.319> connected<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:30.080> then<00:04:31.080> up

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
here so they stay connected and then up

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:32.420 
here so they stay connected and then up
here<00:04:31.319> from<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.830> top<00:04:32.009> we're<00:04:32.130> going<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:32.310> come

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
here from the top we're going to come

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.300 
here from the top we're going to come
down<00:04:32.669> a<00:04:32.729> block<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.360> put<00:04:34.169> dust<00:04:34.380> here<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:34.860> then

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
down a block I put dust here and then

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
down a block I put dust here and then
from<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.550> top<00:04:35.729> we're<00:04:35.880> going<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.060> come<00:04:36.180> down

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
from the top we're going to come down

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.580 
from the top we're going to come down
one<00:04:36.660> more<00:04:36.840> block<00:04:37.080> so<00:04:37.319> it<00:04:37.380> looks<00:04:37.530> something

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
one more block so it looks something

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.420 
one more block so it looks something
like<00:04:37.740> this<00:04:37.830> kind<00:04:38.099> of<00:04:38.160> like<00:04:38.280> they're

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
like this kind of like they're

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.339 
like this kind of like they're
connecting<00:04:38.819> together<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.360> then<00:04:40.139> we're<00:04:40.259> going

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:40.349 
connecting together and then we're going

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.020 
connecting together and then we're going
to<00:04:40.410> put<00:04:40.500> a<00:04:40.620> repeater<00:04:41.039> right<00:04:41.340> here<00:04:41.490> on<00:04:41.639> one<00:04:41.849> tick

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
to put a repeater right here on one tick

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.600 
to put a repeater right here on one tick
the<00:04:42.210> leg<00:04:42.530> then<00:04:43.530> behind<00:04:43.949> the<00:04:44.130> repeater<00:04:44.490> we're

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
the leg then behind the repeater we're

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.860 
the leg then behind the repeater we're
going<00:04:44.729> to<00:04:44.819> put<00:04:44.940> a<00:04:45.090> sticky<00:04:45.449> piston<00:04:45.569> facing

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
going to put a sticky piston facing

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.110 
going to put a sticky piston facing
upwards<00:04:46.380> with<00:04:47.099> a<00:04:47.130> block<00:04:47.430> on<00:04:47.460> top<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.940> it<00:04:48.000> this

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
upwards with a block on top of it this

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.700 
upwards with a block on top of it this
will<00:04:48.300> create<00:04:48.389> a<00:04:48.599> monostable<00:04:48.990> circuit<00:04:49.560> and

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
will create a monostable circuit and

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.860 
will create a monostable circuit and
this<00:04:50.160> right<00:04:50.340> here<00:04:50.370> is<00:04:50.550> our<00:04:50.849> input<00:04:51.030> so<00:04:51.690> if<00:04:51.780> we

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
this right here is our input so if we

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.710 
this right here is our input so if we
put<00:04:52.020> dust<00:04:52.319> here<00:04:52.680> or<00:04:52.860> you<00:04:53.430> know<00:04:53.520> dust<00:04:53.819> here<00:04:54.240> or

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
put dust here or you know dust here or

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.010 
put dust here or you know dust here or
dust<00:04:55.080> here<00:04:55.880> it<00:04:56.880> will<00:04:57.060> activate<00:04:57.419> so<00:04:57.690> if<00:04:57.750> I<00:04:57.810> could

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
dust here it will activate so if I could

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.800 
dust here it will activate so if I could
put<00:04:58.199> a<00:04:58.229> button<00:04:58.440> right<00:04:58.590> here<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:58.770> click<00:04:59.009> it<00:04:59.810> it
