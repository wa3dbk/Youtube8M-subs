00:01:09.559 --> 00:01:09.569 
the seed up on the top of your screen as

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.510 
the seed up on the top of your screen as
you<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:10.079> see<00:01:10.229> next<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.679> the<00:01:10.799> build<00:01:11.039> number<00:01:11.100> we

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
you can see next to the build number we

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.609 
you can see next to the build number we
have<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.939> number<00:01:12.329> in<00:01:12.630> parentheses<00:01:13.350> that

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
have this number in parentheses that

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.859 
have this number in parentheses that
number<00:01:14.009> is<00:01:14.189> actually<00:01:14.429> the<00:01:14.819> seed<00:01:15.060> number<00:01:15.270> so

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
number is actually the seed number so

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.760 
number is actually the seed number so
just<00:01:16.049> remember<00:01:16.200> 26<00:01:16.649> for<00:01:17.869> 279<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.289> if<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.560> go

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
just remember 26 for 279 and if I go

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.399 
just remember 26 for 279 and if I go
back<00:01:19.799> into<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.849> world<00:01:21.090> options<00:01:21.749> you<00:01:22.049> can<00:01:22.170> see

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
back into the world options you can see

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.999 
back into the world options you can see
that<00:01:22.649> the<00:01:22.740> seed<00:01:23.009> for<00:01:23.219> that<00:01:23.549> world<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:24.029> 264<00:01:25.009> 279

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
that the seed for that world is 264 279

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.089 
that the seed for that world is 264 279
just<00:01:26.609> like<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:27.299> saw<00:01:27.869> up<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.649> build<00:01:29.039> number

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:29.099 
just like we saw up in the build number

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:31.279 
just like we saw up in the build number
so<00:01:29.789> that's<00:01:30.149> a<00:01:30.299> really<00:01:30.630> really<00:01:30.779> cool<00:01:30.869> feature

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
so that's a really really cool feature

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.620 
so that's a really really cool feature
for<00:01:32.039> the<00:01:32.340> people<00:01:32.700> running<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.149> build<00:01:33.359> and

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
for the people running the build and

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.659 
for the people running the build and
they<00:01:33.899> want<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.139> showcase<00:01:34.349> a<00:01:34.560> seed<00:01:34.950> but<00:01:35.279> I<00:01:35.310> don't

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:35.669 
they want to showcase a seed but I don't

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:37.159 
they want to showcase a seed but I don't
think<00:01:35.880> that's<00:01:36.119> going<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.450> be<00:01:36.659> there<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.079> the

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:37.169 
think that's going to be there in the

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:39.379 
think that's going to be there in the
official<00:01:37.560> release<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.399> it's<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:39.149> a

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:39.389 
official release so it's just a

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:41.510 
official release so it's just a
temporary<00:01:39.810> feature<00:01:40.289> so<00:01:40.799> other<00:01:41.189> than<00:01:41.429> that

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
temporary feature so other than that

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.940 
temporary feature so other than that
that<00:01:41.939> was<00:01:42.149> really<00:01:42.539> it<00:01:42.810> everything<00:01:43.469> else<00:01:43.649> was

we just uploaded beta build 7 no skin
packs<00:02:29.849> still<00:02:30.510> but<00:02:31.319> they<00:02:31.650> are<00:02:31.799> almost<00:02:32.069> done<00:02:32.819> so

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
packs still but they are almost done so

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.390 
packs still but they are almost done so
we've<00:02:33.660> been<00:02:33.900> talking<00:02:34.410> about<00:02:34.470> skin<00:02:34.950> packs<00:02:35.190> for

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
we've been talking about skin packs for

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.520 
we've been talking about skin packs for
the<00:02:35.489> past<00:02:35.700> two<00:02:35.940> beta<00:02:36.180> builds<00:02:36.540> since<00:02:37.230> beta

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
the past two beta builds since beta

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.400 
the past two beta builds since beta
build<00:02:37.799> six<00:02:38.129> and<00:02:38.370> they<00:02:38.580> aren't<00:02:38.819> done<00:02:39.150> yet<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:40.230> we

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
build six and they aren't done yet so we

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.530 
build six and they aren't done yet so we
can<00:02:40.590> probably<00:02:40.920> expect<00:02:41.549> them<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.940> come<00:02:42.180> out<00:02:42.209> in

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
can probably expect them to come out in

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.780 
can probably expect them to come out in
beta<00:02:42.840> build<00:02:43.170> eight<00:02:43.379> now<00:02:43.680> we<00:02:44.129> also<00:02:44.370> know<00:02:44.760> a

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
beta build eight now we also know a

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.850 
beta build eight now we also know a
little<00:02:45.060> bit<00:02:45.239> more<00:02:45.450> about<00:02:45.629> these<00:02:46.019> skins<00:02:46.470> than

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
little bit more about these skins than

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.430 
little bit more about these skins than
before<00:02:47.099> skin<00:02:47.700> packs<00:02:47.970> unlike<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.900> Minecraft

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
before skin packs unlike the Minecraft

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.770 
before skin packs unlike the Minecraft
Xbox<00:02:49.620> skin<00:02:50.430> packs<00:02:50.700> aren't<00:02:51.030> going<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.599> have

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
Xbox skin packs aren't going to have

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.780 
Xbox skin packs aren't going to have
different-shaped<00:02:52.349> characters<00:02:53.280> with

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
different-shaped characters with

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.000 
different-shaped characters with
different<00:02:54.000> extrusions<00:02:54.750> along<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.349> head<00:02:55.530> arms

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
different extrusions along the head arms

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.770 
different extrusions along the head arms
wherever<00:02:56.250> have<00:02:56.609> you<00:02:56.670> instead<00:02:57.299> they're<00:02:57.629> just

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
wherever have you instead they're just

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.839 
wherever have you instead they're just
going<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.019> be<00:02:58.200> regular<00:02:58.799> skin<00:02:59.220> packs<00:02:59.489> with

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
going to be regular skin packs with

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.539 
going to be regular skin packs with
Steve<00:03:00.299> skin<00:03:00.690> models<00:03:01.109> and<00:03:01.349> Alex<00:03:01.890> skin<00:03:02.160> models

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
Steve skin models and Alex skin models

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.780 
Steve skin models and Alex skin models
so<00:03:03.060> that's<00:03:03.599> that<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.319> that<00:03:04.709> set<00:03:04.980> in<00:03:05.099> stone<00:03:05.400> the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
so that's that and that set in stone the

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.180 
so that's that and that set in stone the
skin<00:03:06.060> packs<00:03:06.299> most<00:03:06.690> likely<00:03:07.170> will<00:03:07.440> be<00:03:07.470> free<00:03:07.920> and

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
skin packs most likely will be free and

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.160 
skin packs most likely will be free and
available<00:03:08.579> to<00:03:09.090> everyone<00:03:09.450> playing<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.959> game
