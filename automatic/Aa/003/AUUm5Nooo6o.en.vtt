00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.360
 Hotline becomes the first battlefield 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.299
 which is not from developer dice 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.250
 this task has been produced 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.500
 electronic arts now visceral games 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.810
 already attributed to 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.330
 Titles like dead space or dante's 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.040
 Inferno made a name for it 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.009
 itself is currently with the development 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.800
 by battlefield four dlcs battlefront 3 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:36.190
 mirror's edge 2 and probably also 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.460
 Battlefield 5 deals with the release 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.640
 probably in the third quarter of 2014 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.350
 da ea hinted about three weeks ago that 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.019
 you do not have one for this period 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.510
 have planned more closely announced game 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.809
 the platform is still there 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:56.170
 unknown after some puts the last 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.879
 days and now one from ea allegedly 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.489
 unintentionally published trailer 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.859
 which but mostly on youtube 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.320
 has been locked again has electronic 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:08.170
 arts battlefield eagle now officially on 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.210
 his website confirmed in the trailer 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.580
 which already six months old should be 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.800
 is still called mara which game 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.720
 known to have been changed 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.840
 By the way, that has nothing to do with the 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.900
 battlefield 1942 map omaha to do 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.210
 in hallein it will be about that 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.430
 not as usual two armies 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.440
 fight against each other but police 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.080
 probably a swat team against 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.430
 Criminals such as the drug or drug 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.400
 manufacturer fight 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.070
 the fights will probably be on something 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.220
 narrower space than previously held 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.290
 on july 9 electronic arts wants more 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.490
 details at the e3 press conference 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.920
 announce 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.370
 as typical of the battlefield 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.600
 franchises are also available in hallein 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.660
 demolish all buildings and 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.340
 destroy the pugs game are there 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.350
 but not in magnificent 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.250
 landscapes but in the city 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.640
 settled 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.660
 This is the preferred way to bank 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.980
 hemp farms or shops 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.679
 equalize soil 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:12.370
 the engine book probably like this 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.180
 Battlefield 4 on Ross soon comes 3 too 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.459
 as well as 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.709
 in battlefield 4 level already in use 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.900
 whether exactly as striking as the 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.689
 skyscrapers of the nz of shanghai a 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.120
 Fall is questionable, however, can itself 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.799
 an areal through a ruined key 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.629
 change buildings significantly 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.069
 the weapons join the 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.769
 usual suspects like that 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.620
 rocket launcher apg to destroy by 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.689
 vehicles in missiles to destroy 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.780
 pulling air like helicopters, for example 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:43.230
 and storm rifles as well as some carbines 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.510
 shotguns and sniper rifles 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.180
 New counter gadgets are like Taser 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.510
 hithooks and something that 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.609
 big as a syringe 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.430
 again there are crossbow like 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:59.439
 in battlefield 3 repair tool and one 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.200
 ballistic shield which also in the 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.250
 next battlefield 4 dlc dragon deep 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.250
 will appear 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.120
 to the vehicles count in battlefield 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.480
 hertler a helicopter jeeps racetrack 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.889
 Team cars and motorcycles 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.470
 everything seems to be omitted 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:20.620
 tanks and jets were inside the 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.019
 community for upset caused because this 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.229
 Vehicle has been firmer since the beginning 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.729
 ingredient in battlefield are still 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:30.370
 more than in the predecessors 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:33.909
 Laying battlefield hotline on teamwork 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.250
 So far, four game modes are known for 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:38.199
 example of the hot fashion here have the 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.510
 Thieves deal with a bank robbery 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:42.459
 you jump a safe and with the 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.810
 Loot flees without being caught by the police 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.659
 to be stopped 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.479
 another mode is the rescue mode 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:52.810
 similar to the host edge mode 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:54.639
 in counter strike suit units hostage 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.489
 freeing them from crime 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:59.799
 to be prevented from doing so 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.079
 Also included is the hot wire mode 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.780
 where the police criminal in 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.739
 vehicles hunting and attempts to 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.889
 shoot dead 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.919
 Last but not least is the trailer of blood 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:15.140
 money mode shown in the fight 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:16.940
 the same applies to a money epo 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.239
 in capture the flag on your own basis 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.040
 has to be shipped and that 's it 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.830
 then already with the previously laid 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.790
 info as I find a whole lot like 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.160
 said on 9 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.780
 june wants ea ea on one 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.060
