isn't<00:00:09.090> what<00:00:09.750> I'm<00:00:09.840> talking<00:00:10.200> about<00:00:10.230> but<00:00:10.620> you

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
isn't what I'm talking about but you

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.709 
isn't what I'm talking about but you
could<00:00:10.920> still<00:00:11.099> learn<00:00:11.250> some<00:00:11.550> potion<00:00:12.210> recipes<00:00:12.570> if

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
could still learn some potion recipes if

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.690 
could still learn some potion recipes if
you<00:00:12.809> don't<00:00:12.960> know<00:00:13.080> them<00:00:13.259> I'll<00:00:14.070> be<00:00:14.219> doing<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.580> lot

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
you don't know them I'll be doing a lot

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.580 
you don't know them I'll be doing a lot
of<00:00:14.759> math<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.450> video<00:00:15.690> so<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.139> don't<00:00:16.320> have

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
of math in this video so you don't have

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.560 
of math in this video so you don't have
to<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.520> majority<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.060> video<00:00:18.270> will<00:00:18.390> just

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
to the majority of this video will just

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.390 
to the majority of this video will just
be<00:00:18.630> adding<00:00:18.960> gold<00:00:19.080> values<00:00:19.470> together<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.039> I'll

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
be adding gold values together and I'll

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.800 
be adding gold values together and I'll
also<00:00:20.580> make<00:00:20.820> sure<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.939> tell<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.390> recipes

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
also make sure I tell you the recipes

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.599 
also make sure I tell you the recipes
for<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.050> potions<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.529> pick<00:00:22.740> out<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.519> it

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
for the potions that I pick out so it

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.250 
for the potions that I pick out so it
still<00:00:23.820> applies<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.300> Minecraft<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.900> general

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
still applies to Minecraft in general

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.870 
still applies to Minecraft in general
but<00:00:25.529> you're<00:00:25.890> better<00:00:26.099> off<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:26.310> checking<00:00:26.789> the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
but you're better off just checking the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.509 
but you're better off just checking the
wiki<00:00:27.150> if<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.390> want<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.630> know<00:00:27.689> all<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> recipes

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
wiki if you want to know all the recipes

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.830 
wiki if you want to know all the recipes
with<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.640> out<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> way<00:00:30.119> I'll<00:00:30.570> get<00:00:30.779> my

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
with that out of the way I'll get my

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.720 
with that out of the way I'll get my
calculator<00:00:31.320> out<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:32.189> can<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:32.489> relax

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
calculator out and you can just relax

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.010 
calculator out and you can just relax
and<00:00:33.059> absorb<00:00:34.520> an<00:00:35.520> annihilation<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.420> find<00:00:36.899> that

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
and absorb an annihilation I find that

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.020 
and absorb an annihilation I find that
the<00:00:37.140> three<00:00:37.590> most<00:00:37.860> useful<00:00:38.370> potions<00:00:38.760> are

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the three most useful potions are

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.780 
the three most useful potions are
strength<00:00:39.809> invisibility<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.070> instant

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
strength invisibility and instant

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.209 
strength invisibility and instant
healing<00:00:42.410> strengthen<00:00:43.410> invisibility<00:00:43.829> being

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
healing strengthen invisibility being

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.340 
healing strengthen invisibility being
the<00:00:44.399> most<00:00:44.550> important<00:00:45.059> however<00:00:45.870> strength

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the most important however strength

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.930 
the most important however strength
alone<00:00:46.590> isn't<00:00:46.770> quite<00:00:47.010> as<00:00:47.129> good<00:00:47.280> as<00:00:47.370> strength<00:00:47.640> to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
alone isn't quite as good as strength to

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.700 
alone isn't quite as good as strength to
a<00:00:48.149> variation<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.899> doesn't<00:00:49.170> cost<00:00:49.320> much<00:00:49.530> more

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
a variation that doesn't cost much more

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.069 
a variation that doesn't cost much more
gold<00:00:49.980> I'll<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:51.120> setting<00:00:51.300> up<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> basic<00:00:51.690> gold

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
gold I'll be setting up the basic gold

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.410 
gold I'll be setting up the basic gold
cost<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> alchemy<00:00:52.949> setup<00:00:53.250> first<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.879> then

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
going into the potion specifically first

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.910 
going into the potion specifically first
off<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:58.170> need<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.350> know<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.530> you'll<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:58.859> to

you want to make the potions to splash
you'll<00:01:28.619> need<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.860> add<00:01:28.950> gunpowder<00:01:29.400> which<00:01:29.640> only

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
you'll need to add gunpowder which only

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.149

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
costs three gold ingots but just

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.830 
costs three gold ingots but just
remember<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.490> also<00:01:32.670> cuts<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> effect<00:01:33.540> time

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
remember this also cuts the effect time

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.219 
remember this also cuts the effect time
of<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.079> potion<00:01:34.409> down<00:01:34.590> by<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> bit<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.960> next
