shots on the settings and focal length

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.359 
shots on the settings and focal length
that<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.000> used<00:00:21.510> now<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.230> actual<00:00:22.769> element<00:00:23.189> in

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
that I used now the actual element in

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.429 
that I used now the actual element in
this<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.240> same<00:00:24.480> one<00:00:24.689> that's<00:00:24.869> used<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.350> a

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
this is the same one that's used in a

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.620 
this is the same one that's used in a
night<00:00:25.619> conversion<00:00:26.279> but<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.939> do<00:00:27.150> get<00:00:27.390> that

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
night conversion but you do get that

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.779 
night conversion but you do get that
image<00:00:27.810> stabilization<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.769> i<00:00:28.800> am<00:00:28.980> using<00:00:29.220> if

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
image stabilization that i am using if

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.490 
image stabilization that i am using if
you<00:00:29.880> take<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> look<00:00:30.330> at<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.570> shot<00:00:30.810> for<00:00:31.080> example

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
you take a look at this shot for example

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.979 
you take a look at this shot for example
this<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> very<00:00:31.980> tall<00:00:32.369> pine<00:00:32.669> tree<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.120> at<00:00:33.510> 200

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
this is a very tall pine tree and at 200

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.600 
this is a very tall pine tree and at 200
millimeters<00:00:34.469> with<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> huge<00:00:34.980> lens<00:00:35.280> it'd<00:00:35.489> be

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
millimeters with a huge lens it'd be

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.600 
millimeters with a huge lens it'd be
impossible<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.270> shoot<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.620> i<00:00:37.980> did<00:00:38.399> get

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
impossible to shoot with is i did get

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.819 
impossible to shoot with is i did get
some<00:00:38.820> more<00:00:39.000> stabilization<00:00:39.390> there<00:00:40.050> here's

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
some more stabilization there here's

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.770 
some more stabilization there here's
another<00:00:41.040> shot<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.730> sign<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.450> at<00:00:42.600> def

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
another shot of a sign this is at def

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.010 
another shot of a sign this is at def
2.8<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.800> then<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.760> shot<00:00:45.149> right<00:00:45.180> here<00:00:45.390> we

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
2.8 and then this shot right here we

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.580 
2.8 and then this shot right here we
have<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.890> tree<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.930> if<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.170> see<00:00:49.379> you

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
have this tree and if you see you

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.650 
have this tree and if you see you
basically<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.129> see<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.520> tree<00:00:50.760> there<00:00:51.030> but

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
basically just see the tree there but

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.479 
basically just see the tree there but
actually<00:00:52.230> right<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.710> front<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.100> me<00:00:53.219> was<00:00:53.430> a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
actually right in front of me was a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.450 
actually right in front of me was a
chain<00:00:53.879> that's<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.480> f2<00:00:54.989> you're<00:00:55.770> able<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.160> go

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
chain that's a f2 you're able to go

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.920 
chain that's a f2 you're able to go
through<00:00:56.670> obstacles<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.600> which<00:00:57.780> is

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
through obstacles like that which is

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.170 
through obstacles like that which is
absolutely<00:00:58.230> crazy<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.070> once<00:00:59.609> again<00:00:59.760> this<00:01:00.030> is

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
absolutely crazy and once again this is

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.910 
absolutely crazy and once again this is
all<00:01:00.329> hand<00:01:00.750> held<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.260> chain<00:01:01.500> was<00:01:01.680> really

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
all hand held this chain was really

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.160 
all hand held this chain was really
close<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.340> me<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:03.300> wasn't<00:01:03.420> very<00:01:03.539> large<00:01:03.930> but

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
close to me and it wasn't very large but

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.109 
close to me and it wasn't very large but
you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.379> see<00:01:04.500> how<00:01:04.650> close<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.129> can<00:01:05.280> get<00:01:05.489> with

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
you can see how close you can get with

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.179 
you can see how close you can get with
this<00:01:06.330> lens<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.049> set<00:01:07.409> up<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
this lens in the set up like that and

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.380 
this lens in the set up like that and
the<00:01:08.250> background<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.700> beautifully<00:01:09.150> blurred

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
the background is beautifully blurred

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.310 
the background is beautifully blurred
out<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.530> next<00:01:10.979> shot<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:12.090> some<00:01:13.049> wood

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
out so next shot here we have some wood

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.010 
out so next shot here we have some wood
being<00:01:13.770> cut<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.640> at<00:01:14.760> 70<00:01:15.180> millimeters<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
being cut this is at 70 millimeters and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.020 
being cut this is at 70 millimeters and
I'm<00:01:16.770> not<00:01:16.920> sure<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.250> focus<00:01:17.580> was<00:01:17.700> spot-on

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
I'm not sure if the focus was spot-on

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.109 
I'm not sure if the focus was spot-on
there<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:18.840> anyways<00:01:19.500> that's<00:01:19.770> f2<00:01:20.159> handheld<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
there but anyways that's f2 handheld and

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.080 
there but anyways that's f2 handheld and
the<00:01:22.049> next<00:01:22.350> shot<00:01:22.500> here<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> close-up<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.939> is

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the next shot here is a close-up this is

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.179 
the next shot here is a close-up this is
that<00:01:24.240> 200<00:01:24.840> also<00:01:25.680> at<00:01:25.920> f/2<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.180> decently<00:01:28.189> nice

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
that 200 also at f/2 so decently nice

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.920
