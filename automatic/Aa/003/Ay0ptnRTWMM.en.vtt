basic shapes now for it first draw a
round<00:00:11.969> circle<00:00:12.450> for<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.559> head<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.920> B<00:00:18.560> then

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
round circle for the head of the B then

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.609 
round circle for the head of the B then
we've<00:00:19.680> gone<00:00:19.859> all<00:00:20.130> Vall<00:00:20.750> but<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:21.869> gonna<00:00:22.050> start
