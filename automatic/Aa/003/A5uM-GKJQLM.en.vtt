I don't think awards are going to be a

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.149 
I don't think awards are going to be a
problem<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:21.720> problem<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:23.009> know<00:01:23.100> she

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
problem the problem is that you know she

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.789 
problem the problem is that you know she
you<00:01:23.640> know<00:01:23.670> must<00:01:23.970> because<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.750> think<00:01:25.380> she's

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
you know must because I think she's

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.679 
you know must because I think she's
gonna<00:01:25.950> go<00:01:26.130> really<00:01:26.340> really<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:27.000> know<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.299> high

gonna go really really you know up high

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.899 
gonna go really really you know up high
so<00:01:28.049> her<00:01:28.740> head<00:01:28.950> needs<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.340> be<00:01:29.460> properly

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
so her head needs to be properly

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.429 
so her head needs to be properly
balanced<00:01:30.479> from<00:01:30.600> those<00:01:30.780> two<00:01:30.900> shoulders<00:01:31.290> and

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439
