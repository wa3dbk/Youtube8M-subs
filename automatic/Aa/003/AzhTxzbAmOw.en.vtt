 rays bringing another video to you 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.779
 on the channel and today's video is about 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.420
 subway last light 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.360
 so people already enter here in the video tab 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.369
 to comment a little bit for you 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.380
 basically talking about here you are O 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.960
 seeing this setting that I left 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.580
 which is not a top setting you can see 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.610
 that I left in the high tech that goes to the 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.440
 green leave in haiti when quality o 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.399
 ssa leaving texture 16 because 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.940
 independent of the game so this will not 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.500
 catch your plate hold motion blur is 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.680
 something I've never really enjoyed 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.010
 left not and the tc that the function 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.640
 one more dx11 main point I left 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.649
 normal 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.420
 now you will understand why I 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.460
 I left these options 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.219
 Let's get in the game here. I do not have 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.230
 how to give a continuum because I do not 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.869
 he played many works went only on 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.670
 game just saw a little bit of the beginning and 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.660
 it's already gone 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.660
 so let's go guys 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:27.110
 I shovel is so I've seen videos in this game 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.759
 of the pc version even found it simply 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:34.789
 perfect guy so I really enjoyed the 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.340
 game but I will comment a little with you 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.140
 on his performance because after 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.429
 accounts on my channel from the beginning 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.380
 always been talking a little about the 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.560
 gaming performance on computers 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.140
 medians that some people can look 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.899
 I thought fucking talk but your pc is not 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.959
 It's so bad, man so it's not so bad. 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.459
 so but with today's expensive technology 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:58.670
 It's my pc, it's weak. 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:01.700
 so come on middle right 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.149
 and here you can see I do not know if the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.039
 program is capturing with two 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.420
 open capture programs I do not know 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.120
 if the two are appearing at the same time 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.130
 time left side tower bani at 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.719
 less for me and on the right side such 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.319
 action that is the program that I am 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:20.129
 recording in action 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:24.569
 I think he's scoring 20 pts. 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:30.230
 already at the hotel mateus trout came 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.230
 already nuno artur band showing 50 60 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:41.000
 TaubatÃ©, my friend, then, guys. 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.139
 can perceive there that the game is up 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.060
 it is with this configuration that 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.700
 I let it increase a little bit in 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.189
 a little for you to understand why 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.169
 all beauty that only ends after 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:03:00.569
 presentation is that I think it's going to 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:03:08.099
 take a little time to honor the free play 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:11.790
 who come here it starts in the subway 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:17.189
 I'll be honest with you guys again. 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:20.069
 I will not be the metro 2033 I did not get to 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:23.400
 see to it but I played pretty expensive 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.349
 I played this game a lot and our face. 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.629
 the first was very fucking expensive a lot of 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.780
 very shaken same time is one game 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.669
 What kind of you to stay the day? 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.430
 whole even enjoying the game every 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:37.889
 moment of it is that I do not really to 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.319
 getting plenty of time to play and 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.030
 I'm a little jealous of you who can 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.810
 Dude, it's really cool games. 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.449
 coming out nowadays is very good indeed 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.220
 for all games nowadays is that 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:52.560
 some games before advanced computes 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.540
 graphic and poor text quality 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.370
 since the recent games not the guy is 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.540
 with a nice cool story with 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.329
 supersurf graphics 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.530
 amazing even the metro is cool 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:06.120
 delicate because it was a good thing 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.599
 Realistically same life even carole has 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.370
 a few bottles plus a cup of coffee 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.409
 Like, guy has a guitar there behind the 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.169
 crazy command of a thing well 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:18.120
 realistic caroli the face helmet looks the 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.070
 light effect of the lamp 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.169
 Because it's not at its maximum, it's not 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:27.750
 maximum and then I'm going to because 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:30.980
 You are a slow part here 12 f 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.890
 This guy 12 you can swear at me 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:40.260
 beauty has a detail to the game yet 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:42.870
 has updated ie several bugs 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.900
 still amd video card to my board 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.960
 video is sure to be a week from now 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.780
 or less will launch a drive for the 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.430
 beauty correction then so with 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.410
 sure will also make a video 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.810
 showing the performance after the 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:11.540
 update this is obvious guy you are 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:11.540
 Obviously the beauty there 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.199
 very cool guy very cool indeed 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:27.600
 it is very similar to the good 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.650
 similar to the first ice type face 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:34.580
 to the game segment so it is closed 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.580
 with oscar doing training 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:49.020
 The research shows gas directx11 is 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.040
 very good face however is not the whole plate 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:57.860
 video can rotate this 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.860
 this application is still tense 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:11.290
 Beauty is not that I 'm going to take it here. 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:13.120
 good quality texture beauty 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:17.350
 you saw there was an average of 20 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.190
 ps a really bad thing for me the middle one 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:25.960
 and 30 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:28.090
 so we'll see you there with a very high a 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.870
 average remained the same graph did not change 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:35.620
 with a little more focus but putting in 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.360
 I play some parts of the phrase we 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:42.730
 frozen 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:44.380
 the km until his cpf comes all that drama 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:49.360
 now give me the gun that is the most 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:50.380
 important will cut the gang for you guys 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.730
 It's more or less a part goes to 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.960
 beauty front 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:58.600
 Good! I'm sorry, the game is too much. 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.340
 big like this 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.470
 so I will not make a video too much 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.810
 long I promise you that I will 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:07.510
 make another video there a bed a scene 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.100
 of action even for you because I know 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:12.400
 that everyone who see the video that is watching 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:14.920
 an action scene is what I have to 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.470
 say to you summarizing today about 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.930
 This game is a very good game, but expensive 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:24.820
 at least on my plate my plate 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:26.770
 remembering is a hd 68 50 is very buggy 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:33.340
 Dude, it's very common, but parts. 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:35.500
 that I showed you where the smoke 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.860
 is very excited 

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:41.170
 it's very ugly sometimes 30 business 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:47.440
 fps 10 

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:52.060
 River the river has an update drive I do not know 

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:56.350
 How are you doing videos, but for me? 

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:58.990
 What a complicated beauty, cool face. 

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:01.300
 people are thank you very much for you 

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:03.580
 I promise that I will do another 

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:06.250
 video showing the differences 

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:11.220
 then when 11 drives or a 

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:11.220
 update and thats it's good and bye
