black<00:00:07.220> control<00:00:07.609> and<00:00:07.849> we<00:00:08.120> have<00:00:08.240> a<00:00:08.269> match<00:00:08.510> versus

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
black control and we have a match versus

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.030 
black control and we have a match versus
the<00:00:09.500> white<00:00:10.099> human<00:00:10.610> deck<00:00:10.820> and<00:00:11.740> this<00:00:12.740> hand

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
the white human deck and this hand

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.680 
the white human deck and this hand
regardless<00:00:13.249> of<00:00:13.759> our<00:00:13.879> opponents<00:00:14.360> deck<00:00:14.480> we

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
regardless of our opponents deck we

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:23.640 
regardless of our opponents deck we
cannot<00:00:15.049> keep<00:00:15.289> so<00:00:16.129> we<00:00:16.309> mulligan<00:00:20.380> this<00:00:21.380> hand<00:00:21.859> is

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
cannot keep so we mulligan this hand is

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.620 
cannot keep so we mulligan this hand is
not<00:00:24.650> optimal<00:00:25.400> but<00:00:25.460> it's<00:00:25.849> likely<00:00:26.090> better<00:00:26.390> than

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
not optimal but it's likely better than

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.599 
not optimal but it's likely better than
a<00:00:26.660> random<00:00:26.840> sex<00:00:27.289> we<00:00:27.500> have<00:00:27.589> some<00:00:27.769> land<00:00:27.980> and<00:00:28.279> I

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
a random sex we have some land and I

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.370 
a random sex we have some land and I
think<00:00:28.849> place<00:00:29.029> will<00:00:29.240> cycle<00:00:29.420> it's<00:00:30.080> unfortunate

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
think place will cycle it's unfortunate

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.779 
think place will cycle it's unfortunate
we're<00:00:30.740> on<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:30.949> draw<00:00:31.160> we're<00:00:31.429> probably<00:00:31.669> just

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
we're on the draw we're probably just

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.340 
we're on the draw we're probably just
going<00:00:31.910> to<00:00:32.270> get<00:00:32.390> beat<00:00:32.450> down<00:00:32.750> and<00:00:32.990> lose<00:00:33.110> this

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
going to get beat down and lose this

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.550 
going to get beat down and lose this
game<00:00:33.590> but<00:00:34.190> there's<00:00:35.150> not<00:00:35.390> really<00:00:35.600> a<00:00:36.050> hand<00:00:36.440> I

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
game but there's not really a hand I

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.500 
game but there's not really a hand I
would<00:00:36.710> want<00:00:36.890> to<00:00:36.980> mulligan<00:00:37.430> a<00:00:37.460> five-card<00:00:38.330> hand

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
would want to mulligan a five-card hand

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.790 
would want to mulligan a five-card hand
that<00:00:38.660> would<00:00:38.750> be<00:00:38.900> good<00:00:39.020> against<00:00:39.410> him<00:00:39.530> on<00:00:39.680> the

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
that would be good against him on the

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.950 
that would be good against him on the
draw<00:00:40.010> I<00:00:40.280> mean<00:00:40.760> I<00:00:40.820> would<00:00:40.970> need<00:00:41.090> like<00:00:41.120> land<00:00:41.570> land

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
draw I mean I would need like land land

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.860 
draw I mean I would need like land land
think<00:00:42.500> twice<00:00:42.770> and<00:00:43.070> to<00:00:43.880> removal<00:00:44.330> spells<00:00:44.600> it

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
think twice and to removal spells it

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.120 
think twice and to removal spells it
would<00:00:44.960> just<00:00:45.110> have<00:00:45.230> to<00:00:45.260> be<00:00:45.380> the<00:00:45.530> perfect<00:00:45.740> five

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
would just have to be the perfect five

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.290 
would just have to be the perfect five
so<00:00:47.260> this<00:00:48.260> hand<00:00:48.560> is<00:00:48.680> fine<00:00:48.920> if<00:00:49.130> we<00:00:49.190> draw<00:00:49.490> we<00:00:49.880> want

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
so this hand is fine if we draw we want

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.390 
so this hand is fine if we draw we want
to<00:00:50.600> draw<00:00:50.780> a<00:00:50.810> land<00:00:51.110> plus<00:00:51.410> a<00:00:51.590> removal<00:00:52.010> spell<00:00:52.250> and

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
to draw a land plus a removal spell and

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.040 
to draw a land plus a removal spell and
that<00:00:52.520> should<00:00:52.700> buy<00:00:52.850> us<00:00:52.880> enough<00:00:53.060> time<00:00:53.210> so<00:00:53.960> we're

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
that should buy us enough time so we're

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.180 
that should buy us enough time so we're
going<00:00:54.140> to<00:00:54.230> keep<00:00:54.380> this<00:00:59.230> and<00:01:00.230> our<00:01:00.530> opponent<00:01:01.010> has

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
going to keep this and our opponent has

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.160 
going to keep this and our opponent has
he<00:01:01.790> kept<00:01:01.970> done<00:01:02.150> 7<00:01:03.939> f-6<00:01:04.939> through<00:01:05.449> his<00:01:05.570> turn<00:01:05.840> here

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
he kept done 7 f-6 through his turn here

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.870 
he kept done 7 f-6 through his turn here
so<00:01:09.170> we're<00:01:09.350> hoping<00:01:09.679> okay<00:01:10.100> I<00:01:10.130> was<00:01:10.549> going<00:01:10.700> to<00:01:10.759> say

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
so we're hoping okay I was going to say

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.969 
so we're hoping okay I was going to say
we<00:01:11.000> were<00:01:11.390> hoping<00:01:11.810> that<00:01:11.869> he<00:01:12.259> had<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:12.409> slower<00:01:12.679> hand

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
we were hoping that he had a slower hand

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.980 
we were hoping that he had a slower hand
without<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.280> one<00:01:13.520> drop<00:01:13.759> but<00:01:14.119> he<00:01:14.329> has<00:01:14.450> a<00:01:14.479> one<00:01:14.750> drop

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
without a one drop but he has a one drop

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.739 
without a one drop but he has a one drop
so<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:16.479> unfortunately<00:01:17.710> we<00:01:19.390> break<00:01:20.390> on<00:01:20.600> our

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:20.749 
so and unfortunately we break on our

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:22.419 
so and unfortunately we break on our
first<00:01:20.960> straw<00:01:21.320> we<00:01:21.619> do<00:01:21.740> not<00:01:21.890> want<00:01:22.070> counter

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
first straw we do not want counter

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:26.679 
first straw we do not want counter
spells<00:01:22.670> against<00:01:22.939> the<00:01:23.060> stack<00:01:25.149> so<00:01:26.149> we're<00:01:26.600> going

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
spells against the stack so we're going

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.539 
spells against the stack so we're going
to<00:01:26.780> just<00:01:27.020> play<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.350> top<00:01:27.530> ground<00:01:28.009> catacombs

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
here playing an island doesn't

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.630 
here playing an island doesn't
accomplish<00:01:30.439> anything<00:01:30.710> there's<00:01:31.219> nothing<00:01:31.520> we

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
accomplish anything there's nothing we

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:55.899

with one of his champions either way we

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.330 
with one of his champions either way we
should<00:03:46.349> be<00:03:46.500> able<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.800> trade<00:03:46.980> with<00:03:47.099> at<00:03:47.250> least

should be able to trade with at least

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:55.970 
should be able to trade with at least
one<00:03:47.610> champion<00:03:48.120> but<00:03:54.590> something<00:03:55.590> like<00:03:55.739> if<00:03:55.890> he

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
one champion but something like if he

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.350 
one champion but something like if he
plays<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.190> mean<00:03:56.370> crew<00:03:56.580> Seder<00:03:56.760> next<00:03:57.090> turn<00:03:57.180> we're

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
plays a mean crew Seder next turn we're

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.040 
plays a mean crew Seder next turn we're
just<00:03:57.510> in<00:03:57.629> trouble

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.600 

guess<00:04:04.620> it's<00:04:04.800> actually<00:04:05.070> not<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.310> worst<00:04:05.460> if<00:04:05.550> he

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
guess it's actually not the worst if he

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.990 
guess it's actually not the worst if he
does<00:04:05.730> play<00:04:05.910> Mary<00:04:06.090> crusader<00:04:06.650> um<00:04:07.880> what<00:04:08.880> the

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
does play Mary crusader um what the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.030 
does play Mary crusader um what the
worst<00:04:09.210> is<00:04:09.450> going<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.930> be<00:04:10.080> is<00:04:10.350> if<00:04:10.800> he<00:04:10.920> has

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
worst is going to be is if he has

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.830 
worst is going to be is if he has
angelic<00:04:11.490> Dustin<00:04:11.820> if<00:04:11.910> he<00:04:12.000> goes<00:04:12.120> like<00:04:12.300> land<00:04:12.540> land

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
angelic Dustin if he goes like land land

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.470 
angelic Dustin if he goes like land land
it<00:04:13.020> has<00:04:13.140> angelic<00:04:13.560> destiny<00:04:14.010> here<00:04:14.280> like<00:04:14.940> he<00:04:15.360> has

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
it has angelic destiny here like he has

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.880 
it has angelic destiny here like he has
six<00:04:15.630> cards<00:04:15.900> at<00:04:15.990> hand<00:04:16.140> of<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.350> devil<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.620> what

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
turns in a row it's going to be rough

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.170 
turns in a row it's going to be rough
times<00:04:45.810> for<00:04:46.080> us<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.500> we<00:04:47.370> flash<00:04:47.580> back<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:47.850> think

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
times for us and we flash back to think

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.490 
times for us and we flash back to think
twice<00:04:48.360> instead<00:04:48.960> of<00:04:48.990> playing<00:04:49.170> the<00:04:49.290> one<00:04:49.380> from

twice instead of playing the one from
her<00:04:49.590> hand<00:04:49.770> is<00:04:49.920> because<00:04:50.160> there's<00:04:50.310> no<00:04:50.460> reason

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
her hand is because there's no reason

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.600 
her hand is because there's no reason
for<00:04:50.880> us<00:04:50.910> to<00:04:50.970> give<00:04:51.240> information<00:04:51.510> away<00:04:52.140> and<00:04:52.610> also

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
for us to give information away and also

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.860 
for us to give information away and also
it's<00:04:54.000> more<00:04:54.150> mana<00:04:54.330> efficient<00:04:56.600> school<00:04:57.600> so<00:04:57.750> he's

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
it's more mana efficient school so he's

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.450 
it's more mana efficient school so he's
going<00:04:58.020> in<00:04:58.200> he<00:04:58.380> didn't<00:04:58.590> attack<00:04:58.890> okay<00:04:59.250> so<00:04:59.310> he

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
going in he didn't attack okay so he

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.100 
going in he didn't attack okay so he
just<00:04:59.640> has<00:04:59.790> nothing<00:05:00.240> so<00:05:00.480> this<00:05:00.630> is<00:05:00.810> pretty<00:05:00.990> good

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
just has nothing so this is pretty good

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.340 
just has nothing so this is pretty good
for<00:05:01.230> us<00:05:02.270> I<00:05:03.270> was<00:05:03.630> going<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:03.840> say<00:05:03.930> if<00:05:04.020> I<00:05:04.110> draw<00:05:04.320> a

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
for us I was going to say if I draw a

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.690 
for us I was going to say if I draw a
land<00:05:04.560> here<00:05:04.740> I'm<00:05:04.830> not<00:05:04.980> actually<00:05:05.190> going<00:05:05.460> to<00:05:05.580> play

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
land here I'm not actually going to play

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.630 
land here I'm not actually going to play
the<00:05:05.820> solemn<00:05:06.180> because<00:05:07.020> you're<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.190> worm<00:05:08.370> coil

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
the solemn because you're the worm coil

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.880 
the solemn because you're the worm coil
because<00:05:08.820> he<00:05:09.270> is<00:05:09.620> looks<00:05:10.620> like<00:05:10.770> he's

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
because he is looks like he's

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.830 
because he is looks like he's
representing<00:05:11.400> a<00:05:11.460> mana<00:05:11.640> leak<00:05:11.880> and<00:05:12.540> he<00:05:12.660> just

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
representing a mana leak and he just

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.420 
representing a mana leak and he just
keeps<00:05:13.020> passing<00:05:13.470> and<00:05:13.770> doing<00:05:13.919> nothing<00:05:14.040> so<00:05:14.340> his

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
keeps passing and doing nothing so his

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.520 
keeps passing and doing nothing so his
hand<00:05:14.610> he<00:05:14.730> could<00:05:14.850> have<00:05:14.970> a<00:05:15.030> really<00:05:15.210> bad<00:05:15.330> hand<00:05:15.570> so

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
hand he could have a really bad hand so

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.500 
hand he could have a really bad hand so
the<00:05:16.980> question<00:05:17.310> is<00:05:17.400> we<00:05:17.580> can<00:05:17.730> attack<00:05:18.180> here

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
the question is we can attack here

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.550 
the question is we can attack here
attack<00:05:18.840> them<00:05:18.960> for<00:05:19.110> two<00:05:19.169> and<00:05:19.320> play<00:05:19.410> another

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
attack them for two and play another

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.070 
attack them for two and play another
solemn<00:05:20.330> at<00:05:21.330> this<00:05:21.419> point<00:05:21.600> I<00:05:21.690> don't<00:05:21.720> think<00:05:21.900> we

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
solemn at this point I don't think we

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.450 
solemn at this point I don't think we
need<00:05:22.230> to<00:05:22.320> tap<00:05:22.500> out<00:05:22.680> and<00:05:22.860> risk<00:05:23.010> like<00:05:23.250> getting

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
need to tap out and risk like getting

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.770 
need to tap out and risk like getting
hit<00:05:23.520> by<00:05:23.580> a<00:05:23.669> mere<00:05:23.850> Crusader<00:05:24.180> because<00:05:24.480> we<00:05:24.570> really

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
hit by a mere Crusader because we really

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.420 
hit by a mere Crusader because we really
can't<00:05:24.990> beat<00:05:25.169> the<00:05:25.290> mirror<00:05:25.470> and<00:05:25.530> Crusader<00:05:25.860> the

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
can't beat the mirror and Crusader the

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.800 
can't beat the mirror and Crusader the
boards<00:05:26.669> kind<00:05:26.880> of<00:05:26.940> a<00:05:27.000> stalemate<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.540> way<00:05:27.660> it<00:05:27.780> is

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
boards kind of a stalemate the way it is

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.080 
boards kind of a stalemate the way it is
we're<00:05:28.110> holding<00:05:28.380> two<00:05:28.500> dissipates<00:05:28.980> so<00:05:29.669> like<00:05:29.880> we

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
we're holding two dissipates so like we

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.120 
we're holding two dissipates so like we
can<00:05:30.300> just<00:05:30.330> dissipate<00:05:31.260> a<00:05:31.290> threat<00:05:31.560> plus<00:05:31.830> think

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
can just dissipate a threat plus think

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.280 
can just dissipate a threat plus think
twice<00:05:32.370> and<00:05:32.610> slowly<00:05:32.760> set<00:05:33.030> up<00:05:33.150> to<00:05:33.900> where<00:05:33.990> we<00:05:34.169> can

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
twice and slowly set up to where we can

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.650 
twice and slowly set up to where we can
just<00:05:34.440> slam<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:34.680> wurmcoil<00:05:35.370> engine<00:05:35.610> so<00:05:36.180> I<00:05:36.210> like

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
just slam the wurmcoil engine so I like

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.970 
just slam the wurmcoil engine so I like
playing<00:05:36.810> super<00:05:37.230> safe<00:05:37.410> here<00:05:37.620> and<00:05:37.740> just<00:05:37.860> not

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
playing super safe here and just not

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.070 
playing super safe here and just not
actually<00:05:38.280> doing<00:05:38.370> anything<00:05:38.720> we<00:05:39.720> could<00:05:39.900> think

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
actually doing anything we could think

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.570 
actually doing anything we could think
twice<00:05:40.320> on<00:05:40.500> our<00:05:40.620> turn<00:05:40.770> looking<00:05:41.100> for<00:05:41.280> at<00:05:41.340> land

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
twice on our turn looking for at land

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.860 
twice on our turn looking for at land
but<00:05:42.650> that<00:05:43.650> isn't<00:05:43.800> largely<00:05:44.190> relevant<00:05:44.760> I<00:05:44.940> would

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
but that isn't largely relevant I would

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.180 
but that isn't largely relevant I would
rather<00:05:45.990> keep<00:05:46.230> man<00:05:46.410> open<00:05:46.710> in<00:05:46.770> case<00:05:46.860> we<00:05:47.010> need<00:05:47.160> to

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
rather keep man open in case we need to

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.290 
rather keep man open in case we need to
go<00:05:47.340> for<00:05:47.520> the<00:05:47.580> throat<00:05:47.730> something<00:05:48.120> plus

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
go for the throat something plus

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.390 
go for the throat something plus
dissipate<00:05:48.750> something<00:05:49.169> so<00:05:49.440> we're<00:05:50.220> going<00:05:50.310> to

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
dissipate something so we're going to

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:59.480 
dissipate something so we're going to
pass<00:05:50.580> here

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.550 

and<00:05:59.910> then<00:06:00.660> at<00:06:00.750> the<00:06:00.810> end<00:06:00.900> of<00:06:01.050> the<00:06:01.139> turn<00:06:01.289> if<00:06:01.440> we

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
and then at the end of the turn if we

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.439 
and then at the end of the turn if we
need<00:06:01.770> to<00:06:01.800> we<00:06:01.949> can<00:06:02.130> mill<00:06:02.490> but<00:06:03.120> we're<00:06:03.300> not<00:06:03.419> going

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
need to we can mill but we're not going

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:04.610 
need to we can mill but we're not going
to<00:06:03.630> be<00:06:03.750> milling<00:06:04.050> we're<00:06:04.169> going<00:06:04.289> to<00:06:04.349> be<00:06:04.410> think

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
to be milling we're going to be think

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:13.190 
to be milling we're going to be think
twice<00:06:04.800> so

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.910 

and<00:06:13.640> the<00:06:14.640> ideal<00:06:15.180> situation<00:06:16.080> for<00:06:16.110> us<00:06:16.290> is<00:06:16.560> for

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:16.920 
and the ideal situation for us is for

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.770 
and the ideal situation for us is for
him<00:06:17.160> to<00:06:17.190> tap<00:06:17.490> out<00:06:17.670> for<00:06:17.910> a<00:06:17.940> mere<00:06:18.210> Crusader<00:06:18.570> which

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
him to tap out for a mere Crusader which

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.670 
him to tap out for a mere Crusader which
we<00:06:18.930> dissipate<00:06:19.440> and<00:06:20.810> then<00:06:21.810> we<00:06:22.020> think<00:06:22.410> twice

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
we dissipate and then we think twice

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.380 
we dissipate and then we think twice
draw<00:06:22.980> lane<00:06:23.220> and<00:06:23.430> get<00:06:23.520> to<00:06:23.610> slammer<00:06:23.820> worm<00:06:23.970> coil

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390 
draw lane and get to slammer worm coil

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.960 
draw lane and get to slammer worm coil
that's<00:06:24.840> the<00:06:25.260> best<00:06:25.620> situation<00:06:26.520> that<00:06:26.880> can

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
that's the best situation that can

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.770 
that's the best situation that can
happen<00:06:28.130> and<00:06:29.240> he<00:06:30.240> must<00:06:30.450> have<00:06:30.540> still<00:06:30.690> been

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
happen and he must have still been

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.540 
happen and he must have still been
laying<00:06:31.050> screwed<00:06:31.440> and<00:06:31.560> he<00:06:31.620> just<00:06:31.830> scoops

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.280

the<00:07:04.260> draw<00:07:04.410> I'm<00:07:04.590> just<00:07:04.710> not<00:07:04.860> a<00:07:04.920> fan<00:07:07.340> we<00:07:08.340> can<00:07:08.460> leave

one<00:07:08.820> in<00:07:09.000> I<00:07:09.920> think<00:07:10.920> one<00:07:11.430> mana<00:07:11.760> leak<00:07:12.030> the<00:07:12.360> first

one in I think one mana leak the first
mana<00:07:12.870> leak<00:07:13.080> is<00:07:13.200> probably<00:07:13.620> better<00:07:13.860> than<00:07:14.190> this

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 
mana leak is probably better than this
