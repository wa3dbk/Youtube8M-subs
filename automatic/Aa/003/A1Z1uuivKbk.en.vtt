00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.880
 the coffee he's good at has mainly 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.160
 basically caffeine that helps both 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.449
 in the matter of blood pressure was 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.480
 controlled 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.380
 it helps to make the person more active 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.689
 also ends up helping to make a 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.640
 fat burning is to help release 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.019
 more fat in the bloodstream 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.369
 certainly the properties 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.010
 especially leaving the person more at 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.559
 alert but agreed then practiced 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.050
 sports to be a consumer of sugarcane 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.450
 and then the consumption began to consume 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.390
 coffee associated with physical activity and 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.640
 I really feel different from 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.070
 performance in activities 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.899
 coffee is not a miracle that the trainings 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.850
 which will raise us highly 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.219
 performance it has to be combined with 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.500
 some points such as food and 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.020
 hydration for activity practitioners 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.180
 physics it has one more function 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.040
 necker this issue of fat burning 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.189
 I wonder what this alert question 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.270
 even a matter of letting the person 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.270
 perception of pain 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.710
 I never asked someone to look at coffee. 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.810
 but the people comment with me half act 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.140
 tired and I indicate spoke already 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.490
 experienced a coffee cup before 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.590
 full and that feeds right into a 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.530
 cup will train himself is more exposed 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.720
 there is no recommendation just for who 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.900
 have heart problem recommends 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.770
 limiting to 200 ml per day I usually 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.530
 take almost every day before 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.690
 of my training the 15 minutes before 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:50.899
 I drink a big glass 20 minutes before 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:54.290
 and I will do the training the benefits 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.500
 coffee so athlete would it 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.940
 after consumption it may begin to 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.149
 release more fat in the chain 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.670
 blood to be burned to the person of 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.649
 my perception of pain will not get a 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.780
 hour or an hour and a half with him she 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.030
 start from muscle aches 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.250
 coffee reduces this perception that it 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.810
 can keep on working for more 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.780
 time then I think it has to be 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.970
 fairly balanced by 11 bruno 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.160
 practicing physical activity not only 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.500
 an athlete without this as how 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.350
 professional and work and 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.350
 balanced in nutrition and hydration 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.940
 This coffee is a stimulant and I 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:38.660
 I have noticed 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:40.580
 results of English activities after 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.769
 training is not necessary because it is the 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.350
 moment that the body has to relax in 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.090
 quetta restoring its energies 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.740
 if you go to long training you can 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.740
 consumed 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.020
 between the three in order to help a 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.510
 next workout because it's a person to do 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.420
 her body and then she goes to the 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.670
 aerobic training by console 12 to 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.150
 bodybuilding and then another dose 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.390
 now erotic between the three after and 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.390
 resting
