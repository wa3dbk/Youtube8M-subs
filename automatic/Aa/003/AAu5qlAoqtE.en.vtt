thing<00:01:52.560> if<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.860> would<00:01:53.009> driven<00:01:53.490> across<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
thing if you would driven across the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.289 
thing if you would driven across the
entire<00:01:54.240> continent<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:55.680> guess<00:01:56.250> back<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.759> 70s

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
entire continent I guess back in the 70s

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:57.830 
entire continent I guess back in the 70s
or<00:01:57.420> something

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
or something

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.420 
or something
it's<00:01:58.259> got<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.829> little<00:01:58.979> interesting

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
it's got like it's a little interesting

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.179 
it's got like it's a little interesting
map<00:01:59.640> light<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:01.049> could<00:02:01.229> turn<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.469> you

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
map light that you could turn on you

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.679 
map light that you could turn on you
know<00:02:02.310> read<00:02:02.579> your<00:02:02.729> map<00:02:02.909> at<00:02:03.090> night<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.299> guess<00:02:03.540> it's

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
know read your map at night I guess it's

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.510 
know read your map at night I guess it's
a<00:02:03.780> military<00:02:04.200> thing<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.860> got<00:02:05.040> your<00:02:05.159> controls

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
a military thing you got your controls

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.010 
a military thing you got your controls
there<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.939> switch<00:02:06.180> either<00:02:06.659> right<00:02:06.990> or

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
there to switch either right or

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.830 
there to switch either right or
left-hand<00:02:07.560> guessed<00:02:07.829> gas<00:02:08.580> tank<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.179> also<00:02:09.539> added

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
left-hand guessed gas tank I also added

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.839 
left-hand guessed gas tank I also added
little<00:02:10.050> things<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.890> should<00:02:11.310> mention<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.670> guess

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
little things I should mention I guess

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.650

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
know I'm thinking like during daylight

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.920 
know I'm thinking like during daylight
hours<00:02:50.130> if<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.730> don't<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.300> know<00:02:51.360> if<00:02:51.480> I'm<00:02:51.600> driving

with my headlights if it's misty I want
to<00:02:53.520> know<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.820> they're<00:02:53.970> on<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:55.080> you<00:02:55.980> know<00:02:56.070> have

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
to know that they're on so you know have

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.920 
to know that they're on so you know have
a<00:02:56.250> little<00:02:56.490> indicator<00:02:56.970> switch<00:02:57.180> there<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:57.720> tell

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
a little indicator switch there to tell

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.440 
a little indicator switch there to tell
me<00:02:58.050> that<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.290> headlights<00:02:58.620> are<00:02:58.770> on<00:02:59.180> and<00:03:00.180> this

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
me that the headlights are on and this

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.180 
me that the headlights are on and this
is<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.870> military<00:03:01.110> vehicle<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:01.770> it<00:03:01.860> came<00:03:02.010> with

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
is a military vehicle so it came with

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.680 
is a military vehicle so it came with
actually<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.700> ability<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.180> wire<00:03:03.480> the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
actually the ability to wire the

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.430 
actually the ability to wire the
headlights<00:03:04.050> separately<00:03:04.820> so<00:03:05.820> you<00:03:05.910> can<00:03:06.440> wire

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
headlights separately so you can wire

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.500 
headlights separately so you can wire
drive<00:03:08.190> with<00:03:08.370> your<00:03:08.460> headlights<00:03:08.520> off<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.360> your

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
drive with your headlights off and your

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.770 
drive with your headlights off and your
panel<00:03:09.930> lights<00:03:10.110> on<00:03:10.760> but<00:03:11.760> in<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:12.240> case<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.540> kept

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
panel lights on but in this case I kept

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.200 
panel lights on but in this case I kept
that<00:03:12.900> functionality<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.910> added<00:03:14.910> this<00:03:15.030> little

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
that functionality I added this little

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.030 
that functionality I added this little
little<00:03:16.020> piece<00:03:16.200> here<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.470> thought<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.800> kind<00:03:16.920> of

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
little piece here I thought it kind of

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.800 
little piece here I thought it kind of
fit<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.250> had<00:03:17.490> this<00:03:17.610> grenade<00:03:18.030> sitting<00:03:18.360> around<00:03:18.510> so

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
fit I had this grenade sitting around so

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.420 
fit I had this grenade sitting around so
threaded<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.500> attached<00:03:19.890> it<00:03:20.100> in<00:03:20.220> there<00:03:20.340> you

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
threaded it and attached it in there you

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.940 
threaded it and attached it in there you
can<00:03:20.580> remove<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.940> if<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.120> don't<00:03:21.270> like<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:21.950> but

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
can remove it if you don't like it but

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.410 
can remove it if you don't like it but
beyond<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:23.400> on<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.730> other<00:03:23.850> side<00:03:23.940> there

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
beyond that on the other side there

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.940 
beyond that on the other side there
there's<00:03:24.630> that<00:03:24.780> blackout<00:03:25.320> switch<00:03:25.620> over<00:03:25.920> there

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
there's that blackout switch over there

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.560 
there's that blackout switch over there
and<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.520> that<00:03:26.550> was<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.790> switch<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.150> wasn't<00:03:27.420> sure

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
and so that was a switch I wasn't sure

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.000 
and so that was a switch I wasn't sure
what<00:03:27.750> it's<00:03:27.870> used<00:03:28.110> for<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.440> was<00:03:28.560> dead<00:03:28.800> when<00:03:28.950> I

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
what it's used for it was dead when I

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.460 
what it's used for it was dead when I
got<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.459> so<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:29.880> wired<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.630> now<00:03:30.780> so<00:03:30.990> it<00:03:31.080> now<00:03:31.230> acts

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
got it so I wired it now so it now acts

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.680 
got it so I wired it now so it now acts
as<00:03:31.590> your<00:03:31.650> hazard<00:03:32.100> lights<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:33.180> then<00:03:33.360> beyond

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
as your hazard lights and then beyond

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.449 
as your hazard lights and then beyond
that<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:33.900> added<00:03:34.320> at<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.560> Commodore<00:03:34.980> kind<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.340> a

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
that I added at a Commodore kind of a

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.520 
that I added at a Commodore kind of a
period<00:03:36.060> looking<00:03:36.390> one<00:03:36.600> so<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:36.990> kind<00:03:37.200> of<00:03:37.260> fits<00:03:37.440> a

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
period looking one so it kind of fits a

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.890 
period looking one so it kind of fits a
little<00:03:37.650> bit<00:03:37.830> with<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.750> nature<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.780> the

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
little bit with the the nature of the

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.570 
little bit with the the nature of the
truck<00:03:40.110> these<00:03:40.530> cars<00:03:40.770> didn't<00:03:41.010> originally<00:03:41.400> come

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
truck these cars didn't originally come

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.010 
truck these cars didn't originally come
with<00:03:41.730> teka<00:03:42.030> meters<00:03:42.300> but<00:03:42.480> I<00:03:42.510> added<00:03:42.690> one<00:03:42.989> in

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
with teka meters but I added one in

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.660 
with teka meters but I added one in
there<00:03:44.090> beyond<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.300> pretty<00:03:45.780> straightforward

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
there beyond that pretty straightforward

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.370 
there beyond that pretty straightforward
everything<00:03:47.670> seems<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:47.970> work<00:03:48.209> on<00:03:48.390> it<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:49.170> take

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
everything seems to work on it and take

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.870 
everything seems to work on it and take
show<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.770> engine

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.130 

show<00:03:55.880> you<00:03:55.940> some<00:03:56.120> changes<00:03:56.510> I<00:03:56.600> did<00:03:56.750> in<00:03:56.870> here<00:03:57.050> as

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
show you some changes I did in here as

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.930 
show you some changes I did in here as
well<00:03:57.670> so<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.700> couple<00:03:59.090> things<00:03:59.270> I<00:03:59.900> removed<00:04:00.740> the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
well so a couple things I removed the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.340 
well so a couple things I removed the
the<00:04:01.940> generator<00:04:02.750> that<00:04:02.900> was<00:04:03.020> here<00:04:03.200> originally

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
the generator that was here originally

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.560 
the generator that was here originally
and<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:03.770> replaced<00:04:04.160> it<00:04:04.310> rewired<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:05.180> when<00:04:05.270> I<00:04:05.300> did

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
and I replaced it rewired it when I did

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.330 
and I replaced it rewired it when I did
the<00:04:05.660> wiring<00:04:06.020> I<00:04:06.110> replaced<00:04:06.680> it<00:04:06.800> with<00:04:06.830> a<00:04:06.950> GM

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
the wiring I replaced it with a GM

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.370 
the wiring I replaced it with a GM
alternator<00:04:08.180> just<00:04:08.600> simply<00:04:08.870> because<00:04:09.140> they<00:04:09.230> put

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
alternator just simply because they put

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.920 
alternator just simply because they put
out<00:04:09.500> more<00:04:09.680> power<00:04:10.120> they're<00:04:11.120> more<00:04:11.270> reliable<00:04:11.780> and

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
out more power they're more reliable and

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.080 
out more power they're more reliable and
and<00:04:12.440> by<00:04:12.620> then<00:04:12.860> if<00:04:13.070> you<00:04:13.100> get<00:04:13.340> stuck<00:04:13.670> someplace

and by then if you get stuck someplace

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.550 
and by then if you get stuck someplace
you<00:04:14.270> can<00:04:14.390> always<00:04:14.690> find<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:14.960> replacement<00:04:15.260> part

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
you can always find a replacement part

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.190 
you can always find a replacement part
for<00:04:15.800> it<00:04:15.890> fairly<00:04:16.220> easily<00:04:16.780> down<00:04:17.780> here<00:04:18.019> at<00:04:18.080> the
