now let's take a look at the wires okay

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.949 
now let's take a look at the wires okay
so<00:04:11.040> this<00:04:11.250> is<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.489> box<00:04:11.700> that<00:04:12.239> comes<00:04:12.420> out<00:04:12.690> of<00:04:12.750> the

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
so this is the box that comes out of the

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.140 
so this is the box that comes out of the
box<00:04:13.140> it's<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.590> filled<00:04:14.459> with<00:04:14.640> wires<00:04:14.940> and

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
box it's a filled with wires and

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.940 
box it's a filled with wires and
everything<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:16.560> comes<00:04:16.890> with<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.580> iPhone

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
everything that comes with the iPhone

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.120 
everything that comes with the iPhone
so<00:04:18.790> it<00:04:19.510> is<00:04:19.660> a<00:04:19.690> pollutant<00:04:20.140> headphone<00:04:20.530> so<00:04:21.040> it

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
so it is a pollutant headphone so it

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
so it is a pollutant headphone so it
uses<00:04:21.400> power<00:04:22.440> not<00:04:23.440> from<00:04:23.650> your<00:04:24.160> cell<00:04:24.880> phone<00:04:24.910> or

uses power not from your cell phone or

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.050 
uses power not from your cell phone or
iPod<00:04:25.810> but<00:04:26.470> it<00:04:26.590> uses<00:04:26.920> so<00:04:27.370> you<00:04:27.430> can<00:04:27.610> charge<00:04:27.910> it

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
iPod but it uses so you can charge it

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.150 
iPod but it uses so you can charge it
that's<00:04:28.360> what<00:04:28.510> I<00:04:28.540> want<00:04:28.750> to<00:04:28.870> say<00:04:29.050> so

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
that's what I want to say so

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.950 
that's what I want to say so
this<00:04:30.700> is<00:04:30.820> a<00:04:30.850> wall<00:04:31.090> adapter<00:04:31.180> you<00:04:31.540> can<00:04:31.600> plug<00:04:31.870> it

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
this is a wall adapter you can plug it

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.680 
this is a wall adapter you can plug it
in<00:04:32.140> the<00:04:32.200> wall<00:04:32.230> looks<00:04:33.130> like<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.690> standard

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
in the wall looks like a standard

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.100 
in the wall looks like a standard
adapter<00:04:35.380> it's<00:04:35.950> USB<00:04:36.220> so<00:04:37.120> I<00:04:37.150> think<00:04:37.390> you<00:04:37.660> can<00:04:37.840> even

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110

adapter it's USB so I think you can even
use<00:04:38.530> it<00:04:38.680> for<00:04:38.820> charging<00:04:39.820> your<00:04:40.660> iPod<00:04:41.590> or

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
use it for charging your iPod or
