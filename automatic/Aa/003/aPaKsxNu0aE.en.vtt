00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
here and I mean it doesn't really feel

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.410 
here and I mean it doesn't really feel
that<00:01:52.810> good<00:01:53.310> way<00:01:54.310> better<00:01:54.580> here<00:01:54.730> with<00:01:55.300> the

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
that good way better here with the

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.840 
that good way better here with the
brand-new<00:01:55.750> design<00:01:56.020> here<00:01:56.530> on<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.850> L

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
brand-new design here on the the the L

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.110 
brand-new design here on the the the L
ninety<00:02:01.360> which<00:02:02.110> feels<00:02:02.410> is<00:02:02.740> way<00:02:03.310> better<00:02:04.620> to<00:02:05.620> hold

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
ninety which feels is way better to hold

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.419 
ninety which feels is way better to hold
so<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:08.170> are<00:02:08.290> the<00:02:08.410> specs<00:02:08.770> here<00:02:08.950> on<00:02:09.190> these<00:02:09.369> two

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
so what are the specs here on these two

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.740 
so what are the specs here on these two
devices<00:02:09.880> that<00:02:10.450> are<00:02:11.130> quite<00:02:12.130> similar<00:02:12.850> because

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
devices that are quite similar because

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.490 
devices that are quite similar because
we<00:02:14.260> can<00:02:14.380> go<00:02:14.500> over<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:16.260> like<00:02:17.260> give<00:02:17.440> you

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
we can go over that and like give you

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.900 
we can go over that and like give you
some<00:02:17.650> fun

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
some fun

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.410 
some fun
so<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:20.320> specs<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.860> are<00:02:21.070> quite<00:02:21.610> familiar<00:02:21.790> on

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
so the specs that are quite familiar on

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.650 
so the specs that are quite familiar on
these<00:02:22.660> two<00:02:22.900> devices<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.820> first<00:02:25.060> off<00:02:25.209> they

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
these two devices is that first off they

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.650 
these two devices is that first off they
both<00:02:25.900> have<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.170> 4.7<00:02:26.709> inch<00:02:26.920> display<00:02:27.060> 540<00:02:28.060> x<00:02:28.270> 960

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
both have a 4.7 inch display 540 x 960

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.370 
both have a 4.7 inch display 540 x 960
resolution<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.270> can<00:02:31.420> see<00:02:31.540> above<00:02:31.989> this

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
resolution so you can see above this

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.900 
resolution so you can see above this
place<00:02:32.650> seems<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.920> be<00:02:33.100> reacting<00:02:33.310> kind<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:33.850> the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
place seems to be reacting kind of the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.250 
place seems to be reacting kind of the
same<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.330> don't<00:02:34.390> think<00:02:34.660> that<00:02:34.750> they<00:02:34.840> upgraded

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
same I don't think that they upgraded

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.699 
same I don't think that they upgraded
that<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:36.220> little<00:02:36.520> thing<00:02:37.290> this<00:02:38.290> needs<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.620> be

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
that that little thing this needs to be

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.080 
that that little thing this needs to be
the<00:02:38.890> same<00:02:39.100> viewing<00:02:40.090> angles<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.720> then<00:02:40.920> such

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
the same viewing angles and then such

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.250 
the same viewing angles and then such
let's<00:02:43.090> just<00:02:43.270> take<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.510> look<00:02:43.720> here<00:02:43.870> at<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.110> back

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
let's just take a look here at the back

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.290 
let's just take a look here at the back
as<00:02:44.470> well<00:02:44.650> pretty<00:02:45.040> quick<00:02:45.280> again<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.150> other

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
as well pretty quick again and the other

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.240 
as well pretty quick again and the other
thing<00:02:49.540> yeah<00:02:49.780> five<00:02:49.959> four<00:02:50.140> x<00:02:50.380> 960<00:02:50.680> resolution

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
thing yeah five four x 960 resolution

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.670 
thing yeah five four x 960 resolution
4.7<00:02:52.000> inch<00:02:52.150> display<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.870> seems<00:02:53.050> to<00:02:53.170> be<00:02:53.290> one<00:02:53.650> of

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
4.7 inch display that seems to be one of

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.740 
4.7 inch display that seems to be one of
the<00:02:53.830> only<00:02:53.980> things<00:02:54.280> that<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.270> familiar<00:02:55.660> about

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
the only things that is familiar about

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.180 
the only things that is familiar about
these<00:02:56.020> two<00:02:56.170> devices<00:02:56.350> they<00:02:56.890> will<00:02:56.920> have

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
these two devices they will have

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.890 
these two devices they will have
differences<00:02:57.670> here<00:02:57.970> they've<00:02:58.330> upgraded<00:02:58.540> the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
differences here they've upgraded the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.320 
differences here they've upgraded the
camera<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.350> an<00:02:59.410> H&amp;P<00:02:59.770> so<00:02:59.890> one<00:03:00.160> last<00:03:00.880> one<00:03:01.120> had<00:03:01.300> a

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
camera to an H&amp;P so one last one had a

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.430 
camera to an H&amp;P so one last one had a
five<00:03:01.690> megapixel<00:03:01.870> one<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.660> then<00:03:05.110> we

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
five megapixel one and so and then we

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.020 
five megapixel one and so and then we
also<00:03:05.650> have<00:03:05.980> another<00:03:06.250> difference<00:03:06.670> here<00:03:06.850> this

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
also have another difference here this

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.850 
also have another difference here this
one<00:03:07.330> l9<00:03:07.840> optimus<00:03:08.440> l9

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
one l9 optimus l9

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.449 
one l9 optimus l9
last<00:03:09.160> year<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.610> only<00:03:10.090> came<00:03:10.920> with<00:03:11.920> four

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
last year it only came with four

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.060 
last year it only came with four
gigabytes<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.360> storage<00:03:13.720> which<00:03:14.680> was<00:03:14.860> pretty

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
gigabytes of storage which was pretty

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.570 
gigabytes of storage which was pretty
bad

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
bad

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.360 
bad
because<00:03:16.390> what<00:03:16.600> I<00:03:16.630> basically<00:03:16.900> made<00:03:17.350> was<00:03:17.920> so<00:03:18.310> you

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
because what I basically made was so you

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.490 
because what I basically made was so you
would<00:03:18.820> only<00:03:19.030> be<00:03:19.150> able<00:03:19.330> to<00:03:19.600> like<00:03:19.900> install<00:03:20.320> not

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
would only be able to like install not

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.339 
would only be able to like install not
even

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
even

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.920 
even

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.530 
I in the game sometimes so that was
pretty<00:03:24.109> bad<00:03:24.319> and<00:03:24.909> another<00:03:25.909> big<00:03:26.090> thing<00:03:26.359> here

fast and snappy in in menus so I mean
that's<00:03:42.079> definitely<00:03:42.230> quite<00:03:42.829> nice<00:03:48.040> versus<00:03:49.040> this

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
that's definitely quite nice versus this

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.839 
that's definitely quite nice versus this
one<00:03:49.760> which<00:03:50.269> I<00:03:50.450> only<00:03:50.659> have<00:03:51.139> at<00:03:51.379> the<00:03:51.530> moment<00:03:51.849> I

only have an Android Man Ice Cream
Sandwich<00:03:56.209> actually<00:03:57.109> I<00:03:57.139> don't<00:03:57.290> know<00:03:57.620> if

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
Sandwich actually I don't know if

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.170 
Sandwich actually I don't know if
there's<00:03:58.010> any<00:03:58.189> update<00:03:58.519> I<00:03:58.549> mean<00:03:58.849> I<00:03:58.939> try<00:03:59.150> to

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
there's any update I mean I try to

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.679 
there's any update I mean I try to
update<00:03:59.389> it<00:03:59.889> more<00:04:00.889> times<00:04:01.219> but<00:04:02.000> I<00:04:02.269> mean<00:04:02.449> there

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:02.689 
update it more times but I mean there

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:04.720 
update it more times but I mean there
really<00:04:02.719> is<00:04:03.049> like<00:04:03.500> for<00:04:04.010> three<00:04:04.549> different

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
really is like for three different

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.309 
really is like for three different
Android<00:04:05.180> versions<00:04:05.569> between<00:04:05.959> these<00:04:06.139> two

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
Android versions between these two

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.789 
Android versions between these two
devices<00:04:06.699> so<00:04:07.699> I<00:04:07.730> think<00:04:08.030> LG<00:04:08.510> have<00:04:09.079> really<00:04:09.560> played

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
devices so I think LG have really played

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.699 
devices so I think LG have really played
like<00:04:10.069> catch-up<00:04:10.370> game<00:04:10.730> this<00:04:11.090> time<00:04:11.299> around

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
like catch-up game this time around

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.780 
like catch-up game this time around
another<00:04:12.709> thing<00:04:13.010> that's<00:04:13.219> different<00:04:13.549> about

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
another thing that's different about

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.189 
another thing that's different about
these<00:04:14.060> two<00:04:14.120> devices<00:04:14.510> of<00:04:14.900> course<00:04:15.250> is<00:04:16.250> I<00:04:17.199> mean

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
these two devices of course is I mean

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.539 
these two devices of course is I mean
software<00:04:18.620> is<00:04:18.709> gonna<00:04:18.859> be<00:04:18.979> a<00:04:19.009> little<00:04:19.190> bit<00:04:19.340> of<00:04:19.489> a

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
software is gonna be a little bit of a

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.610 
software is gonna be a little bit of a
different<00:04:19.940> store<00:04:20.299> you<00:04:20.750> don't<00:04:20.870> you<00:04:21.289> have<00:04:21.470> no

you also have the cool feature here with

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.719 
you also have the cool feature here with
the<00:04:46.550> brand-new<00:04:46.970> 90<00:04:47.599> and<00:04:48.530> that<00:04:48.860> is<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:49.430> NOC

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
the brand-new 90 and that is the NOC

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.310 
the brand-new 90 and that is the NOC
code<00:04:50.060> so<00:04:50.840> you<00:04:51.110> can<00:04:52.030> do<00:04:53.030> it<00:04:53.120> like<00:04:53.270> that<00:04:53.449> and<00:04:54.110> wake

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
code so you can do it like that and wake

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.960 
code so you can do it like that and wake
it<00:04:54.470> up<00:04:54.560> and<00:04:54.889> also<00:04:55.280> make<00:04:55.490> it<00:04:55.729> good<00:04:55.880> sleep

thing here is that we had 44 here we had
you<00:05:05.360> core<00:05:05.719> here<00:05:06.130> so<00:05:07.130> we<00:05:07.280> get<00:05:07.430> a<00:05:07.699> 1<00:05:08.150> gigahertz

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:08.469

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
was that you also have different GPUs so

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.460 
was that you also have different GPUs so
they<00:05:27.289> will<00:05:27.530> be<00:05:28.039> a<00:05:28.070> little<00:05:28.190> bit<00:05:28.400> different<00:05:28.729> in
