three<00:00:24.720> examples<00:00:25.260> we<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.560> here<00:00:25.710> one<00:00:25.920> is

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
three examples we have here one is

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.519 
three examples we have here one is
completely<00:00:26.609> fused<00:00:26.849> from<00:00:27.060> top<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.300> bottom<00:00:27.529> the

completely fused from top to bottom the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.720 
completely fused from top to bottom the
other<00:00:28.680> one<00:00:28.830> which<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.010> more<00:00:29.279> expensive

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
other one which is more expensive

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.410 
other one which is more expensive
garment<00:00:30.539> has<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.289> fuse<00:00:31.859> front<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:32.850> also<00:00:33.059> with<00:00:33.390> a

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
garment has a fuse front but also with a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.299 
garment has a fuse front but also with a
floating<00:00:33.719> chest<00:00:34.140> piece<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.950> one<00:00:35.070> I'm

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
floating chest piece and the one I'm

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.880 
floating chest piece and the one I'm
making<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.790> completely<00:00:36.300> canvas<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.559> idea

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
making is completely canvas and the idea

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.040 
making is completely canvas and the idea
is<00:00:38.100> as<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.340> go<00:00:38.460> up<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.640> up<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.149> scale<00:00:39.420> that

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
is as you go up the up the scale that

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.170 
is as you go up the up the scale that
you<00:00:40.230> get<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.829> body<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.430> garment<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.910> built

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
you get a body of a garment is built

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.090 
you get a body of a garment is built
into<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.379> when<00:00:43.500> someone<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:43.890> wearing

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
into it so that when someone is wearing

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.799 
into it so that when someone is wearing
it<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.399> few<00:00:44.610> years<00:00:44.789> time<00:00:45.090> then<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.539> still

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
it a few years time then you still

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.930 
it a few years time then you still
retain<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.260> shape<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:47.100> can't<00:00:47.399> get<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.789> with

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
retain the shape you can't get that with

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.639 
retain the shape you can't get that with
the<00:00:48.059> fused<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.539> Terrance<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> open<00:00:49.469> sea

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the fused with Terrance the open sea

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.439 
the fused with Terrance the open sea

let's have a look let's have a look this
stuff<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.140> fuse<00:00:52.469> one<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.039> a

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
stuff this is the fuse one and it's a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
new garment and you can see if we turn

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.270 
new garment and you can see if we turn
this<00:00:57.149> inside<00:00:57.449> out<00:01:00.440> it's<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.859> stuck

this inside out it's it's stuck

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.810 
this inside out it's it's stuck
completely<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> fabric<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:05.369> may<00:01:05.640> even

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
completely to the fabric and I may even

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.240 
completely to the fabric and I may even
be<00:01:06.210> able<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.720> well<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.350> probably<00:01:07.680> can't<00:01:08.010> even

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
be able to well I probably can't even

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.469

pull it off through here

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.149 
pull it off through here
sometimes<00:01:10.049> these<00:01:10.229> these<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.680> break<00:01:10.830> down

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
sometimes these these can break down

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
this the gum expensive that makes it

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.450 
this the gum expensive that makes it
that<00:02:27.240> makes<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.660> last<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.560> shape<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.220> we

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
that makes it last and the shape that we

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.120 
that makes it last and the shape that we
put<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:29.850> there<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.390> built<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.980> goes

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
put in there is built so that it goes

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.820 
put in there is built so that it goes
around<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.700> cuts<00:02:32.970> into<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.420> waist<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.990> put

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
around and cuts into the waist and put

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.550 
around and cuts into the waist and put
some<00:02:35.010> shaping<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.640> there<00:02:35.850> but<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:37.290> know<00:02:37.410> we're

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
some shaping in there but you know we're

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.930 
some shaping in there but you know we're
talking<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:38.040> several<00:02:38.459> thousand<00:02:38.850> dollars

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
talking that several thousand dollars

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.080 
talking that several thousand dollars
here<00:02:39.330> as<00:02:39.450> opposed<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.560> know<00:02:40.910> 200<00:02:41.910> there

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
here as opposed to you know 200 there

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.230 
here as opposed to you know 200 there
but<00:02:42.990> there's<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.230> big<00:02:43.410> difference<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:44.070> if<00:02:45.030> you

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
but there's a big difference and if you

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.180 
but there's a big difference and if you
can<00:02:45.450> afford<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.900> it's<00:02:45.990> worth<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.500> because<00:02:46.830> it

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
can afford it it's worth it because it

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.430 
can afford it it's worth it because it
then<00:02:47.370> becomes<00:02:47.880> something<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.750> can<00:02:48.959> you

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
then becomes something that you can you

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.160 
then becomes something that you can you
can<00:02:49.470> wear<00:02:49.770> for<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.100> next<00:02:50.340> 10<00:02:50.520> 15<00:02:50.700> years<00:02:51.170> and

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
can wear for the next 10 15 years and

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.290 
can wear for the next 10 15 years and
still<00:02:52.470> look<00:02:52.709> good<00:02:52.740> so<00:02:53.730> here's<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.090> question

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300
