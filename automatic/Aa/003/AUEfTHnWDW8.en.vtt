00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.440
Werdroid is a non-profit association of robotics

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.779
which includes engineering students and engineering graduates

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:13.019
University of Technology of Compiègne

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.180
Troy and Belfort-Montbéliard

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.720
We spent our first year to provide a solid base for the team.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.000
&nbsp;Essentially starting the search for partners.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.700
3D Print carries us all our parts in rapid prototyping.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.939
Avelty us realize our mechanical parts in steel and aluminum.

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.499
Some of these items are sent in PEP that realizes our engrenges.

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:37.879
The laser cuts are made in AAZ Laser.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.840
This year we inaugurated the manufacture of springs in Vitressorts.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.100
For comfort during transport we decided to make a flight case.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.260
Vexi gave us all profiles, all parts, handles, casters.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.540
While the manufacture of robots is underway we can simulate the behavior of our robots Webots of Cyberbotics.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.400
The cup is organized by science planet Artec festival at La Ferte Bernard - France.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.300
It takes place every year in May

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.540
On the schedule, we start very early with the arrival of settlement in September.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.220
Follows the design of robots, two this year.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.780
And manufacturing from our partners different pieces together.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.760
Once the robots must be functional tests to test operation.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.600
For funding we are independent.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.440
We used crowdfunding and we raised € 850 (950 - taxes).

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.740
The rest comes from our pocket because is very involved in our project.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.040
When teams arrive at the gaming table, they have 3 minutes to install.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.580
Each team can have up to 2 robots, so four robots total for 2 teams.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.940
There followed 90 seconds into the match. At this point the robot does everything himself because it is autonomous.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:35.380
In 2014 it was a good performance coming 27th out of 156 teams registered.

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:42.589
Our goal for 2015 is to improve our score.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.920
We think we're ready to get there.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.400
The theme in 2015 we know it, it is "Robot Movie".

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.220
It is expected to fetch up OSCARDS or the red carpet.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:05.500
To achieve these objectives, we are looking for partners and financial sponsors.

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:10.159
To enable us to buy equipment accuracy.
