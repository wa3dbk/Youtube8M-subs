00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170
 so hello everyone in this 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.240
 capsule let's see how we can 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.210
 to reduce our premiums 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.160
 auto insurance 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.949
 in the first place I'm talking to you about 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.400
 the use we make of our life 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.789
 than then obviously those who 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.560
 his language at work with their vehicle 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.109
 learn it costs a little more than 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.300
 the one who stay at home stop 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.059
 or who use transport in 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.950
 common to get to work 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:41.210
 so the bonus between someone good 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.010
 that they would use would not use 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.520
 excuse me his vehicle to go to 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.789
 job 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.350
 but then they would go to 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.250
 public transport could 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.030
 easily save some 15% of 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.730
 saint-prime annually in a second 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.559
 time the influential one must think about the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.840
 franchise 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:07.260
 the collision section so-called 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.659
 we in our jargon the chapter b2 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.770
 what are you calling you are 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.890
 reassured this both sides so so 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.500
 increase your franchise to 2,250 to 500 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.310
 from 500 to 1000 could you do 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.520
 save some seizures % this your 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.270
 insurance premium for those 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.380
 who drive luxury vehicle 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.790
 high-end vehicles 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.509
 so it is strongly recommended to 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.060
 to increase your deductible chapter 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.009
 b2 collision but I just talked about it 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.149
 so obviously is for 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.210
 luxury vehicles 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.399
 premiums are higher then 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.420
 obviously that says little higher 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.990
 discounts again 50 so the discount will go 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.850
 to be around 15% but amazing 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.860
 that much higher premium then 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:08.280
 the discount is going to be substantial a sector 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.400
 very important in career I noticed 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.430
 often that 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.069
 we do not regret our fonts 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:22.280
 insurance at the same insurer 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:24.689
 know that grouping these fonts these 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.120
 automobiles or suck insurance 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:30.569
 at home same insurers go 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.409
 save 15% your premium also 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:38.400
 a system going into your vehicle 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:40.739
 will also save you money 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.019
 under on your first especially for the 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.769
 high-end vehicles 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:50.400
 obviously and I would say in varnish and 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:53.549
 especially do not forget to shop your 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.989
 premium your car insurance 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:01.069
 then the web is obviously the 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:06.180
 web on the internet one can very easily 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:09.180
 from here not on 70
