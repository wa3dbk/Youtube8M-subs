00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.410
 the 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.740
 the new the national registration 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.299
 with information about all buildings and addresses in the Netherlands 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.380
 rural in the current time with high quality 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.299
 for persons we have the gb for photos the license plate register 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.169
 for companies and trade register 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.169
 from now on guard for buildings and addresses 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.009
 10 million buildings one are signed on the map 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.100
 year one 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.130
 area he uses goals are set 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.170
 in addition, all buildings have been given the clinic identification number 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.870
 all 418 municipalities in the netherlands we have worked hard in recent years 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.620
 to fill the registration with the correct and current information and to complete the 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.480
 quality assurance 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.200
 this information has been brought together in a national facility 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.160
 4 by the land register 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.350
 the wait is now available for everyone 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.690
 citizens businesses and governments can take advantage of this 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.120
 A few examples nevertheless it is also proud that its 2009 is the first 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.430
 100,000 plus municipality was that emissions were on the bin 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.040
 we are working hard to create a number of new links and also subsequent 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.500
 we focus on added value at the municipal basic administration and in particular there 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.940
 pull out 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.210
 as a government must strive for high-quality reliable data 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.210
 to have that make available to everyone 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.310
 for me it's the boss 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.310
 the civil status of addresses and buildings 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.910
 the fire department cannot go a day without debate 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.200
 because it indicates where we need to go but it also indicates 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.120
 what risks they face We are very hard looking for a means 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.690
 to ensure that different information flows land on a map 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.600
 buy after the round we are increasingly doing completely free 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.900
 and that makes the bag an excellent tool 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.810
 because there are many on the street there are also able to give restraint if 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.460
 something is not good because we ourselves are also bothered by it at that 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.230
 the shortage comes 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.999
 for an insurer it is 

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:06.020
 very far too long that said good information 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.329
 year of use of the plant 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:13.669
 and are the elements that often do not have it but can offer us in the 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.750
 risk assessment and now also request a number of loans 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.180
 there one comes that x intel zoom on an object but also an exceptional one 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.929
 product then I can therefore ascertain 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:28.649
 how this environment risks the influence of ginkel vitesse 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:35.639
 we would like a good European ministry of infrastructure and environment 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:40.149
 provide information to citizens from other companies when it comes to 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:41.249
 best in buildings 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:45.769
 which is important for us to provide first aid from the clear overviews 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:46.879
 on cards and 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.459
 with the identification numbers of all buildings in the Netherlands and we can 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.769
 a nice user on the move her to see about whether or not information about it 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.769
 if a bus is available over those properties 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:02.349
 these buildings provide information for noise and air quality studies 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.199
 christian 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.789
 that is allowed, but it became a lot easier the first country to become stronger 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:10.789
 stand it is uniform that has the good quality and good topicality 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:16.539
 also the environmental counter online of a number are linked to the bin 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:20.359
 that is, the applicant needs a zip code and house number 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.359
 follows only ask I expect that the rest is available immediately 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.369
 this makes the further processing of applications much easier 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:31.299
 what nonsense 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.810
 the key decided to come and taste the other sources of information on the 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:38.599
 crossing would skip that made the basketball player connect to work 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.599
 until 67 she could come 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.589
 why misunderstanding are to think this 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:49.629
 the pure government support strike well between us and the service also it 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.239
 for citizens and businesses 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.270
 half an hour of playing with being noticeable that also applies to the appreciation 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.400
 immovable property or for the collection of bulky refuse for building permits 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:02.309
 in the end everyone is happy with it not only the organization but also 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:04.219
 the turn 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.739
 and so there are many more government agencies and institutions 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.479
 companies that will benefit from the watch the day 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.569
 one hundred percent filled 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:14.849
 for the Netherlands 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:15.659
 ready for use
