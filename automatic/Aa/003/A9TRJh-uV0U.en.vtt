00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
now I'm guessing with any other battery

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.590 
now I'm guessing with any other battery
it's<00:03:53.300> always<00:03:53.810> recommended<00:03:54.590> to<00:03:55.210> do<00:03:56.210> a<00:03:56.270> full

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
it's always recommended to do a full

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.070 
it's always recommended to do a full
charge<00:03:57.080> of<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:57.410> battery<00:03:58.600> before<00:03:59.600> use<00:03:59.780> it<00:03:59.960> for

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
charge of the battery before use it for

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.270 
charge of the battery before use it for
the<00:04:00.140> first<00:04:00.290> time<00:04:00.560> even<00:04:00.770> though<00:04:01.070> there's

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
the first time even though there's

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.480 
the first time even though there's
nowhere<00:04:01.730> that<00:04:01.790> says<00:04:02.180> on<00:04:02.330> the<00:04:02.420> packaging<00:04:02.960> so

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
nowhere that says on the packaging so

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:10.570 
nowhere that says on the packaging so
yeah<00:04:04.540> so<00:04:05.540> let's<00:04:05.930> take<00:04:06.140> this<00:04:06.290> off<00:04:06.500> so<00:04:09.580> check

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
yeah so let's take this off so check

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.540 
yeah so let's take this off so check
that

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.949 

take<00:04:14.210> that<00:04:14.360> off<00:04:14.540> like<00:04:14.780> so<00:04:15.110> and<00:04:16.390> this<00:04:17.390> thing<00:04:17.750> is

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
take that off like so and this thing is

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.530 
take that off like so and this thing is
dirt<00:04:18.260> white<00:04:18.530> this<00:04:19.160> thing<00:04:19.519> is<00:04:19.730> actually<00:04:19.970> quite

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
dirt white this thing is actually quite

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.260 
dirt white this thing is actually quite
heavy<00:04:20.780> so<00:04:22.480> let's<00:04:23.480> take<00:04:24.110> this<00:04:24.290> I<00:04:25.090> guess<00:04:26.090> it

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
heavy so let's take this I guess it

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:44.159 
heavy so let's take this I guess it
might<00:04:26.390> be<00:04:26.540> better<00:04:26.720> if<00:04:26.960> I<00:04:27.110> lock<00:04:27.800> this<00:04:28.010> in<00:04:28.220> first

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.750 

okay<00:04:44.830> that's<00:04:45.039> kind<00:04:45.249> of<00:04:45.340> weird<00:04:47.189> huh

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
okay that's kind of weird huh

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.300 
okay that's kind of weird huh
they<00:04:50.270> put<00:04:50.480> the<00:04:50.570> connector<00:04:51.020> on<00:04:51.170> backwards<00:04:51.890> or

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
they put the connector on backwards or

00:04:52.310 --> 00:05:01.780 
they put the connector on backwards or
upside<00:04:52.340> down

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.240 

all<00:05:02.300> right<00:05:02.480> that's<00:05:02.660> on<00:05:02.870> there<00:05:03.430> all<00:05:04.430> right<00:05:04.750> so

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
all right that's on there all right so

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.800 
all right that's on there all right so
now<00:05:07.250> that<00:05:07.310> that's<00:05:07.610> on<00:05:07.910> here<00:05:08.180> you<00:05:08.300> can<00:05:08.450> kind<00:05:08.690> of

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
now that that's on here you can kind of

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.310 
now that that's on here you can kind of
see<00:05:09.050> how<00:05:09.650> much<00:05:09.950> this<00:05:10.790> actually<00:05:11.180> fills<00:05:11.390> in<00:05:11.660> now

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
see how much this actually fills in now

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.160 
see how much this actually fills in now
as<00:05:13.220> of<00:05:13.520> this<00:05:13.610> video<00:05:13.940> Nintendo<00:05:14.630> recently

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
as of this video Nintendo recently

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.780 
as of this video Nintendo recently
announced<00:05:15.620> that<00:05:15.680> they<00:05:15.920> are<00:05:16.070> coming<00:05:16.430> out<00:05:16.580> with

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
announced that they are coming out with

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.240 
announced that they are coming out with
their<00:05:17.000> version<00:05:17.480> of<00:05:17.570> a<00:05:17.690> higher<00:05:17.870> capacity<00:05:18.250> but

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
their version of a higher capacity but

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.340 
their version of a higher capacity but
this<00:05:19.460> one's<00:05:19.700> still<00:05:19.970> larger<00:05:20.480> and<00:05:20.690> this<00:05:21.170> one

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
this one's still larger and this one

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.100 
this one's still larger and this one
actually<00:05:21.830> fills<00:05:22.220> in<00:05:22.630> everything<00:05:23.630> inside<00:05:23.960> the

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
actually fills in everything inside the

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.370 
actually fills in everything inside the
compartment<00:05:24.470> the<00:05:25.270> Nintendo<00:05:26.270> version<00:05:26.510> is<00:05:27.110> only

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
compartment the Nintendo version is only

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.620 
compartment the Nintendo version is only
like<00:05:27.560> twice<00:05:27.830> the<00:05:28.010> size<00:05:28.040> of<00:05:28.430> this<00:05:28.640> so<00:05:29.330> it's<00:05:29.480> like

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
like twice the size of this so it's like

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.450 
like twice the size of this so it's like
here<00:05:30.050> but<00:05:30.710> you've<00:05:30.800> still<00:05:30.890> got<00:05:31.010> the<00:05:31.250> empty

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
here but you've still got the empty

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.670 
here but you've still got the empty
space<00:05:31.820> here<00:05:32.060> and<00:05:32.330> only<00:05:32.450> extends<00:05:33.080> out<00:05:33.230> slightly

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
space here and only extends out slightly

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:42.190 
space here and only extends out slightly
more<00:05:34.240> so<00:05:35.320> hopefully<00:05:36.320> this<00:05:36.860> works<00:05:37.280> out<00:05:40.150> and<00:05:41.200> of

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
more so hopefully this works out and of

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.010 
more so hopefully this works out and of
course<00:05:42.470> ones<00:05:42.710> in<00:05:42.950> here<00:05:43.420> it<00:05:44.420> looks<00:05:44.630> like<00:05:44.750> you

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
course ones in here it looks like you

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:51.269 
course ones in here it looks like you
didn't<00:05:45.290> do<00:05:45.470> anything<00:05:45.710> to<00:05:46.070> it

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:51.279 

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:54.119 

now<00:05:52.179> of<00:05:52.359> course<00:05:52.389> these<00:05:52.959> screws<00:05:53.409> do<00:05:53.799> not

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:54.129 
now of course these screws do not

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:56.699 
now of course these screws do not
over-tighten<00:05:54.969> them<00:05:55.449> they're<00:05:56.109> not<00:05:56.289> designed

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:56.709 
over-tighten them they're not designed

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:58.499 
over-tighten them they're not designed
to<00:05:56.829> be<00:05:56.919> overtime<00:05:57.459> they're<00:05:57.669> just<00:05:57.879> there<00:05:58.329> just

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
to be overtime they're just there just

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:05.759 
to be overtime they're just there just
to<00:05:58.629> hold<00:05:58.809> the<00:05:58.929> door<00:05:59.169> down<00:06:04.199> so<00:06:05.199> just<00:06:05.469> screw<00:06:05.649> it

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:05.769 
to hold the door down so just screw it

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:11.069 
to hold the door down so just screw it
down<00:06:05.949> and<00:06:07.229> then<00:06:08.229> once<00:06:08.439> are<00:06:08.649> getting<00:06:08.889> snug<00:06:10.079> turn

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:11.079 
down and then once are getting snug turn

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:13.199 
down and then once are getting snug turn
it<00:06:11.229> just<00:06:11.469> slightly<00:06:11.709> just<00:06:12.609> to<00:06:12.699> lock<00:06:12.909> it<00:06:13.119> in

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:13.209 
it just slightly just to lock it in

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:17.219 
it just slightly just to lock it in
place<00:06:13.359> and<00:06:13.719> it's<00:06:13.989> on<00:06:14.169> there<00:06:15.719> now<00:06:16.719> it<00:06:17.049> is

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
place and it's on there now it is

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.959 
place and it's on there now it is
slightly<00:06:17.709> more<00:06:17.919> heavy<00:06:18.509> just<00:06:19.509> slightly<00:06:20.079> but

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:20.969 
slightly more heavy just slightly but

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:24.119 
slightly more heavy just slightly but
it's<00:06:21.969> still<00:06:22.329> not<00:06:22.689> ridiculously<00:06:23.499> heavy<00:06:23.799> as

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:24.129 
it's still not ridiculously heavy as

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:27.749 
it's still not ridiculously heavy as
people<00:06:25.089> might<00:06:25.239> think<00:06:25.569> now<00:06:26.279> back<00:06:27.279> when<00:06:27.489> I<00:06:27.579> did

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 
people might think now back when I did

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:31.409 
people might think now back when I did
an<00:06:27.879> unboxing<00:06:28.209> video<00:06:28.539> of<00:06:28.719> the<00:06:29.139> Wii<00:06:29.289> U<00:06:30.419> the

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
an unboxing video of the Wii U the

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:33.600 
an unboxing video of the Wii U the
biggest<00:06:31.779> surprise<00:06:32.229> was<00:06:32.619> how<00:06:32.829> light<00:06:33.369> this

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
biggest surprise was how light this

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.049 
biggest surprise was how light this
controller<00:06:34.089> is<00:06:34.209> and<00:06:35.339> honestly<00:06:36.339> the<00:06:36.699> battery

00:06:37.049 --> 00:06:37.059 
controller is and honestly the battery

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:39.869 
controller is and honestly the battery
even<00:06:37.269> though<00:06:37.389> is<00:06:37.449> larger<00:06:38.489> doesn't<00:06:39.489> really<00:06:39.639> add

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:39.879 
even though is larger doesn't really add

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:42.679 
even though is larger doesn't really add
that<00:06:40.299> much<00:06:40.569> more<00:06:40.599> weight<00:06:41.019> to<00:06:41.049> it<00:06:41.259> and<00:06:41.559> honestly

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:42.689 
that much more weight to it and honestly

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:45.869 
that much more weight to it and honestly
if<00:06:43.689> this<00:06:44.019> gives<00:06:44.319> me<00:06:44.589> up<00:06:44.860> to<00:06:45.189> eight<00:06:45.399> to<00:06:45.639> ten

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:45.879 
if this gives me up to eight to ten

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:47.939 
if this gives me up to eight to ten
hours<00:06:46.419> on<00:06:46.599> this<00:06:47.110> gamepad

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:47.949 
hours on this gamepad

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.189 
hours on this gamepad
that's<00:06:48.729> a<00:06:48.939> nice<00:06:49.089> trade-off<00:06:49.569> for<00:06:49.599> me<00:06:49.869> because

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 
that's a nice trade-off for me because

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:52.649 
that's a nice trade-off for me because
there's<00:06:50.469> been<00:06:50.649> countless<00:06:51.129> times<00:06:51.489> when<00:06:52.359> the

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:52.659 
there's been countless times when the

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:54.509 
there's been countless times when the
batteries<00:06:53.049> just<00:06:53.079> go<00:06:53.349> dead<00:06:53.589> after<00:06:53.859> a<00:06:54.069> couple<00:06:54.339> of

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:54.519 
batteries just go dead after a couple of

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:56.969 
batteries just go dead after a couple of
after<00:06:54.729> like<00:06:55.239> two<00:06:55.449> hours<00:06:55.860> it's<00:06:56.860> just

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:56.979 
after like two hours it's just

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.239 
after like two hours it's just
ridiculous<00:06:57.669> so<00:06:58.529> hopefully<00:06:59.529> this<00:06:59.769> works<00:06:59.949> out

00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:00.249 
ridiculous so hopefully this works out

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:03.899 
ridiculous so hopefully this works out
and<00:07:00.629> I<00:07:01.629> will<00:07:01.989> do<00:07:02.139> an<00:07:02.259> update<00:07:02.379> on<00:07:02.919> if<00:07:03.399> I<00:07:03.549> have<00:07:03.759> any

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:03.909 
and I will do an update on if I have any

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:06.749 
and I will do an update on if I have any
issues<00:07:04.509> I'll<00:07:05.110> probably<00:07:05.409> do<00:07:05.889> one<00:07:06.189> like<00:07:06.429> a<00:07:06.459> month

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:06.759 
issues I'll probably do one like a month

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:09.839 
issues I'll probably do one like a month
later<00:07:07.529> it's<00:07:08.529> still<00:07:08.769> pretty<00:07:09.039> hard<00:07:09.339> to<00:07:09.429> find<00:07:09.669> one

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:09.849 
later it's still pretty hard to find one

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:14.609 
later it's still pretty hard to find one
of<00:07:09.879> these<00:07:10.089> so<00:07:12.419> if<00:07:13.419> you're<00:07:13.689> wondering<00:07:14.169> how<00:07:14.409> good

00:07:14.609 --> 00:07:14.619 
of these so if you're wondering how good

00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:16.739 
of these so if you're wondering how good
the<00:07:14.769> battery<00:07:15.129> is<00:07:15.279> I'll<00:07:15.879> let<00:07:16.179> you<00:07:16.299> guys<00:07:16.479> know

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:18.579 
I'll do like an update or two about this

00:07:18.579 --> 00:07:22.649 
I'll do like an update or two about this
and<00:07:19.709> and<00:07:20.709> that's<00:07:21.579> it<00:07:21.789> so<00:07:22.059> that's<00:07:22.239> been<00:07:22.539> an

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:22.659 
and and that's it so that's been an

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:25.649 
and and that's it so that's been an
unboxing<00:07:23.110> and<00:07:23.619> installation<00:07:24.399> video<00:07:24.669> of<00:07:24.849> the
