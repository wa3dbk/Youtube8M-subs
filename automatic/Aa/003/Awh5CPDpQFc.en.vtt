shot this is a 38-inch 32 LED hoop from

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.640 
shot this is a 38-inch 32 LED hoop from
trick<00:00:22.050> concepts<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:24.199> covered<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.380> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
you're going to LED hoop so that's nice

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.830 
you're going to LED hoop so that's nice
um<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:25.619> way<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.270> light<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.299> up<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.720> you

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
um the way that you light it up is you

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.620 
um the way that you light it up is you
pull<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.619> apart<00:01:28.740> here<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.460> has<00:01:30.030> these<00:01:30.329> little

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
pull it apart here it has these little

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.539 
pull it apart here it has these little
connector<00:01:31.200> things<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:33.350> snap<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.590> together<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
connector things to snap it together and

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.630 
connector things to snap it together and
connect<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.310> pull<00:01:38.520> it

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
connect it like that so you pull it

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.710 
connect it like that so you pull it
apart<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:40.130> you<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.430> store<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.270> battery<00:01:42.600> in

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
apart and you can store the battery in

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.030 
apart and you can store the battery in
it<00:01:42.810> backwards<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:44.060> so<00:01:45.439> it<00:01:46.439> can<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.770> be<00:01:46.890> in

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
it backwards and so it can just be in

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.580 
it backwards and so it can just be in
there<00:01:47.220> unlit<00:01:47.869> when<00:01:48.869> you're<00:01:49.020> doing<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:50.570> tada

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
there unlit when you're doing this tada

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.490 
there unlit when you're doing this tada
and<00:01:52.909> turns<00:01:53.909> out<00:01:54.060> like<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:55.110> colors<00:01:55.470> are

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
and turns out like this the colors are

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.179 
and turns out like this the colors are
green<00:01:56.250> blue<00:01:57.000> purple<00:01:57.840> white<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.890> then<00:01:58.979> they<00:01:59.070> go

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
green blue purple white and then they go

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.310 
green blue purple white and then they go
back<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.549> green<00:01:59.790> blue<00:02:00.149> purple<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.960> then<00:02:01.110> white

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
back to green blue purple and then white

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.060 
back to green blue purple and then white
again<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.180> so<00:02:03.180> it's<00:02:03.479> very<00:02:03.899> bright<00:02:04.200> 32<00:02:04.680> LEDs

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
again and so it's very bright 32 LEDs

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.639 
again and so it's very bright 32 LEDs
I'm<00:02:05.369> not<00:02:05.520> sure<00:02:05.670> if<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.790> said<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.469> 38<00:02:07.469> inch

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
I'm not sure if I said that and 38 inch

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.449 
I'm not sure if I said that and 38 inch
diameter<00:02:08.160> it's<00:02:09.349> pretty<00:02:10.349> much<00:02:10.560> been<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:11.099> really

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
diameter it's pretty much been a really

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.590 
diameter it's pretty much been a really
great<00:02:11.879> starter<00:02:12.870> hoop

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
great starter hoop

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.510 
great starter hoop
pretty<00:02:14.600> much<00:02:14.780> i'm<00:02:14.930> just<00:02:15.110> ready<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.350> stop<00:02:16.220> great

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
pretty much i'm just ready to stop great

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.960 
pretty much i'm just ready to stop great
so<00:02:17.120> there's<00:02:18.110> nothing<00:02:18.470> wrong<00:02:18.620> with<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.980> all<00:02:19.340> the

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
so there's nothing wrong with it all the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.450 
so there's nothing wrong with it all the
LEDs<00:02:20.150> work<00:02:21.550> it<00:02:22.550> has<00:02:23.060> very<00:02:23.840> minor<00:02:24.560> tape<00:02:25.070> damage

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
LEDs work it has very minor tape damage

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.900 
LEDs work it has very minor tape damage
like<00:02:26.210> this<00:02:26.390> is<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.720> worst<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.910> everything

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
like this is the worst and everything

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.230 
like this is the worst and everything
else<00:02:29.710> actually<00:02:30.710> think<00:02:31.010> that's<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.550> only<00:02:31.580> tape

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
else actually think that's the only tape

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.130 
else actually think that's the only tape
