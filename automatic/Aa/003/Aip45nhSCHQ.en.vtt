00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.400
 hello everyone with you fil and this is the sixth 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.030
 release of the legendary check in the game san 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.520
 andreas 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.930
 today let's talk about an unusual myth he 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.270
 quite common on 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.460
 West gamer from the United States and even Germany 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.740
 quite strongly discuss it with this 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.989
 myth of two names then eyes of fire and 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.730
 chupacabra why exactly so i will tell 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.500
 a little later but in order to 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.350
 start checking this legend us 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.150
 need to know what we are dealing with so here 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.800
 Chupacabra is a character urban 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.390
 the legend of south central america 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.280
 according to rides represents 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.620
 livestock killing animal and 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.640
 sucking blood from him she looks like 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.410
 small creature with luminous eyes 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.570
 I think that in no Chupacabra 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.790
 there is no game that explains what eats 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.890
 on livestock most often goats and in 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.690
 san andreas they simply do not have any 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.460
 corpses of animals that hang on the house 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.680
 distant others 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.080
 so the version is that this is the chupacabra 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.180
 Immediately we disappear in than 100 sine 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.250
 is the myth and it is 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.590
 that many gamers have bad weather in the forest 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.070
 have seen 2 red glowing eyes due 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.409
 bushes 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.420
 who pretty quickly disappeared from here 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.340
 and the name because a lot of these 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.170
 testimonies were near steel firms 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.790
 say that this is a chupacabra so 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.640
 legends and chupacabra red glowing 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.710
 eyes in my opinion it's not exactly as it 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.990
 so about the fiery eye then why would 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.510
 no, accordingly, I set off at night 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.780
 bad weather on the farm and began to look for these 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.780
 eyes 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.670
 I carefully looked into every glare 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.140
 in every luminous object before and after 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.140
 records showed every video 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.370
 there were many similar glow during 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.930
 when lightning flashed but still not 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.879
 quite such and that says the myth and 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.519
 clambered firm their neighborhood just 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:36.360
 ran through the woods peering but again 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.849
 nothing like the myth is not found and then 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.900
 as always, I started searching on the Internet 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.910
 evidence of instruction as your own 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.280
 In light of this creature was much 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.890
 photos some were like the truth riga 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.690
 there were frankly photoshop and video 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.209
 some of the most interesting let's 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.160
 Now consider the first and such 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.620
 there were a lot of similar but it is more or less 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.690
 good quality here guys run around 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.819
 the farm is looking for something running around suddenly on 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.900
 he attacks 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:09.390
 chupacabra we all 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.060
 guessed it is a normal mod it can 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.900
 found in runet plus yet by acne 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.989
 you can kill 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:20.569
 And the next video is from Germany. 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:24.209
 but more interesting so here he runs 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:27.120
 turns the cameras suddenly to the right of the bushes and 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.410
 red eyes are coming he determines 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.410
 cameras but they are already gone 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.250
 pretty strong feeling when already 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.200
 quite similar to the truth and quite 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.209
 maybe there is some kind of bug or something else 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.220
 what we have the opportunity for 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.050
 observe these lights and so that it 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.670
 check the bottom there is nothing left 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.370
 how to go to the same place and 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.319
 watch us a video user 1 hour 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.160
 nights on then let's wait and 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.380
 approximately at this time we will run there 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.010
 here i found this place so let's 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.010
 check 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.040
 but nothing 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.109
 can something done wrong then 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.120
 don't write comments like you 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.609
 did everything wrong you were at the wrong time 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.160
 not in your clothes in the wrong place not in 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.530
 that lenovo game i will try again in 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.449
 more accurate time as on video but 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.370
 I won't change clothes like you saw 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:37.580
 This phenomenon is a user in different 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:40.180
 clothes and I think she does not affect it 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.180
 nothing 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.569
 I try even more accurate time 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:57.710
 you are also all again so I ran and 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.710
 help at another time but found nothing 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.410
 such that actually I think about 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.330
 of this myth 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.250
 my mind is fake it 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.430
 easy enough now I'll show you 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.430
 as 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.889
 first we take the car go to the forest 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:18.680
 write the code for bad weather, we find 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.680
 bushes and put the car near them 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:34.139
 and actually all here is our Chupacabra and 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:36.060
 ready these eyes 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.969
 if the worst video quality is 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:42.120
 will say this is some kind of demon in 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:44.039
 bushes limb pictures which 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.990
 car headlights will be difficult to justify 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:49.379
 but still a third of all evidence on 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.870
 my opinion is done this way and now 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:53.879
 let's summarize the myth itself if 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.189
 treat it like red lights they 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:58.319
 how the chupacabra can more or less go on 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:59.520
 I was guided by the truth when 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.889
 took on this legend 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.689
 Maybe there is some bug or black 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.990
 or something else that can be observed in 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:06.360
 the game 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.699
 what will look like fiery eyes but I 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.889
 paid for a large enough space 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:12.889
 ran in the forest and near the sphere but nothing 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:15.150
 I didn't even find it close 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.319
 maybe users just watched 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.960
 car headlights 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:20.960
 passing by a number of people who know 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:25.439
 write in the comments below your 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:27.509
 opinion about this legend may have 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:28.529
 have your own reasons and findings 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:30.599
