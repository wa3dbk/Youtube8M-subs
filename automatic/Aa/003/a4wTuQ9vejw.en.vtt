00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.430
 hello and none of us all, we are 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.200
 here another day more on my channel and today what 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.729
 that touches is the video tutorial of the 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.860
 Saturdays of every Saturday as you already know 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:11.509
 every Saturday good - the previous one that already 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.920
 you know holiday text and you can not 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.870
 upload your homework 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.219
 today it's up to the ministerial on Saturday and 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.939
 I'm going to teach you a very interesting topic 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.390
 to improve the fps is in villeta 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.390
 standalone 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.150
 what does it mean to improve the fps good 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.460
 improves performance let's not say that the 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.870
 game has more fluid and there is not 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.060
 performance problems as you know 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.340
 the iceta has quite a problem of 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.260
 performance because good do not know if 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.870
 you are up to date but the 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.980
 developers have decided to put 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.170
 content and so on before optimizing the 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.430
 client no man supposedly this 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.949
 always done in the end not with the game 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.020
 is in a beta phase so good when 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:56.090
 everything is already built so let's say that 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:59.270
 are dedicated to optimizing the fps and the 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.399
 performance on the client side what 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.230
 happen with this good as this game 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.300
 it also has a lot of processor 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.340
 those that we have a pretty processor 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.509
 old or less powerful as I can be 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.180
 I have a phenom 2 965 that is a 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.500
 pretty old processor as the 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.270
 game will cost you a little when 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.880
 you will not care what graphics you have 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.550
 because I have a gtx 660 that I 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.710
 he threw t54 sharp perfectly at his 40 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.820
 50 fps is that it turns out that this game does not 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.380
 It's going to be good for you, it does not matter 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.090
 hardware that you have how powerful it is 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.490
 this mind the same because this game 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.219
 very badly used already you know look for and 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.689
 Bohemian uses it fatally and well I 'll go 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.030
 fool me stop and I'll tell the 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.409
 first step to improve those weights worth 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.929
 Been testing these days 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.600
 configurations and such and this has been the 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:47.119
 What has been better for me in the new city? 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.100
 in the largest there is on the map 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.270
 before I was about 10 fps is a playable 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.369
 and with the configuration that I have achieved 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.789
 gives me about 25 fps is pretty much 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.530
 stable is worth 2025 more or less I know that no 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.970
 great thing but it 's much better than going to 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.950
 10 because going to 10 is practically 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.429
 playable and I in fact to the game played 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.280
 lately I play little because in playing 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.440
 10 times it seems absurd to me 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.530
 not being able to play the game and good as you 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.110
 I said fuck you with the extra message 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.700
 you know we have to do it 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.019
 First, well, we have to go to 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.819
 this address is worth the one I'm going to put 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.299
 up here it 's good in your case to be 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:29.150
 makes users your name and documents 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.769
 ok i have it in de and well my name 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.350
 because my name I have it in because 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.400
 I have changed a user file 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.680
 OK 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.900
 how good it is usually we do not 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.549
 is licensed so it will be that is 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.769
 your name and documentary once 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.390
 here we are going to look for the game of iceta 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.360
 which will be here and here is the of 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.270
 mushroom and we go here 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.800
 arise from iceta profile is good in 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.660
 your name is valid so that 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.460
 You understand, it has to be your name 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.620
 Iceta professional point has 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.450
 to be this the barça this way we give 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.890
 right button and we edit it with your 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.660
 favorite text editor I have the 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.690
 note peace cross plus I recommend it 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.340
 very much so I'm going to give it to open and 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.230
 we 're going to the end of the all good this 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.180
 it's a pretty big file, it's worth it 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.010
 I am located and in the end we are 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.380
 let's go to the end of the everything goes and we have 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.900
 that modify some values ​​here in 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.459
 shading quality you are going to put 18 vale 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.320
 this you can download all these values 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.390
 I'm going to tell you what you can download 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.340
 even more but the game is going to see a 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.630
 little more 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.320
 I have these values and the game looks 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.700
 quite well worth everything to the maximum in 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.860
 graphics in features but with 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.360
 this lowered is worth then I'm going 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.590
 saying the lines that you have to 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.340
 modify sado sharing quality 8 vale 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.340
 quality 3 status 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:51.040
 this from the complexity complexity scene 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.290
 ok psg English piece that I have what 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.959
 left at 500,000 but I think so 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.069
 that could be lowered I think that 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.050
 yes that could be lowered but not what 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.000
 they played a hit because I do not know either 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.459
 well, no notes or anything appeared 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.300
 of what what this serves well for 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.040
 I do not have it 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.890
 you can go touching it you can 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.250
 go testing behind the shadow set to 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.610
 distance of 50 voucher is the 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.250
 drawn distance of the shadow in 50 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.889
 Pretty fucking mother, I'm telling you 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.260
 view distance 1000 is worth the best 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:27.280
 you have in 3000 or 4000 the Latvians a 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.979
 thousand and preferred of the distance thousand 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.530
 also worth these would be the values 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.370
 that you have to modify is worth in this 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.220
 file i 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.199
 and now you do not have to modify more 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.050
 it's worth in this file only in this 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.510
 let's close it and let's go here he says 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.810
 is cfg let's open it with much peace 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:52.220
 ok and here you have to modify 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:55.550
 well this gpu max payne ageas 17 u 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.660
 detect frames to head 1 is worth the only 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.150
 what do you have to modify? 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.560
 modify with what you want but good 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.270
 under your responsibility I 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.270
 modified these two things and new 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.889
 luxury I see it and finally finally 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.919
 that we would have to modify finally 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:12.500
 let's go to steam let's choose the 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.139
 of iceta here I have the iceta let's go to 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.930
 give right button properties 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:21.259
 we're going to give you to set up options 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.900
 launch and you have to copy this 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:26.300
 this pileup here that I'm going to put 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.659
 down in the description but you have to 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.550
 modify a few small things good 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:33.229
 I will explain in two classes so that 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.749
 exit the bohemian title screen 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.689
 that is a pain in the ass because you put it in 

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:41.389
 mixes and so the game will start more 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:43.340
 faster start he did not pause it 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:46.039
 no pause is so good also for 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.960
 the intro theme is valid for the topic of 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:50.449
 so intro that does not stop or anything like that 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.550
 I think that's that 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.639
 all these first two is so that the 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.580
 game nor if faster is worth summarizing 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:00.860
 cpu count 4 and they have four because I have 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.659
 four cores in the processor each 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.870
 we have to put the value of our 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:04.870
 nuclei 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.000
 and depending on the processor for other 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.700
 nuclei or others you can have up to eight 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.590
 nuclei I think there are processors or 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.180
 six I do not think that someone who comes up 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.220
 but we are the most modern 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.210
 and the more expensive so good if not 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.560
 you know the nuclei that our 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.440
 processor because you do not put in google 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.270
 your model and 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.980
 and processor brand and I guess you 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.470
 will appear the nuclei and 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.660
 all specifications whole vale 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:36.290
 I have four because I tell you it 's 1965 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.360
 10 in 2 and has four cores max men 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:41.590
 this is the amount of ram memory that 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:45.340
 we have in the computer I have put 4 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:48.190
 096 because I have 4 gigas of ram worth 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.910
 do not have more if you have 8 gigas then eight 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:53.680
 a thousand and a half I think they are 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:57.160
 8.096 could strain does not have to be either 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:00.460
 you just know that it's 1024 to 24 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:03.070
 it has to be fair worth and extras 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.840
 It is also worth the number of threads of the 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.949
 processor that are also four because 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.620
 in my case I also tell you that they are 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:11.469
 four cores worth and good with this 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:14.419
 jet here we give to ok 

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:17.090
 we closed and it would already be our says is 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:19.699
 optimized voucher I guess there will be more 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.979
 options are worth more ways to use it 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:23.930
 even more but I have not found them worth 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:25.759
 I have not dedicated much either 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.159
 time but I already tell you that I invite you 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:31.009
 to modify the file that I've 

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:33.199
 modified before and that you go testing 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:35.629
 you are testing and you are going to improve our 

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:37.219
 performance is good, you know that 

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:39.409
 taking is very important at least for 

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:42.319
 I have some good fps I think 

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:44.090
 fundamental and more in this game and good 

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:45.500
 strokes or liked tutorial kids and 

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.139
 I hope it has helped you and see you 

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.319
 in the next video until next time 

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:50.319
 bye
