00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
get started okay the first thing is the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.939 
get started okay the first thing is the
swings<00:00:30.660> there's<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.470> couple<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.740> different

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
swings there's a couple of different

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.500 
swings there's a couple of different
ways<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.220> doing<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.699> personally<00:00:33.150> like<00:00:33.239> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
ways of doing it I personally like the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.970 
ways of doing it I personally like the
one<00:00:33.809> swing<00:00:34.080> technique<00:00:34.260> which<00:00:34.620> I'll<00:00:34.800> show<00:00:34.949> you

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
one swing technique which I'll show you

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.010 
one swing technique which I'll show you
first<00:00:35.390> basically<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.600> where<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.809> jump

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
first basically that is where you jump

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.260 
first basically that is where you jump
and<00:00:37.290> grab<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> bar<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.399> do<00:00:38.550> one<00:00:38.760> big<00:00:38.940> kick

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and grab the bar and you do one big kick

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.940 
and grab the bar and you do one big kick
and<00:00:39.450> keep<00:00:40.020> your<00:00:40.140> feet<00:00:40.260> up<00:00:40.379> nice<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.590> high<00:00:40.770> and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
and keep your feet up nice and high and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.979 
and keep your feet up nice and high and
you<00:00:41.040> get<00:00:41.219> near<00:00:41.370> horizontal<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.300> then<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.870> let

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
you get near horizontal and then you let

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.150 
you get near horizontal and then you let
your<00:00:43.020> feet<00:00:43.230> come<00:00:43.260> back<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.800> then<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.950> do<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
your feet come back and then you do the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.670 
your feet come back and then you do the
framing<00:00:44.760> from<00:00:44.910> but<00:00:45.719> also<00:00:45.930> people<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.590> do

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
framing from but also people like to do

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.290 
framing from but also people like to do
a<00:00:46.710> couple<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.039> swings<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.670> get<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> event<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
a couple of swings to get the event and

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.229 
a couple of swings to get the event and
I<00:00:48.450> recommend<00:00:49.230> on<00:00:50.070> your<00:00:50.250> final<00:00:50.640> swing<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.030> get

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
I recommend on your final swing you get

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.760 
I recommend on your final swing you get
your<00:00:51.480> legs<00:00:51.719> nice<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:51.989> high<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.350> they're<00:00:52.590> sort

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
your legs nice and high so they're sort

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.290 
your legs nice and high so they're sort
of<00:00:52.800> horizontal<00:00:53.100> with<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.489> bar<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.940> that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
of horizontal with the bar and that

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.400 
of horizontal with the bar and that
should<00:00:54.539> give<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.780> enough<00:00:54.809> power<00:00:55.170> when<00:00:55.289> you

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
should give you enough power when you

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.889 
should give you enough power when you
come<00:00:55.590> back<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.670> let<00:00:56.820> go<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.120> do<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.510> do<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
come back to let go and do the do the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.900 
come back to let go and do the do the
Front's<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.320> top<00:00:58.559> okay<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.219> my<00:00:59.489> technique<00:00:59.850> for

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
Front's on top okay so my technique for

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.819 
Front's on top okay so my technique for
this<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.449> one<00:01:00.870> pump<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.410> what<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.649> like<00:01:01.800> to

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
this is the one pump and what I like to

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.799 
this is the one pump and what I like to
do<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.219> keep<00:01:02.399> my<00:01:02.489> feet<00:01:02.699> nice<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:02.879> high<00:01:03.149> get

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
do is I keep my feet nice and high get

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.870 
do is I keep my feet nice and high get
horizontal<00:01:04.110> with<00:01:04.440> that<00:01:04.619> with<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.070> bar<00:01:05.670> and

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
horizontal with that with the bar and

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.850 
horizontal with that with the bar and
then<00:01:06.330> late<00:01:06.869> legs<00:01:07.080> come<00:01:07.259> back<00:01:07.380> with<00:01:07.590> your<00:01:07.680> Shane

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
then late legs come back with your Shane

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.999 
then late legs come back with your Shane
at<00:01:08.009> first<00:01:08.420> don't<00:01:09.420> kick<00:01:09.569> up<00:01:09.750> legs<00:01:10.709> come<00:01:10.979> back

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
at first don't kick up legs come back

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.490 
at first don't kick up legs come back
and<00:01:11.490> then<00:01:12.119> that's<00:01:12.330> also<00:01:12.840> your<00:01:12.959> let<00:01:13.110> go<00:01:13.229> point

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and then that's also your let go point

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.889 
and then that's also your let go point
so<00:01:13.800> after<00:01:14.789> you've<00:01:14.880> done<00:01:14.910> your<00:01:15.030> kick<00:01:15.300> up<00:01:15.479> you

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
so after you've done your kick up you

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.690 
so after you've done your kick up you
want<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.110> be<00:01:16.229> quite<00:01:16.500> relaxing<00:01:17.160> your<00:01:17.310> legs<00:01:17.490> it's

want to be quite relaxing your legs it's

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.160 
want to be quite relaxing your legs it's
like<00:01:17.819> a<00:01:17.849> lead<00:01:18.060> weight<00:01:18.090> let<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:18.990> feet<00:01:19.140> come

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170

like a lead weight let your feet come
down<00:01:19.649> again<00:01:20.429> nice<00:01:20.910> and<00:01:21.149> nice<00:01:21.539> and<00:01:21.720> straight

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
down again nice and nice and straight

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.960 
down again nice and nice and straight
then<00:01:22.500> your<00:01:22.649> feet<00:01:22.800> come<00:01:23.039> up<00:01:23.160> to<00:01:23.640> probably

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
then your feet come up to probably

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.669 
then your feet come up to probably
horizon--<00:01:24.479> or<00:01:24.660> with<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.020> point<00:01:25.259> here<00:01:25.349> and

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
horizon-- or with this point here and

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:27.350 
horizon-- or with this point here and
then<00:01:26.190> that's<00:01:26.429> the<00:01:26.550> point<00:01:26.819> where<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.060> really

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
then that's the point where you really

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.300 
then that's the point where you really
you<00:01:27.660> want<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.869> let<00:01:27.990> go<00:01:28.200> if<00:01:28.709> you<00:01:28.800> let<00:01:28.950> go<00:01:29.160> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
you want to let go if you let go and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.710 
you want to let go if you let go and
your<00:01:29.429> feet<00:01:29.610> are<00:01:29.729> down<00:01:29.880> here<00:01:30.149> you're<00:01:30.509> going<00:01:30.660> to

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
your feet are down here you're going to

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.300 
your feet are down here you're going to
shoot<00:01:30.869> back<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.470> you're<00:01:31.679> not<00:01:31.709> going<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:31.979> make

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
shoot back and you're not going to make

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.309 
shoot back and you're not going to make
the<00:01:32.399> rotation<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.720> yeah<00:01:33.899> that's<00:01:34.110> why<00:01:34.259> you

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319

got your feet being horizontal so you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.109
