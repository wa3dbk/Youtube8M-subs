00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
important uncovered so that the rub

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.109 
important uncovered so that the rub
dries<00:01:48.619> out<00:01:48.860> a<00:01:48.920> bit<00:01:49.159> and<00:01:49.310> loses<00:01:49.759> some<00:01:49.909> of<00:01:49.939> its

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
dries out a bit and loses some of its

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.780 
dries out a bit and loses some of its
moisture<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:51.650> less<00:01:51.860> moisture<00:01:52.369> you<00:01:52.460> have<00:01:52.490> on

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
moisture the less moisture you have on

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.760 
moisture the less moisture you have on
your<00:01:52.939> bird<00:01:53.150> when<00:01:53.450> it's<00:01:53.570> about<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:53.990> go<00:01:54.140> in<00:01:54.320> a<00:01:54.530> vat

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
of hot oil is the less splattering and

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.039 
of hot oil is the less splattering and
bubbling<00:01:58.430> you're<00:01:58.549> gonna<00:01:58.700> get<00:01:58.970> which<00:01:59.540> helps

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
bubbling you're gonna get which helps

immerse it in the hot oil the
temperature<00:03:25.590> is<00:03:25.680> gonna<00:03:25.799> drop<00:03:26.190> quite<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.519> bit

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
temperature is gonna drop quite a bit

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.460 
temperature is gonna drop quite a bit
and<00:03:26.940> you<00:03:27.030> really<00:03:27.480> want<00:03:27.660> this<00:03:27.780> bird<00:03:28.079> to<00:03:28.290> cook

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
and you really want this bird to cook

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.280 
and you really want this bird to cook
somewhere<00:03:28.769> around<00:03:29.190> 340<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.120> 3<00:03:30.359> 55<00:03:30.870> degrees

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
somewhere around 340 to 3 55 degrees

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.589 
somewhere around 340 to 3 55 degrees
it's<00:03:32.069> usually<00:03:32.340> about<00:03:32.609> three<00:03:33.090> minutes<00:03:33.269> per

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
it's usually about three minutes per

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.930 
it's usually about three minutes per
pound<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.590> it's<00:03:34.949> gonna<00:03:35.040> be<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.280> little<00:03:35.430> bit<00:03:35.639> over

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
pound so it's gonna be a little bit over

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.759 
pound so it's gonna be a little bit over
35<00:03:36.480> minutes<00:03:36.810> or<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.079> for<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.349> bird<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.680> be

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
35 minutes or so for this bird to be

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.949 
35 minutes or so for this bird to be
done<00:03:37.949> but<00:03:38.190> once<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:38.879> get<00:03:39.030> close<00:03:39.359> towards<00:03:39.840> the

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
done but once you get close towards the

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.020 
done but once you get close towards the
end<00:03:40.139> forget<00:03:40.980> about<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:41.340> three<00:03:41.609> minutes<00:03:41.879> per

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
end forget about the three minutes per

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.430 
end forget about the three minutes per
pound<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.419> really<00:03:42.690> need<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:42.989> just<00:03:43.169> look<00:03:43.349> at

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
pound you really need to just look at

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.869 
pound you really need to just look at
the<00:03:43.560> bird<00:03:43.769> and<00:03:43.949> see<00:03:44.129> what's<00:03:44.310> going<00:03:44.579> on<00:03:44.699> because

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
the bird and see what's going on because

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.759 
the bird and see what's going on because
every<00:03:45.239> one<00:03:45.389> is<00:03:45.510> different<00:03:45.540> how<00:03:46.349> your<00:03:46.560> oil

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
every one is different how your oil

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.409 
every one is different how your oil
reacts<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.430> comes<00:03:47.639> back<00:03:47.879> up<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.150> temperature

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
reacts and comes back up to temperature

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.449 
reacts and comes back up to temperature
is<00:03:48.660> very<00:03:48.870> different<00:03:49.290> with<00:03:49.410> each<00:03:49.590> setup<00:03:49.889> so

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
is very different with each setup so

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.099 
is very different with each setup so
towards<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.030> end<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.329> really<00:03:51.599> need<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.930> pay<00:03:52.079> a

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
towards the end you really need to pay a

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.199 
towards the end you really need to pay a
lot<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.319> attention<00:03:52.609> another<00:03:53.609> good<00:03:53.819> thing<00:03:53.849> to

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
lot of attention another good thing to

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
oil is splattering it's even coming up

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.830 
oil is splattering it's even coming up
through<00:05:01.980> the<00:05:02.100> neck<00:05:02.280> cavity<00:05:02.520> here<00:05:03.060> so<00:05:03.510> the<00:05:03.630> more

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
through the neck cavity here so the more

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.810 
through the neck cavity here so the more
moisture<00:05:04.050> you<00:05:04.380> had<00:05:04.530> in<00:05:04.650> this<00:05:04.800> bird<00:05:05.130> is<00:05:05.370> the

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
moisture you had in this bird is the

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.580 
moisture you had in this bird is the
more<00:05:06.000> severe<00:05:06.450> this<00:05:06.600> would<00:05:06.840> be<00:05:07.020> so<00:05:07.260> you<00:05:07.320> try<00:05:07.560> to

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
more severe this would be so you try to

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.590 
more severe this would be so you try to
minimize<00:05:07.890> that<00:05:08.160> again<00:05:08.610> by<00:05:08.760> removing<00:05:09.300> as<00:05:09.390> much

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
minimize that again by removing as much

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.720 
minimize that again by removing as much
moisture<00:05:09.780> as<00:05:10.050> you<00:05:10.170> can<00:05:10.350> from<00:05:10.590> the<00:05:10.710> bird<00:05:10.920> before

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
moisture as you can from the bird before
