hi<00:00:01.050> I'm<00:00:01.709> Oscar<00:00:01.920> validator<00:00:02.639> and<00:00:02.790> I<00:00:03.300> built<00:00:03.540> this

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
hi I'm Oscar validator and I built this

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.280 
hi I'm Oscar validator and I built this
fin<00:00:04.350> fire<00:00:04.560> detector<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:06.540> course<00:00:06.779> you<00:00:07.140> know

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
fin fire detector and of course you know

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.910 
fin fire detector and of course you know
how<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.799> vampire<00:00:08.309> detector<00:00:08.910> works<00:00:09.740> you<00:00:10.740> have<00:00:10.769> to

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
how a vampire detector works you have to

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.410 
how a vampire detector works you have to
check<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.429> mirror<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:13.219> let's<00:00:14.219> let's<00:00:15.000> check<00:00:15.240> this

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
check a mirror so let's let's check this

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.910 
check a mirror so let's let's check this
mirror<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.430> let's<00:00:17.430> look<00:00:17.609> into<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.300> mirror<00:00:18.920> so

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
mirror and let's look into the mirror so

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.540 
mirror and let's look into the mirror so
can<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.400> see<00:00:20.580> me<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:21.769> guess<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.800> can<00:00:23.130> see<00:00:23.369> me

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
can you see me I guess you can see me

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.640 
can you see me I guess you can see me
well<00:00:24.090> that's<00:00:24.390> true<00:00:24.689> I'm<00:00:24.869> not<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> vampire

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
well that's true I'm not a vampire

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.689 
well that's true I'm not a vampire
as<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.310> can<00:00:26.460> read<00:00:26.670> below<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.710> definitely<00:00:28.710> not

as you can read below and definitely not

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.810 
as you can read below and definitely not
a<00:00:30.170> vampire<00:00:31.579> but<00:00:32.750> now<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.140> question<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.820> are

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
a vampire but now the question is are

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.910 
a vampire but now the question is are
you<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.030> vampire<00:00:36.500> well<00:00:37.500> then<00:00:38.129> we<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.700> look

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
you a vampire well then we have to look

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.000 
you a vampire well then we have to look
through<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.040> again<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:42.140> please<00:00:43.140> check<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.590> out

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
through it again and please check it out

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.110 
through it again and please check it out
can<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.760> see<00:00:44.940> yourself<00:00:45.059> oh<00:00:45.660> oh<00:00:46.879> you<00:00:47.879> can

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
can you see yourself oh oh you can

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.360 
can you see yourself oh oh you can
hardly<00:00:48.510> see<00:00:48.660> yourself<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> mirror<00:00:49.710> so

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
hardly see yourself in the mirror so

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.410 
hardly see yourself in the mirror so
your<00:00:50.640> looks<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.600> you're<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> vampire

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
your looks like you're a vampire

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.709 
your looks like you're a vampire
hmm<00:00:54.420> how<00:00:55.289> does<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.620> work<00:00:56.460> well<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.600> course

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
hmm how does this work well of course

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.290 
hmm how does this work well of course
this<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.350> not<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.559> real<00:00:59.160> vampire<00:00:59.489> detector

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
this is not a real vampire detector

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.080 
this is not a real vampire detector
actually<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> piece<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.090> polarization

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
actually this is a piece of polarization

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.479 
actually this is a piece of polarization
filter<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.290> polarization<00:01:04.559> filter<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
filter and the polarization filter is a

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.260 
filter and the polarization filter is a
sheet<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.270> linear<00:01:06.570> filter<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.229> one<00:01:07.500> side<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
sheet of linear filter on one side and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.670 
sheet of linear filter on one side and
at<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> other<00:01:09.510> side<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.350> so-called

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
at the other side do the so-called

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.219 
at the other side do the so-called
quarter<00:01:11.430> wave<00:01:11.610> plate<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.479> turns<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.930> linear

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
quarter wave plate that turns the linear

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.679 
quarter wave plate that turns the linear
light<00:01:13.860> into<00:01:14.250> circular<00:01:14.760> light<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.509> has

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
light into circular light and that has

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.320 
light into circular light and that has
all<00:01:15.900> kinds<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.290> interesting<00:01:16.740> properties<00:01:17.700> but

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
all kinds of interesting properties but

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.990 
all kinds of interesting properties but
let<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.810> let<00:01:19.500> me<00:01:19.619> show<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.860> again<00:01:20.280> how<00:01:20.850> this

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
let you let me show you again how this

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.990 
let you let me show you again how this
works<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> mirror<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:23.220> please<00:01:23.460> look

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
works in the mirror so please look

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.550 
works in the mirror so please look
through<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.689> mirror<00:01:25.729> in<00:01:26.810> one<00:01:27.810> direction<00:01:28.350> when

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
through the mirror in one direction when

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.679 
through the mirror in one direction when
you<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.009> linear<00:01:29.310> part<00:01:29.970> at<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.479> mirror

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
you have the linear part at the mirror

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.960 
you have the linear part at the mirror
then<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.619> light<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.310> goes<00:01:32.579> linearly

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
then the light just goes linearly

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.530 
then the light just goes linearly
through<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:34.040> filter<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.250> back<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.240> can

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
through the filter and back so you can

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.740 
through the filter and back so you can
see<00:01:36.780> through<00:01:37.020> when<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:37.920> turn<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.250> around<00:01:38.750> you

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
see through when I turn it around you

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.109 
see through when I turn it around you
have<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.079> circular<00:01:40.350> part<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.610> light<00:01:41.790> comes

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
have the circular part the light comes

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.050 
have the circular part the light comes
writes<00:01:42.689> your<00:01:42.930> Clark<00:01:43.290> out<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:44.220> returns<00:01:44.729> left

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
writes your Clark out it returns left

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.330 
writes your Clark out it returns left
circular<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.290> blocked<00:01:46.590> by<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.860> filter

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
circular and it's blocked by the filter

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.859 
circular and it's blocked by the filter
so<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.270> one<00:01:48.509> direction<00:01:48.710> it's<00:01:49.710> opaque<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.869> in

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
so in one direction it's opaque and in

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.770 
so in one direction it's opaque and in
the<00:01:51.990> other<00:01:52.140> direction<00:01:52.820> it's<00:01:53.960> transparent

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
the other direction it's transparent

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.480 
the other direction it's transparent
opaque<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:59.840> transparent<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.469> while<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
opaque and transparent and while the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.969 
opaque and transparent and while the
material<00:02:03.030> reflects<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.659> bit<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.079> that's<00:02:04.290> part

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
material reflects a bit so that's part

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.109 
material reflects a bit so that's part
of<00:02:05.119> what<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.299> see<00:02:06.509> but<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
of what you see but this is this is the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.910 
of what you see but this is this is the
way<00:02:09.239> how<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.110> firm

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
way how this firm
