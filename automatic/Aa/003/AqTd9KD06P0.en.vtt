00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:56.170 

this<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:48.920> part<00:02:49.280> of<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.430> shirt

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:06.610 

yep<00:02:57.140> fits<00:02:58.099> perfectly<00:03:03.099> up<00:03:04.099> the<00:03:04.280> head<00:03:04.659> and<00:03:05.659> this

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
yep fits perfectly up the head and this

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:17.910 
yep fits perfectly up the head and this
arm<00:03:06.920> for<00:03:07.310> some<00:03:07.430> reason<00:03:07.760> it<00:03:07.819> keeps<00:03:07.940> falling<00:03:08.299> off

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:25.810 

and<00:03:20.440> I'm<00:03:21.440> not<00:03:21.830> sure<00:03:21.890> what<00:03:22.670> this<00:03:22.970> is<00:03:24.670> maybe<00:03:25.670> a

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
and I'm not sure what this is maybe a

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:39.980 
and I'm not sure what this is maybe a
stand<00:03:30.580> it<00:03:31.580> doesn't<00:03:32.000> really<00:03:32.120> show

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.950 

I<00:03:40.080> guess<00:03:41.070> it<00:03:41.250> is<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.400> stand<00:03:41.820> because<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.690> can't

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
I guess it is a stand because it can't

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:51.350 
I guess it is a stand because it can't
stand<00:03:43.290> up<00:03:43.560> by<00:03:43.770> itself<00:03:49.490> so<00:03:50.490> there<00:03:50.880> you<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.210> it

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
stand up by itself so there you have it

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.400 
stand up by itself so there you have it
that's<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.720> Goku<00:03:52.200> with<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.710> kick<00:03:52.860> gets
