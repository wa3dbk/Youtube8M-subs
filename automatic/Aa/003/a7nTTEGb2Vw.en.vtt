00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.259
 most recently, on August 23, decided to brighter 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.960
 run all mortals who have 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.340
 playstation 4 on beta multiplayer call 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.889
 of duty black ops 3 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.020
 I'm not a fan of all parts 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.199
 pre-order and was glad this news 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.350
 downloaded and began to bend but not immediately because 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.180
 At first, the server was very lagged for 1 hour 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.670
 a little impossible to play by two 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.340
 For the first reasons, we don’t leave it and 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.399
 feeling like i'm not playing black ops 3 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.250
 and in advance for fair with a bunch of addons 2 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.120
 ethologists though the game showed that pink y 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.489
 me normal 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.410
 but it was imperceptible to feeling like 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.480
 as if swinging parallel 10 more 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.969
 films with porno truth there is and 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.129
 alternative version all the fighters studied 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.559
 teleport and just scored on normal 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.570
 walking after a while I already 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.850
 Filmets and paused and smog 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.640
 ok play that strange could 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.590
 I play another 24 numbers while 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.510
 testing was up to 23 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.609
 maybe the developers decided not to 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.229
 disable the stiller a little more and give 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.900
 enjoy freeloader this 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.180
 I was a great multiplayer 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.500
 one day is enough to burn 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.500
 fifth point we begin 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.310
 throughout the series my treat 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.350
 graphics loyal while in the world 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.750
 everyone shouted sucks at once 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.600
 horror change already the engine and in response 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.330
 got that the engine though old but not 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.000
 worthless and every year they make 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.789
 its better and better or engine new 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.369
 I answer and on this deception sold treasure 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.979
 20 Lyamov copies a year at the same time waste 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.600
 on the heart of the game a couple of kopecks so far those 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.789
 terrible textures which also 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.170
 immersed in real time with 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.509
 after both years not the best 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.909
 the only place where the eyes are happy is the menu 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.429
 there is your character and everything is very 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.619
 beautiful otherwise the same sucks 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.420
 animation from the last part of any 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.850
 destructible even that in the game 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.270
 plastic sound is destroyed 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.909
 weapons and so on some will say Vlad 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.429
 so there is a cool gameplay and in something 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.840
 they will be right but this is cool gameplay 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.569
 we have seen in other games 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.580
 where not phrases call of duty remember 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.100
 how are you one of the developers cat said 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.380
 that they do not look at other projects and 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.930
 from this comes the conclusion guys then 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.390
 invent everything themselves sadly one all 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.700
 it has already been invented but let's get into the game 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.650
 First of all, they give us one ticket and 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.989
 offer to choose your class and four 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.670
 proposed ruby pumped white 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.310
 a man with two sticks in his hands 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.739
 morning gait sweet girl assassins 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.709
 bow bow electric nigga 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.320
 battery strong woman strong gun 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.420
 arm and five more closed classes which 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.549
 available for testing only need 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.100
 level raise long sit and choose 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.690
 this or that one is not worth it and you 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.590
 are free to try another class 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.840
 abilities 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.150
 there is a mega electric gun 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.430
 charge in advance for fair she shot 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.970
 laser and super teleport ability 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.609
 backwards 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.920
 like we have seen Vovochku 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:06.010
 Tracer hero but that's all get out 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.740
 differently her servants who's kinda cool 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.260
 And as if not care there is and 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.790
 There is and still she owns voiky on some 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.770
 time looks through the walls and 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.630
 highlights enemies but these abilities 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.150
 inaccessible from the very beginning 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.190
 naturally you need to open them and then 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.210
 in battle but killing enemies so that some 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.400
 the scale is full 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.680
 and something has become available to you 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.170
 forever and not even to death vanity 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.150
 weapons, things are rapidly given 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.700
 with a dozen rounds this is the school 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.190
 starts crawling back you shoot 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.940
 the scale is accelerating and even if you don’t 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.680
 shot out 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.630
 Well, not found that lucky ready 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.340
 take death by your hand weapon 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.950
 disappear and again have to accumulate 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.030
 energy to the word swelling so for which you 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.250
 open classes 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.220
 this is the local currency for it you can 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.300
 buy but in the opened arms up and 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.490
 all sorts of gadgets 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.010
 while skirts for trunks need only 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.440
 open purchase is not required in black 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.080
 ops 3 3 archie decided to go on system 10 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.270
 when the howl is available 10 points for which 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.340
 you and dress your character from that 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.350
 what opened and bought as already 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.390
 said before the gameplay of this game is very 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.000
 similar to advance for fair with small 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.460
 changes instead of double jump and 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.650
 rebound to the side there is hover 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.870
 and already during the short flight you can 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.640
 dodge the side again given 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.860
 exoskeleton attended the last part 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.620
 true here he is more maneuverable 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.870
 added a pinch of tython to run 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.840
 thank you walls x titans did not break out 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.010
 although they were n't here for cards 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.530
 same as before 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.780
 poor building in the middle and around to me 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.850
 with poor machines some who react 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.070
 the action of the player you shoot was a couple 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.950
 once the glass it will explode and others 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.780
 brazen are standing and as if they are not here that 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.240
 please with them to do the deformation too 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.640
 glass unnoticed and which year we already 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.430
 please add normal destructible 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.220
 at least the smallest before the start let 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.420
 barrels explode learn yes yes I forgot 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.970
 old engine 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.380
 but don't be discouraged by the revolution here 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.900
 also 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.270
 gone guys learned how to swim under water 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.550
 otherwise this is the last part 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.410
 only occurred replacement weapons 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.840
 slightly changed grenades 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.510
 This also applies to the type of gadgets appeared 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.940
 new drones are some kind of robot wasps and 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.610
 similar and more designers gave 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.040
 today's weapons and paints up said 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.920
 make the weapons of the future in the game themes 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.940
 time 2060 year Aelita runs with 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.580
 Kalash rooster hands bravo 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.800
 and in the end I don't know what to say i am very 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.020
 love this series but even I am a man 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.000
 who took gust adequately 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.160
 looked at the texture data and not spitting 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.410
 I realized that she was not rolling down 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.480
 liked advanced warfare it was 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.120
 something new for call of duty and i'm waiting 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.640
 Continue to twist the plot but let me down 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.040
 already had enough of this cyberpunk all 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.020
 now just obsessed with the future why 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.420
 would not unfold the present events 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.970
 or in the past there was also interesting 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.190
 so no everything just go ahead and still 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.300
 this part will buy millions further somewhere 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.340
 over 25 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.440
 developers will again understand what is possible 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.390
 Do not bathe much and continue to rivet 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.030
 same on the same 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.740
 one hope for a single player game in black 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.410
 ops was like a nice plot 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.760
 I hope it will remain write in 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.370
 comments what do you think about this 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.560
 about how to raise call of duty from your knees 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.780
 You can do it on the old engine and 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.920
 after what part did you understand what was at the bottom 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.920
 see you soon
