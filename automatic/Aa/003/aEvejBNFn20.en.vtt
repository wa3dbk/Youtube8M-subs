00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
tripped up with the server IP addresses

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.000 
tripped up with the server IP addresses
because<00:00:17.610> there<00:00:17.850> are<00:00:18.000> two<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.270> them<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:19.010> you

and how to actually find both of them so
let's<00:00:25.230> just<00:00:25.440> I'm<00:00:25.770> just<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.100> do<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.190> quick

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
let's just I'm just going to do a quick

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.480 
let's just I'm just going to do a quick
video<00:00:26.520> here<00:00:26.940> about<00:00:27.270> the<00:00:27.450> IP<00:00:27.750> addresses

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
video here about the IP addresses

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.590 
video here about the IP addresses
alright<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:29.700> when<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.970> first<00:00:30.180> create<00:00:30.510> your

alright so when you first create your

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.239 
alright so when you first create your
server<00:00:30.870> here<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.620> get<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:31.860> little<00:00:32.009> window

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:32.249 
server here you get this little window

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:34.869 
server here you get this little window
cut<00:00:32.550> server<00:00:32.820> properties<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.570> inside<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.260> is

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
cut server properties and inside this is

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.560 
cut server properties and inside this is
the<00:00:35.879> server<00:00:36.120> IP<00:00:36.329> here<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.890> IP<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.699> your

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
the server IP here and this IP is your

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.319 
the server IP here and this IP is your
private<00:00:40.109> IP<00:00:40.230> address<00:00:40.649> alright<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:42.089> this<00:00:42.210> is

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
private IP address alright so this is

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.399 
private IP address alright so this is
the<00:00:42.420> IP<00:00:42.659> address<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:43.079> you're<00:00:43.199> going<00:00:43.350> to

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:43.409 
the IP address that you're going to

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.110 
the IP address that you're going to
connect<00:00:43.679> to<00:00:43.859> as<00:00:44.039> long<00:00:44.309> as<00:00:44.489> you're<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.819> the<00:00:44.940> same

alright and this is how to do it for Mac
there's<00:01:19.049> other<00:01:19.320> ways<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.039> on<00:01:20.159> pc<00:01:20.579> i

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
there's other ways to do it on pc i

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.279 
there's other ways to do it on pc i
believe<00:01:20.789> on<00:01:21.210> pc<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.659> actually<00:01:21.960> type<00:01:22.140> in

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
believe on pc you actually type in

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.940 
believe on pc you actually type in
ipconfig<00:01:22.820> in<00:01:23.820> your<00:01:24.450> run<00:01:24.750> window<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.829> that

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
ipconfig in your run window and that

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.380 
ipconfig in your run window and that
will<00:01:26.070> give<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.880> will<00:01:27.000> give<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.210> your

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
will give it to that will give you your

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.020 
will give it to that will give you your
IP<00:01:27.859> so<00:01:28.859> um<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.369> know<00:01:29.460> there's<00:01:29.670> different<00:01:29.759> ways

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
IP so um you know there's different ways

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.550 
IP so um you know there's different ways
to<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> Mac<00:01:30.960> let's<00:01:31.200> say<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.439> do

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
to do it but on a Mac let's say you do

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.160 
to do it but on a Mac let's say you do
it<00:01:31.710> ifconfig<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.609> it's<00:01:33.060> right<00:01:33.210> here<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.719> that

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
it ifconfig and it's right here on that

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.319 
it ifconfig and it's right here on that
line<00:01:34.710> that's<00:01:35.490> how<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.700> get<00:01:35.789> your<00:01:35.850> private<00:01:36.240> IP

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
line that's how you get your private IP

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.149 
line that's how you get your private IP
address<00:01:36.689> now<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.289> guys<00:01:37.469> are<00:01:37.560> all<00:01:37.770> wondering

server on your computer though you're

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.839 
server on your computer though you're
going<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.799> want<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.040> use<00:02:41.189> the<00:02:41.370> one<00:02:41.489> that<00:02:41.609> we<00:02:41.700> got

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
going to want to use the one that we got

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.300 
going to want to use the one that we got
off<00:02:41.970> IP<00:02:42.150> chicken<00:02:42.659> alright<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:44.129> basically

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
off IP chicken alright so basically

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.860 
off IP chicken alright so basically
that's<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.000> way<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.180> works<00:02:45.359> if<00:02:45.599> you're<00:02:45.750> not

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
that's the way it works if you're not

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.839 
that's the way it works if you're not
running<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.230> server<00:02:46.439> on<00:02:46.799> your<00:02:46.980> computer<00:02:47.370> then

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
running the server on your computer then

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.259 
running the server on your computer then
you<00:02:48.269> use<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.900> IP<00:02:49.349> chicken<00:02:49.980> or<00:02:50.189> that<00:02:51.000> IP

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
you use the IP chicken or that IP

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.119 
you use the IP chicken or that IP
address<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.959> if<00:02:52.379> you<00:02:52.500> are<00:02:52.680> running<00:02:52.859> the

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
address and if you are running the

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.199 
address and if you are running the
server<00:02:53.280> on<00:02:53.549> your<00:02:53.730> computer<00:02:54.120> then<00:02:54.689> you<00:02:54.930> use

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
server on your computer then you use

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.309 
server on your computer then you use
this<00:02:57.209> IP<00:02:57.450> address<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.109> that's<00:02:58.230> just

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
this IP address and that's just

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.559 
this IP address and that's just
basically<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.950> way<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.370> IP<00:02:59.819> addresses<00:03:00.389> work

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
basically the way that IP addresses work

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.720 
basically the way that IP addresses work
and<00:03:00.919> hopefully<00:03:01.919> this<00:03:02.159> will<00:03:02.310> clear<00:03:02.519> up<00:03:02.639> a

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
and hopefully this will clear up a

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.309 
and hopefully this will clear up a
little<00:03:02.939> bit<00:03:03.090> on<00:03:03.329> you<00:03:03.720> know<00:03:03.840> server<00:03:04.109> IP

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
little bit on you know server IP

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.960 
little bit on you know server IP
addresses<00:03:04.889> hopefully<00:03:05.310> I'll<00:03:05.459> be<00:03:05.489> able<00:03:05.879> to

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
addresses hopefully I'll be able to

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.490 
addresses hopefully I'll be able to
touch<00:03:06.180> port<00:03:06.689> forwarding<00:03:07.109> and<00:03:07.230> some<00:03:07.379> other

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
touch port forwarding and some other

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:17.460 
touch port forwarding and some other
videos<00:03:07.879> but<00:03:08.879> um<00:03:09.060> thanks<00:03:09.510> for<00:03:09.629> watching<00:03:09.930> guys
