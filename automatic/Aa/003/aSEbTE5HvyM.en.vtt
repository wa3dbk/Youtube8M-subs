you one second when they wiped off the
counter<00:00:39.750> because<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.350> was<00:00:41.040> making<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.399> mess<00:00:41.579> with

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
counter because I was making a mess with

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.459 
counter because I was making a mess with
this<00:00:41.969> experiment<00:00:42.690> for<00:00:43.160> and<00:00:45.020> you<00:00:46.020> want<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.289> fill

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:57.380 
this experiment for and you want to fill
it<00:00:46.500> up<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.190> little<00:00:47.489> bit<00:00:56.030> ok<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.059> know<00:00:57.210> you

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.369 
it up just a little bit ok I know you
can<00:00:57.600> see<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:59.129> don't<00:00:59.280> tiny<00:00:59.910> lobe

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
can see that but just don't tiny lobe

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.609

now<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.680> like<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.160> use<00:01:02.399> dies<00:01:02.699> because<00:01:03.409> what<00:01:04.409> this

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
now I like to use dies because what this

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.950 
now I like to use dies because what this
does<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.189> water<00:01:05.369> gets<00:01:05.729> sucked<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.180> but<00:01:06.750> I

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
does is the water gets sucked up but I

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.350

can't<00:01:07.229> really<00:01:07.350> see<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.070> if<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.610> used<00:01:08.850> eyes<00:01:09.090> I

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
can't really see it so if I used eyes I

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.380 
can't really see it so if I used eyes I
can<00:01:09.659> see<00:01:09.900> what's<00:01:10.110> happening<00:01:10.170> oh<00:01:10.909> I<00:01:11.909> forgot<00:01:12.090> to

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
thinner the best part is the better I

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.880 
thinner the best part is the better I
just<00:01:20.820> didn't<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.360> any<00:01:21.479> thinner<00:01:21.750> glass<00:01:22.409> cups

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890

so now take your grace and matches I use

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:37.910 
so now take your grace and matches I use
to<00:01:33.170> stick<00:01:34.549> this<00:01:35.549> end<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.659> match<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.619> end

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
to stick this end of the match this end

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.540 
to stick this end of the match this end
right<00:01:38.070> here<00:01:38.340> into<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.329> grape

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.330 

and<00:01:43.970> same<00:01:44.900> with<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.200> other<00:01:45.230> one<00:01:48.070> so<00:01:49.070> it<00:01:49.190> will

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
and same with the other one so it will

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.800 
and same with the other one so it will
place<00:01:49.610> that<00:01:51.340> now

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
place that now

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.770 
place that now
place<00:01:54.579> your<00:01:55.579> grape<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:57.259> water<00:01:57.500> in<00:01:58.780> this

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
center would be perfect and make sure

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.350 
center would be perfect and make sure
these<00:02:02.750> are<00:02:03.229> in<00:02:03.590> them<00:02:03.890> standing<00:02:04.700> up<00:02:04.880> oh<00:02:07.360> it's

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360
