00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.970
 way of catching empty with field bomber 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:10.320
 came up with this way of catching father 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.040
 six-time world champion emilio 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:18.779
 Colombo somewhere after the war and he 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.180
 used first for trout fishing in 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.019
 deep lakes of italy 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.029
 but this method turned out to be very catchy 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.150
 very effective very simple 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.759
 mastering and therefore now apply 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.680
 in almost any place what 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.489
 is such a bombard on 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.440
 bard is a special float which 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.780
 has a float body and extension cord 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.789
 parent intended to bombard 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.760
 held a certain position in the water a 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.840
 body it means intended for 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.910
 to throw away the bait and 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.129
 while posting hold the bait on 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.570
 limit on a certain horizon 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:07.140
 Here is the beauty of the bombers is that it 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.710
 Tackle provides long-distance casts 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.030
 spinning 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.460
 and catch fly fishing fly fishing you 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.189
 maximum can throw bait on 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.820
 20-30 meters long-long May 1 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.860
 waving a cord with a spinning blog you 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.650
 can throw the bait more far 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.799
 meters by 7 180 but there are cases up to 100 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.040
 meters but the bait will be very big 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.299
 fish he caught would be very bad 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.549
 bombing tackle you can pick up 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.780
 small bait such as mine 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.780
 little fly 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.250
 little twister 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.530
 or a small bead even zero 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.290
 size you can pick up everything be 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.310
 far and carry out as when using 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:01.580
 fly fishing very slowly bombards 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.869
 the bombard lineup they come in 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.149
 Generally not in appearance 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.920
 they are not different from each other but they 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:11.959
 there are floating here bombards 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:16.280
 top slowly sinking and fast sinking 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:19.160
 they are designed to catch all as well 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.959
 would all tiers answer floating him catch 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.500
 chub means slowly sinking we 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.610
 burning 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.980
 perch and pike and fast sinking we for sure 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.190
 as well as using jack spinning 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.750
 we can fish the deepest 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.840
 water horizon and including 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.640
 knock under new for pawnshops and 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.269
 fishing is better to use special 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.580
 rods 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:47.600
 this rod is a lot like 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.660
 ordinary fishing pole with rings 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 but unlike a fishing pole with rings she 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:59.120
 has cast bait weight if you 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.730
 You can see that we are throwing seats 15 35 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.680
 gram that is like a spinning and this 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.620
 rod she has a special build and 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.530
 It designed to throw 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:14.480
 like spinning throw bait for 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.980
 for a long distance the length of these rods 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.940
 defined in the rules of sport fishing 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:25.940
 and is from three point 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:29.480
 and 8 tenths of meters to 4.8 meters and 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:34.880
 the test and those rods should be from 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.650
 0 almost 80 grams why rods 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.230
 why not spinning a or some 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.690
 other gear because the length of the leash 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.860
 For the right lowball scorers must 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:50.710
 be a half two meters and we are ordinary 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:54.830
 spining even a length of 3 meters can not 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:56.930
 correctly throw and bombard and so 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.360
 her letter dangled leash 2 meters 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.770
 therefore, use a special rod 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.140
 In addition, these rods provide 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.410
 correct bait wiring and started still 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.410
 when choosing rods for bombardy very 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.360
 it means important peculiar statement 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.090
 rings that is, you see here a lot 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.580
 rings called english staging 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:21.049
 rings i have some rings 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:27.980
 stand not only on the knees themselves but also on 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:29.110
 special floating inserts which 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.200
 at 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.900
 parsing is set in the middle 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:41.080
 knee this way on each knee 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:42.550
 not have to 2 to 3 this vstavochki 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.830
 unloads the rod 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.390
 that is, the more the ringlets will be 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.180
 more will be destroyed were carried out during 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.030
 casting and vyvazhivaniya time 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.430
 The second feature of these rods is that 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:59.980
 they are pretty straightforward 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:03.670
 hard build have very flexible 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:06.310
 whip he shows us a bite and he 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.230
 does not break even when rods 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:14.880
 my scientific bends like a big 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:14.880
 the value of how it all works means we 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.720
 Reveal rods put coil 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.810
 we pass through rings we insert into 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.440
 Bombard here you can install 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:36.040
 rubber ring to soften the blows 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:38.320
 bombers about swivel after that 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:42.280
 tied swivel swivel 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:46.630
 remains special means it consists of 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:50.340
 three swivels that are connected 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:54.040
 connected together and by they provide 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.320
 the fact that while catching our bait is very 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.670
 strongly glue twisted and only 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.160
 triple swivel 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:05.400
 saves us from this well and when fishing 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.770
 bombard use fluorocarbon y 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:12.550
 fishing line she have no invisible to fish in 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:15.670
 water and therefore allows you to do this 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.050
 tackle is even more catchy and in quality 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:20.050
 bait can be as i said 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:24.409
 use in trimmers 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:27.289
 flies can be ordinary 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:33.080
 worm caps can be small beads 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:35.929
 and little-little twister who haven't yet 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:39.199
 caught using bombers 

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:42.889
 I advise you to use this type of fishing 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:45.169
 because he is very catchy and very 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:49.249
 easy to handle 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:53.239
 he allows with the help of uncomplicated gear 

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:54.099
 throw a little bait on the far 

00:06:53.239 --> 00:06:57.079
 distance 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:07:00.259
 but unlike fly fishing gear 

00:06:57.079 --> 00:07:04.159
 which require a very long mastery 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:06.110
 sometimes it takes years to do so 

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:08.229
 to throw this little one right 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.159
 lure for a long distance and 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:12.379
 allows you to throw besides 

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:15.289
 bait of the most awkward positions 

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:18.079
 from behind the bushes from behind the trees and catch 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:21.669
 careful fish with you was igor 

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:21.669
 good city dweller you would be
