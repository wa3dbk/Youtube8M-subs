the only good snake is a dead snake I
hate<00:00:34.210> snakes<00:00:35.350> but<00:00:36.350> I<00:00:36.410> read<00:00:36.710> a<00:00:36.739> statistic<00:00:36.980> Gary

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
hate snakes but I read a statistic Gary

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.729 
hate snakes but I read a statistic Gary
Davis<00:00:37.970> said<00:00:38.210> more<00:00:38.600> people<00:00:38.960> die<00:00:39.230> each<00:00:39.410> year

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
Davis said more people die each year

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.729 
Davis said more people die each year
from<00:00:39.980> falling<00:00:40.940> down<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:41.300> stairs<00:00:41.630> than<00:00:42.500> from

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
from falling down the stairs than from

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.100 
from falling down the stairs than from
snake<00:00:43.010> bites<00:00:43.280> I<00:00:43.610> really<00:00:44.600> didn't<00:00:44.809> like<00:00:44.899> that

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
snake bites I really didn't like that

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.560 
snake bites I really didn't like that
statistic<00:00:45.730> because<00:00:46.730> it<00:00:46.850> makes<00:00:47.030> my<00:00:47.239> fear<00:00:47.540> of

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
statistic because it makes my fear of

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.940 
statistic because it makes my fear of
snakes<00:00:47.899> seem<00:00:48.410> so<00:00:49.180> irrational<00:00:53.649> but<00:00:54.649> isn't<00:00:54.920> that

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
snakes seem so irrational but isn't that

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.150 
snakes seem so irrational but isn't that
true<00:00:55.250> of<00:00:55.280> all<00:00:55.550> of<00:00:55.579> us<00:00:55.789> we're<00:00:56.719> scared<00:00:57.200> of<00:00:57.500> wrong

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
true of all of us we're scared of wrong

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.580 
true of all of us we're scared of wrong
things<00:00:58.690> and<00:00:59.690> what<00:00:59.930> I<00:00:59.960> want<00:01:00.170> to<00:01:00.260> talk<00:01:00.440> about

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
things and what I want to talk about

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.229 
things and what I want to talk about
today<00:01:00.949> is<00:01:01.070> this<00:01:01.219> disparity<00:01:01.699> between<00:01:01.969> the

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
today is this disparity between the

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.850 
today is this disparity between the
things<00:01:02.420> that<00:01:02.539> were<00:01:02.629> scared<00:01:02.989> of<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:03.440> the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
things that were scared of and the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.010 
things that were scared of and the
things<00:01:03.890> that<00:01:04.159> are<00:01:04.309> actually<00:01:04.670> dangerous<00:01:05.020> take

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
things that are actually dangerous take

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.069 
things that are actually dangerous take
sharks<00:01:06.380> for<00:01:06.529> example<00:01:07.039> you've<00:01:07.579> seen<00:01:07.819> jaws<00:01:08.090> okay

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
sharks for example you've seen jaws okay

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:10.599 
sharks for example you've seen jaws okay
so<00:01:09.139> the<00:01:09.319> odds<00:01:09.529> of<00:01:09.740> dying<00:01:10.009> in<00:01:10.159> a<00:01:10.219> shark<00:01:10.490> attack

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:10.609 
so the odds of dying in a shark attack

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:13.120 
so the odds of dying in a shark attack
are<00:01:11.060> like<00:01:11.149> one<00:01:11.389> and<00:01:11.509> a<00:01:11.600> quarter<00:01:11.899> billion<00:01:12.170> but

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
are like one and a quarter billion but

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.099 
are like one and a quarter billion but
it<00:01:13.219> doesn't<00:01:13.549> matter<00:01:13.759> we're<00:01:14.420> still<00:01:14.659> really

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
it doesn't matter we're still really

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.669 
it doesn't matter we're still really
scary

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
scary

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.849 
scary
and<00:01:16.009> who<00:01:16.819> are<00:01:16.880> we<00:01:17.119> to<00:01:17.149> let<00:01:17.479> statistics<00:01:18.229> getting

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
and who are we to let statistics getting

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:22.149 
and who are we to let statistics getting
aware<00:01:19.069> of<00:01:19.159> our<00:01:19.279> fears<00:01:20.590> this<00:01:21.590> is<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.920> only

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159
