00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
window use GL to put that to true I'll

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.470 
window use GL to put that to true I'll
just<00:03:04.980> use<00:03:05.100> this<00:03:05.190> Open<00:03:05.550> GL<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.940> point<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.270> server

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
just use this Open GL to point on server

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.990 
just use this Open GL to point on server
1.0<00:03:06.930> use<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.500> do<00:03:07.950> do<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.340> for<00:03:08.489> Android<00:03:08.880> as

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
1.0 use that do do that for Android as

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.210 
1.0 use that do do that for Android as
well<00:03:10.610> so<00:03:11.610> use<00:03:11.820> GL<00:03:12.209> that<00:03:12.750> true<00:03:13.200> alright<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:17.130> you

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
well so use GL that true alright and you

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.500 
well so use GL that true alright and you
can<00:03:17.340> set<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.550> width<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:17.970> height<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.390> can

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
can set the width and a height you can

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.979 
can set the width and a height you can
also<00:03:18.660> do<00:03:18.870> other<00:03:19.020> stuff<00:03:19.650> like<00:03:20.120> is<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.330> resizable

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
also do other stuff like is it resizable

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.920 
also do other stuff like is it resizable
so<00:03:22.950> that's<00:03:23.130> false

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
so that's false

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.800 
so that's false
next<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:24.989> Pro<00:03:26.090> yeah<00:03:27.090> I'm<00:03:27.330> also<00:03:27.480> going<00:03:27.630> to<00:03:27.690> teach

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
next I Pro yeah I'm also going to teach

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.930 
next I Pro yeah I'm also going to teach
you<00:03:27.989> through<00:03:28.230> how<00:03:28.470> libgdx<00:03:28.950> basically<00:03:29.700> works

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
you through how libgdx basically works

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.360 
you through how libgdx basically works
right<00:03:30.410> so<00:03:31.410> we've<00:03:31.530> got<00:03:31.560> all<00:03:31.709> my<00:03:31.950> game<00:03:32.160> this<00:03:32.280> is

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
right so we've got all my game this is

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.010 
right so we've got all my game this is
where<00:03:32.459> all<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.730> source<00:03:32.940> code<00:03:33.000> is<00:03:33.239> when<00:03:33.780> libgdx

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
where all the source code is when libgdx

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.830 
where all the source code is when libgdx
runs<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.800> game<00:03:35.010> okay<00:03:35.550> on<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:36.180> specific<00:03:36.690> platform

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
runs a game okay on a specific platform

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.780 
runs a game okay on a specific platform
say<00:03:37.140> we're<00:03:37.290> running<00:03:37.350> on<00:03:37.739> desktop<00:03:38.190> what<00:03:38.670> it'll

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
say we're running on desktop what it'll

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.000 
say we're running on desktop what it'll
do<00:03:38.940> is<00:03:39.090> it'll<00:03:39.450> basically<00:03:39.720> merge<00:03:40.410> these<00:03:40.739> two

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
do is it'll basically merge these two

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.199 
do is it'll basically merge these two
projects<00:03:41.430> basically<00:03:41.730> it's<00:03:41.820> got<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.000> source

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
projects basically it's got the source

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.930 
projects basically it's got the source
code<00:03:42.390> of<00:03:42.420> this<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:42.870> just<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.770> just<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.850> know

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
code of this and just the just you know

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.670 
code of this and just the just you know
a<00:03:44.970> little<00:03:45.209> overlay<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:46.020> know<00:03:46.140> this<00:03:46.530> is

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
a little overlay you know this is

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.910 
a little overlay you know this is
basically<00:03:47.010> this<00:03:47.220> it's<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.760> little<00:03:47.970> overlay<00:03:48.420> on

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
basically this it's a little overlay on

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.620 
basically this it's a little overlay on
you<00:03:49.920> know<00:03:50.010> with<00:03:50.160> all<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.400> desktop<00:03:50.850> crap<00:03:51.270> in<00:03:51.510> it

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
you know with all the desktop crap in it

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.620 
you know with all the desktop crap in it
if<00:03:52.560> we<00:03:53.400> run<00:03:53.580> it<00:03:53.700> on<00:03:53.760> Android<00:03:54.060> it'll<00:03:54.330> run<00:03:54.450> this

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
if we run it on Android it'll run this

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.380 
if we run it on Android it'll run this
on<00:03:54.900> this<00:03:55.230> okay<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:56.010> if<00:03:56.489> we're<00:03:56.670> not<00:03:56.700> web<00:03:57.030> this

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
on this okay and if we're not web this

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.449 
on this okay and if we're not web this
and<00:03:57.690> this

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
and this

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.670
