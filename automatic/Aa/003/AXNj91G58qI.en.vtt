00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.639
 Well, I think the team started a little bit 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.710
 I lie nervous 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.830
 then I think the example is scorching 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.840
 advantage scored two goals 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.010
 still moments were thinking I should have been 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.470
 end the first half 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.039
 during the break, the team warned that 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.619
 you need to carefully collect the first 15-20 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.259
 minutes and think and Arabs so on 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.680
 proceeded since it was given to score 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.560
 the first ball rapid felt a little 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.950
 confidence they had moments they 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.080
 climbed but once again thought on the counterattack we 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.600
 must have also ended the game afterwards 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.620
 94 minutes well, such a ball is just missing 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.530
 it is impossible that there is loss of concentration 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.470
 is it nonsense i think we are likely 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:59.320
 lost two points rapid most likely 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:03.260
 I found a point but I think that the tournament is still 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.960
 there are many and in front of the door walls with 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.450
 Rapid home and away shooting 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.640
 so I think the tour is not only 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.040
 starts, not all is lost all 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.990
 lost why already shout that if we 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.100
 not dug today too tournament for us 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.210
 ended these times you expected that 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.220
 rapid will return to the game 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.000
 first half rapid look very bad 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.880
 below 3 do not hammer rapid in the first minutes 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.120
 what we expected well I don't know a goal 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.370
 what wave don't you take python rubo at all 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.270
 didn't come back then when he scored the minutes 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.470
 10-15 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.940
 it was there could be such 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.729
 imperceptible but pure advantage 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:48.159
 moral but then again leveled the game 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:51.920
 had a moment and so I don't think that 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.290
 should have been missing last yes 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.869
 No, but we were afraid of the second card 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.909
 young guy but 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.700
 Varys was very big honestly I would not 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.409
 would change it without having a card all the more 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.349
 young guy oh well normal yelled 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:13.790
 just a shock card but I was afraid through 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:16.349
 first I cooked the team all yes yes 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.480
 then the newspapers started coming up with what 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.549
 Blokhin does not speak about personalities 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.959
 does not allocate no one is found 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.019
 some kind of mote 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.879
 forever and never say I raised 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.709
 whole team never highlighting it 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.470
 simple yet break now you write and i 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.569
 do not single out or praise anyone 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.299
 and here is another coach he tells 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:40.680
 thoroughly about every iraq so I 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:44.610
 it's just an introduction yes I agree 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.879
 said some of the players fell out 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.879
 the number fell out need to understand why but 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.769
 this is regardless of the value of the price for 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.329
 which person he buys probably 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.390
 still have to show some 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:03:03.000
 level well maybe not all guess 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:05.489
 with this purchase buffer or with purchases well 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.650
 price is not my problem honestly i don't 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:12.510
 I would put in the price and be knowledgeable in the price I would climb 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.450
 where I will not evaluate and router 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.549
 malina sa or makarenko or sidorchik a 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.709
 or synod did not want me out of here I'm 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.220
 said I won't be our internal affairs 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.780
 I will evaluate the overall whole team 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.510
 team lost no man 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:32.190
 lost volta hammered by all team 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.139
 people can take any result 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.940
 said I am responsible for the result for my 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.950
 players must meet the aura if they 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.019
 do not fall into an era for various reasons and 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.019
 not ready to play then better come and 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:47.280
 say it yes it we figure it out 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:49.680
 I think that successful successful replacement 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.700
 well, you're still on our commander is not an incentive to 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.650
 to of course score score 3 3 personally 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.600
 this one would all be over not only 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.400
 mbokani something to the bad left there 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.830
 about the ropes were moments just never 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:08.580
 hammer do not understand and everything is at the end of the canopies 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.080
 and bright as the ultro missed by max 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.620
 well dota 1 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.220
 the transfer was to further human somknite 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.440
 second point too 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.410
 transfer of an elephant and hit with 11 method 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.060
 to head scoring care and yet not 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.630
 our focus on the cold grow and 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.460
 even call 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:28.770
 this is all evil clearly all evil and will raise 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.540
 just called moments from all such 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.540
 moments and score how we want to play 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.860
 oz paper 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:41.650
 why didn't we get scored all thanks 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:45.550
 object shadow supported us not trying 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:51.490
 why can't it all come to 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:55.479
 fans and iran for them and i think on 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:58.449
 a couple of games to choose either then I will 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:04.590
 I think for fans ira really 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:06.789
 was interesting is a nightmare for us 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.210
 really created a lot of moment and 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:14.560
 before the break was supposed to go on 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.479
 with a bigger bill made not 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.430
 forced if I may say so mistakes 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.759
 which influenced the results at the end 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.530
 us even 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:26.289
 certainly dissatisfaction with 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:30.099
 the result is not the satisfaction of the whole of 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:34.750
 games although I think that if you take it 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:37.940
 super this we spent very well 2 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:42.100
 somewhere failed to fail by 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.100
 the replacement players 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:51.830
 let's just say no additional forces 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:55.380
 the first replacement was forced because 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:58.360
 what was already a yellow card commit 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.250
 came released onion 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.960
 I can say that he dropped it and 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.580
 Claims principle wishes for 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:10.150
 dedication show me enough 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:12.910
 it was hard well, somehow I didnâ€™t 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.070
 there was an increase in the sky population well 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.750
 psychological state is definitely 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.550
 is not at the highest level but 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.070
 the question is more psychological 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.610
 condition and more all the same in a relationship 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.610
 I think 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.840
 in relation to the players to their football as 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.270
 to such 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.240
 because you need to love all the same football 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:37.720
 in itself not football not to drag 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.820
 a blanket to your side do not be offended when 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.530
 someone plays today and someone does not play 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.720
 and going out to replace strengthen the game 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.750
 teams, but it turns out so interesting 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.250
 the story when there is one composition here 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.710
 they fall composition for some 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:55.600
 objective reasons 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:58.060
 Feels like coaching 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.740
 offended then comes the next game 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.840
 does not show that level of the game which 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:05.040
 need to show it so here it goes to 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.330
 it is already 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.919
 string stretches long enough 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.650
 there are players 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:13.720
 I can say that we have enough 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:17.730
 strong players but so teams to 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.730
 unfortunately
