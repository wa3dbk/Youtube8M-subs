about bowling ball surfaces but not a

about bowling ball surfaces but not a

bowler why is it so important it's

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.000 
bowler why is it so important it's
actually<00:00:39.730> rather<00:00:39.880> simple<00:00:40.420> I'm<00:00:41.380> sure<00:00:41.650> a<00:00:41.680> few<00:00:41.950> of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
actually rather simple I'm sure a few of

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.560 
actually rather simple I'm sure a few of
the<00:00:42.130> manufacturers<00:00:42.760> out<00:00:42.910> there<00:00:42.970> think<00:00:43.420> that

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
the manufacturers out there think that

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.119 
the manufacturers out there think that
this<00:00:43.690> is<00:00:43.750> a<00:00:43.960> little<00:00:44.320> too<00:00:44.500> simple<00:00:44.710> of<00:00:44.980> an

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
this is a little too simple of an

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.610 
this is a little too simple of an
explanation<00:00:45.430> but<00:00:46.120> in<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:46.960> long<00:00:47.140> run<00:00:47.170> I<00:00:47.590> think

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
explanation but in the long run I think

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.400 
explanation but in the long run I think
it'll<00:00:47.920> do<00:00:48.129> is<00:00:48.250> good<00:00:48.430> for<00:00:48.610> this<00:00:48.730> video<00:00:49.410> there

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
it'll do is good for this video there

under a microscope it's actually going

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.310 
under a microscope it's actually going
to<00:01:40.960> look<00:01:41.110> like<00:01:41.140> this<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:43.450> ball<00:01:43.660> surface<00:01:44.110> has

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
to look like this the ball surface has

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.560 
to look like this the ball surface has
peaks<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:44.770> valleys<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:46.030> peaks<00:01:46.270> are<00:01:46.420> right

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
peaks and valleys the peaks are right

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.760

here<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.900> valleys<00:01:47.230> are<00:01:47.380> down<00:01:47.560> there

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
here the valleys are down there

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.710 
here the valleys are down there
depending<00:01:48.580> on<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.790> grid<00:01:49.060> of<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.540> bowling

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.850 
are higher it is very important to keep
those<00:01:57.730> because<00:01:58.270> every<00:01:58.810> time<00:01:58.840> you<00:01:59.170> go<00:01:59.320> bowling

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
those because every time you go bowling

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.800 
those because every time you go bowling
and<00:02:00.100> you<00:02:00.460> roll<00:02:00.730> over<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:01.180> surface<00:02:01.510> of<00:02:01.630> that

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
and you roll over the surface of that

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.900 
and you roll over the surface of that
ball<00:02:02.050> you're<00:02:02.650> actually<00:02:02.890> breaking<00:02:03.280> off<00:02:03.640> some

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
ball you're actually breaking off some

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.900 
ball you're actually breaking off some
of<00:02:03.940> those<00:02:04.090> Peaks<00:02:04.480> and<00:02:04.950> with<00:02:05.950> all<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.220> oils<00:02:06.640> and

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
of those Peaks and with all the oils and

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.359 
of those Peaks and with all the oils and
grease<00:02:07.510> and<00:02:07.870> even<00:02:08.259> dust<00:02:08.530> that<00:02:08.769> settles<00:02:09.099> on<00:02:09.250> the

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
grease and even dust that settles on the

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.720 
grease and even dust that settles on the
lanes<00:02:09.519> the<00:02:10.300> valleys<00:02:10.750> fill<00:02:11.110> in<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:12.489> what

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
lanes the valleys fill in so what

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.160 
lanes the valleys fill in so what
happens<00:02:13.120> is<00:02:13.269> that<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:13.569> starts<00:02:13.840> looking<00:02:13.989> like

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
happens is that it starts looking like

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.839 
happens is that it starts looking like
this<00:02:14.470> I'm<00:02:14.650> going<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.860> use<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.069> red<00:02:15.370> marker<00:02:15.810> and

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
this I'm going to use a red marker and

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.990 
this I'm going to use a red marker and
the<00:02:18.849> peaks<00:02:19.390> start<00:02:20.110> breaking<00:02:20.440> off<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
the peaks start breaking off and the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.259 
the peaks start breaking off and the
valleys<00:02:22.560> start<00:02:23.560> filling<00:02:23.920> in<00:02:24.150> depending<00:02:25.150> on

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
valleys start filling in depending on

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.960 
valleys start filling in depending on
the<00:02:25.390> grip<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:25.930> your<00:02:26.290> bowling<00:02:26.709> ball<00:02:26.970> those

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
the grip of your bowling ball those

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.910 
the grip of your bowling ball those
valleys<00:02:28.390> are<00:02:28.510> gonna<00:02:28.599> be<00:02:28.750> deeper<00:02:29.110> or<00:02:29.709> some<00:02:29.890> of

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
valleys are gonna be deeper or some of

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.550 
valleys are gonna be deeper or some of
those<00:02:30.040> pics<00:02:30.250> are<00:02:30.310> gonna<00:02:30.489> be<00:02:30.550> hired

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
those pics are gonna be hired

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.650 
those pics are gonna be hired
but<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.430> surface<00:02:32.819> doesn't<00:02:33.209> stay<00:02:33.330> like<00:02:33.510> that

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
but that surface doesn't stay like that

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.170 
but that surface doesn't stay like that
forever<00:02:34.430> every<00:02:35.430> time<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.700> roll<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:36.030> ball

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
forever every time you roll the ball

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.910 
forever every time you roll the ball
you're<00:02:36.569> going<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.750> break<00:02:36.930> off<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.380> peaks<00:02:37.590> and

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
you're going to break off the peaks and

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.550 
you're going to break off the peaks and
you're<00:02:38.550> going<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.700> fill<00:02:38.940> in<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.209> valleys<00:02:39.560> the

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
you're going to fill in the valleys the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.640 
you're going to fill in the valleys the
lane<00:02:40.800> has<00:02:41.130> oil<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:43.020> back<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.410> bowling

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
lane has oil the back of the bowling

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.880 
lane has oil the back of the bowling
center<00:02:43.920> has<00:02:44.099> dirt<00:02:44.700> grease<00:02:45.209> grime<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.020> of

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
center has dirt grease grime and of

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.620 
center has dirt grease grime and of
course<00:02:47.160> there's<00:02:47.430> dust<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.940> settles<00:02:48.239> on<00:02:48.420> that

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
course there's dust that settles on that

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.990 
course there's dust that settles on that
oil<00:02:48.780> on<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.170> legs<00:02:49.349> so<00:02:50.040> these<00:02:50.400> valleys<00:02:50.849> are

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
oil on the legs so these valleys are

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.520 
oil on the legs so these valleys are
going<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.180> fill<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.930> peaks<00:02:52.170> are<00:02:52.319> going<00:02:52.470> to

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
going to fill the peaks are going to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.100 
going to fill the peaks are going to
break<00:02:52.709> off<00:02:52.920> eventually<00:02:53.819> over<00:02:54.390> time<00:02:54.420> as<00:02:54.900> you

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
break off eventually over time as you

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.370 
break off eventually over time as you
ball<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:56.160> end<00:02:56.340> up<00:02:56.489> with<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.599> surface<00:02:58.019> that<00:02:58.230> no

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
ball you end up with the surface that no

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.530 
ball you end up with the surface that no
longer<00:02:58.739> looks<00:02:59.010> like<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.580> surface<00:02:59.790> when<00:03:00.450> the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
longer looks like the surface when the

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.270 
longer looks like the surface when the
ball<00:03:00.660> was<00:03:00.780> new<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.170> this<00:03:01.290> happens<00:03:01.620> within<00:03:01.769> 15

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
ball was new and this happens within 15

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.420 
ball was new and this happens within 15
games<00:03:02.690> now<00:03:03.690> let's<00:03:03.930> say<00:03:04.049> we<00:03:04.319> don't<00:03:04.769> provide<00:03:05.130> the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
games now let's say we don't provide the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.979 
games now let's say we don't provide the
ball<00:03:05.549> with<00:03:05.730> any<00:03:05.940> maintenance<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.630> surface

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
ball with any maintenance of the surface

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.759 
ball with any maintenance of the surface
and<00:03:07.200> we<00:03:08.010> ball<00:03:08.190> another<00:03:08.459> 15<00:03:08.910> 20<00:03:09.090> games<00:03:09.769> now

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
and we ball another 15 20 games now

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.470 
and we ball another 15 20 games now
those<00:03:11.010> Peaks<00:03:11.310> don't<00:03:11.610> look<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.000> sharp<00:03:12.269> and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
those Peaks don't look so sharp and

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.120 
those Peaks don't look so sharp and
they're<00:03:12.660> not<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:13.049> tall<00:03:13.290> anymore<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:13.860> diwali

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
they're not so tall anymore and diwali

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.970 
they're not so tall anymore and diwali
start<00:03:14.580> filling<00:03:14.940> in<00:03:15.319> well<00:03:16.319> when<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.590> go<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.769> the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
start filling in well when you go to the

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.800 
start filling in well when you go to the
next<00:03:17.190> stake<00:03:17.489> and<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.760> boil<00:03:17.940> another<00:03:18.239> 20<00:03:18.599> 30

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
next stake and you boil another 20 30

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.900 
next stake and you boil another 20 30
games<00:03:19.110> now<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:19.830> have<00:03:20.040> just<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.370> bunch<00:03:20.549> of<00:03:20.640> lumps

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
games now you have just a bunch of lumps

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.280 
games now you have just a bunch of lumps
on<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.120> bowling<00:03:21.390> ball<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.569> it's<00:03:21.840> not<00:03:21.989> giving

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
on the bowling ball and it's not giving

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.860 
on the bowling ball and it's not giving
you<00:03:22.349> a<00:03:22.380> detraction<00:03:22.739> that<00:03:23.519> is<00:03:23.640> desired<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.390> grip

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
you a detraction that is desired to grip

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.140 
you a detraction that is desired to grip
the<00:03:25.019> lane<00:03:25.200> on<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.410> oil<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.950> make<00:03:26.310> I'd<00:03:26.819> make

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
the lane on the oil and make I'd make

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.059 
the lane on the oil and make I'd make
the<00:03:27.239> strikes<00:03:27.480> happen<00:03:27.840> well<00:03:28.650> let's<00:03:28.890> boil

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
the strikes happen well let's boil

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.710 
the strikes happen well let's boil
another<00:03:29.370> 20<00:03:29.700> 30<00:03:29.940> games<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.450> guess<00:03:30.540> what

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
another 20 30 games and guess what

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.440 
another 20 30 games and guess what
you're<00:03:31.319> vulnerable<00:03:31.500> flatlines<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:33.060> now<00:03:33.209> have

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
you're vulnerable flatlines you now have

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.000 
you're vulnerable flatlines you now have
a<00:03:33.480> two<00:03:33.720> hundred<00:03:33.780> fifty<00:03:34.170> dollar<00:03:34.500> bowling<00:03:34.739> ball

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
a two hundred fifty dollar bowling ball

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.250 
a two hundred fifty dollar bowling ball
or<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:35.519> depending<00:03:35.910> on<00:03:35.940> what<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.269> want<00:03:36.480> that

has a flat line surface to it you have

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.720 
has a flat line surface to it you have
no<00:03:39.810> traction<00:03:40.049> no<00:03:40.560> friction<00:03:41.040> you<00:03:41.489> start

no traction no friction you start

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.610
