00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.050 
like that just when you try and actually
get<00:01:39.630> them<00:01:39.780> off<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.430> pretty<00:01:41.670> good<00:01:41.759> case

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
get them off so it's a pretty good case

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.950 
get them off so it's a pretty good case
for<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.540> for<00:01:42.780> building<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.689> stick

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
for that for building on you can stick

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.899 
for that for building on you can stick
cloth<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.409> there<00:01:46.590> if<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.770> want<00:01:46.979> who's<00:01:47.790> gonna

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
cloth on there if we want who's gonna

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.170 
cloth on there if we want who's gonna
want<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.180> stick<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.509> their<00:01:48.720> pocket<00:01:50.180> but

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
want to stick that in their pocket but

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.030 
want to stick that in their pocket but
yeah<00:01:51.329> let's<00:01:51.810> go<00:01:51.960> ahead<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.229> try<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.470> see<00:01:52.740> how

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
yeah let's go ahead and try and see how

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.649 
yeah let's go ahead and try and see how
regular<00:01:53.640> means<00:01:53.880> let's<00:01:54.149> go<00:01:54.270> ahead<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.540> put

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
regular means let's go ahead and put

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.410 
regular means let's go ahead and put
this<00:01:54.750> minifigure<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.250> Emmet<00:01:57.060> from

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
this minifigure on this is Emmet from

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.969 
this minifigure on this is Emmet from
lego<00:01:58.200> movie<00:01:58.409> and<00:02:00.409> yeah<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.439> think<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.829> would

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
lego movie and yeah I think you would

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.219 
lego movie and yeah I think you would
pretty<00:02:02.369> much<00:02:02.460> come<00:02:02.850> right<00:02:03.030> off<00:02:03.060> going<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.110> out

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
pretty much come right off going in out

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.149 
pretty much come right off going in out
of<00:02:04.380> your<00:02:04.469> pocket

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
of your pocket

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.380 
of your pocket
so<00:02:05.369> probably<00:02:05.759> not<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.939> best<00:02:06.000> thing<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.329> to

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
so probably not the best thing you to

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.320 
so probably not the best thing you to
put<00:02:06.540> minifigures<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.140> there<00:02:07.789> that<00:02:08.789> means<00:02:09.000> said

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
put minifigures on there that means said

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.969 
put minifigures on there that means said
you<00:02:09.450> can<00:02:09.599> do<00:02:09.810> tons<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.259> other<00:02:10.410> stuff<00:02:10.440> with<00:02:10.800> this

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
you can do tons of other stuff with this

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.340 
you can do tons of other stuff with this
great<00:02:11.750> customisable<00:02:12.750> case<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.170> know

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
this case is going to get an 8 I just

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.400 
this case is going to get an 8 I just
feel<00:02:36.210> like<00:02:36.270> it<00:02:36.450> doesn't<00:02:36.720> protect<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> phone

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
feel like it doesn't protect the phone

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.400 
feel like it doesn't protect the phone
all<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:38.040> well<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.580> think<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.210> could<00:02:39.870> do<00:02:40.350> a

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
all that well I think you could do a

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.110 
all that well I think you could do a
little<00:02:40.500> bit<00:02:40.650> better<00:02:40.800> especially<00:02:40.980> down<00:02:41.430> here
