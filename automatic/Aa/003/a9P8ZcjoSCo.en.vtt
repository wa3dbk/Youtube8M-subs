00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.400
 insofar as I would now 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.580
 reminded everyone or told 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.370
 a little story about how i met 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.370
 totally young boy whom 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.430
 led dad to one of the contests i then 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.370
 the jury was also there and when I heard 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.730
 his voice I went backstage and asked 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.340

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:15.060

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.250
