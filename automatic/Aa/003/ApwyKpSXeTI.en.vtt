one time it just lays down on the water

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.120

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
doesn't rust and it's just never a

doesn't rust and it's just never a
problem<00:02:22.740> now<00:02:23.370> if<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:23.700> don't<00:02:23.910> have<00:02:24.120> one<00:02:24.300> of

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
problem now if you don't have one of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.230 
problem now if you don't have one of
these<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.630> can<00:02:25.020> still<00:02:25.380> can<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.550> have<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:27.060> keep

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
these you can still can you have to keep

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.000 
these you can still can you have to keep
your<00:02:27.450> jars<00:02:27.720> off<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.560> bottom<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
your jars off of the bottom of the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.880 
your jars off of the bottom of the
canner<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:29.670> another<00:02:29.970> way<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.240> do<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:30.990> to

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
canner so another way to do that is to

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.310 
canner so another way to do that is to
just<00:02:31.920> drop<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:32.880> dish<00:02:33.180> towel<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:33.600> there<00:02:33.810> I'm

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
just drop a dish towel in there I'm

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.020 
just drop a dish towel in there I'm
doing<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:34.860> one-handed<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.550> I<00:02:35.580> can't<00:02:35.820> really

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
doing this one-handed so I can't really

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.400 
doing this one-handed so I can't really
spread<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:36.390> out<00:02:36.480> like<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.780> should<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.170> it's<00:02:37.320> a

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
spread it out like I should and it's a

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.750 
spread it out like I should and it's a
little<00:02:37.560> difficult<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:38.130> wants<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.460> float<00:02:38.670> in

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
little difficult it wants to float in

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.850 
little difficult it wants to float in
the<00:02:38.820> water<00:02:38.850> at<00:02:39.180> first<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:40.440> press<00:02:40.680> it

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
the water at first but you just press it

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.290 
the water at first but you just press it
down<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.250> cover<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.610> bottom<00:02:41.850> of<00:02:41.910> your<00:02:42.030> canner

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
down to cover the bottom of your canner

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.240 
down to cover the bottom of your canner
and<00:02:42.540> then<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.780> can<00:02:42.930> put<00:02:43.110> your<00:02:43.140> jars<00:02:43.530> on<00:02:43.860> that

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
and then you can put your jars on that

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.820 
and then you can put your jars on that
and<00:02:44.550> can<00:02:44.790> safely<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.450> just<00:02:45.750> don't<00:02:45.990> want<00:02:46.260> your

jars to be in direct contact with the
bottom<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.350> pressure<00:02:49.620> canner<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.880> can

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
bottom of the pressure canner you can

bottom of the pressure canner you can
see<00:02:51.210> I'm<00:02:51.360> pointing<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.930> line<00:02:52.260> kind<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.710> a

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
see I'm pointing to a line kind of a

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.320 
see I'm pointing to a line kind of a
dark<00:02:53.040> line<00:02:53.280> in<00:02:53.460> there<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.760> can<00:02:53.850> see<00:02:53.880> pretty

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
dark line in there you can see pretty

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.080 
dark line in there you can see pretty
much<00:02:54.450> where<00:02:54.960> my<00:02:55.140> water<00:02:55.380> level<00:02:55.800> comes<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.370> came

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
much where my water level comes I came

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.940 
much where my water level comes I came
very<00:02:57.120> close<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.050> wall<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:58.350> can<00:02:58.710> see<00:02:58.830> the

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
very close to this wall you can see the

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.590 
very close to this wall you can see the
arrow<00:02:59.130> there<00:02:59.460> that's<00:02:59.760> where<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.090> put<00:03:00.240> the<00:03:00.390> lid

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
arrow there that's where you put the lid

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.630 
arrow there that's where you put the lid
on<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:01.080> make<00:03:01.590> sure<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.100> locked

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
on to make sure that it's locked

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.470 
on to make sure that it's locked

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.449 
water line is supposed to come when I
look<00:03:12.660> inside<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.080> canner<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:14.160> what<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.340> did

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
look inside the canner so what I did

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.400 
look inside the canner so what I did
with<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.790> very<00:03:15.090> sharp<00:03:15.330> knife<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.900> just<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.230> etch

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
with a very sharp knife is just to etch

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.470 
with a very sharp knife is just to etch
this<00:03:16.800> line<00:03:17.100> on<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.520> outside<00:03:17.700> of<00:03:18.090> my<00:03:18.120> pressure

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
this line on the outside of my pressure

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.229 
this line on the outside of my pressure
canner<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.070> when<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.100> feel<00:03:20.459> that<00:03:20.700> canner<00:03:20.940> with

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
canner and when I feel that canner with

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.810 
canner and when I feel that canner with
cold<00:03:21.540> water<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.900> begin<00:03:22.290> with<00:03:22.500> I<00:03:22.800> can<00:03:23.310> easily

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
cold water to begin with I can easily

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.930 
cold water to begin with I can easily
feel<00:03:24.380> feel<00:03:25.380> with<00:03:25.680> my<00:03:25.830> fingers<00:03:26.250> where<00:03:26.670> the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
feel feel with my fingers where the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.180 
feel feel with my fingers where the
water<00:03:27.150> level<00:03:27.510> is<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:28.020> if<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.590> is<00:03:28.709> up<00:03:28.860> to<00:03:29.010> that

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
water level is and if it is up to that

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.900 
water level is and if it is up to that
line<00:03:29.600> now<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:31.620> always<00:03:32.190> do<00:03:32.520> it<00:03:32.640> just<00:03:32.820> a<00:03:32.880> little

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
line now I always do it just a little

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.490 
line now I always do it just a little
below<00:03:33.330> that<00:03:33.360> because<00:03:33.660> once<00:03:34.020> you<00:03:34.170> put<00:03:34.470> your

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
below that because once you put your

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.990 
below that because once you put your
jars<00:03:34.800> in<00:03:34.980> it's<00:03:35.130> going<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.340> raise<00:03:35.580> that<00:03:35.610> level

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
jars in it's going to raise that level

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.479 
jars in it's going to raise that level
just<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.450> little<00:03:36.720> bit<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.110> it's<00:03:37.620> not<00:03:37.890> an<00:03:38.070> exact

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
just a little bit and it's not an exact

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.550 
just a little bit and it's not an exact
science<00:03:38.610> as<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.180> where<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.450> water<00:03:39.630> has<00:03:40.320> to<00:03:40.530> be

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
science as to where the water has to be

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.260 
science as to where the water has to be
so<00:03:40.920> if<00:03:41.040> you're<00:03:41.190> you<00:03:41.700> know<00:03:41.790> if<00:03:41.910> you're<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.060> little

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
so if you're you know if you're a little

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.760 
so if you're you know if you're a little
off<00:03:42.570> that's<00:03:42.900> great<00:03:43.170> your<00:03:43.320> water<00:03:43.530> at<00:03:43.709> a

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
off that's great your water at a

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.170 
off that's great your water at a
pressure<00:03:43.980> canner<00:03:44.190> certainly<00:03:44.730> should<00:03:44.910> not<00:03:45.030> be

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
pressure canner certainly should not be

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.180 
pressure canner certainly should not be
covering<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.660> jars<00:03:45.959> but<00:03:46.590> if<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:46.800> edge<00:03:46.950> this

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
covering the jars but if you edge this

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.949 
covering the jars but if you edge this
little<00:03:47.489> line<00:03:47.670> in<00:03:47.700> your<00:03:47.940> canner<00:03:48.209> it's<00:03:48.420> really

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
little line in your canner it's really

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.210 
little line in your canner it's really
easy<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.410> know<00:03:49.500> if<00:03:49.650> you're<00:03:49.769> about<00:03:49.950> at<00:03:50.130> the

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
easy to know if you're about at the

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.490 
easy to know if you're about at the
right<00:03:50.370> spot<00:03:50.670> or<00:03:50.700> not<00:03:50.840> anyway<00:03:51.840> hope<00:03:52.110> this<00:03:52.260> helps

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
right spot or not anyway hope this helps

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.820 
right spot or not anyway hope this helps
you<00:03:52.560> out<00:03:52.650> cat's<00:03:53.550> cradle
