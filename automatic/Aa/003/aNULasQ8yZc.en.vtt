month I just didn't apply it because it

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.020

eye<00:01:33.880> so<00:01:34.540> I<00:01:34.570> was<00:01:34.780> kind<00:01:35.020> of<00:01:35.049> nervous<00:01:35.200> that<00:01:35.710> if<00:01:36.220> I

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
eye so I was kind of nervous that if I

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:37.710

tics<00:01:38.170> mouth<00:01:38.409> parts<00:01:38.799> might<00:01:38.979> stay<00:01:39.310> in<00:01:39.340> her<00:01:39.549> skin

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
tics mouth parts might stay in her skin

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.090 
tics mouth parts might stay in her skin
and<00:01:40.119> then<00:01:40.689> it<00:01:40.810> could<00:01:40.930> get<00:01:41.080> infected<00:01:41.350> inflamed

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
and then it could get infected inflamed

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.070 
and then it could get infected inflamed
and<00:01:42.430> it's<00:01:42.549> painful<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:43.210> it's<00:01:43.600> kind<00:01:43.869> of<00:01:43.900> close

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
or 30 seconds I noticed and here's a

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.160 
or 30 seconds I noticed and here's a
ticker<00:02:06.100> here<00:02:06.520> kind<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.479> shriveling<00:02:08.049> up

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
ticker here kind of shriveling up

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.880 
ticker here kind of shriveling up
already<00:02:08.970> within<00:02:09.970> about<00:02:10.090> 15-20<00:02:10.959> seconds<00:02:11.410> the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
already within about 15-20 seconds the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.370 
already within about 15-20 seconds the
tick<00:02:12.130> just<00:02:12.160> released<00:02:12.820> let<00:02:13.570> go<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.019> fell<00:02:14.230> to

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
tick just released let go and fell to

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.550 
tick just released let go and fell to
the<00:02:14.500> ground<00:02:14.579> and<00:02:15.579> that<00:02:15.940> was<00:02:16.030> pretty<00:02:16.150> much<00:02:16.269> it

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
the ground and that was pretty much it

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.229 
the ground and that was pretty much it
so<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.680> dog<00:02:17.890> as<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:18.250> can<00:02:18.430> see<00:02:18.640> there's<00:02:19.030> really

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
so the dog as you can see there's really

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.819 
so the dog as you can see there's really
no<00:02:19.480> swelling<00:02:19.780> I<00:02:20.140> mean<00:02:20.500> there's<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.709> little

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
no swelling I mean there's a little

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.860 
no swelling I mean there's a little
something<00:02:21.280> here<00:02:21.519> left<00:02:22.120> over<00:02:22.450> from<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.690> bite

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
something here left over from the bite

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.170 
something here left over from the bite
so<00:02:23.739> that's<00:02:23.920> where<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.220> tick<00:02:24.400> lights<00:02:24.640> on<00:02:24.940> and

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
so that's where the tick lights on and

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.509 
so that's where the tick lights on and
all<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.870> mouth<00:02:26.049> parts<00:02:26.500> are<00:02:26.620> intact<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.250> the

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
all the mouth parts are intact and the

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.199 
all the mouth parts are intact and the
tick<00:02:28.350> has<00:02:29.350> been<00:02:29.650> dispatched<00:02:30.070> took<00:02:30.730> about<00:02:30.940> two

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
tick has been dispatched took about two

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.950 
tick has been dispatched took about two
hours<00:02:31.239> but<00:02:31.810> he<00:02:31.959> has<00:02:32.109> now<00:02:32.350> passed<00:02:32.650> away

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
hours but he has now passed away

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.720 
hours but he has now passed away
now<00:02:34.960> many<00:02:35.200> things<00:02:35.290> disgust<00:02:36.010> me<00:02:36.220> or<00:02:36.370> get<00:02:36.520> under

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
now many things disgust me or get under

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.760 
now many things disgust me or get under
my<00:02:36.880> skin<00:02:36.910> but<00:02:37.360> this<00:02:38.080> thing<00:02:38.350> looks<00:02:38.500> pretty

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
my skin but this thing looks pretty

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.260 
my skin but this thing looks pretty
nasty<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.460> he<00:02:40.420> was<00:02:40.540> still<00:02:40.750> walking<00:02:41.170> around

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
nasty and he was still walking around

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.120 
nasty and he was still walking around
even<00:02:43.270> though<00:02:43.420> he<00:02:43.750> was<00:02:43.870> in<00:02:43.900> gorged<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.740> I<00:02:45.070> don't

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
even though he was in gorged and I don't

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.500 
even though he was in gorged and I don't
think<00:02:45.280> this<00:02:45.490> is<00:02:45.520> fully<00:02:45.820> engorged<00:02:46.150> cuz<00:02:46.420> I've

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
think this is fully engorged cuz I've

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.330 
think this is fully engorged cuz I've
seen<00:02:46.690> ones<00:02:46.870> bigger<00:02:47.050> than<00:02:47.260> this<00:02:47.380> even<00:02:48.250> though

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
seen ones bigger than this even though

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.680 
seen ones bigger than this even though
he<00:02:48.490> was<00:02:48.610> engorged<00:02:49.120> he<00:02:49.240> was<00:02:49.360> still<00:02:49.570> like

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
he was engorged he was still like

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.330 
he was engorged he was still like
walking<00:02:50.110> around<00:02:50.230> he<00:02:50.530> was<00:02:50.620> able<00:02:50.740> to<00:02:50.920> walk<00:02:51.130> on<00:02:51.160> a

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
walking around he was able to walk on a

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.430 
walking around he was able to walk on a
side<00:02:51.610> it's<00:02:52.030> pretty<00:02:52.210> impressive<00:02:52.450> nature<00:02:53.050> yeah

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
side it's pretty impressive nature yeah

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.470 
side it's pretty impressive nature yeah
so<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.190> that's<00:02:54.610> how<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:54.820> removed<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.270> tick

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
so and that's how I removed the tick

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.390 
so and that's how I removed the tick
from<00:02:55.660> April<00:02:56.050> and<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.650> think<00:02:56.920> this<00:02:57.040> would<00:02:57.220> help

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
from April and I think this would help

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.970 
from April and I think this would help
out<00:02:57.520> a<00:02:57.550> lot<00:02:57.730> of<00:02:57.850> people<00:02:58.150> because<00:02:58.510> I<00:02:58.770> put<00:02:59.770> gloves

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
out a lot of people because I put gloves

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.740 
out a lot of people because I put gloves
on<00:03:00.160> just<00:03:00.430> for<00:03:00.580> safety<00:03:00.940> but<00:03:01.090> in<00:03:01.240> reality<00:03:01.390> I

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
on just for safety but in reality I

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.080 
on just for safety but in reality I
never<00:03:02.020> touched<00:03:02.290> a<00:03:02.440> tick<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:02.920> never<00:03:03.580> had<00:03:03.820> to<00:03:03.970> do
