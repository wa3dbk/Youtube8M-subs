squats

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.109 
squats
I<00:01:32.900> wouldn't<00:01:33.830> necessarily<00:01:34.280> use<00:01:34.430> these<00:01:34.850> shoes

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
I wouldn't necessarily use these shoes

I wouldn't necessarily use these shoes
for<00:01:35.390> deadlifts<00:01:35.930> because<00:01:36.229> you<00:01:36.320> want<00:01:36.530> fairly

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
for deadlifts because you want fairly

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.710 
for deadlifts because you want fairly
flat<00:01:37.189> feet<00:01:37.520> it's<00:01:38.000> almost<00:01:38.119> best<00:01:38.479> to<00:01:38.600> do

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
flat feet it's almost best to do

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.960 
flat feet it's almost best to do
deadlifts<00:01:39.140> barefoot<00:01:39.619> but<00:01:40.340> you<00:01:40.610> know<00:01:40.909> you

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
deadlifts barefoot but you know you

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.789 
deadlifts barefoot but you know you
could<00:01:41.180> use<00:01:41.390> these<00:01:41.540> for<00:01:41.600> deadlifts<00:01:42.200> but

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
could use these for deadlifts but

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:43.810 
could use these for deadlifts but
they're<00:01:42.950> great<00:01:43.189> for<00:01:43.340> doing<00:01:43.460> things<00:01:43.700> like

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
they're great for doing things like

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.840 
they're great for doing things like
squats<00:01:44.530> snatches<00:01:45.530> all<00:01:45.770> kinds<00:01:46.130> of<00:01:46.220> over<00:01:46.729> the

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
squats snatches all kinds of over the

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.530 
head you know picking the ground picking
the<00:01:48.890> weight<00:01:49.009> up<00:01:49.220> when<00:01:49.400> it's<00:01:49.549> up<00:01:49.759> on<00:01:49.970> your<00:01:50.330> back

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
the weight up when it's up on your back

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.890 
the weight up when it's up on your back
type<00:01:50.930> of<00:01:51.049> exercises<00:01:51.799> so<00:01:52.460> why<00:01:53.180> are<00:01:53.420> these<00:01:53.600> shoes

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
type of exercises so why are these shoes

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.050 
type of exercises so why are these shoes
specifically<00:01:54.530> better<00:01:54.740> for<00:01:55.340> doing<00:01:55.640> a<00:01:55.820> variety

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
specifically better for doing a variety

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.789 
specifically better for doing a variety
of<00:01:56.240> things<00:01:56.479> well<00:01:56.750> these<00:01:57.020> are<00:01:57.259> good<00:01:57.409> because

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
of things well these are good because

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.890 
of things well these are good because
they're<00:01:58.009> lightweight<00:01:58.329> they're<00:01:59.329> flexible

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
they're lightweight they're flexible

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.280 
they're lightweight they're flexible
they<00:02:00.650> have<00:02:00.860> zero<00:02:01.540> angle<00:02:02.540> so<00:02:02.810> they're<00:02:02.960> flat

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
they have zero angle so they're flat

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.899 
they have zero angle so they're flat
they're<00:02:03.560> completely<00:02:03.920> fat<00:02:04.220> flat<00:02:04.549> they<00:02:04.700> don't

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
they're completely fat flat they don't

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.090 
they're completely fat flat they don't
raise<00:02:05.119> up<00:02:05.360> in<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.570> back<00:02:05.780> so<00:02:06.470> they're<00:02:06.680> kind<00:02:07.009> of

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
raise up in the back so they're kind of

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.889 
raise up in the back so they're kind of
basically<00:02:07.610> as<00:02:07.880> if<00:02:08.060> you're<00:02:08.269> doing<00:02:08.600> your

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
basically as if you're doing your

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.140 
basically as if you're doing your
activity<00:02:09.410> is<00:02:09.530> barefoot<00:02:10.009> as<00:02:10.100> possible<00:02:10.640> so

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
activity is barefoot as possible so

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.479 
activity is barefoot as possible so
you're<00:02:11.269> getting<00:02:11.570> as<00:02:11.690> much<00:02:12.290> of<00:02:12.590> your<00:02:13.010> foot<00:02:13.340> on

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
you're getting as much of your foot on

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.090 
you're getting as much of your foot on
the<00:02:14.030> ground<00:02:14.290> similar<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.590> like<00:02:15.739> I<00:02:15.769> said<00:02:16.010> is

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
the ground similar to it like I said is

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.410 
the ground similar to it like I said is
if<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.310> were<00:02:16.430> barefoot<00:02:16.700> you're<00:02:17.030> not<00:02:17.180> going<00:02:17.360> to

if you were barefoot you're not going to

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.900 
if you were barefoot you're not going to
get<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.600> lot<00:02:17.870> of<00:02:17.900> flex<00:02:18.709> in<00:02:18.919> the<00:02:18.950> shoe<00:02:19.280> there's

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
little bit it actually brings your

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.830

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
weight will come down straight over your

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.370 
weight will come down straight over your
heel<00:04:04.549> as<00:04:04.760> opposed<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.510> if<00:04:05.630> your<00:04:05.780> foot<00:04:06.019> is<00:04:06.049> like

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
heel as opposed to if your foot is like

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.440 
heel as opposed to if your foot is like
this<00:04:06.650> it<00:04:07.280> actually<00:04:07.549> pushes<00:04:08.120> you<00:04:08.239> forward

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
believe it or not it's almost the

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.470 
believe it or not it's almost the

shoe doing the squat and the weight

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.050 
shoe doing the squat and the weight
definitely<00:04:18.739> carries<00:04:19.400> backwards<00:04:19.880> and<00:04:19.970> what

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
definitely carries backwards and what

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.310

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
squat it's a better technique so it's a

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.409 
squat it's a better technique so it's a

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
good way to learn alright so that's

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.240 
good way to learn alright so that's
pretty<00:04:35.510> much<00:04:35.990> it<00:04:36.260> you<00:04:36.530> can<00:04:36.650> see<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.950> total
