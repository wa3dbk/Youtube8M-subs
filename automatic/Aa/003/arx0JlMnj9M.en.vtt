00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.560 

so<00:00:01.610> generally<00:00:02.610> what<00:00:02.730> you<00:00:02.909> want<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.210> do<00:00:03.389> in

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
so generally what you want to do in

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.860 
so generally what you want to do in
cases<00:00:03.990> where<00:00:04.350> you<00:00:04.560> want<00:00:04.890> something<00:00:05.549> to

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:05.870 
cases where you want something to

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.410 
cases where you want something to
collide<00:00:06.870> in<00:00:07.140> and<00:00:07.379> work<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.730> have<00:00:08.849> two<00:00:09.000> two

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
collide in and work is you have two two

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.570 
collide in and work is you have two two
choices<00:00:09.660> you<00:00:09.840> can<00:00:09.960> either<00:00:10.170> do<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.710> collision

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
choices you can either do a collision

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.789 
choices you can either do a collision
object<00:00:12.019> which<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.259> case<00:00:13.320> won't<00:00:13.620> work

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
object which in this case won't work

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:14.959 
object which in this case won't work
because<00:00:13.980> it's<00:00:14.190> not<00:00:14.340> going<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.519> be<00:00:14.580> driven<00:00:14.759> by

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
because it's not going to be driven by

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.880 
because it's not going to be driven by
dynamics<00:00:15.599> specifically<00:00:16.289> it's<00:00:16.440> just<00:00:16.619> going<00:00:16.830> to

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
dynamics specifically it's just going to

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.340 
dynamics specifically it's just going to
collide<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.460> be<00:00:17.640> an<00:00:18.119> immovable<00:00:18.420> object<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.289> to

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
collide and be an immovable object so to

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.800 
collide and be an immovable object so to
speak<00:00:19.640> but<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.730> can<00:00:20.850> also<00:00:20.970> do<00:00:21.150> cloth<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.600> cloth

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
speak but you can also do cloth to cloth

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.310 
speak but you can also do cloth to cloth
objects<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:23.269> in<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.330> case<00:00:24.570> I'm<00:00:25.109> going<00:00:25.170> to

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
objects so in this case I'm going to

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.750 
objects so in this case I'm going to
bring<00:00:25.439> these<00:00:25.619> down<00:00:25.890> because<00:00:26.340> they<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.580> just

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
bring these down because they can just

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.970 
bring these down because they can just
be<00:00:26.849> very<00:00:27.060> simple<00:00:27.330> forms<00:00:27.930> what<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.529> want<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.859> do

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
be very simple forms what I want to do

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:39.560 
be very simple forms what I want to do
is<00:00:29.010> give<00:00:29.310> them<00:00:35.930> select<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.140> geosphere<00:00:38.570> and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
is give them select the geosphere and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.130 
is give them select the geosphere and
I'm<00:00:40.350> going<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.530> make<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.829> very<00:00:40.860> primitive<00:00:42.140> now

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
I'm going to make it very primitive now

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.450 
I'm going to make it very primitive now
with<00:00:44.010> regards<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.520> cloth<00:00:45.090> effects<00:00:45.450> itself<00:00:46.460> go

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
with regards to cloth effects itself go

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.340 
with regards to cloth effects itself go
into<00:00:47.610> my<00:00:47.700> object<00:00:48.149> properties<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.780> add<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.230> 2

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
into my object properties and add the 2

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.639 
into my object properties and add the 2
Geo<00:00:49.620> spheres<00:00:50.539> tell<00:00:51.539> them<00:00:51.750> both<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.320> cloth

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
Geo spheres tell them both to be cloth

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.830 
Geo spheres tell them both to be cloth
but<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.100> want<00:00:53.370> them<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.699> essentially<00:00:54.449> rigid

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
but I want them to be essentially rigid

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.569 
but I want them to be essentially rigid
so<00:00:55.140> they<00:00:55.530> really<00:00:55.710> don't<00:00:55.949> want<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.129> bend<00:00:56.370> they

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
so they really don't want to bend they

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.700 
so they really don't want to bend they
don't<00:00:56.760> want<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.969> stretch<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.620> they're<00:00:58.620> going

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
don't want to stretch and they're going

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.490 
don't want to stretch and they're going
to<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:59.210> so<00:01:00.210> I'm<00:01:00.329> going<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.480> boost<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.289> up

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
to be so I'm going to boost this up

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.350 
to be so I'm going to boost this up
really<00:01:01.800> high<00:01:03.500> stretch<00:01:04.500> value<00:01:07.250> sharing<00:01:08.360> I'm

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
really high stretch value sharing I'm

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.420 
really high stretch value sharing I'm
going<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> tell<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> use<00:01:09.990> edge<00:01:10.170> springs<00:01:10.619> and

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
going to tell it to use edge springs and

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.950 
going to tell it to use edge springs and
what<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.150> allow<00:01:12.299> me<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.600> do<00:01:12.840> is

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
what this is going to allow me to do is

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.780 
what this is going to allow me to do is
it's<00:01:13.110> going<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.950> really<00:01:14.100> kind<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.460> create

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
it's going to to really kind of create

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.719 
it's going to to really kind of create
much<00:01:15.090> more<00:01:15.119> stiff<00:01:15.780> cloth<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:17.460> I'm<00:01:17.549> going<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
much more stiff cloth and I'm going to

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.090 
much more stiff cloth and I'm going to
increase<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> repulsion<00:01:18.540> factor<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.830> that

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
increase the repulsion factor so that

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.630 
increase the repulsion factor so that
the<00:01:20.610> force<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.330> acting<00:01:21.650> to<00:01:22.650> push<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the force that is acting to push the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.609 
the force that is acting to push the
cloth<00:01:23.880> away<00:01:24.210> from<00:01:24.450> itself<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.530> be

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
cloth away from itself is going to be

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.469 
cloth away from itself is going to be
exceptionally<00:01:26.159> high<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:27.180> you've<00:01:27.299> got<00:01:27.330> a

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
exceptionally high so you've got a

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.420 
exceptionally high so you've got a
perfect<00:01:27.840> sphere<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.170> should<00:01:28.320> maintain<00:01:28.890> itself

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
perfect sphere it should maintain itself

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.190 
perfect sphere it should maintain itself
the<00:01:30.270> last<00:01:30.450> thing<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.659> want<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.869> do<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:30.990> adjust

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the last thing I want to do is adjust

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.069 
the last thing I want to do is adjust
the<00:01:31.530> overall<00:01:31.650> density<00:01:32.100> now<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.869> might<00:01:34.020> think

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
the overall density now you might think

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.170 
the overall density now you might think
you've<00:01:34.409> set<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.799> 50<00:01:35.100> or<00:01:35.220> 100<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.939> may<00:01:36.060> need

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
you've set it to 50 or 100 you may need

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.210 
you've set it to 50 or 100 you may need
to<00:01:36.240> play<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.840> value<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> little<00:01:37.409> bit<00:01:37.560> I'm

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
to play with this value a little bit I'm

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.670 
to play with this value a little bit I'm
to<00:01:38.759> know<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.090> value<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.479> 0<00:01:39.720> point<00:01:39.960> 35<00:01:40.409> for

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
to know that a value of 0 point 35 for

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.080 
to know that a value of 0 point 35 for
this<00:01:40.799> one<00:01:40.950> will<00:01:41.100> probably<00:01:41.250> work<00:01:41.670> out<00:01:41.850> pretty

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
this one will probably work out pretty

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:51.410 
this one will probably work out pretty
well<00:01:43.250> so<00:01:44.250> once<00:01:45.180> I've<00:01:45.360> got<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.600> set<00:01:50.030> let's<00:01:51.030> go

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
well so once I've got that set let's go

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.550 
well so once I've got that set let's go
and<00:01:52.280> now<00:01:53.280> I'm<00:01:53.399> going<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.610> attach<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.560> vertices

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
and now I'm going to attach the vertices

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.219 
and now I'm going to attach the vertices
for<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.070> for<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.549> bag<00:01:57.000> itself<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:58.110> an

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
for that for that bag itself to an

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.630 
for that for that bag itself to an
object<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> scene<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.250> let's<00:01:59.399> just<00:01:59.520> build

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
object in the scene so let's just build

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.600 
object in the scene so let's just build
a<00:01:59.820> quick<00:01:59.969> dummy

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.130 

and<00:02:03.350> back<00:02:04.350> within<00:02:04.560> here<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:05.010> group<00:02:06.080> now<00:02:07.080> I

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
and back within here this group now I

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.639 
and back within here this group now I
can<00:02:07.440> tell<00:02:07.620> it<00:02:07.800> to<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> node<00:02:09.289> I'm<00:02:10.289> going<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> pick

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
can tell it to a node I'm going to pick

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.260 
can tell it to a node I'm going to pick
the<00:02:10.800> dummy<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.550> these<00:02:11.670> vertices<00:02:12.030> are

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
the dummy so that these vertices are

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.630 
the dummy so that these vertices are
going<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.450> stay<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.800> thing<00:02:14.040> as<00:02:14.250> these

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
going to stay is this thing as these

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.950 
going to stay is this thing as these
actually<00:02:15.150> start<00:02:15.390> colliding<00:02:15.660> downward<00:02:17.870> so<00:02:18.870> now

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
actually start colliding downward so now

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.380 
actually start colliding downward so now
I<00:02:19.020> can<00:02:19.080> tell<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.650> simulate<00:02:23.090> those<00:02:24.090> don't

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
I can tell it to simulate those don't

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.920 
I can tell it to simulate those don't
seem<00:02:24.660> quite<00:02:27.230> quite<00:02:28.230> heavy<00:02:28.470> enough<00:02:29.840> so<00:02:30.840> I'll

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
seem quite quite heavy enough so I'll

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.260 
seem quite quite heavy enough so I'll
grab<00:02:31.140> both<00:02:31.410> those<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.070> let's<00:02:32.250> say<00:02:32.640> bring<00:02:33.150> it

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
grab both those and let's say bring it

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:42.170 
grab both those and let's say bring it
to<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:40.260> raise<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.620> simulation<00:02:41.220> simulate

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
to to to raise the simulation simulate

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:50.240 
to to to raise the simulation simulate
again<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:48.870> that's<00:02:49.110> not<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:49.800> maybe<00:02:49.980> we<00:02:50.130> do

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
again so that's not it so maybe we do

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.590 
again so that's not it so maybe we do
need<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.459> set<00:02:50.670> these<00:02:50.820> up<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:51.120> little<00:02:51.150> bit<00:02:51.420> higher

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
need to set these up a little bit higher

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:00.520 
need to set these up a little bit higher
now<00:02:52.610> let's<00:02:53.610> try<00:02:53.850> something<00:02:54.450> very<00:02:55.110> heavy<00:02:55.610> 20<00:02:56.610> I

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.160 

guess<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.739> might<00:03:01.950> actually<00:03:02.190> help<00:03:03.080> sorry<00:03:04.080> I'm

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
guess it might actually help sorry I'm

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.870 
guess it might actually help sorry I'm
working<00:03:04.440> on<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.530> short<00:03:04.770> screen<00:03:05.070> I<00:03:05.100> keep

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
working on a short screen I keep

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.250 
working on a short screen I keep
forgetting<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.330> don't<00:03:06.540> have<00:03:06.660> gravity<00:03:07.049> turned

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
forgetting I don't have gravity turned

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.990 
forgetting I don't have gravity turned
on<00:03:07.410> let's<00:03:07.620> go<00:03:07.769> back<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.190> set<00:03:08.370> this<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.790> where

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
on let's go back and set this to where

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.310 
on let's go back and set this to where
it<00:03:09.120> was<00:03:09.150> before<00:03:10.880> point<00:03:11.880> 35<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:14.420> see<00:03:15.420> how<00:03:18.320> there

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
it was before point 35 and see how there

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.199 
it was before point 35 and see how there
we<00:03:19.500> go<00:03:21.320> so<00:03:22.320> now<00:03:22.350> they're<00:03:22.950> really<00:03:23.850> they're

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
we go so now they're really they're

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.900 
we go so now they're really they're
actually<00:03:24.480> too<00:03:24.660> heavy<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:26.160> I'll<00:03:26.280> erase<00:03:26.640> that

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
actually too heavy so I'll erase that

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.360 
actually too heavy so I'll erase that
let's<00:03:27.480> move<00:03:27.660> back<00:03:30.830> so<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:31.890> can<00:03:32.040> see<00:03:32.340> that

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
let's move back so you can see that

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:46.230 
let's move back so you can see that
setting<00:03:33.360> this<00:03:33.480> up<00:03:33.540> point<00:03:34.440> 15

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.600 

still<00:03:47.020> awfully<00:03:47.380> heavy<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.130> cloth<00:03:48.400> itself

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
still awfully heavy and the cloth itself

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:58.080 
still awfully heavy and the cloth itself
the<00:03:49.270> bag<00:03:49.510> maybe<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:49.990> bit<00:03:50.260> too<00:03:56.550> let's<00:03:57.550> bring<00:03:57.850> the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
the bag maybe a bit too let's bring the

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.950 
the bag maybe a bit too let's bring the
its<00:03:58.390> resistance<00:03:59.020> up<00:03:59.200> just<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.620> little<00:03:59.800> bit<00:04:00.960> and

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
its resistance up just a little bit and

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.540 
its resistance up just a little bit and
let's<00:04:02.200> bring<00:04:02.410> this<00:04:02.560> down<00:04:02.800> a<00:04:02.830> little<00:04:03.130> bit<00:04:03.280> more

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
let's bring this down a little bit more

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:15.960 
let's bring this down a little bit more
so<00:04:03.820> point<00:04:04.150> 0<00:04:04.420> 75

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.350 

so<00:04:16.630> now<00:04:16.780> I've<00:04:16.930> got<00:04:17.170> kind<00:04:17.530> of<00:04:17.590> a<00:04:17.709> purse<00:04:17.950> a<00:04:18.880> money

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.360 
so now I've got kind of a purse a money

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:28.200 
so now I've got kind of a purse a money
bag<00:04:20.760> that<00:04:21.760> I<00:04:21.850> can<00:04:22.030> work<00:04:22.210> with<00:04:26.580> not<00:04:27.580> too<00:04:27.850> hard<00:04:28.090> to

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
bag that I can work with not too hard to

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.540 
bag that I can work with not too hard to
set<00:04:28.510> up<00:04:28.630> now<00:04:29.590> of<00:04:29.680> course<00:04:29.830> this<00:04:30.010> is<00:04:30.160> very<00:04:30.340> low

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
set up now of course this is very low

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.480 
set up now of course this is very low
res<00:04:30.790> cloth<00:04:31.120> I<00:04:31.480> could<00:04:32.200> easily<00:04:32.530> have<00:04:32.920> increased

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
res cloth I could easily have increased

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.390 
res cloth I could easily have increased
the<00:04:34.090> amount<00:04:34.210> of<00:04:34.570> density<00:04:37.830> through<00:04:38.830> garment

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
the amount of density through garment

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.890 
the amount of density through garment
maker<00:04:40.410> using<00:04:41.410> the<00:04:41.500> density<00:04:41.860> here<00:04:42.310> or<00:04:42.870> what<00:04:43.870> i

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
maker using the density here or what i

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.130 
maker using the density here or what i
can<00:04:44.080> do<00:04:44.170> is<00:04:44.200> simulate<00:04:44.440> low<00:04:44.920> res<00:04:45.160> i<00:04:48.900> can<00:04:49.900> apply

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
can do is simulate low res i can apply

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.380 
can do is simulate low res i can apply
an<00:04:50.200> h<00:04:50.410> SDS<00:04:50.830> modifier<00:04:51.310> on<00:04:51.340> top<00:04:51.730> go<00:04:52.540> to<00:04:52.600> element

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
an h SDS modifier on top go to element

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.950 
an h SDS modifier on top go to element
subdivide<00:04:56.610> now<00:04:57.610> of<00:04:57.760> course<00:04:57.910> i<00:04:58.090> can<00:04:58.270> hide<00:04:58.540> the

subdivide now of course i can hide the
geosphere<00:04:59.770> is<00:05:00.130> because<00:05:00.490> you<00:05:00.910> don't<00:05:01.090> really

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
geosphere is because you don't really

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:08.010 
geosphere is because you don't really
need<00:05:01.780> to<00:05:02.020> see<00:05:02.260> them<00:05:06.540> so<00:05:07.540> now<00:05:07.630> you've<00:05:07.780> got<00:05:07.900> this

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
need to see them so now you've got this

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.770 
need to see them so now you've got this
gorgeous<00:05:08.260> looking<00:05:08.680> bag<00:05:09.510> that<00:05:10.510> you<00:05:10.540> could

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
gorgeous looking bag that you could

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.930 
gorgeous looking bag that you could
probably<00:05:11.010> drawstring<00:05:12.010> up<00:05:12.160> even<00:05:12.430> more<00:05:12.610> if<00:05:12.820> you

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
probably drawstring up even more if you

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.810 
probably drawstring up even more if you
spend<00:05:13.150> a<00:05:13.180> little<00:05:13.270> bit<00:05:13.390> more<00:05:13.600> time<00:05:13.810> to<00:05:13.840> it<00:05:17.820> and

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
spend a little bit more time to it and

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.909 
spend a little bit more time to it and
you've<00:05:19.180> basically<00:05:19.360> created<00:05:20.290> a<00:05:20.500> cloth

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
you've basically created a cloth

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.700 
you've basically created a cloth
simulation<00:05:21.720> for<00:05:22.720> a<00:05:22.780> money<00:05:23.110> bag<00:05:23.350> or<00:05:23.680> a

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
simulation for a money bag or a

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.900 
simulation for a money bag or a
parachute<00:05:24.130> or<00:05:24.460> something<00:05:24.790> like<00:05:24.910> that<00:05:24.970> using

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
parachute or something like that using

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.550 
parachute or something like that using
using<00:05:27.910> other<00:05:28.150> cloth<00:05:28.480> objects<00:05:28.900> as<00:05:29.050> collision

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
using other cloth objects as collision

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.880 
using other cloth objects as collision
objects<00:05:29.950> or<00:05:30.130> as<00:05:30.280> weights<00:05:30.720> to<00:05:31.720> drive<00:05:32.050> whatever

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
objects or as weights to drive whatever

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.580
