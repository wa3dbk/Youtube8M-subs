00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.479 
to do this it's not going to work why is
it<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.080> work<00:01:04.110> well<00:01:04.589> some<00:01:04.920> reasons<00:01:05.309> are

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
it going to work well some reasons are

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.340 
it going to work well some reasons are
if<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:06.299> have<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.510> ball<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.810> wrong<00:01:06.960> hand

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
if you have the ball in the wrong hand

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.960 
if you have the ball in the wrong hand
now<00:01:07.710> some<00:01:08.010> people<00:01:08.100> will<00:01:08.310> fight<00:01:08.520> me<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.790> that

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
now some people will fight me on that

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.359 
now some people will fight me on that
but<00:01:09.180> look<00:01:09.689> at<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.130> left

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
but look at this if it's in the left

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.370 
but look at this if it's in the left
hand<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:12.210> seems<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.720> works<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.990> heck<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.200> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
hand it seems like it works a heck of a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.630 
hand it seems like it works a heck of a
lot<00:01:13.500> better<00:01:13.560> than<00:01:13.890> when<00:01:14.130> you're<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> right

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
lot better than when you're in the right

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.920 
lot better than when you're in the right
hand<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.030> depends<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.450> what<00:01:15.600> side<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
hand it depends on what side of the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.600 
hand it depends on what side of the
basket<00:01:16.080> you're<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:16.650> well<00:01:16.830> I've<00:01:17.400> been
