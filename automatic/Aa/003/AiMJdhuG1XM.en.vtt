00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
flipping the switch now we were talking

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.279 
flipping the switch now we were talking
just<00:00:29.670> about<00:00:29.880> how<00:00:30.179> long<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.779> signal<00:00:31.140> has<00:00:31.230> been

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
just about how long this signal has been

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.160 
just about how long this signal has been
on<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.590> air<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:32.489> transmitter<00:00:33.059> nearly<00:00:33.660> 28

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
on the air this transmitter nearly 28

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.799 
on the air this transmitter nearly 28
years<00:00:34.469> it's<00:00:35.309> been<00:00:35.550> very<00:00:35.820> reliable<00:00:36.360> it's

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
years it's been very reliable it's

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.690 
years it's been very reliable it's
running<00:00:37.230> very<00:00:37.530> well<00:00:37.649> right<00:00:38.010> now<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.280> hate

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
running very well right now we hate

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.720 
running very well right now we hate
producing<00:00:39.360> some<00:00:39.570> fine<00:00:39.780> pictures<00:00:40.320> right<00:00:40.559> now

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
producing some fine pictures right now

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.060 
producing some fine pictures right now
but<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:42.180> has<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.480> move<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.440> when<00:00:43.860> they<00:00:44.010> do

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
but it has to move on and when they do

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.910 
but it has to move on and when they do
flip<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.969> switch<00:00:45.090> here<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:46.170> noise<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.710> going

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
flip this switch here the noise is going

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.069 
flip this switch here the noise is going
to<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> little<00:00:48.329> less<00:00:48.450> it's<00:00:48.809> going<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.020> be

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
to be a little less it's going to be

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.369 
to be a little less it's going to be
less<00:00:49.379> noisy<00:00:49.800> right<00:00:50.000> yeah<00:00:51.000> well<00:00:51.780> here<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
less noisy right yeah well here the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.900 
less noisy right yeah well here the
quiet<00:00:52.649> for<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.129> speak<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:55.610> lot<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.760> noise

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
quiet for the speak so a lot of noise

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.380 
quiet for the speak so a lot of noise
right<00:00:57.210> now<00:00:58.760> it's<00:00:59.760> going<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> be<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> different

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
right now it's going to be a different

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.119 
right now it's going to be a different

place<00:01:21.420> grab<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.259> new<00:01:22.380> remote<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.890> comes

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
place grab the new remote that comes

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.530 
place grab the new remote that comes
with<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.400> box<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.880> then<00:01:24.030> lock<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.420> new

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
with the box and then lock the new

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.780 
with the box and then lock the new
channels<00:01:24.960> there<00:01:25.470> will<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.890> welcome<00:01:26.580> screen

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
channels there will be a welcome screen

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.280 
channels there will be a welcome screen
and<00:01:27.119> then<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.450> should<00:01:27.630> take<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.960> through<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
and then it should take you through the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:37.630 
and then it should take you through the
process<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:28.890> there<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.220> one<00:01:29.490> tricky<00:01:29.850> question

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.660 

all<00:01:38.640> right<00:01:38.910> so<00:01:39.920> it<00:01:40.920> should<00:01:41.310> only<00:01:41.400> take<00:01:41.520> a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
all right so it should only take a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.670 
all right so it should only take a
couple<00:01:41.730> minutes<00:01:42.120> for<00:01:42.300> you<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:43.260> double-check

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
couple minutes for you to double-check

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.110 
couple minutes for you to double-check
that<00:01:44.130> we've<00:01:44.280> got<00:01:44.430> all<00:01:44.460> sorts<00:01:44.760> of<00:01:44.820> information

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
that we've got all sorts of information

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.550 
that we've got all sorts of information
on<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.510> but<00:01:45.660> well<00:01:45.900> let's<00:01:46.020> come<00:01:46.200> back<00:01:46.230> out

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
on that but well let's come back out

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.860 
on that but well let's come back out
here<00:01:46.590> live<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.730> couple<00:01:47.940> seconds<00:01:48.600> here
