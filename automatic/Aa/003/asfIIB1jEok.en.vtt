00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.690
 in french, the word apartment 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.540
 has two meanings in the first place where 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.300
 people live meet secondly apart 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.060
 means apart on the clash of these two 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.520
 meanings and build but not your ballet 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.520
 which Russian version is called 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.520
 apartment 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.620
 thirst system lack of water in all 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.079
 manifestations 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.019
 but it is also a symbolic subject thirst 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.420
 this is like hunger this movement is progress 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.280
 someone pushes a person to some 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.140
 by action 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.780
 you need to do super efforts to get 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.759
 this water is the same super effort to 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.970
 realize this project is the same 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.470
 super effort 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.890
 dock stravinsky music together 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:21.000
 ballet dancers six 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.000
 weeks of rehearsals 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:42.710
 this apartment is a place where people live but 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.090
 while all people are different but you can 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.070
 roughly call it communal apartments 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.750
 that is, people who live with one 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.450
 the parties are together but at the same time live completely 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.890
 separately each with his life and each 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.720
 experiencing their inner gusts 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.410
 internal tragedy internal 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.410
 experiencing 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.390
 tourist heritage you need to know 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.540
 the rules of the game yes at least elementary 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.610
 how do these gestures mean or so 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.069
 does this jump in modern 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.709
 art has more imagination 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.380
 from the viewer and just do not need him 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.640
 afraid that here he must 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.640
 understand what is happening 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.220
 wave 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.990
 I think that it is the pallet audience 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.910
 who loves her goes to ballet named 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.220
 Pre-classical and in general in Bali, then not 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.320
 the subsequent ones have already heard something about it 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.080
 give think that and they will touch because 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.080
 that this is just very real 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.800
 here
