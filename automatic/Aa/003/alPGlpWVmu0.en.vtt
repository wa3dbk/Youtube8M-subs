that<00:00:19.360> pretty<00:00:20.360> quickly<00:00:20.600> we<00:00:20.840> learned<00:00:21.080> that

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
that pretty quickly we learned that

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.250 
that pretty quickly we learned that
you're<00:00:22.250> expected<00:00:22.700> to<00:00:22.730> meet<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.539> the<00:00:23.570> time

acts<00:00:24.500> that<00:00:24.770> are<00:00:24.830> put<00:00:25.100> out<00:00:25.840> wasn't<00:00:26.840> anything

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
acts that are put out wasn't anything

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.080 
acts that are put out wasn't anything
impossible<00:00:27.770> but<00:00:27.950> it<00:00:28.160> was<00:00:28.250> definitely<00:00:28.430> a<00:00:28.760> good

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
impossible but it was definitely a good

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.000 
impossible but it was definitely a good
way<00:00:29.240> to<00:00:29.300> start<00:00:29.600> off<00:00:29.720> PRC<00:00:32.410> right<00:00:33.410> now<00:00:33.560> I<00:00:33.620> am

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
way to start off PRC right now I am

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.530 
way to start off PRC right now I am
plotting<00:00:34.280> there<00:00:34.640> five<00:00:34.940> points<00:00:35.540> a<00:00:37.300> little<00:00:38.300> cold

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
plotting there five points a little cold

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.600 
plotting there five points a little cold
shake<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:39.200> turn<00:00:39.320> of<00:00:39.440> hot<00:00:39.620> points<00:00:40.040> but<00:00:40.250> once<00:00:40.520> I

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
shake and turn of hot points but once I

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.790 
shake and turn of hot points but once I
get<00:00:40.670> moving<00:00:41.000> there<00:00:41.120> should<00:00:41.300> be<00:00:41.420> good<00:00:44.800> being

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
get moving there should be good being

get moving there should be good being
thick<00:00:46.040> woods<00:00:46.340> isn't<00:00:46.880> another<00:00:47.239> problem<00:00:47.480> that's

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
thick woods isn't another problem that's

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.389 
thick woods isn't another problem that's
not<00:00:47.690> a<00:00:47.720> lot<00:00:47.899> of<00:00:47.930> vegetation<00:00:48.110> out<00:00:48.620> here<00:00:48.860> because

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
not a lot of vegetation out here because

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.940 
not a lot of vegetation out here because
obviously<00:00:49.910> spring<00:00:50.450> just<00:00:50.630> started<00:00:50.930> so<00:00:51.110> there's

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
obviously spring just started so there's

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.260 
obviously spring just started so there's
not<00:00:52.130> much<00:00:52.190> green<00:00:52.550> all<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:52.820> trees<00:00:52.969> are<00:00:53.090> dead

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
not much green all the trees are dead

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.850 
not much green all the trees are dead
which<00:00:53.450> helps<00:00:53.719> a<00:00:53.780> lot<00:00:53.899> looking<00:00:54.170> for<00:00:54.260> points<00:00:54.500> far

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
which helps a lot looking for points far

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.250 
which helps a lot looking for points far
out<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.460> I<00:00:55.969> basically<00:00:56.630> just<00:00:56.750> shot<00:00:56.989> a<00:00:57.020> beat
