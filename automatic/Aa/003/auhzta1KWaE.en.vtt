listened me this bike is made for for
for<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.050> electronic<00:00:55.050> shifting<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> first

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
for the electronic shifting so the first

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.990 
for the electronic shifting so the first
thing<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.420> did<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.980> built<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
thing that we did is we we built the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.389 
thing that we did is we we built the
brakes<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:00.570> example<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.739> fit<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
brakes for example that I fit to the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.070 
brakes for example that I fit to the
Shimano<00:01:02.730> Eva<00:01:03.000> -<00:01:03.570> brake<00:01:03.809> lever<00:01:04.140> not<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
Shimano Eva - brake lever not to the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.840 
Shimano Eva - brake lever not to the
other<00:01:07.080> brands<00:01:07.590> because<00:01:07.920> otherwise<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.640> brake

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
other brands because otherwise the brake

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.760 
other brands because otherwise the brake
is<00:01:09.030> not<00:01:09.060> working<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.260> also<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.619> major

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
is not working and this is also a major

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.359 
is not working and this is also a major
mhm<00:01:11.420> thing<00:01:12.560> sounds<00:01:13.560> strange<00:01:13.830> but<00:01:14.070> if<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
mhm thing sounds strange but if the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.620 
mhm thing sounds strange but if the
brakes<00:01:14.580> are<00:01:14.790> not<00:01:14.880> working<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.390> are<00:01:15.420> not

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
brakes are not working you are not

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.600 
brakes are not working you are not
faster<00:01:16.049> Chandra<00:01:16.380> bike<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.799> mean<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.280> Tundra

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
faster Chandra bike I mean it's a Tundra

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.600 
faster Chandra bike I mean it's a Tundra
bike<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.840> most<00:01:19.049> most<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> power<00:01:20.100> you

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
bike and the most most of the power you

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.289 
bike and the most most of the power you
lose<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.450> air<00:01:21.799> no<00:01:22.799> it's<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.369> 90%<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:24.180> your

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
lose in the air no it's like 90% of your

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.289 
lose in the air no it's like 90% of your
power<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.259> you're<00:01:25.830> losing<00:01:26.150> against<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
power is you you're losing against the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.190 
power is you you're losing against the
air<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:28.400> so<00:01:29.400> with<00:01:29.549> major<00:01:29.759> part<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.570> course<00:01:30.990> it's

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
air so so with major part of course it's

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.340 
air so so with major part of course it's
the<00:01:31.259> iterate<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.340> water<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> bike<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.659> we

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the iterate the water on the bike so we

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.710 
the iterate the water on the bike so we
work<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.829> Precision's<00:01:35.479> meet<00:01:36.479> with<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
work with the Precision's meet with the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.960 
work with the Precision's meet with the
riders<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:37.439> also<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.070> next<00:01:38.490> step<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
riders but also the next step is the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.609 
riders but also the next step is the
bike<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.570> whole<00:01:39.960> equipment<00:01:40.290> wheels<00:01:40.909> boss

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
bike and the whole equipment wheels boss

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.050 
bike and the whole equipment wheels boss
they<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.979> very<00:01:44.009> much<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.729> had

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
they like it very much that I had

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
feeling that the motor is in the bike

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.630 
feeling that the motor is in the bike
but<00:01:52.200> believe<00:01:52.470> me<00:01:52.500> there's<00:01:52.860> no<00:01:53.040> motor<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
but believe me there's no motor in the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.180 
but believe me there's no motor in the
bike
