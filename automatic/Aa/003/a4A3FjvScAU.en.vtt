00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.029
 gym animals in this short 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.890
 video we will talk about weight loss or 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.290
 suppose I wanted to lose weight 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.059
 very quickly they know what it is 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.289
 better to do better focus 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.220
 exclusively on aerobic training 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.369
 cardiovascular as running bike and e 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.279
 whatever else neglecting that in nairobi 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.410
 go weight lifting in the gym because 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.289
 generally an aerobic workout 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.820
 burns far more calories than a 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.520
 then weight training in the gym 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.610
 many of you have thought of sending to 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.050
 that country neglecting the training 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.120
 anaerobic then lifting weights in 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.070
 gym in favor of training 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.559
 more cardiovascular fanny because 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.270
 burns more calories but generally 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.559
 this is not the case first 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.739
 let the arts quest that has always 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.809
 busy just burning to lose 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.000
 weight and you don't care about anything 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.500
 look like a breadstick you don't need 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.510
 follow this channel see in this 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.600
 channel I teach you how to get the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.270
 physique of a Greek god now leave me 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.640
 explain why I don't think it's good 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.409
 only do cardio training e 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.010
 neglect weight training this not 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.530
 it works 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.330
 first of all they are two activities 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.530
 different that have a lot of benefits 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.720
 different 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.580
 then anaerobic training 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.530
 Intense weight training was 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.509
 scientifically proven 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.299
 there are many studies that prove 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.479
 this is an anaerobic training 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.869
 intense can increase your levels of 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.970
 gh up to six times more then 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.430
 the growth hormone of a hormone 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.020
 very important when it comes to 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.390
 lose weight to burn fat because 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.579
 precisely it favors the mobilization and the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.430
 fat loss 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.729
 ok so this is one while 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.090
 very intense aerobic training 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:58.170
 generally releases lactic acid and 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.360
 this is a kata boric hormone is ok 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.829
 completely the opposite the training 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.000
 anaerobic promotes an environment 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.470
 anabolic for your body then 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.670
 only development will proceed 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.140
 muscles as the race more than makes 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.690
 go and produce that lactic acid 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.510
 that bolic or paper also burns 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.500
 muscle mass so go get lost in 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.470
 both fronts 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.930
 second thing when you develop mass 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.200
 your calorie needs 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.000
 daily increases because it is more muscle 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.490
 and muscles require energy for 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.610
 therefore also maintain a status of 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.710
 rest if you are more muscular, burn more 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.620
 calories during the day 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.880
 third thing is that the training 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.640
 anaerobic weight lifting goes to 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.070
 produce an effect called ep york is 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.780
 generally in the fitness world it comes 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.180
 called as the room for an effect 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.030
 or your body burns more calories 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.520
 of some burns generally at rest 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.430
 in the hours following your training 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.740
 Weights are now many scientific studies 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.130
 showing that it is training 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.440
 aerobic aerobic they go to produce 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.230
 this effect only that 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.700
 point difference there are so many studies 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.090
 scientific studies that prove this that 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.380
 aerobic training extends this 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.600
 this process this effect up to 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.420
 stones hours after training while 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.300
 in the case of a weight training this 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.959
 effect is extended up to 36 hours 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.550
 after 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:35.489
 this generally means if 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:39.060
 watching TV at rest consumption 60 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:42.060
 calories each hour after a workout 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.930
 instead of burning ss 60 calories per hour 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.150
 in burning 70 to rai lawn rest but yes 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.760
 what do you want 10 extra calories to be 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.940
 for paths I realize that this effect is 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.730
 extension for 30 36 hours of course I am 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.530
 over 300 extra calories you burn and 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.810
 this is an effect that also 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.150
 aerobic training, however, obviously 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.760
 not of the same duration 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.010
 so these are the pros and cons of 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.959
 these two activities are very different according to 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.510
 me no need to exclude any finds 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.410
 place in the training program of 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.860
 each of us 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.049
 both have benefits of course 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.940
 use your head and know how to use it 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.120
 having said that I remind you that if you have 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.690
 need a training program 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.480
 customized according to yours 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.700
 constitution to your lifestyle click
