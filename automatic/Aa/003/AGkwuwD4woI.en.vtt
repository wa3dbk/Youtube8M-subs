knobby 2 tablet to charge off the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.459 
knobby 2 tablet to charge off the
microUSB<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:10.650> know<00:00:11.460> that<00:00:12.259> there's<00:00:13.259> been<00:00:13.349> a

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
microUSB I know that there's been a

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.150 
microUSB I know that there's been a
bunch<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.830> charging<00:00:14.309> problems<00:00:14.639> anyway<00:00:14.910> for<00:00:15.089> us

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
bunch of charging problems anyway for us

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.050 
bunch of charging problems anyway for us
with<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.340> regular<00:00:18.830> charge<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.039> hookup<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.670> I

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
with the regular charge and hookup so I

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.939 
with the regular charge and hookup so I
decided<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.720> go<00:00:21.869> ahead<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.170> do<00:00:22.830> this

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
decided to go ahead and do this

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.740 
decided to go ahead and do this
modification<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.699> read<00:00:23.850> about<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.180> online<00:00:24.300> I

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
modification I read about it online I

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.620 
modification I read about it online I
have<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.410> change<00:00:25.619> now<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.830> charging<00:00:26.310> port

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
have to change now the charging port

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.900 
have to change now the charging port
which<00:00:27.630> student<00:00:28.019> works<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.650> I'm<00:00:29.609> going<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.789> go

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
which student works so I'm going to go

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.510 
which student works so I'm going to go
over<00:00:30.090> how<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.529> modified<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:32.070> charge<00:00:32.340> from

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
over how I modified it to charge from

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.940 
over how I modified it to charge from
usb<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.750> first<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.079> all<00:00:34.140> get<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.500> knobby<00:00:34.770> take

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
usb so first of all get you knobby take

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.780 
usb so first of all get you knobby take
that<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.910> cover<00:00:36.239> off<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> outside<00:00:37.579> it's<00:00:38.579> four

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
that the cover off the outside it's four

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.600 
that the cover off the outside it's four
screws<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.270> corners<00:00:40.010> take<00:00:41.010> those<00:00:41.219> screws

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
screws in the corners take those screws

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.740 
screws in the corners take those screws
out<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.590> then<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:44.399> Nabi<00:00:44.610> tablet<00:00:44.940> should<00:00:45.629> be

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
out and then the Nabi tablet should be

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.440 
out and then the Nabi tablet should be
able<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.930> come<00:00:46.079> apart<00:00:46.850> just<00:00:47.850> be<00:00:48.059> careful

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
able to come apart just be careful

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.720 
able to come apart just be careful
because<00:00:48.480> when<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.559> take<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.890> apart<00:00:50.010> you'll

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
because when you take it apart you'll

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.569 
because when you take it apart you'll
see<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:52.199> connection<00:00:52.980> for<00:00:53.160> your<00:00:53.250> screen

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
see that the connection for your screen

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.590 
see that the connection for your screen
is<00:00:54.539> right<00:00:54.930> there<00:00:55.820> alright<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.030> basically<00:00:57.149> come

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
is right there alright so basically come

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.580 
is right there alright so basically come
over<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.640> corner<00:00:59.870> here<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.469> will

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
over to this corner here and you will

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.020 
over to this corner here and you will
see<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:04.339> charging<00:01:05.339> port<00:01:07.610> which<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.790> causing

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
see the charging port which is causing

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.929 
see the charging port which is causing
some<00:01:09.360> problems<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:10.430> people<00:01:11.430> I've<00:01:11.580> changed

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
some problems for people I've changed

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.620

that one out sorry for my shoddy solder
and<00:01:15.750> work<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.680> basically<00:01:17.009> what<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.250> want<00:01:17.369> to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
and work but basically what you want to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.740 
and work but basically what you want to
do<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.670> get<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.970> charge<00:01:18.180> from<00:01:18.330> usb<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:20.750> this

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
do to get it to charge from usb is this

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.740 
do to get it to charge from usb is this
terminal<00:01:22.229> right<00:01:22.380> here<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> bottom<00:01:23.070> corner

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
terminal right here in the bottom corner

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.700 
terminal right here in the bottom corner
you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.380> wire<00:01:25.619> attached<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:27.710> it's

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
you can see the wire attached to it it's

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.130 
you can see the wire attached to it it's
going<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.920> be<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.280> one<00:01:29.610> right<00:01:30.320> here<00:01:33.140> that

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
going to be this one right here that

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.380 
going to be this one right here that
right<00:01:34.380> there<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.950> your<00:01:35.310> positive<00:01:35.939> terminal<00:01:36.299> if

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
right there is your positive terminal if

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.390 
right there is your positive terminal if
you<00:01:36.479> put<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> meter<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.110> you'll<00:01:37.290> see<00:01:37.530> like

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
you put a meter on it you'll see like

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.880 
you put a meter on it you'll see like
four<00:01:38.700> point<00:01:38.909> six<00:01:39.090> volts<00:01:39.479> coming<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.079> so

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
four point six volts coming to it so

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.240 
four point six volts coming to it so
what<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> did<00:01:41.759> was<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.180> red<00:01:42.570> wire<00:01:43.250> running

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
what I did was this red wire running

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.420 
what I did was this red wire running
down<00:01:44.520> here<00:01:45.619> soldered<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.799> onto<00:01:47.250> that

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
down here soldered that onto that

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.460 
down here soldered that onto that
positive<00:01:48.329> terminal<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.490> then<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:50.700> ran<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.470> to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
positive terminal and then we ran it to

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.610 
positive terminal and then we ran it to
this<00:01:54.200> capacitor<00:01:55.850> right<00:01:56.850> there

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
this capacitor right there

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.030 
this capacitor right there
get<00:01:59.620> you<00:01:59.770> a<00:01:59.800> little<00:01:59.920> better<00:02:00.100> look<00:02:00.700> at<00:02:00.820> that<00:02:01.000> I

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
get you a little better look at that I

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.960 
get you a little better look at that I
said<00:02:03.040> my<00:02:03.130> so<00:02:03.310> little<00:02:03.490> work<00:02:03.610> he's<00:02:03.760> not<00:02:03.790> that

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
said my so little work he's not that

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.120 
said my so little work he's not that
great<00:02:04.120> Adam<00:02:04.480> soldered<00:02:04.780> since<00:02:04.960> high<00:02:05.080> school

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
great Adam soldered since high school

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.860 
great Adam soldered since high school
but<00:02:06.130> that's<00:02:06.280> what<00:02:06.490> you<00:02:06.550> want<00:02:06.730> to<00:02:06.850> solder<00:02:07.690> onto

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
but that's what you want to solder onto

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.770 
but that's what you want to solder onto
right<00:02:08.200> there<00:02:08.440> is<00:02:08.590> this<00:02:08.680> capacitor<00:02:09.600> so<00:02:10.600> there's

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
right there is this capacitor so there's

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.720 
right there is this capacitor so there's
the<00:02:10.960> red<00:02:11.110> wire<00:02:11.320> running<00:02:11.620> goes<00:02:12.340> straight<00:02:12.670> to

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
the red wire running goes straight to

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.390 
the red wire running goes straight to
the<00:02:12.910> positive<00:02:13.360> terminal<00:02:14.820> so<00:02:15.820> if<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:16.420> take<00:02:16.600> a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
the positive terminal so if I take a

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.420 
the positive terminal so if I take a
microUSB<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:19.710> find<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:20.830> port<00:02:21.040> on<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.190> side

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
microUSB and find the port on the side

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:30.210 
microUSB and find the port on the side
and<00:02:24.060> plug<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.150> on<00:02:25.210> up<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:28.120> can<00:02:28.330> see<00:02:29.220> the

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
and plug it on up you can see the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.390
