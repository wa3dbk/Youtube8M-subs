00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
that's why motley golden not a lab

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.280 
that's why motley golden not a lab
Motley<00:03:08.550> yeah<00:03:09.550> I<00:03:09.610> hope<00:03:12.720> darn<00:03:13.720> this<00:03:13.959> could<00:03:14.170> have

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:36.160 

white<00:03:25.890> white<00:03:26.890> tiger

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:43.530 

so<00:03:36.740> if<00:03:36.920> this<00:03:37.220> is<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.430> Motley

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.270 

No

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.120 

i<00:03:46.370> would<00:03:47.000> say<00:03:47.209> golden<00:03:49.420> golden<00:03:50.740> so<00:03:51.740> that<00:03:51.890> means

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
i would say golden golden so that means

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.250 
i would say golden golden so that means
we<00:03:52.280> got<00:03:52.459> a<00:03:52.490> golden<00:03:53.060> as<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.209> father<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:53.990> that

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
we got a golden as a father and that

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.030 
we got a golden as a father and that
means<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:54.800> is<00:03:55.480> laughs<00:03:56.480> it<00:03:57.140> means<00:03:57.470> it's<00:03:57.709> a<00:03:57.800> lab

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
means it is laughs it means it's a lab

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.190 
means it is laughs it means it's a lab
platy<00:03:58.870> so<00:03:59.870> that<00:04:00.050> means<00:04:00.290> that's<00:04:00.530> probably<00:04:02.200> the

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
platy so that means that's probably the

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.630 
platy so that means that's probably the
first<00:04:03.500> lab<00:04:04.100> platy<00:04:04.580> tiger<00:04:05.150> I<00:04:05.770> mean<00:04:06.770> white<00:04:07.250> platy

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
first lab platy tiger I mean white platy

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.520 
first lab platy tiger I mean white platy
tiger<00:04:08.180> a<00:04:09.790> golden<00:04:10.790> child<00:04:11.120> so<00:04:12.020> I<00:04:12.050> think<00:04:12.140> that's<00:04:12.440> a

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
tiger a golden child so I think that's a

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.940 
tiger a golden child so I think that's a
first<00:04:12.800> right<00:04:13.010> there<00:04:14.350> trick<00:04:15.350> me<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:15.560> thought<00:04:15.800> was

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
first right there trick me I thought was

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.480 
first right there trick me I thought was
a<00:04:16.010> son<00:04:16.690> so<00:04:17.690> that's<00:04:17.840> kind<00:04:18.079> of<00:04:18.139> cool<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:22.190> it<00:04:22.310> looks

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
a son so that's kind of cool so it looks

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.310 
a son so that's kind of cool so it looks
a<00:04:22.580> lot<00:04:22.730> like<00:04:22.910> a<00:04:22.970> son<00:04:23.300> it's<00:04:23.510> got<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.840> reduced

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
a lot like a son it's got the reduced

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.340 
a lot like a son it's got the reduced
really<00:04:25.160> clean<00:04:25.460> pattern<00:04:26.060> and<00:04:26.450> see<00:04:26.630> no<00:04:26.810> speckles

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
really clean pattern and see no speckles

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.080 
really clean pattern and see no speckles
that's<00:04:27.530> why<00:04:27.680> we<00:04:27.860> knew<00:04:28.010> I<00:04:28.040> that's<00:04:28.730> why<00:04:28.910> I<00:04:28.940> was

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
that's why we knew I that's why I was

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.550 
that's why we knew I that's why I was
pretty<00:04:29.270> confident<00:04:29.780> couldn't<00:04:30.080> be<00:04:30.169> just<00:04:30.410> a

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
pretty confident couldn't be just a

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.270 
pretty confident couldn't be just a
golden<00:04:31.550> child<00:04:31.820> tiger<00:04:32.480> albino<00:04:33.280> because

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.440 
normally golden child Tiger albinos
house<00:04:36.620> speckles<00:04:37.160> all<00:04:37.340> up<00:04:37.490> in<00:04:37.610> there<00:04:37.790> kind<00:04:38.419> of

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
house speckles all up in there kind of

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.000 
house speckles all up in there kind of
like<00:04:38.570> that<00:04:38.720> little<00:04:38.990> tiny<00:04:39.380> spot<00:04:39.740> right<00:04:39.979> there

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
like that little tiny spot right there

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.850 
like that little tiny spot right there
but<00:04:40.340> really<00:04:40.660> radical<00:04:41.660> so<00:04:42.229> this<00:04:42.380> is<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:42.590> plot

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
but really radical so this is a plot

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.090 
but really radical so this is a plot
that's<00:04:43.130> a<00:04:43.310> first<00:04:43.550> so<00:04:44.360> that's<00:04:44.540> a<00:04:44.750> plot<00:04:44.990> e<00:04:45.100> so

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
that's a first so that's a plot e so

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.010 
that's a first so that's a plot e so
this<00:04:46.130> is<00:04:46.400> a<00:04:46.430> platy<00:04:47.889> that's<00:04:48.889> a<00:04:49.040> platy<00:04:49.310> golden

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
this is a platy that's a platy golden

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.850 
this is a platy that's a platy golden
tiger<00:04:52.570> so<00:04:53.570> that's<00:04:53.690> a<00:04:53.810> platy<00:04:54.050> golden<00:04:54.500> tiger

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
tiger so that's a platy golden tiger

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:01.180 
tiger so that's a platy golden tiger
plotting<00:04:55.400> white<00:04:55.669> the<00:04:56.510> golden<00:04:57.380> tiger<00:04:57.830> and<00:05:00.190> this

one's kind of unique looking could be a

one's kind of unique looking could be a
platinum<00:05:04.460> I<00:05:04.729> haven't<00:05:04.970> quite<00:05:05.120> seen<00:05:05.419> one

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
platinum I haven't quite seen one

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.110 
platinum I haven't quite seen one
platter<00:05:05.960> like<00:05:06.200> that<00:05:06.470> but<00:05:06.740> we<00:05:07.610> haven't<00:05:07.760> seen<00:05:07.970> it

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.860 
platter like that but we haven't seen it
all<00:05:08.240> that's<00:05:08.419> for<00:05:08.630> sure<00:05:09.370> another<00:05:10.720> good<00:05:11.720> look

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
all that's for sure another good look

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.980 
all that's for sure another good look
and<00:05:12.050> stuff<00:05:12.310> so<00:05:13.310> that's<00:05:14.300> the<00:05:14.539> interesting<00:05:14.750> part

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
and stuff so that's the interesting part

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.900 
and stuff so that's the interesting part
of<00:05:15.380> multiple<00:05:15.860> daddy's<00:05:16.250> it<00:05:16.430> makes<00:05:16.580> you<00:05:16.700> wonder

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
of multiple daddy's it makes you wonder

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.940 
of multiple daddy's it makes you wonder
for<00:05:17.210> a<00:05:17.240> minute<00:05:17.539> have<00:05:18.140> me<00:05:18.320> tricked<00:05:18.590> there<00:05:18.740> for<00:05:18.919> a

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
for a minute have me tricked there for a

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
for a minute have me tricked there for a
minute<00:05:19.100> but<00:05:19.250> I<00:05:19.340> should've<00:05:19.610> looked<00:05:19.700> at<00:05:19.850> the

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
minute but I should've looked at the

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.300 
minute but I should've looked at the
label<00:05:20.270> I<00:05:20.390> started<00:05:20.900> cutting<00:05:21.200> what<00:05:21.530> can<00:05:21.740> I<00:05:21.800> say<00:05:22.039> I

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
label I started cutting what can I say I

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.890 
label I started cutting what can I say I
kind<00:05:22.910> of<00:05:23.030> like<00:05:23.090> one<00:05:23.360> of<00:05:23.390> the<00:05:23.510> guys<00:05:23.630> who<00:05:23.690> just
