00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.679
&gt;&gt; NOW THAT YOU'VE SEEN A DEMONSTRATION, LET'S WATCH A PARENT PUTTING A TUBE 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:07.169
IN THEIR  OWN CHILD. AFTER THAT, YOU'LL WATCH AN OLDER CHILD INSERTING

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:14.169
THEIR OWN TUBE.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.020
&gt;&gt; THEN THERE IS A WIRE. YOU GOT TO PULL IT OUT WHEN YOU'RE DONE 
WITH IT.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:49.380
AND THEN USUALLY MY MOM OR MY DAD, WHOEVER IS THERE, CUTS THE TAPE WITH 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.580
THE SCISSORS IN THE BACK.

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:05.539
AND THEN YOU'RE DONE.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.440
&gt;&gt; WE HOPE THAT IS INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO PROVIDES
YOU WITH THE SKILLS, INFORMATION, AND ENCOURAGEMENT

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.970
NEEDED TO SAFELY INSERT THE TUBE IN YOUR OWN
CHILD AT HOME.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.150
IF YOU'RE HAVING ANY TROUBLE INSERTING THE
TUBE, OR HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE TUBE,

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.499
PLEASE CONTACT YOUR CHILD'S HEALTHCARE PROVIDER.
