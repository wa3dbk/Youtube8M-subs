00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.740 
fade just within your golf swing so it's
all<00:00:35.160> about<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> rotation<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> wrist<00:00:36.300> just

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
all about the rotation of the wrist just

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:45.710 
all about the rotation of the wrist just
like<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.380> regular<00:00:37.530> golf

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.200 

exactly<00:00:46.650> like<00:00:46.920> precisely<00:00:47.520> how<00:00:47.790> you<00:00:47.850> hit<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
exactly like precisely how you hit the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.470 
exactly like precisely how you hit the
ball<00:00:48.360> is

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.060 

no<00:00:53.840> one<00:00:54.020> should<00:00:54.170> go<00:00:54.230> through<00:00:54.320> what<00:00:54.800> you<00:00:54.920> got

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
no one should go through what you got

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.310 
no one should go through what you got
Green<00:00:55.430> has<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.090> same<00:00:56.300> effect<00:00:56.570> on<00:00:56.660> your<00:00:57.079> putty

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
Green has the same effect on your putty

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.950 
Green has the same effect on your putty
so

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
so

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.229 
so
that<00:01:00.559> makes<00:01:00.710> like<00:01:00.890> before<00:01:01.700> you<00:01:01.850> bring<00:01:02.059> back

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
that makes like before you bring back

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.970 
that makes like before you bring back
the<00:01:02.480> club<00:01:02.719> is<00:01:03.140> how<00:01:03.260> far<00:01:03.469> he<00:01:03.590> brings<00:01:03.800> it<00:01:03.950> back

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
the club is how far he brings it back

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.039 
the club is how far he brings it back
and<00:01:04.430> however<00:01:04.699> once<00:01:04.940> you<00:01:05.000> follow<00:01:05.239> through<00:01:05.630> is

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
and however once you follow through is

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:07.930 
and however once you follow through is
how<00:01:06.200> much<00:01:06.380> he<00:01:06.530> follows<00:01:06.890> through<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:07.700> it<00:01:07.760> really

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
how much he follows through so it really

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.160 
how much he follows through so it really
gives<00:01:08.000> you<00:01:08.210> more<00:01:08.390> control<00:01:08.540> than<00:01:08.810> you've<00:01:09.050> ever

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170
