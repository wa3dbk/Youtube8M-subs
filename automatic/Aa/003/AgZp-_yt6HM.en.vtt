00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
of grip as well as the inability to slip

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.690 
of grip as well as the inability to slip
out<00:00:33.170> of<00:00:33.320> it<00:00:33.410> which<00:00:33.559> is<00:00:33.739> very<00:00:33.800> important<00:00:34.489> for<00:00:34.610> a

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
out of it which is very important for a

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.540 
out of it which is very important for a

lot of top mount downhill racers the
next<00:00:37.820> thing<00:00:37.969> after<00:00:38.210> that<00:00:38.510> is<00:00:38.870> it's<00:00:39.140> got<00:00:39.320> very

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
next thing after that is it's got very

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.619 
next thing after that is it's got very
nice<00:00:39.949> wheel<00:00:40.370> cutouts<00:00:40.789> that<00:00:41.030> you<00:00:41.120> can<00:00:41.269> see<00:00:41.480> up

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
nice wheel cutouts that you can see up

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.419 
nice wheel cutouts that you can see up
here<00:00:41.660> they've<00:00:42.440> been<00:00:42.469> routed<00:00:42.829> so<00:00:43.160> you<00:00:43.219> don't

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:43.429 
here they've been routed so you don't

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:45.579 
here they've been routed so you don't
have<00:00:43.550> to<00:00:43.670> worry<00:00:43.910> about<00:00:44.059> you<00:00:44.359> know<00:00:44.390> catching<00:00:45.350> a

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
have to worry about you know catching a

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.639 
have to worry about you know catching a
wheel<00:00:45.769> bite<00:00:46.039> and<00:00:46.250> going<00:00:46.489> down<00:00:46.609> at<00:00:46.789> 50<00:00:47.469> next<00:00:48.469> big

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
wheel bite and going down at 50 next big

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.079 
wheel bite and going down at 50 next big
feature<00:00:48.859> that<00:00:49.160> they<00:00:49.280> do<00:00:49.339> is<00:00:49.579> they<00:00:49.699> go<00:00:49.850> with<00:00:49.969> an

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
feature that they do is they go with an

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.329 
feature that they do is they go with an
arbor<00:00:50.510> right<00:00:50.660> based<00:00:51.019> to<00:00:51.649> the<00:00:51.769> bottom<00:00:52.100> of<00:00:52.190> this

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
arbor right based to the bottom of this

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:54.430 
arbor right based to the bottom of this
skate<00:00:52.609> board<00:00:52.879> what<00:00:53.390> it<00:00:53.480> allows<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:53.809> board<00:00:54.320> to

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
skate board what it allows the board to

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.470 
skate board what it allows the board to
be<00:00:54.890> is<00:00:55.070> just<00:00:55.249> a<00:00:55.309> lot<00:00:55.460> more<00:00:55.640> scratch<00:00:55.969> resistant

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
be is just a lot more scratch resistant

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.590 
be is just a lot more scratch resistant
as<00:00:56.600> well<00:00:56.629> as<00:00:56.960> durable<00:00:57.640> if<00:00:58.640> I<00:00:58.940> was<00:00:59.120> to<00:00:59.239> set<00:00:59.420> this

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
as well as durable if I was to set this

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.899 
as well as durable if I was to set this
board<00:00:59.929> up<00:01:00.140> I'd<00:01:00.530> be<00:01:00.769> putting<00:01:00.980> some<00:01:01.249> gnarly<00:01:01.609> grip

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
board up I'd be putting some gnarly grip

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:03.610 
board up I'd be putting some gnarly grip
tape<00:01:02.149> on<00:01:02.329> it<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:02.510> I<00:01:02.629> wouldn't<00:01:02.929> be<00:01:03.050> slipping<00:01:03.499> off

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
tape on it so I wouldn't be slipping off

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.760 
tape on it so I wouldn't be slipping off
I'd<00:01:04.309> be<00:01:04.370> putting<00:01:04.730> some<00:01:04.970> Paris<00:01:05.390> 195<00:01:06.110> trucks<00:01:06.560> on

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
I'd be putting some Paris 195 trucks on

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.620 
I'd be putting some Paris 195 trucks on
it<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:07.400> only<00:01:07.460> difference<00:01:07.760> with<00:01:08.180> how<00:01:08.330> I<00:01:08.360> would

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
it the only difference with how I would

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.420 
it the only difference with how I would
put<00:01:08.750> my<00:01:08.930> trucks<00:01:09.259> on<00:01:09.439> is<00:01:09.710> that<00:01:10.159> I<00:01:10.250> would

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
put my trucks on is that I would

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.550 
put my trucks on is that I would
actually<00:01:10.520> be<00:01:11.030> taking<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.600> base<00:01:11.840> plates<00:01:12.229> off

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
actually be taking the base plates off

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.920 
actually be taking the base plates off
of<00:01:12.829> the<00:01:13.009> Paris<00:01:13.430> trucks<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:14.299> adding<00:01:14.720> some

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
of the Paris trucks and adding some

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.370 
of the Paris trucks and adding some
Randol<00:01:15.790> 42<00:01:16.790> degree<00:01:17.149> base<00:01:17.360> plates<00:01:17.720> these<00:01:18.320> are

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
Randol 42 degree base plates these are

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.350 
Randol 42 degree base plates these are
lower<00:01:19.009> type<00:01:19.399> base<00:01:19.729> fight<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:20.240> they're<00:01:20.329> a

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
lower type base fight and they're a

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.160 
lower type base fight and they're a
little<00:01:20.570> bit<00:01:20.810> more<00:01:21.100> downhill<00:01:22.100> specific<00:01:23.170> after

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
little bit more downhill specific after

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.350 
little bit more downhill specific after
that<00:01:24.350> I<00:01:24.560> would<00:01:24.710> put<00:01:24.950> some<00:01:25.189> blue<00:01:25.520> mini<00:01:25.850> monsters

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
that I would put some blue mini monsters

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.200 
that I would put some blue mini monsters
because<00:01:27.140> they<00:01:27.320> not<00:01:27.500> only<00:01:27.770> match<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.939> board

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
because they not only match the board

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.200 
because they not only match the board
but<00:01:29.960> they're<00:01:30.290> a<00:01:30.320> very<00:01:30.649> very<00:01:30.799> grippy<00:01:31.490> very

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
but they're a very very grippy very

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.300 
but they're a very very grippy very
sugary<00:01:32.659> type<00:01:33.170> of<00:01:33.350> urethane<00:01:33.590> it<00:01:33.979> just<00:01:34.130> works

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
sugary type of urethane it just works

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.580 
sugary type of urethane it just works
really<00:01:34.670> well<00:01:34.880> on<00:01:35.060> a<00:01:35.090> top<00:01:35.360> mount<00:01:35.630> after<00:01:36.439> that

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
really well on a top mount after that

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.560 
really well on a top mount after that
you're<00:01:36.740> gonna<00:01:36.829> need<00:01:36.979> some<00:01:37.250> hardware<00:01:37.700> you're

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
you're gonna need some hardware you're

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.539 
you're gonna need some hardware you're
gonna<00:01:38.689> need<00:01:38.869> a<00:01:39.079> nice<00:01:39.409> set<00:01:39.710> of<00:01:39.740> bushings<00:01:40.280> for
