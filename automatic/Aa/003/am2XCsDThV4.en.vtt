 hairstyles are at hand to you as always 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.710

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.280
 to comb your hair all over 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.330
 length large elk gum and 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.030
 small elastic rubber

 as well as not 1st hair do not do without 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.649
 invisible well and finally 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.320
 it will be necessary to fix the result with 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.330
 using hairspray and important 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.729
 the fact is that your hair 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.310
 must be pre-curled either on 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.920
 curler or curler or socks 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.900
 First you need to comb your hair 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.500
 full length to get rid of all 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.320
 knots and entanglement 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.170
 then around the perimeter of the crown I outline 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.730
 circle and taking the hair from the inside of it 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.580
 circle in the tail 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.970
 and capturing part of the hair with the crown high 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.880
 tail 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.970
 I share two vertical partitions 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.360

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:44.850

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.850
 forward twist in a bun 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.640
 and fasten with the help of crab to these 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.090
 hair at the moment did not interfere with me 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.930
 in work with the rest of the hair we will begin 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.090

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.260
 I also act with a tail I share 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.670

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.819
 I take the part forward and fix it with 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.790

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.700

 cashier 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.740

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.370

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:33.499
 when all hide and seek is woven into weaving 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:35.750
 braids only need to braid pigtail 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:41.960
