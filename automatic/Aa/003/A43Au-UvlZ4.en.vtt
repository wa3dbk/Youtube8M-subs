00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.639
 [music] 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:31.070
 i welcome all lawyers i'm allergy 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:35.410
 Now I will tell you about the monolithic 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.410
 central field for engines java 638 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.530
 on earth known to frequent problem 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.019
 engine 138 is what starts 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.330
 some rumble in the area of ​​the calendula at 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.970
 that there and the whole bearings, it seems, 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.370
 whole root well, what all the same 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.530
 the problem with this studio is just the way 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.489
 motorcycle often stops winding up 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.430
 Generally it feels like just not 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.269
 sucks gasoline so to speak 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.680
 so here I will show why this happens 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:14.650
 yes, I have such a rape 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:16.180
 on the jacket if you look at the engine 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.560
 638 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.470
 such a problem can be detected here 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.460
 such a 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.010
 all this suggests that 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:31.539
 central support to called not 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:31.539
 central at times it is just for air 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.109
 with such a problem 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:41.240
 many will come different solutions to this 

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:41.780
 how to slander new aluminum on 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.499
 picture 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.780
 together landing central pore and then 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:49.659
 a little grind but all this again 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.689
 not for long 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.200
 in general, some change completely 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.060
 crankcase 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.829
 but also this is not an option because 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.330
 documents will have to register all 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.790
 equally 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.170
 monolithic comes to help us 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.530
 central support now I'm you 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.530
 will show 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.799
 This here this here she with mind 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.900
 different from standard central 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.840
 form so that it is completely summer here 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:27.720
 there are no mud flows 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.890
 extra just tucks under mounting 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.760
 coupling screws 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:37.920
 and under drowned 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:42.540
 lubrication channels so here it is 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.400
 central lesson is put in return 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.109
 standard with apartments 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.799
 absolutely do not need anything here 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.700
 just need to warm them up well and so 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.299
 let's find out 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.099
 what are the common advantages of monolithic 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.069
 central support with respect to 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:04.109
 standard most important advantage and 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:08.459
 essentially preventing the replacement of carders 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:10.709
 here is such a problem 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.139
 this is my standard central pore 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.599
 she generally waffle 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:17.560
 loose so here's the advantage is that 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:21.099
 if we look at 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.230
 the seller central support see that 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.709
 contact area here 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.630
 just these polosochka she 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.459
 only 5 millimeters thick at all 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:35.110
 what for such a colossus so these here 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.769
 motility not so here these 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.690
 little ones 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.790
 thin stripes of course not enough 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.930
 for a clear support 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:47.709
 our channel will generally come to this 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.500
 I conclude why it is on Java 638 more often 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.940
 just such a problem occurs though 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.519
 central pillar at 603 fourth on 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.900
 the torus is about the same too 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:01.510
 little contact area carter and 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.700
 634 made of stronger alloy 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.940
 aluminum with the addition of alloying 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:11.950
 Zinc elements are included and 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.090
 graphite in so here the engine 138 excluded 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.819
 from its alloy 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:20.310
 these additives so its material has become 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:23.350
 softer when working due to strong 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.650
 loads on from here zintron set here 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.600
 Now these stripes causes the egg is not 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.910
 erases nothing just pulls out 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.950
 metal turns our map here 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:37.750
 increases to those places above and 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:39.940
 down here so here's the advantage 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.130
 solid support is that it has 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.300
 completely what percentage area 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.840
 of touch 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.610
 with halves of the map that is here but the whole 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.430
 here this plane she will cuddle 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.590
 and tight and build support in all its 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:58.569
 surface no hair glasses glasses edges 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.169
 its entire surface which means it is 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.020
 many times 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:05.289
 dozens of times increase or he sustainability 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.169
 in apartments will also lower the probability 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:11.199
 of the fact that carder’s face will be 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:16.659
 that first of all she has a permit with 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:19.360
 by 3.5 millimeter it means 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:21.940
 that her landing and and landing 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.620
 performed only on warmed 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.259
 the apartments need to be fully heated 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:30.159
 as strong as possible only on the hot and 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:32.349
 most likely then someday and him 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:35.849
 it will be very difficult to get from there but I 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:39.729
 I think it will not be needed soon 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:41.940
 so here we will put here 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.940
 this
