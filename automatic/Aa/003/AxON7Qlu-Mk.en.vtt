it's like near impossible so this is a

it's like near impossible so this is a
really<00:03:03.540> really<00:03:03.720> welcome<00:03:04.350> change<00:03:04.709> my<00:03:05.250> only

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
really really welcome change my only

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.160 
really really welcome change my only
question<00:03:05.880> is<00:03:06.209> if<00:03:06.330> this<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:06.600> somehow<00:03:06.810> going<00:03:07.080> to

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
question is if this is somehow going to

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.810 
question is if this is somehow going to
translate<00:03:07.650> over<00:03:07.950> into<00:03:08.130> any<00:03:08.580> other

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
translate over into any other

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.340 
translate over into any other
professions<00:03:09.480> because<00:03:09.600> right<00:03:09.930> now<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.230> would

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
professions because right now it would

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.190 
professions because right now it would
seem<00:03:10.380> pretty<00:03:10.890> unfair<00:03:11.459> that<00:03:12.000> only<00:03:12.270> herbalists

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
seem pretty unfair that only herbalists

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.350 
seem pretty unfair that only herbalists
and<00:03:13.440> miners<00:03:14.130> would<00:03:14.280> get<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.580> because<00:03:14.820> there's

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
and miners would get it because there's

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.940 
and miners would get it because there's
other<00:03:15.540> crafters<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.170> gatherers<00:03:16.350> in<00:03:16.860> the

two<00:03:55.050> cents<00:03:55.410> in<00:03:55.590> since<00:03:55.890> we're<00:03:56.100> here<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.610> I

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
two cents in since we're here and I

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.820 
two cents in since we're here and I

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
think because we already we do know that

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.440 
think because we already we do know that

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
to say that the only reason i think all

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.959 
to say that the only reason i think all
these<00:04:33.300> things<00:04:33.540> is<00:04:33.690> because<00:04:33.840> i<00:04:34.020> googled<00:04:34.410> no

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:34.969

bull<00:04:35.089> in<00:04:35.329> northrend<00:04:35.929> and<00:04:36.169> he<00:04:36.379> was<00:04:36.529> the<00:04:36.649> only

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:36.829 
bull in northrend and he was the only

00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:40.539 
bull in northrend and he was the only
NPC<00:04:37.669> that<00:04:38.269> came<00:04:38.479> up<00:04:38.509> so<00:04:39.349> if<00:04:39.709> this<00:04:39.889> is<00:04:40.039> not<00:04:40.339> like

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:40.549 
NPC that came up so if this is not like

00:04:40.549 --> 00:04:42.519 
NPC that came up so if this is not like
a<00:04:40.610> very<00:04:40.939> good<00:04:41.179> guess<00:04:41.449> what<00:04:41.989> I<00:04:42.019> mean<00:04:42.289> to<00:04:42.319> say<00:04:42.409> is

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:42.529 
a very good guess what I mean to say is

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.609 
a very good guess what I mean to say is
that<00:04:42.769> if<00:04:42.860> this<00:04:43.309> were<00:04:43.519> a<00:04:43.729> race<00:04:44.539> of<00:04:44.569> horses<00:04:45.439> if

00:04:45.609 --> 00:04:45.619 
that if this were a race of horses if

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:47.079 
that if this were a race of horses if
this<00:04:45.769> were<00:04:45.919> a<00:04:45.979> horse<00:04:46.399> race<00:04:46.610> that<00:04:46.789> I<00:04:46.909> was<00:04:47.059> a

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:47.089 
this were a horse race that I was a

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:49.359 
this were a horse race that I was a
horse<00:04:47.479> in<00:04:47.749> the<00:04:47.959> race<00:04:47.989> but<00:04:48.469> then<00:04:48.889> I<00:04:48.919> was<00:04:49.129> also

00:04:49.359 --> 00:04:49.369 
horse in the race but then I was also

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:51.549 
horse in the race but then I was also
somehow<00:04:49.610> a<00:04:49.729> human<00:04:50.209> who<00:04:50.689> is<00:04:50.839> betting<00:04:51.259> on<00:04:51.529> a

00:04:51.549 --> 00:04:51.559 
somehow a human who is betting on a

somehow a human who is betting on a
horse<00:04:51.709> in<00:04:52.099> the<00:04:52.249> race<00:04:52.279> I<00:04:52.699> probably<00:04:53.479> wouldn't

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:54.049 
horse in the race I probably wouldn't

00:04:54.049 --> 00:04:58.209 
horse in the race I probably wouldn't
bet<00:04:54.469> on<00:04:54.499> my<00:04:54.919> horse<00:04:55.249> self<00:04:55.719> to<00:04:56.719> win<00:04:57.219> worst
