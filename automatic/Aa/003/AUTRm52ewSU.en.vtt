it looks okay so I got everything hooked

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.949 
it looks okay so I got everything hooked
up<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:56.030> adapters<00:02:56.900> fairly<00:02:57.709> large<00:02:58.450> but<00:02:59.450> you

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
up that adapters fairly large but you

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.120 
up that adapters fairly large but you
know<00:03:00.049> had<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.410> hook<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.650> up<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:00.920> mini

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
know had to hook it up to the mini

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.819 
know had to hook it up to the mini
DisplayPort<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:01.850> then<00:03:01.940> up<00:03:02.120> into<00:03:02.389> the<00:03:02.829> USB

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
DisplayPort and then up into the USB

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.970 
DisplayPort and then up into the USB
there<00:03:04.239> um<00:03:05.239> it<00:03:06.019> did<00:03:06.230> solve<00:03:06.470> my<00:03:06.590> problem<00:03:06.920> with

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
there um it did solve my problem with

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.430 
there um it did solve my problem with
how<00:03:07.130> large<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.639> is<00:03:07.730> though<00:03:07.970> because<00:03:08.440> there's

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
how large it is though because there's

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.520 
how large it is though because there's
about<00:03:09.709> five<00:03:10.370> ER<00:03:10.600> almost<00:03:11.600> actually<00:03:11.900> close<00:03:12.500> to

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
about five ER almost actually close to

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.379 
about five ER almost actually close to
10<00:03:12.859> inches<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.220> poor<00:03:13.609> line<00:03:13.819> between<00:03:14.090> the

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
10 inches of poor line between the

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.599 
10 inches of poor line between the
adapter<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.290> system<00:03:15.620> which<00:03:16.220> gave<00:03:16.489> me

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
adapter and the system which gave me

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.610 
adapter and the system which gave me
that<00:03:16.730> extra<00:03:16.940> room<00:03:17.209> to<00:03:17.389> hook<00:03:17.720> up<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:18.049> monitor

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
that extra room to hook up this monitor

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.229 
that extra room to hook up this monitor
without<00:03:18.980> having<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.430> move<00:03:19.519> my<00:03:19.700> system<00:03:20.060> if<00:03:20.150> you

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
without having to move my system if you

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.809 
without having to move my system if you
remember<00:03:20.569> in<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.780> first<00:03:20.900> video<00:03:21.200> I<00:03:22.100> didn't

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
remember in the first video I didn't

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.000 
remember in the first video I didn't
have<00:03:22.940> enough<00:03:23.150> room<00:03:23.359> for<00:03:23.600> this<00:03:23.720> monitor<00:03:24.170> the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
have enough room for this monitor the

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.490 
have enough room for this monitor the
cord<00:03:25.489> was<00:03:25.640> long<00:03:25.849> enough<00:03:25.970> so<00:03:26.689> that<00:03:26.720> solved<00:03:27.319> that

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
cord was long enough so that solved that

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.110 
cord was long enough so that solved that
which<00:03:27.739> is

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
which is

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.210 
which is
very<00:03:28.269> good<00:03:28.480> so<00:03:28.659> this<00:03:28.810> one's<00:03:29.049> uh<00:03:29.440> made<00:03:30.190> a

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
very good so this one's uh made a

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.899 
very good so this one's uh made a
displayport<00:03:30.870> this<00:03:31.870> one<00:03:32.140> is<00:03:32.340> DVI<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:33.430> Divya

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
displayport this one is DVI and Divya

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.630 
displayport this one is DVI and Divya
now<00:03:34.569> I<00:03:34.930> do<00:03:35.349> have<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.799> adjust<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.220> color<00:03:36.400> of<00:03:36.459> the

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
now I do have to adjust the color of the

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.580 
now I do have to adjust the color of the
sand<00:03:36.790> Sun<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.060> bit<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.450> match<00:03:37.569> the<00:03:37.810> acers<00:03:38.140> as

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
sand Sun a bit to match the acers as

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.699 
sand Sun a bit to match the acers as
they<00:03:38.739> are<00:03:39.750> two<00:03:40.750> years<00:03:41.110> newer<00:03:41.440> than<00:03:41.650> the

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
they are two years newer than the

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.210 
they are two years newer than the
Samsung<00:03:42.420> so<00:03:43.420> obviously<00:03:44.290> wear<00:03:44.620> and<00:03:44.860> tear<00:03:45.069> is

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
Samsung so obviously wear and tear is

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.160 
Samsung so obviously wear and tear is
going<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.459> be<00:03:45.549> evident<00:03:45.909> I<00:03:46.060> will<00:03:46.269> adjust<00:03:46.599> those

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
going to be evident I will adjust those

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.259 
going to be evident I will adjust those
down<00:03:47.440> or<00:03:47.680> maybe<00:03:47.829> this<00:03:48.010> one<00:03:48.190> up<00:03:48.310> but<00:03:48.849> here<00:03:49.180> we<00:03:49.239> go

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
down or maybe this one up but here we go

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.789

when I enable both I get like 10 frames
per<00:06:25.419> second<00:06:25.779> when<00:06:25.870> I<00:06:25.899> disable<00:06:26.439> one<00:06:26.560> of<00:06:26.680> them<00:06:26.800> I

before<00:06:30.039> like<00:06:30.370> I<00:06:30.460> bet<00:06:30.610> 25<00:06:31.360> 30<00:06:33.180> 32<00:06:34.180> 33<00:06:35.430> but<00:06:36.430> once

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
before like I bet 25 30 32 33 but once

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.209 
before like I bet 25 30 32 33 but once
10.1<00:06:37.930> comes<00:06:38.199> out<00:06:38.379> it<00:06:38.560> will<00:06:38.589> optimize<00:06:39.490> the

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:41.219 
10.1 comes out it will optimize the

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:43.330 
10.1 comes out it will optimize the
driver<00:06:42.219> issue

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
driver issue

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.010

so<00:06:43.520> this<00:06:43.669> is<00:06:43.760> the<00:06:43.880> view<00:06:44.300> you<00:06:44.480> get<00:06:44.630> well<00:06:44.780> inside

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
so this is the view you get well inside

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.570 
so this is the view you get well inside
the<00:06:45.169> car<00:06:45.380> you<00:06:45.560> pretty<00:06:45.860> much<00:06:45.919> go<00:06:46.160> out<00:06:46.190> and<00:06:46.490> see

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.580 
the car you pretty much go out and see

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:54.879 
the car you pretty much go out and see
everything<00:06:53.020> little<00:06:54.020> awkward<00:06:54.440> to<00:06:54.470> control

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:54.889 
everything little awkward to control

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:58.470 
everything little awkward to control
with<00:06:55.100> that

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:58.480 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.990 

controller<00:06:59.140> I<00:06:59.520> like<00:07:00.520> it<00:07:00.640> better<00:07:00.760> with<00:07:00.910> a

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
controller I like it better with a

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.680
