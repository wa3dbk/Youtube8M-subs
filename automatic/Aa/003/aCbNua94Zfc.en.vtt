00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.410 
the resident floats on top of salt line
so<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.440> created<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.130> drip<00:02:24.370> system<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:25.090> feeds

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
so I created a drip system that feeds

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.330 
so I created a drip system that feeds
salt<00:02:25.900> water<00:02:26.110> into<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.739> print<00:02:26.980> container

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
salt water into the print container

causing the resin floating on top of it
to<00:02:29.980> rise<00:02:30.160> this<00:02:31.120> replaces<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.690> need<00:02:31.930> for<00:02:31.989> a

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
to rise this replaces the need for a

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.650

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
electronics to drive them I then needed

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.270

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
to detect the level of the resin so I

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.400

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
allowed me to replace all these

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.620 
allowed me to replace all these
