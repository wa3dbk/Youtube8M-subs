it<00:00:40.380> works<00:00:40.590> fine<00:00:42.290> scoots<00:00:43.290> around<00:00:43.470> very<00:00:43.860> quickly

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
it works fine scoots around very quickly

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.240 
it works fine scoots around very quickly
there's<00:00:44.550> only<00:00:44.700> one<00:00:45.000> moving<00:00:45.300> part<00:00:46.070> and<00:00:49.250> five

different settings going from straight

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.080 
different settings going from straight
to<00:00:54.200> tight<00:00:55.200> curves<00:00:55.879> tight<00:00:56.879> circles<00:00:58.820> right<00:00:59.820> now

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
to tight curves tight circles right now

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.830 
to tight curves tight circles right now
it's<00:01:00.390> running<00:01:00.990> tight<00:01:01.260> circles<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:02.690> changed<00:01:03.690> it

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
it's running tight circles I changed it

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.719 
it's running tight circles I changed it
to<00:01:05.330> straight<00:01:09.020> straight<00:01:10.020> across<00:01:10.580> even<00:01:11.580> with

to straight straight across even with

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.820 
to straight straight across even with
that<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.060> still<00:01:12.300> has<00:01:12.330> circles<00:01:13.020> involved<00:01:13.680> with

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
that it still has circles involved with

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.670 
that it still has circles involved with
it<00:01:15.259> it<00:01:16.259> would<00:01:16.440> clean<00:01:17.160> the<00:01:17.280> whole<00:01:17.430> tool<00:01:17.729> in

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
it it would clean the whole tool in

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.660 
it it would clean the whole tool in
short<00:01:19.680> time<00:01:20.360> not<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.600> look<00:01:21.810> not<00:01:22.020> too<00:01:22.259> bad<00:01:22.670> every

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
short time not to look not too bad every

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.249 
short time not to look not too bad every
once<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.940> while<00:01:23.970> I'll<00:01:24.210> get<00:01:24.360> hung<00:01:24.570> up<00:01:24.720> by<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
once a while I'll get hung up by the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.170 
once a while I'll get hung up by the
ladder<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.250> think<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.550> was<00:01:26.640> good<00:01:26.940> because

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
ladder but I think it was good because

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.180 
ladder but I think it was good because
of<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> setting<00:01:28.520> when<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.640> change<00:01:29.940> it<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.149> a

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
of the setting when I change it to a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.560 
of the setting when I change it to a
little<00:01:32.190> bit<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.640> circle<00:01:32.880> not<00:01:33.150> all<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> way

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
little bit of a circle not all the way

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.980 
little bit of a circle not all the way
down<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:34.020> small<00:01:34.680> circle<00:01:35.130> would<00:01:35.280> seem<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.360> get

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
down but small circle would seem to get

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.210 
down but small circle would seem to get
out<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.290> there<00:01:38.120> the<00:01:39.229> problem<00:01:40.229> every<00:01:41.010> was<00:01:41.190> a

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
out of there the problem every was a

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.840 
out of there the problem every was a
while<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> quote<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:43.130> opposing<00:01:44.130> coil<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.640> like

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
while a quote the opposing coil up like

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.750 
while a quote the opposing coil up like
that<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.860> change<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.130> setting<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.640> it

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
that I have to change the setting so it

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.300 
that I have to change the setting so it
wouldn't<00:01:48.030> do<00:01:48.150> that<00:01:48.229> but<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.979> think<00:01:50.190> it's

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
wouldn't do that but and I think it's

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.080 
wouldn't do that but and I think it's
related<00:01:50.940> to<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.600> output<00:01:52.530> flow<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
related to the output flow in the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.770 
related to the output flow in the
direction<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.820> once<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.299> while<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.420> would<00:01:57.659> get

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
direction so once in a while I would get

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.600 
direction so once in a while I would get
stuck<00:01:58.140> down<00:01:58.619> by<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.189> ladder<00:01:59.580> and<00:02:01.460> it<00:02:02.460> would

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
stuck down by this ladder and it would

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.630 
stuck down by this ladder and it would
work<00:02:02.820> its<00:02:03.000> way<00:02:03.150> out<00:02:03.360> eventually<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.640> think

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
work its way out eventually but I think

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.660 
work its way out eventually but I think
the<00:02:05.909> setting<00:02:06.420> again<00:02:07.260> was<00:02:07.500> not<00:02:07.799> quite<00:02:08.399> right

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
the setting again was not quite right

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.520 
the setting again was not quite right
there<00:02:09.510> you<00:02:09.600> can<00:02:09.720> see<00:02:09.750> it's<00:02:10.049> doing<00:02:10.560> some<00:02:11.090> major

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
there you can see it's doing some major

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.600 
there you can see it's doing some major
scrubbing<00:02:14.239> vibrating<00:02:16.160> but<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.280> did<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> good

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
scrubbing vibrating but it did a good

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.900 
scrubbing vibrating but it did a good
job<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:18.209> was<00:02:18.750> pleased<00:02:19.049> with<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.640> creepy<00:02:20.640> crawly

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
job I was pleased with it creepy crawly

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:39.990 
job I was pleased with it creepy crawly
little<00:02:21.540> shark

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.060 

you
