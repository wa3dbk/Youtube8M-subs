00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.299
 very good everyone welcome again 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:06.580
 textile in this video I will leave the 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:09.190
 this week's guides to complete the 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.070
 Assault of the weekly or heroic decline 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.860
 weekly to be possible to do it alone 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.300
 that is not following this guide is not 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.910
 makes the truth very complicated 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.330
 facilitated and we go there we will have to 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.130
 have guns vacuum and solar does not have 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.290
 multiply the damages of any kind 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.520
 but the enemies have a solar shield and 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.020
 of the year we're going to see the weapons that 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.750
 would come well for example the epilogue of 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.120
 action action if we do not have the vision 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.450
 of confluence also that is solar the 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.850
 icebreaker very important or if not the 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.450
 light fusion care that is solar and 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.980
 rocket launcher you could use solar 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.450
 damage by solar once 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.190
 we started the mission and the first part 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.020
 where we will have a little complication 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.760
 it would be in this voucher and what we will have 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.250
 what to do here from here back clean 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.680
 a little here this area of ​​enemies 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.770
 this from here to kill him from here 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.600
 from attack 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.350
 which is made a bit easier since 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.900
 we are further away and when we can 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.940
 see coming the shots and others and 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.400
 we started a little bit in this area and 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.410
 when we have it clean or 67 enemies 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.350
 we can the mark to the end 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.360
 practically okay, we do not take it here 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.610
 you do not need to kill anyone else and with 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.850
 very careful of those enemies that 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.750
 they are down here we can skirt 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.400
 is doing it only if they kill us 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.950
 we will return to the orbit but as in the 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.500
 principle then well does not matter either 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.540
 A lot is worth it but as I say it is not an area 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.640
 very complicated if we do it and what 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.560
 makes us stop and the next one would be 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.180
 is that we will simply have to kill 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.210
 to the little ones this with my shield 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.220
 graph that with the action you see it is a 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.220
 bit simpler and we go down from afar 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.590
 we keep going forward and here 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.330
 well the same with the sniper the 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.700
 icebreaker since nothing is generated for 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.680
 comes very well practically this 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.630
 area we can do the whole from here 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.360
 if you do not have and if we go everything goes and 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.890
 we want to ensure killing the adobe 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.869
 solar that are here on the left 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.360
 pulling grenades and we have grenades 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.400
 solar or even putting us here a 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.440
 poquillo is worth here in these areas 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.269
 killing them here on the left as it 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.940
 it hides enough we could kill ourselves 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.380
 from here the enemy is worth the three 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.299
 great is what we have to kill is 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.100
 printed on rising up and from 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.540
 far we could kill him badly in the case 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.069
 that we have a more or less equipillo 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.049
 well let's be three we could meet 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.330
 here once we eliminate the first 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.370
 this ship will leave to bring the second 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.350
 this ship his thing would be to give him with the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.650
 rocket launcher and another one down here 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.160
 you practically eliminate them all 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.180
 It gives more than would the second ss 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.940
 enemy that is the one that we will have to 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.069
 to kill that as I say it usually comes here 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.380
 up and if we take things from that area 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.990
 Well, the truth is that we can 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.540
 treat it while it comes 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.250
 If I say that, we put here if we have 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.490
 a team more or less eggs on the level 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.590
 29 or 30 with 23 and we can see going here 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.440
 to revive him since it's a little more 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.870
 thin this from behind it is done 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.550
 much simpler but we add a 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.990
 poquillo is better we eliminate all 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.050
 enemies here once we eliminate it 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.819
 we will have to kill the tank that comes out 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.010
 now it's worth 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.719
 until what if we are like I said 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.189
 as long as we have a good team there 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:22.280
 we can come here to the rock that 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:24.620
 magazine 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.709
 one or two people here I'm studying 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.860
 because they can give you and kill you okay and 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.660
 we stop at the wheels of the wheel only 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.400
 the propellers this is worth the 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.310
 cannon that will fire your cannon 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.050
 whenever we are at your point of view 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.910
 once if you aim with the cannon 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.160
 for example and you take off by the canyon 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.900
 stop shooting okay and if we put on 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.120
 here back it's worth that only more more 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.280
 always assured taking into account that 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.260
 we are not right behind a rock 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.819
 because the impact that shoots up in the 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.890
 rock and from next door to attract impact 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.030
 it kills us it's also worth it 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.170
 long in case we can 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:04.010
 dodge because you can dodge 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:06.320
 can be well equipped anywhere and 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.780
 we finish with the pond and we continue 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.600
 forward practically all this is very 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.390
 simple here I get the webs because we're going 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.400
 anything goes and you can pass the 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.769
 pass it without killing anyone but good 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.840
 killing t11 from behind super simple 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.960
 in five minutes that area ends 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.180
 ok here we were giving the pass because the 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.520
 enemies a little bit are level 28 I think 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.380
 so it can be done and this area by 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.450
 same is super simple doing it 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.700
 little by little he left me we are not going to have 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.700
 none complication to now we 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.430
 we put in it the final gesture that times 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.169
 Well, I guess you'll all know in the 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.540
 area to kill it is worth it is super 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.890
 simple if we go alone we are also going to 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.690
 take a little longer but it's very 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.070
 simple we eliminate these two if 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.750
 we want to see those who are here to 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.750
 the left to the most you go out and 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.340
 we come running before the 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.410
 enemy this area I imagine that the 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.260
 you will know many of you but for the 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.640
 that makes us to catch here you have 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.320
 ok we go here and here we have 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.300
 all available for all areas 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.000
 available where you can put him 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.569
 so much here in this area here is worth of 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.680
 where does it come from and we will have 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:16.780
 shot from here okay I say what 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.090
 what can we give him as we are seeing 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.860
 and more that we will have to arm ourselves here 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.300
 we went up and started killing him 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.050
 when we will choose a little life on 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.910
 enemy will go to the other area and 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.500
 what we have to do from here then 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.300
 We can give you a ticket with care that 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.320
 do not kill us because the rule that makes you 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.639
 a very big damage and while we have 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.139
 a partner who is firing from 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.479
 that area here we can go cleaning 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:43.129
 these areas here the enemy that is 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.229
 super simple as you can see the rockets 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:47.479
 big you tubs practically none 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:49.699
 come in and we can kill them without any 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.340
 problem goes from here to the enemy 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.930
 it is also given and the partner if 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.090
 we have a partner if we are alone 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.449
 no but if we want a partner always 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.770
 can go cleaning the enemy zone and 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:02.870
 nothing this is the strategy to follow is 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.659
 super simple doing it this way 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.210
 and doing not only in half an hour what 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:10.969
 have what they have ready is very very 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.000
 practical so nothing guys that has been 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:15.620
 all that has been this week's guide 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.659
 I hope you liked it to be from 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.009
 help also when you go to do the 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:23.180
 I command the assault and I retire here 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:24.650
 subscribe vilar and if you liked it if 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.039
 you like videos and want to know more 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:31.990
 and have more advice and how it is and we 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.990
 we see in the next video see you later
