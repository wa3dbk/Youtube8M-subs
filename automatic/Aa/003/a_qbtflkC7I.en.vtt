00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
video is going to cover stage 24 sums as

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.879 
video is going to cover stage 24 sums as
it's<00:00:11.700> tricky<00:00:11.969> I'm<00:00:12.240> not<00:00:12.300> gonna<00:00:12.570> lie<00:00:12.809> took<00:00:13.710> me

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
it's tricky I'm not gonna lie took me

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.080 
it's tricky I'm not gonna lie took me
many<00:00:14.040> many<00:00:14.190> tries<00:00:14.700> well<00:00:15.540> yeah<00:00:16.880> so<00:00:17.880> there's

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
many many tries well yeah so there's

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.359 
many many tries well yeah so there's
some<00:00:18.300> edits<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.779> me<00:00:18.960> undoing<00:00:19.410> or<00:00:19.800> sitting<00:00:20.220> and

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
some edits of me undoing or sitting and

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.640 
some edits of me undoing or sitting and
thinking<00:00:20.750> but<00:00:21.750> here<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.020> go<00:00:22.050> we're<00:00:22.500> going<00:00:22.590> to

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
thinking but here we go we're going to

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.320 
thinking but here we go we're going to
create<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.010> small<00:00:23.400> staircase<00:00:23.699> up<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
create a small staircase up to the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.750 
create a small staircase up to the
middle<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:25.070> eventually<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:26.099> are<00:00:26.400> going<00:00:26.640> to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
middle and eventually we are going to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.310 
middle and eventually we are going to
create<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.060> bridge<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.599> get<00:00:27.689> across<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.289> that

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
create a bridge to get across to that

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.750 
create a bridge to get across to that
corsage<00:00:29.359> so<00:00:31.790> it's<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.850> two<00:00:33.120> brick<00:00:33.450> bridge<00:00:34.760> there

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
corsage so it's a two brick bridge there

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.650 
corsage so it's a two brick bridge there
we<00:00:35.880> go<00:00:36.030> oh<00:00:36.239> come<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.140> now<00:00:38.510> apparently<00:00:39.510> this
