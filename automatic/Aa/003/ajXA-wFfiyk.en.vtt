00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 or 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.710
 so here it is here on the edges of 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.300
 the river mira to the emirates in 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.090
 the yellow alert that will start my 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.430
 hike on the trail of the road to 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.440
 mid cetin to a first part of 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.600
 inland on the exit 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.820
 classic and a second part that goes 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:47.559
 take full south direction to 17 ch or 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:51.739
 there I will be on the fishermen's trail 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:54.999
 good walk to all under the colors of 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.999
 wool living in Portugal 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.110
 the sentinel was born in an assembly 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:19.190
 and sank general gene from our 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.530
 association account 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.780
 heard we looked at made life 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.810
 to algarve yam then right away 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.000
 several 2 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.159
 associated with the message we want 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.680
 to do here is that they show us 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.100
 so we did the project of which four 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.869
 years we have 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:44.070
 setting up road hiking war 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:47.190
 years that goes from santiag of 4.5 up in 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.940
 kapissa grech and parallel the way 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.509
 fishermen 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.869
 because we have seen that there are small 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.340
 paths very very pretty and so we did 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.820
 of the two roads to make the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.820
 hikes 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.569
 what is the particularity of this path 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.519
 What can we see what 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.640
 that hikers can can there 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.849
 find what you're expecting here it's 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:35.500
 especially a very very beautiful nature of 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:38.769
 people with that the wrestlers not touch 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.930
 still early but for tourism not 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:45.150
 very modern or maybe the paths 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.530
 are really very very pretty with nature 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.459
 it is very beautiful and a lot of geneviÃ¨ve 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.459
 Woodland 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.439
 they are completely hallucinating it's 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.230
 at cork when we look at them they have 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:01.629
 terrifying forms and it goes into 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.959
 all the senses they have a cork that is 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:07.180
 extremely marked it looks like the skin 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.280
 tanned india an old man from 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.319
 ladakh 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.700
 we really feel that Caesar 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.920
 will start a little bit 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.920
 when as in the Lord of the Rings 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:35.610
 and we get the link game every 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:38.560
 how much was 9.9 in failure 9 in 2015 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:42.340
 we will lose next extension 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.870
 I do not know that, it tends to this transfer 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.870
 if it's not good you do not know 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.760
 I 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.950
 m 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:11.500
 at the francas accommodation level so 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:16.060
 which mark the two routes of 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:21.940
 hike what are the common points 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:25.330
 between pomegranate and we have houses very 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:30.160
 very diverse we have houses small of 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:32.949

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.760

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.840

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.190
 2 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.610
 the way of the fishermen as they say 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.350

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.900
 here people they lived thur and 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.640

 fishermen they were always going they go 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:20.480
 always along the coast

 call fishermen with can and 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:27.080
