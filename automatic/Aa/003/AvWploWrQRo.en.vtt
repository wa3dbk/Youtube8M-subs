his<00:02:32.490> beast<00:02:32.730> in<00:02:32.970> my<00:02:33.090> opinion<00:02:33.300> there's<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.690> couple

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
his beast in my opinion there's a couple

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.560 
his beast in my opinion there's a couple
times<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.860> went<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.430> few<00:02:35.550> seconds<00:02:35.970> without

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
times that I went a few seconds without

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.290 
times that I went a few seconds without
getting<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.170> kill<00:02:37.440> which<00:02:38.310> maybe<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:38.970> could<00:02:39.150> have

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
getting a kill which maybe I could have

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.360
