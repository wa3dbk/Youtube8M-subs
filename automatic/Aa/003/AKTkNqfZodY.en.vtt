00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
the front of the gun so it makes it a

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.090 
the front of the gun so it makes it a
little<00:03:08.060> more<00:03:08.180> unwieldy<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.020> I<00:03:09.440> will<00:03:09.650> say<00:03:09.860> that

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
little more unwieldy and I will say that

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.740 
little more unwieldy and I will say that
some<00:03:10.370> of<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:10.520> weight<00:03:10.820> is<00:03:11.000> in<00:03:11.150> these<00:03:11.300> barrels

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
some of that weight is in these barrels

some of that weight is in these barrels
this<00:03:12.260> Rock<00:03:12.710> River<00:03:12.920> ar-15<00:03:13.580> has<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:14.120> heavy

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.930 
contour barrel and this colt has the
skinnier<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:18.620> think<00:03:19.190> it's<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.430> government

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
skinnier I think it's the government

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.850 
skinnier I think it's the government
contour<00:03:20.330> barrel<00:03:20.660> or<00:03:20.780> also<00:03:20.989> known<00:03:21.140> as<00:03:21.290> pencil

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
contour barrel or also known as pencil

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.890 
contour barrel or also known as pencil
barrel<00:03:22.130> but<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:23.030> can<00:03:23.209> see<00:03:23.420> there's<00:03:23.660> quite<00:03:23.810> a

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
barrel but you can see there's quite a

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.270 
barrel but you can see there's quite a
bit<00:03:24.110> of<00:03:24.140> difference<00:03:24.500> in<00:03:24.620> size<00:03:24.890> there<00:03:25.130> so

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
bit of difference in size there so

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.410 
bit of difference in size there so
there's<00:03:25.430> a<00:03:25.520> lot<00:03:25.670> of<00:03:25.700> weight<00:03:25.880> in<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.000> barrel

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
there's a lot of weight in that barrel

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.070 
there's a lot of weight in that barrel
as<00:03:26.540> well<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:28.010> there's<00:03:28.430> $1,000<00:03:29.330> make<00:03:29.570> this<00:03:29.780> gun

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
as well so there's $1,000 make this gun

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.810 
as well so there's $1,000 make this gun
more<00:03:30.860> usable<00:03:31.459> more<00:03:31.820> accurate<00:03:32.300> more<00:03:32.450> reliable

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:43.020 

or<00:03:37.820> is<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.150> better<00:03:38.270> just<00:03:38.570> keep<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:38.810> simple<00:03:39.170> I

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:53.540
