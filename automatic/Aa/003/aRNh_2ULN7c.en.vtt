now<00:00:05.879> recently<00:00:06.390> I've<00:00:06.750> been<00:00:07.080> reflecting<00:00:07.680> on

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
now recently I've been reflecting on

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.500 
now recently I've been reflecting on
what<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:07.980> want<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.490> get<00:00:08.580> out<00:00:08.760> of<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.120> Oxford

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
project and in doing so I have been

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.740 
project and in doing so I have been
thinking<00:00:13.799> about<00:00:14.219> what<00:00:14.790> sort<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.059> questions<00:00:15.509> I

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
thinking about what sort of questions I

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.480 
thinking about what sort of questions I
would<00:00:15.809> have<00:00:16.109> had<00:00:17.330> for<00:00:18.740> someone<00:00:19.740> else<00:00:19.890> doing

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
would have had for someone else doing

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.070 
would have had for someone else doing
the<00:00:20.730> project<00:00:21.470> say<00:00:22.670> three<00:00:23.670> years<00:00:23.820> ago<00:00:24.029> when<00:00:24.630> I

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
the project say three years ago when I

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.380 
the project say three years ago when I
was<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.740> process<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.519> deciding<00:00:27.029> which

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
was in the process of deciding which

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.810 
was in the process of deciding which
university<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.080> wanted<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.619> go<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.369> what<00:00:29.760> I

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
university I wanted to go to and what I

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.889 
university I wanted to go to and what I
wanted<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.390> study<00:00:30.740> and<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.450> I<00:00:33.450> have<00:00:33.809> to

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
wanted to study and so on and I have to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.810 
wanted to study and so on and I have to
say<00:00:34.079> one<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> things<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.190> really<00:00:35.520> stood

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
say one of the things that really stood

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.090 
say one of the things that really stood
out<00:00:35.969> for<00:00:36.030> me<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:37.110> question<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.739> was<00:00:37.890> at<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
out for me the question that was at the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.240 
out for me the question that was at the
forefront<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.879> my<00:00:39.180> mind<00:00:39.620> when<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.980> was

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
forefront of my mind when I was

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.299 
forefront of my mind when I was
considering<00:00:41.640> applying<00:00:41.969> was<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.350> that

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
considering applying was the one that

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.840 
considering applying was the one that

school<00:00:48.120> students<00:00:48.629> now<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.620> know<00:00:49.800> some<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.190> you

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
school students now I know some of you

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.470 
school students now I know some of you
may<00:00:50.640> think<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:53.480> particularly

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
may think that this is a particularly

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.340 
may think that this is a particularly
controversial<00:00:55.050> or<00:00:56.329> maybe<00:00:57.329> even<00:00:57.420> pointless<00:00:58.050> or

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
controversial or maybe even pointless or

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.939 
controversial or maybe even pointless or
ridiculous<00:00:59.420> title<00:01:00.420> but<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.230> said<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.739> was<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
ridiculous title but as I said it was a

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.910 
ridiculous title but as I said it was a
question<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:03.949> could<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.129> make<00:01:05.430> or<00:01:05.640> break

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
question that could really make or break

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.990 
question that could really make or break
my<00:01:08.119> decision<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.470> whether<00:01:10.470> or<00:01:10.590> not<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:11.000> applied

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
my decision of whether or not I applied

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.890 
my decision of whether or not I applied
to<00:01:12.270> Oxford<00:01:12.689> or<00:01:13.110> Cambridge<00:01:14.450> while<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.479> was<00:01:15.780> in

students at Oxford and I have to say
this<00:02:04.770> was<00:02:05.070> something<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:06.180> was<00:02:06.960> very<00:02:08.119> aware

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
this was something that I was very aware

this was something that I was very aware
of<00:02:09.179> when<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.170> was<00:02:10.470> thinking<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.280> applying<00:02:11.610> here

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
of when I was thinking of applying here

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.760 
of when I was thinking of applying here
there<00:02:12.900> are

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
there are

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.790 
there are
so<00:02:13.980> many<00:02:14.340> sort<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:15.350> traditions<00:02:16.350> things<00:02:16.650> that

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
so many sort of traditions things that

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.530 
so many sort of traditions things that
I've<00:02:16.890> talked<00:02:17.160> about<00:02:17.430> before<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.420> know

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
I've talked about before and you know

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.870 
I've talked about before and you know
sometimes<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.290> buy<00:02:19.980> worried<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.760> my

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
sometimes I buy worried that in my

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.430 
sometimes I buy worried that in my
videos<00:02:21.180> when<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.450> talk<00:02:21.720> about<00:02:22.050> things<00:02:22.320> like

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
videos when I talk about things like

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.520 
videos when I talk about things like
matriculation<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.790> sub<00:02:24.450> bus<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:25.050> use<00:02:25.230> words

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
matriculation and sub bus can use words

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.890 
matriculation and sub bus can use words
like<00:02:25.740> pitch<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:26.790> on

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
like pitch and so on

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.770 
like pitch and so on
words<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:28.980> are<00:02:29.310> completely<00:02:29.970> meaningless<00:02:30.210> to

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
words that are completely meaningless to

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.990 
words that are completely meaningless to
anyone<00:02:31.140> outside<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.800> bubble<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:35.000> create

anyone outside the bubble that I create
the<00:02:36.150> feeling<00:02:36.570> that<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.870> had<00:02:37.200> when<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.770> was

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
the feeling that I had when I was

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.660 
the feeling that I had when I was
applying<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.570> feeling<00:02:39.960> of

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
applying and that is that feeling of

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.840 
applying and that is that feeling of
displace<00:02:41.670> ISM<00:02:42.030> for<00:02:42.150> me<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:43.670> could<00:02:44.670> never

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
displace ISM for me that I could never

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.720 
displace ISM for me that I could never
really<00:02:45.120> fit<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.570> here<00:02:45.840> because<00:02:46.050> I<00:02:46.440> was<00:02:47.370> used<00:02:47.610> to

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
really fit in here because I was used to

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.410 
really fit in here because I was used to
what<00:02:47.940> was<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.510> fairly<00:02:49.170> average<00:02:50.240> quite<00:02:51.240> basic

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
what was a fairly average quite basic

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.210 
what was a fairly average quite basic
and<00:02:51.930> quite<00:02:52.170> frankly<00:02:52.350> dull<00:02:52.770> life<00:02:54.020> before<00:02:55.020> I<00:02:55.350> I

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
and quite frankly dull life before I I

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.240 
and quite frankly dull life before I I
got<00:02:57.150> here<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.600> so<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.260> was<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:58.560> easy<00:02:58.770> for<00:02:58.950> me<00:02:59.220> to

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
got here and so it was so easy for me to

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.500 
got here and so it was so easy for me to
look<00:02:59.550> at<00:02:59.700> Oxford<00:03:00.150> from<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.810> distance<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:02.510> do

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
look at Oxford from a distance and do

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.590 
look at Oxford from a distance and do
you<00:03:03.630> think<00:03:03.780> that's<00:03:04.470> that's<00:03:05.010> not<00:03:05.490> for<00:03:05.730> me

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
you think that's that's not for me

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.200 
you think that's that's not for me
an<00:03:06.870> Oxford<00:03:07.230> or<00:03:07.620> Cambridge<00:03:07.700> education<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.910> the

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
an Oxford or Cambridge education is the

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.170 
an Oxford or Cambridge education is the
prerogative<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:10.550> a<00:03:11.550> wealthy<00:03:12.480> elite<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:14.180> it's

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
prerogative of a wealthy elite and it's

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.060 
prerogative of a wealthy elite and it's
it's<00:03:15.480> quite<00:03:15.720> amusing<00:03:15.930> because<00:03:16.440> now<00:03:16.740> I<00:03:16.770> look

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
it's quite amusing because now I look

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.480 
it's quite amusing because now I look
back<00:03:17.310> on<00:03:17.490> it<00:03:17.520> and<00:03:17.850> I<00:03:18.360> see<00:03:18.810> just<00:03:19.590> how<00:03:19.980> ridiculous

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
back on it and I see just how ridiculous

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.420 
back on it and I see just how ridiculous
that<00:03:20.670> was<00:03:21.000> i<00:03:21.440> how<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.709> impression<00:03:23.280> was

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
that was i how that impression was

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.900 
that was i how that impression was
created<00:03:23.910> but<00:03:24.150> now<00:03:24.360> I<00:03:24.660> see<00:03:25.370> just<00:03:26.370> how<00:03:26.610> wrong<00:03:26.880> I

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
created but now I see just how wrong I

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.770 
created but now I see just how wrong I
was<00:03:27.270> in<00:03:27.660> assuming<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.290> Oxford<00:03:29.010> wasn't<00:03:29.610> me

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
quite a ludicrous notion about

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.620 
quite a ludicrous notion about
friendship<00:05:00.430> groups<00:05:00.700> that<00:05:00.970> would<00:05:01.090> form<00:05:01.360> I<00:05:01.600> I

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
friendship groups that would form I I

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.060 
friendship groups that would form I I
thought<00:05:01.960> it<00:05:02.110> would<00:05:02.200> be<00:05:02.320> very<00:05:02.740> much<00:05:02.860> a<00:05:03.010> case<00:05:03.340> of

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
thought it would be very much a case of

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.580 
thought it would be very much a case of
two<00:05:06.070> discrete<00:05:06.520> groups<00:05:06.880> of<00:05:07.350> state<00:05:08.350> school

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
two discrete groups of state school

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.830 
two discrete groups of state school
students<00:05:09.130> and<00:05:09.310> in<00:05:09.690> privately<00:05:10.690> educated

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
students and in privately educated

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.050 
students and in privately educated
students<00:05:11.710> who<00:05:11.980> didn't<00:05:12.400> really<00:05:12.550> have<00:05:12.790> much<00:05:13.030> in

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
students who didn't really have much in

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.470 
students who didn't really have much in
common<00:05:13.530> now<00:05:14.530> I<00:05:14.560> see<00:05:15.010> just<00:05:15.430> how<00:05:15.700> absurd<00:05:16.120> that

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
common now I see just how absurd that

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.670 
common now I see just how absurd that
was<00:05:16.840> because<00:05:18.840> your<00:05:19.840> educational<00:05:20.530> background

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
was because your educational background

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.280 
was because your educational background
is<00:05:21.250> something<00:05:21.760> that<00:05:22.000> is<00:05:22.270> very<00:05:22.930> rarely

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
is something that is very rarely

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.280 
is something that is very rarely
mentioned<00:05:23.740> in<00:05:23.860> fact<00:05:24.130> I<00:05:25.000> think<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.260> only

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
mentioned in fact I think the only

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.100 
mentioned in fact I think the only
reason<00:05:26.740> people<00:05:27.330> actually<00:05:28.330> know<00:05:28.660> about<00:05:28.960> my

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
reason people actually know about my

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.680 
reason people actually know about my
state<00:05:29.410> school<00:05:29.800> background<00:05:30.010> is<00:05:30.580> because<00:05:31.419> I

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
state school background is because I

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.450 
state school background is because I
don't<00:05:32.140> stop<00:05:32.380> banging<00:05:32.770> on<00:05:32.860> about<00:05:32.919> it<00:05:33.160> in<00:05:33.340> these

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
don't stop banging on about it in these

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.969 
don't stop banging on about it in these
videos<00:05:33.820> and<00:05:34.690> so<00:05:35.080> it<00:05:35.229> does<00:05:35.410> become<00:05:35.590> something

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
videos and so it does become something

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.980 
videos and so it does become something
that<00:05:36.190> is<00:05:36.640> very<00:05:37.090> irrelevant<00:05:37.930> as<00:05:38.229> does<00:05:39.100> your

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
that is very irrelevant as does your

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.300 
that is very irrelevant as does your
a-level<00:05:40.990> results<00:05:41.020> I<00:05:41.710> don't<00:05:42.040> think<00:05:42.190> I've<00:05:42.280> ever

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
a-level results I don't think I've ever

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.620 
a-level results I don't think I've ever
told<00:05:43.150> anyone<00:05:43.479> what<00:05:43.750> I<00:05:43.780> got<00:05:44.050> in<00:05:44.290> my<00:05:44.440> a-levels

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
told anyone what I got in my a-levels

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.490 
told anyone what I got in my a-levels
your<00:05:46.919> parents<00:05:48.690> university<00:05:49.690> education<00:05:50.140> or

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
your parents university education or

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.000 
your parents university education or
your<00:05:50.530> parents<00:05:51.070> careers<00:05:52.440> you<00:05:53.440> know<00:05:53.560> the<00:05:53.830> sort

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
your parents careers you know the sort

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.950 
your parents careers you know the sort
of<00:05:54.040> area<00:05:54.490> that<00:05:54.550> you<00:05:54.850> live<00:05:55.030> in<00:05:55.090> none<00:05:55.690> of<00:05:55.720> these

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
of area that you live in none of these

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.760 
of area that you live in none of these
things<00:05:56.260> are<00:05:56.680> really<00:05:57.100> really<00:05:58.050> discussed<00:05:59.050> and

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
things are really really discussed and

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.310 
things are really really discussed and
so<00:05:59.890> I<00:05:59.919> suppose<00:06:00.250> to<00:06:00.490> sort<00:06:00.669> of<00:06:00.700> wrap<00:06:00.940> up<00:06:01.200> what<00:06:02.200> I'm

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
so I suppose to sort of wrap up what I'm

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.540 
so I suppose to sort of wrap up what I'm
really<00:06:02.470> trying<00:06:02.740> to<00:06:02.800> get<00:06:02.950> across<00:06:03.340> in<00:06:03.520> this

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
really trying to get across in this

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.210 
really trying to get across in this
video<00:06:03.970> is<00:06:04.270> in<00:06:04.990> answer<00:06:05.140> to<00:06:05.290> the<00:06:05.470> question<00:06:05.500> is

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
video is in answer to the question is

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.460 
video is in answer to the question is
Oxford<00:06:06.850> for<00:06:07.120> state<00:06:07.300> school<00:06:07.540> students<00:06:08.020> I<00:06:08.229> would

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
Oxford for state school students I would

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.180 
Oxford for state school students I would
say<00:06:08.979> well<00:06:09.820> no<00:06:10.060> but<00:06:10.479> it's<00:06:10.630> not<00:06:10.900> for

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
say well no but it's not for

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.380 
say well no but it's not for
independently<00:06:12.190> educated<00:06:13.150> students<00:06:13.690> either

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390

independently educated students either
you<00:06:16.390> get<00:06:16.540> into<00:06:16.840> Oxford

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
you get into Oxford

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.530 
you get into Oxford
on<00:06:17.560> the<00:06:17.830> basis<00:06:18.280> of<00:06:18.900> educational<00:06:19.900> merit<00:06:20.350> and

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
on the basis of educational merit and

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.930 
on the basis of educational merit and
while<00:06:22.540> you<00:06:22.690> could<00:06:22.930> argue<00:06:23.740> that<00:06:23.770> that<00:06:24.190> is<00:06:24.490> to

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
while you could argue that that is to

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.570 
while you could argue that that is to
some<00:06:25.120> extent<00:06:25.290> influenced<00:06:26.290> by<00:06:26.680> your

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
some extent influenced by your

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.360 
some extent influenced by your
background<00:06:28.540> it's<00:06:28.930> something<00:06:29.530> that<00:06:29.860> Oxford

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
background it's something that Oxford

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.350 
background it's something that Oxford
does<00:06:30.550> take<00:06:30.820> into<00:06:31.090> account<00:06:31.419> and<00:06:31.840> as<00:06:32.020> always

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
does take into account and as always

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.690 
does take into account and as always

what<00:06:39.940> feels<00:06:40.180> like<00:06:40.330> a<00:06:40.780> hundred<00:06:41.320> times<00:06:41.530> before

concern please do reconsider because if

I was like three or so years ago and yet
here<00:07:04.150> I<00:07:04.180> am<00:07:04.330> in<00:07:04.840> spite<00:07:05.260> of<00:07:05.290> having<00:07:05.710> what<00:07:06.460> was

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610 
here I am in spite of having what was

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.470 
here I am in spite of having what was
quite<00:07:06.760> a<00:07:06.880> rough<00:07:07.240> first<00:07:07.810> term<00:07:08.400> and<00:07:09.400> in<00:07:09.880> spite<00:07:10.450> of

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:10.480 
quite a rough first term and in spite of

quite a rough first term and in spite of

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:14.500 
being ill through quite a lot of my time

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.670 
being ill through quite a lot of my time
here<00:07:14.800> in<00:07:14.920> Oxford<00:07:15.220> even<00:07:15.580> during<00:07:15.790> this<00:07:16.030> term

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
here in Oxford even during this term

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.880 
here in Oxford even during this term
every<00:07:17.680> day<00:07:17.890> I<00:07:18.220> loved<00:07:19.000> it<00:07:19.180> more<00:07:19.810> and<00:07:20.260> more<00:07:20.350> and<00:07:20.800> I

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:20.890 
every day I loved it more and more and I

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.950 
every day I loved it more and more and I
really<00:07:21.310> wouldn't<00:07:21.520> choose<00:07:21.940> to<00:07:21.970> be<00:07:22.360> anywhere

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 
really wouldn't choose to be anywhere

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.440 
really wouldn't choose to be anywhere
else<00:07:23.140> so<00:07:23.440> I<00:07:23.770> hope<00:07:24.010> this<00:07:24.160> video<00:07:24.340> hasn't<00:07:24.970> seemed

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:25.450 
else so I hope this video hasn't seemed
