the dongle that comes with it the
unifying<00:01:37.560> dongle<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:39.030> would<00:01:39.150> allow<00:01:39.299> you

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
unifying dongle and that would allow you

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.200 
unifying dongle and that would allow you
to<00:01:39.600> connect<00:01:39.990> wirelessly<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:41.100> your<00:01:41.430> pc<00:01:42.030> or

the<00:01:56.070> unifying<00:01:56.520> dongle<00:01:56.909> itself<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:58.020> right<00:01:58.380> at

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the unifying dongle itself is right at

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.709 
the unifying dongle itself is right at
the<00:01:58.619> back<00:01:58.799> here<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.670> as<00:01:59.880> you<00:01:59.969> can<00:02:00.090> see<00:02:00.360> it's

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
the back here so as you can see it's

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.480 
the back here so as you can see it's
right<00:02:01.020> there<00:02:01.229> really<00:02:01.590> tiny<00:02:01.829> as<00:02:02.040> well<00:02:02.280> and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
right there really tiny as well and

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.499 
right there really tiny as well and
discreet<00:02:02.909> if<00:02:03.030> you're<00:02:03.149> going<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.299> be<00:02:03.390> using

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
discreet if you're going to be using

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.850 
discreet if you're going to be using
that<00:02:03.689> with<00:02:03.810> your<00:02:03.930> laptop<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.290> stuff<00:02:04.649> and

that with your laptop and stuff and

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.830 
that with your laptop and stuff and
you've<00:02:05.219> got<00:02:05.399> an<00:02:05.460> extender<00:02:06.000> as<00:02:06.149> well<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.600> if<00:02:06.689> you

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
you've got an extender as well so if you

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.139 
you've got an extender as well so if you
need<00:02:07.320> an<00:02:07.469> extender<00:02:08.069> you've<00:02:08.429> got<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
need an extender you've got that in the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.029 
need an extender you've got that in the
packaging<00:02:09.599> as<00:02:09.720> well<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.289> think<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:10.950> safe

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
packaging as well so I think it's safe

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.530 
packaging as well so I think it's safe
to<00:02:11.099> say<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.670> everything<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.540> need<00:02:12.810> will<00:02:13.170> be

to say that everything you need will be

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.910 
to say that everything you need will be
the<00:02:13.659> packaging<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:14.260> you<00:02:14.319> don't<00:02:14.530> have<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.739> buy

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
the packaging so you don't have to buy

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.830 
the packaging so you don't have to buy
anything<00:02:14.950> extra<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.390> keyboard<00:02:16.750> itself

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
anything extra so the keyboard itself

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.440 
anything extra so the keyboard itself
it's<00:02:17.379> quite<00:02:17.799> slim<00:02:18.219> so<00:02:18.670> it's<00:02:18.790> slimline<00:02:19.180> put<00:02:19.420> a

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
it's quite slim so it's slimline put a

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.179 
it's quite slim so it's slimline put a
slim<00:02:19.689> profile<00:02:20.079> there<00:02:20.260> as<00:02:20.319> you<00:02:20.409> can<00:02:20.560> see<00:02:20.769> it's

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
slim profile there as you can see it's

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.280 
slim profile there as you can see it's
really<00:02:21.459> thin<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:21.819> if<00:02:22.750> we<00:02:22.900> look<00:02:22.989> underneath

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
really thin and if we look underneath

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.319 
really thin and if we look underneath
there<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:23.739> get<00:02:23.890> your<00:02:24.189> stabilizers<00:02:25.120> so

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
there you get your stabilizers so

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.030 
there you get your stabilizers so
there's<00:02:25.540> one<00:02:25.780> there<00:02:26.019> and<00:02:26.200> there's<00:02:26.680> one<00:02:26.859> on

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
there's one there and there's one on

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.309 
there's one there and there's one on
that<00:02:27.189> side<00:02:27.219> as<00:02:27.579> well<00:02:27.819> so<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.090> can<00:02:28.209> just<00:02:28.239> do<00:02:28.510> you

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
that side as well so you can just do you

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.589 
that side as well so you can just do you
can<00:02:29.469> stabilize<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:30.099> and<00:02:30.159> raise<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.430> up<00:02:30.640> at<00:02:31.450> the

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
can stabilize it and raise it up at the

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.449 
can stabilize it and raise it up at the
top<00:02:31.780> with<00:02:32.260> those<00:02:32.500> so<00:02:32.769> if<00:02:32.829> you'd<00:02:32.950> prefer<00:02:33.099> it

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
top with those so if you'd prefer it

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.789 
top with those so if you'd prefer it
raised<00:02:33.670> up<00:02:33.909> you<00:02:34.540> can<00:02:34.720> do<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:34.870> otherwise<00:02:35.319> you

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
raised up you can do so otherwise you

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.970 
raised up you can do so otherwise you
can<00:02:35.950> just<00:02:35.980> collapse<00:02:36.609> them<00:02:36.819> like<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.049> and<00:02:38.260> it

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
can just collapse them like so and it

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.440 
can just collapse them like so and it
can<00:02:39.099> stay<00:02:39.280> flat<00:02:39.579> as<00:02:39.639> well<00:02:39.970> but<00:02:40.090> i<00:02:40.150> tend<00:02:40.359> to

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
can stay flat as well but i tend to

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.539 
can stay flat as well but i tend to
raise<00:02:40.659> them<00:02:40.840> up<00:02:40.930> because<00:02:41.139> then<00:02:41.470> i<00:02:41.650> feels<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.459> lot

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
raise them up because then i feels a lot

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.550 
raise them up because then i feels a lot
better<00:02:42.700> so<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.569> can<00:02:43.659> see<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.959> keyboard<00:02:44.349> there

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
better so you can see the keyboard there

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.679 
better so you can see the keyboard there
it's<00:02:44.829> a<00:02:45.010> full<00:02:45.250> keyboard<00:02:45.489> with<00:02:45.879> number<00:02:46.269> keys<00:02:46.480> as

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
it's a full keyboard with number keys as

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.750 
it's a full keyboard with number keys as
well<00:02:46.930> dedicated<00:02:47.859> number<00:02:47.980> pads<00:02:48.310> on<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.579> side

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
well dedicated number pads on the side

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.179 
well dedicated number pads on the side
which<00:02:49.329> is<00:02:49.480> brilliant<00:02:49.659> especially<00:02:50.379> people<00:02:50.980> who

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
which is brilliant especially people who

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.250 
which is brilliant especially people who
are<00:02:51.939> into<00:02:52.180> their<00:02:52.269> accounting<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:52.870> stuff<00:02:53.049> that

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
are into their accounting and stuff that

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.960 
are into their accounting and stuff that
will<00:02:53.829> be<00:02:53.950> really<00:02:54.129> useful<00:02:54.370> because<00:02:54.639> you<00:02:54.819> what

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
will be really useful because you what

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.460 
will be really useful because you what
you<00:02:55.090> want<00:02:55.329> to<00:02:55.419> really<00:02:55.599> tie<00:02:55.840> pin<00:02:56.049> things<00:02:56.230> very

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
you want to really tie pin things very

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.159 
you want to really tie pin things very
quickly<00:02:56.620> rather<00:02:56.980> than<00:02:57.099> going<00:02:57.970> across<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:59.139> top

00:02:59.159 --> 00:02:59.169 
quickly rather than going across the top

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:00.809 
quickly rather than going across the top
numbers<00:02:59.680> there<00:02:59.889> and<00:03:00.129> you've<00:03:00.340> got<00:03:00.489> at<00:03:00.579> the<00:03:00.639> top

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
numbers there and you've got at the top

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.580 
numbers there and you've got at the top
there<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.510> sort<00:03:01.720> of<00:03:01.780> light<00:03:01.989> and<00:03:02.200> stuff<00:03:02.409> so<00:03:02.530> you

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
there the sort of light and stuff so you

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.679 
there the sort of light and stuff so you
can<00:03:02.709> check<00:03:02.859> your<00:03:02.919> energy<00:03:03.489> level<00:03:03.819> and<00:03:04.000> there

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:04.689 
can check your energy level and there
