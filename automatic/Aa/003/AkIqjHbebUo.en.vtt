00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.190
 parties in these last two days of 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.480

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.369
 the aesthetic died the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.279
 mysteries the one who makes a goal goes to the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.750
 house closes the door with key puts 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.220
 three tapia hinche ended the match the 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.160
 shame how they all play 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.120
 miserability that there are those who offer you 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.180
 the people are embarrassing the third I had 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.809
 the athletic court of madrid all 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.079
 behind 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.860
 mourinho that's inventing and playing well 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.510
 miserable 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.920
 it is with them the result that they were 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.380
 he went to look for one hundred percent of his 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.480
 life then people die people 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.400
 all of them die of go find 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.160
 results that machine game that can 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.110
 without people 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.989
 has the sense of aesthetics we have 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.989
 the new generation I do not want to talk 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.989
 with me 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:19.000
 smart thing is that it's all 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.000
 back homeland forward and we can 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.000
 pose a type of game with a 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.830
 semifinal formula of champions league and 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.979
 that day has to change do not do something 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.979
 different 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:45.020
 If he does not reach the World Cup he says I do not know 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.550
 because we know that if you arrive because 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.560
 what happens in Brazil to the fifa he cares 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.119
 a fuck the world that is a product 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.159
 for not to look thousands of miles 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.720
 people in the world on television and what 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.610
 they look is not what the people think 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.440
 technicians is a show that generates the 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.630
 Expectation illusion if you keep playing 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.700
 with a 4 the synonym a child his party 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.810
 we are in the oven the people in each go 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.250
 to have fewer matches as the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.650
 Argentine soccer 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:12.100
 it is very miserable exaggerated way very 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:14.750
 miserable because people what the 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.750
 public in general what is intended is 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.340
 that your team manages to win or obtain 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.080
 certain results well and fairly 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.660
 they agree that these technicians are the 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.670
 that I really understand them but in 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.260
 Argentina is not a big fan 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.060
 didactic bellini del chelsea no 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.459
 professional that what it is when one 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.050
 is dispassionate spectator or 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.490
 create being strength by pride is 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.110
 try for an ice cream you're looking for 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:41.480
 over that back 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.480
 the book the real game that people 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.330
 talks about this is said to the people of his 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.540
 team likes that in any way 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:58.500
 is the people of that team is the part of 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.930
 all the people that's why I say when it says 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.540
 not with us when the shirt does not think 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.730
 understand with the shirt on your team 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.730
 that as you want the hand on the hour 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.070
 us and the rest that is the majority 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.190
 from among the real fans of the 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.110
 teams also have guys who 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.730
 I would look to see a little bit more is something the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.350
 reality among all that to say that real 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.760
 madrid barcelona and bayern munich want 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.010
 see your team play better than you 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.060
 they really play in addition to winning 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.320
 surely it is more logical than chelsea 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.030
 that is not a team with a long tradition 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.980
 East of England who became 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.299
 powerful in recent times 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:46.620
 the exact pace of defense levees 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:49.409
 the little fellow edul because never better 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:57.090
 I never thought that roberto carlos by 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:58.700
 one side the tanks but the issue is what 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.080
 you come you also interprets 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.690
 I should be a little more contemplative 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.540
 that there can not be only one 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.760
 way to win there are not some that 30 and 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.379
 the way to win is the mooring not 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.829
 we are talking about winning everything we talk about 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.829
 of playing well the old ball to 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.829
 try
