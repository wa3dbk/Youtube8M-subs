00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
now serie dill is a big prize a fertile

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.690 
now serie dill is a big prize a fertile
heartland<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.470> continent<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.279> it's<00:00:32.520> also

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
the symbol of power over Tamriel in the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.490 
the symbol of power over Tamriel in the
white<00:00:36.180> gold<00:00:36.420> tower<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:37.079> has<00:00:37.200> been<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
white gold tower that has been the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.410 
white gold tower that has been the
center<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> Empire<00:00:38.040> for<00:00:38.670> millennia<00:00:39.239> now

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
center of the Empire for millennia now

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.170 
center of the Empire for millennia now
so<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.200> three<00:00:40.379> alliances<00:00:40.620> all<00:00:41.520> have<00:00:41.969> their

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
so the three alliances all have their

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.049 
so the three alliances all have their
own<00:00:42.210> reasons<00:00:42.870> why<00:00:43.829> they<00:00:44.250> feel<00:00:44.579> like<00:00:44.820> they

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
own reasons why they feel like they

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.600 
own reasons why they feel like they
should<00:00:45.270> be<00:00:45.450> ruling<00:00:46.410> serie<00:00:46.860> dill<00:00:47.100> but<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
should be ruling serie dill but the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.760 
should be ruling serie dill but the
fundamental<00:00:48.239> reason<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.379> Empire

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
fundamental reason is that the Empire

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.549 
fundamental reason is that the Empire
and<00:00:50.070> serie<00:00:50.309> dill<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.879> family<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.840> nobles

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
and serie dill and the family of nobles

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.290 
and serie dill and the family of nobles
the<00:00:52.800> Farnes<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.460> are<00:00:53.550> ruling<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.940> are<00:00:54.090> weak

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the Farnes that are ruling it are weak

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:07.290 
the Farnes that are ruling it are weak
and<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.590> Alliance's<00:00:56.190> are<00:00:56.520> strong

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.330 

so<00:01:08.300> the<00:01:08.390> Empire<00:01:08.659> is<00:01:08.810> weak<00:01:09.080> but<00:01:09.740> their<00:01:09.950> leaders

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
so the Empire is weak but their leaders

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.750 
so the Empire is weak but their leaders
are<00:01:10.610> cunning<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:12.320> current<00:01:13.040> occupant<00:01:13.580> of<00:01:13.670> the
