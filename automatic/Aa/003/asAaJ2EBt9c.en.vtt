00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.110
 I am interested in that 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.150
 welcome to main channel your son 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.949
 mÃ¡ximo you welcome I have it 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.600
 finally done i am 100 grains 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.000
 happy relieved and satisfied that 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.320
 have held on so consistently 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.689
 to play battlefield 3 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.750
 meanwhile I have over 760 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.090
 hours at the clock was around 31 to 32 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.990
 Playing games for a few days means something 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.360
 in my eyes a bit 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.399
 sick but i just can not come 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.960
 away from it is so often mine 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.360
 Calculator and ask me which game 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.820
 I want to play I have nice games 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.559
 So just have to go in with me 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.370
 the playlist really let's look 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.050
 many options 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.629
 and then I just sit there and 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.329
 then do not call Battlefield difficult 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.129
 and yes I'm the virus expired and 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.020
 i play battlefield 3 again and again 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.910
 too a bit like that came to me 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.550
 Tiredness on and where I am 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.039
 I said I am not going to nee 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.680
 battlefield 3 play but three four 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.689
 days later the virus came through and 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.500
 said I play and play myself 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.080
 then I played 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.150
 how about battlefield 4 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.770
 Does that make me play that much ? 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.180
 More I can not say but 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.939
 I can say that I do not 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.189
 Play Battlefield 3 more times 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.100
 because I do it now in bad company 2 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.560
 I look at it once in a while 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.119
 again a bit of nostalgia to bloom 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.610
 and then you play two three 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.619
 round but it goes back to the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.840
 current topics and so will be 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.909
 when you behave now and then times 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.500
 look at the old title but they are 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.790
 very little new play 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.280
 I assume that 80 of the bf 3 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.829
 owner also change too much four 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.500
 and yes they are with the product 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.530
 satisfied and also mourn ea and there is 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.320
 too good with the successor 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.140
 lie down there will be no revolution 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.140
 There are many small changes and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.670
 graphics moderately but in the reason enormous 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.670
 it will feel like in 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.530
 Battlefield 3 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.140
 So it started quite normal 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.640
 the board four years so you can too 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.709
 do not make such a big jump 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.680
 would be so if you are now in the 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.910
 Then golf was completely different 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.920
 the people would not work anymore 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.440
 identify with this vehicle and 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.260
 that's the way it is with Battlefield 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.170
 make small steps and not the 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.569
 to scare people too much 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.670
 but so ne steps steps 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.260
 make sure that the buyers are still willing 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.319
 to buy this product 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.660
 yes that has difficult years too good 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.150
 make products even better like one 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.440
 to do well on bad soil 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.820
 there you have a lot more 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.800
 possibilities yes and yes roundabout can 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.530
 I also say that this whole 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.810
 marketing with this dlcs for me 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.150
 do not actually done so bad 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.450
 because if I find a product good one 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.220
 play well if I also chose 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.190
 there a few more euros to loose 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.690
 to continue the game experience i 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.370
 could have imagined that as well 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.700
 the well battlefield series year longer 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.709
 stay and for two or three 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.140
 additional the cs come but he has 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.320
 decided differently and who go along 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.630
 he wants to go with him and who is not a member 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.540
 the last stay and at some point looks 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.480
 a tube and says I want too and 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.610
 then yes he could still participate 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.500
 So I think many would be 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.720
 tighten and while on the 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.459
 i will get it with the 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.410
 I also have battlefield 4 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.650
 already pre-ordered for me is always like that 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.140
 i have it i have it and then feel it 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:49.640
 I calm down but that's me 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:52.160
 shut up the scenario and be like that 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.290
 a bit of use will be back now 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.020
 this same scenario just another 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.180
 Group 13 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.010
 I believe in Battlefield 4 yet 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.690
 but not if the beds fit five 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.970
 bring out and again the same 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.150
 then I think so 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.340
 and yes, but it is also assumed that 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.940
 Maybe it's more into the future 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.600
 will give 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.510
 So this battlefield 21 42 has it there 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.310
 yes, one of the makers something 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.380
 she tells me so much again 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.600
 want to give in the right future 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.080
 whether it is called with four or 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.090
 battlefield 2044 or whatever 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.240
 or 21 44 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.550
 We'll see that, even though I'm there 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.130
 not so pleased if I want him 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.320
 again for the second world war 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.320
 steps are correct with the German 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.470
 karabiner and yes again something to 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.680
 We wait for the match if the match 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.790
 3s is still synonymous in the stars 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.550
 if there is something to come 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.440
 yes, because medium of order have warfighter 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.050
 So she sawed off a bit and 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.510
 again not and export is set 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.330
 and yes and the valve yes, so everything 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.890
 and we wait for what the days are 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.200
 that's the way i am in any case 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:10.100
 pretty excited and happy about it 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.880
 any new information about the beds 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:16.130
 not come out for three or four 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.870
 and yes again to the people here on 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.690
 youtube I really enjoy it 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.350
 made with you together battlefield 3 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.700
 to play one has many new ones 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.250
 closed platonic friendships 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.410
 I have to say not only through 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.560
 battlefield too for more through youtube 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:37.130
 where one because virtually the compound by 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.510
 battlefield youtube and common 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.510
 I found a lot of interest 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.250
 nice it was a lot of fun and me 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.450
 hope I will be with you even in 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.890
 have a lot of fun battlefield 4 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:52.130
 Now I have a few words 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:54.310
 I'm happy about that 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.960
 kernel 100 and so what's not 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.940
 Worked out and this already 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.320
 made congratulations 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:05.030
 whether right or by difference, yes 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.140
 yes also his thing with battlefield 4 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.670
 I hope that's not the case 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.700
 contaminated that though at battlefield 3 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:19.580
 I do not notice so much he is it 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:21.140
 with crysis and far cry you can almost 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.150
 Do not play anymore because he has this 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.250
 people around oxidize 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.270
 yes, because punkbuster is not supposed to 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.440
 integrated 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:32.270
 you can not expect that bad thing 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.700
 about goals already did I want to do 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.430
 do not talk so much but we wait 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.550
 from what's ace in the hand behind was because 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.800
 yes every student is a buyer and 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.050
 every banned skiing on the game 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.360
 again and yes the buy themselves almost 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.480
 twice the game that one too 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.490
 market policy team behind but it comes 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.380
 that's all else rumored and 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.850
 guesses that are from me I wanted 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.270
 not so long actually we talk 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.010
 about that 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:02.930

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:05.300
