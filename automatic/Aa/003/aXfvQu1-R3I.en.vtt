00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.820
 human you are clever it's ok ok 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:24.810
 ok it's good I break 12h06 ndakarou 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.800
 said we are for a new video 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.599
 and for this time a tutorial for 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.630
 a mode how to install this mode 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.750
 precisely who makes the legs bend 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.670
 when courbin it's been there it's not too much 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.559
 full so when a lot we see that 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.110
 does it like that finally that is rather 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.820
 realistic and so when we are in the water 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.989
 it faces is like going 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.410
 so it's super stylish 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.660
 it's a super fashion that I really like 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.800
 a lot so I'm sorry for them 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.570
 people they like a lot small fail 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.210
 but you can not do you can not 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.710
 the installed with the small fact that 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.390
 will not walk unless at your house this 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.589
 walk maybe I do not know at all 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.560
 case at home it did not work 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.700
 so that's how I found this 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.350
 mode and ben I find I'm not 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.320
 I was in search train look 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.580
 on on planet planet minecraft and 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.799
 I actually found out I came across this 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.840
 months later I installed everything 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.430
 simply and I did not work 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.159
 am told why I removed modes 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.420
 I just take off the fine ones and there 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.830
 it works and so I was a bit of 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.110
 since little fans it's still 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.729
 very practical and it already has a little 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.950
 less with little fayt finally here 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.570
 so we do not say where we are going 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.090
 learn how to install super fashion 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.259
 and those are going to go 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.030
 find on my desk 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.590
 so here we are on my desk 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.500
 finally rather on a web page so 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.060
 I will put you the link 2 2 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.040
 in the description of the video for the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.330
 download so here you will be interested 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.920
 on this page you have to do download 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.440
 momo ben it's called the way 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.630
 after you wait of course the five 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.820
 seconds normally so it's not for 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.080
 that's for the guy who made 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.600
 stuff times it's not money they 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.060
 do so here's where you go on dawn 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.500
 just lahoud and you wait 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.119
 still five seconds so that's still 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.229
 not for me it's still not seen 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.550
 for me 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.959
 so here we wait we wait we wait 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.570
 tac and here we were there and it 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.590
 just press it 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.580
 so here you are calling on it except 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.790
 that I 'm not going to do it since 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.070
 I already have the mode on my desk 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.410
 no it's not that it's a plugin on my 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.060
 office right here so to ensure you there 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.900
 will need to be sure that you will 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.060
 install forges 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.280
 finally I did not do you the tutorial 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.750
 to install forge because it's a 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.940
 tutorial to install that it's not 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.950
 to install forges so that's forge 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.370
 so after you do that you do 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.459
 the key windows r % and you write % 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.940
 of your% and so here after you go 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.440
 so for minecraft you go in 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.959
 fashion if you do not have everything leads 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.610
 since Thursday if you have not strong fort 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.349
 web you do not have the mode folder 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.930
 if you have strong I did not have you the 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:06.970
 of these modes simply needs the 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:09.580
 create mode with with an s at the end 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.209
 so that's fashion and you move everything 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.360
 just this here in the fashion folder 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.430
 and you started minecraft 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.440
 so that's usually the end 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.950
 normally it has to work and if that 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.370
 do not walk and well we must not know that 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.019
 you have to check that everything is on kraft 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.690
 that we do here you must have a 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.900
 other pass more padt more more more 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.049
 well you just open with the 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.989
 notepad stuff 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:44.799
 so here you put everything on too 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.959
 sure too much that's because it's not that 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.780
 on you this time on zombies 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.690
 the creepers and everything so I do that 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.030
 I copied a video of a video in 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.489
 did because I had that I had that 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.859

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.040
 the ag buy things here so you 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.840
 launch minecraft you press play 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.970
 and now we have to wait 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.220
 until martin launches so 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.780
 here is a minecraft on minecraft 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.250
 so there you press the mode for 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.630
 check if he is there he is there 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.829
 so it's no so now you 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.720
 can go on the server you 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:21.160
 so you can not go well 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.440

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.410
