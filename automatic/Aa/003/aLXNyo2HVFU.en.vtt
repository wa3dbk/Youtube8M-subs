Maple Leaf Rag by Scott Joplin uses very

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.339 
Maple Leaf Rag by Scott Joplin uses very
basic<00:00:10.590> chords<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.250> we're<00:00:11.429> going<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.730> learn<00:00:11.910> it

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:12.349 
basic chords and we're going to learn it

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.720 
basic chords and we're going to learn it
over<00:00:13.349> three<00:00:13.710> or<00:00:13.740> four<00:00:13.830> different<00:00:14.130> parts<00:00:14.460> which

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
over three or four different parts which

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.180 
over three or four different parts which
on<00:00:14.910> upload<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.750> YouTube<00:00:16.170> separate<00:00:16.680> video<00:00:16.949> so

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
on upload to YouTube separate video so

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.859 
on upload to YouTube separate video so
this<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.430> part<00:00:17.670> 1<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.150> part<00:00:18.180> 1<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.439> where<00:00:20.869> is

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
this is part 1 and part 1 is where is

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:37.869 
this is part 1 and part 1 is where is
this<00:00:22.020> part<00:00:22.289> here<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.710> was<00:00:22.830> like<00:00:22.859> this

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:47.240 

No

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.620 

then<00:00:48.250> actually<00:00:48.489> repeats<00:00:49.030> that<00:00:49.180> whole<00:00:49.360> section

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
then actually repeats that whole section

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.900 
then actually repeats that whole section
going<00:00:49.989> to<00:00:50.050> play<00:00:50.320> that<00:00:50.500> twice<00:00:50.680> so<00:00:51.670> that's<00:00:51.730> what

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
going to play that twice so that's what

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.390 
going to play that twice so that's what
we're<00:00:52.030> going<00:00:52.150> to<00:00:52.239> learn<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.710> chords<00:00:54.010> for<00:00:54.220> it

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
we're going to learn the chords for it

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.790 
we're going to learn the chords for it
are<00:00:54.580> very<00:00:55.059> straightforward<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.500> most

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:45.170 

than<00:02:33.060> a

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.910 

oh<00:02:45.209> I<00:02:45.720> get<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.200> there's<00:02:46.560> some<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.799> will

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
oh I get that there's some that will

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.730 

okay<00:02:59.019> then<00:02:59.260> we<00:02:59.440> play<00:02:59.680> the

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.260 

which<00:03:04.340> is<00:03:04.460> just<00:03:04.580> literally<00:03:05.350> moving<00:03:06.350> from<00:03:06.710> a<00:03:07.270> to
