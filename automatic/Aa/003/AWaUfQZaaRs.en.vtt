00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 good would that number be my name and where 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.520
 take out and this is another series on 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.990
 command block in minecraft and today 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.589
 made a chest which will be several 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.150
 pages 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.040
 so you only need one 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.929
 a chest instead of these core chests 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.549
 who even make special rooms 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.619
 for them and there are a lot of double 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.480
 Sudak which Alice any crap 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.160
 and I will have my only one chest in 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.289
 which will chaff sex 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.210
 9 days of rest so to speak in general when 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.220
 we open the chest we see this page 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.070
 the thing is we made the panels 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.390
 for example, select the first chest click 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.489
 only the first panel and us open 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.980
 first chests needed ships but with 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.719
 constancy rokston laid in the first 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.850
 case we will have to lay 1 tons I 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.320
 second chest then we put well divide by 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.010
 something like this tree tree 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.980
 weight tree 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.770
 and then let's go to the third chest from and 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.989
 put a shovel 4 chest there is still very 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.250
 we put and in general so martin does not argue 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.710
 all the chests which of us are 3 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.160
 pages and if you need anything 1 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.559
 chest 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.809
 press 1 and we have a relationship here 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.539
 need there if back high-tech one 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.309
 the chest then you press the one who us from the supports 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.769
 then we return to the second page 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.140
 a series of avad no minus this mechanism 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.030
 is that this line 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.820
 inventory of us time is filled therefore 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.640
 if sails for example a sword and open 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.009
 the chest then with us it will disappear see all 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.049
 we are now and this is the only minus well 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.240
 so how do we start from the very beginning 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.770
 start this main chest from the beginning 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.200
 we see that the chest is not simple 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.509
 and this is a trap chest thanks to which 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.820
 can ost interact with the pistons there 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.090
 for all arrested schemes for example 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.430
 but take the piston for the massage the piston and 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.380
 if we open it and the pistons move 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.290
 because he gives ariston a signal that 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.360
 I did next and here we run our 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.220
 words and and then I will tell you why and under 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.810
 Our chest is worth the piston 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.119
 here the piston well in general believe me 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.070
 here the piston elevator duties and when we 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.530
 press it again moves down and how 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.630
 the action itself with this to you unit and with 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.820
 these it goes out that is here 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.040
 allison signal ceases to be given a 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.329
 here is served what comes from not 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.570
 given over 1 scoreboard 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.979
 and this is part of me and about us the thistle is simple 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.439
 type lady just skuboard 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.390
 and it burns there that if we opened 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.180
 chest then we have a value of 1 a 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.080
 let's see and set the scoreboard 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.160
 well honestly 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.960
 from the side and then you will understand 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.790
 we see that at 0 hour when we put a 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.040
 once that block is set, then we put 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.650
 units and we are given from the panel when we 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.080
 we choose it to zero and we have taken 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.690
 thinks here because we open the feet 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.000
 ds1 and the door closes up 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.710
 piston and as we become api put 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.650
 50 thanks to this command block 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.390
 what happens at this moment that is, we 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.330
 open the chest they gave us from fill 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.930
 and go here in this scheme and here it is 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.060
 I look 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.370
 thanks to the video driver for which 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.290
 He said it is easiest to do so 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.350
 that throughout the area will be put 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.690
 and since he is good and I sat down on this topic that is 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.640
 I took this help exactly 10 apparatus because 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.959
 that we can put ours everywhere without 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.640
 the key to the engine that is, if constantly 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.080
 example even 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.390
 endlessly move it here and tell you 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.220
 for example here to write or he will 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.160
 write and I did because 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.890
 can make ahill team with this 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.040
 block and this one fails in the whole 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.480
 This area and all the stones and blocks grew 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.480
 will change and so we have 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.680
 Everywhere there is an infinitely great Well, well 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.709
 and what happens here 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.260
 and when we have a value of 1 then we are about 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.690
 inventory through the command replace a item 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.400
 put 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.050
 glass panels they have them different 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.489
 view what they show amarok different 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.790
 the color this would make the game to such a team 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:38.220
 as a replay site is who and what then 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.269
 and the slot of our case is well 3 because 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.760
 us 012 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.850
 here it will be the third slot and that is stan 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.680
 eye is the amount of her look and everything is a and when 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.340
 we put 0 value that is, we 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.320
 closed their close ri peter and 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:56.040
 comparator and in general we are everywhere in these 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.530
 fleets solis and air that's what happens 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.570
 that moment when we choose glass 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.150
 here we see this line command 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.280
 blocks they test in our amber 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.590
 glass panel that is if we are now 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.110
 give us one value 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.769
 the unit that is will be through the team 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.900
 let's put we appear in 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:19.350
 Amber many many these panel and 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.320
 Comparators light up because we have 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.450
 there is one inside 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.580
 thing that you need this Kamlok 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.260
 for example, this unit is looking for me in amber 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.180
 anywhere that may be 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.980
 the glass panel and the look of it 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.590
 there is a glass panel and a view 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.540
 her 1 and also looking and generally had to run 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.970
 of which is this panel together 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.130
 but in general, and looking for when we throw out 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.930
 this panel and just 1 arm then signal 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.480
 stops working and a signal is given to 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.170
 these two commands to 1 kan block changes 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.030
 title 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.250
 and there at the eagle stand that we have 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.840
 here thanks to this and my name 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.630
 we can change from the music themselves that is 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.730
 each language is the only and 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.680
 his unique our words and which 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.230
 has its own name and thanks 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.740
 argosy well, that is, see we choose 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.080
 first chest 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.480
 armor that need a name and when 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.840
 same if the world is or more 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.810
 sense 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.940
 name 0 then oh chest which is 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.860
 under him is planned to court that is 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.200
 the chest that is here he 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.230
 constantly cloned and in this place and 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:23.170
 so now even if we choose 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:25.130
 one first let's do this already 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.400
 when we put ourselves on the panel 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:31.700
 first something but this time they plan 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.170
 block a chest up to our ears sovereign and 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.240
 so it could open and you can just 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:38.720
 can also be fully planned 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.460
 get blocked chest and in general what 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.200
 happens further still under this ie 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.630
 we opened the chest took the glass 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.460
 panel of amber that is, we take yes 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.100
 throw out and give a signal and 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:53.110
 and the name changes to the armam stands and then 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:55.790
 and here is this block here and then here is a chest 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.500
 planned trial that is we started with 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.390
 time plan this chest sudan and 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.190
 when we choose a new page we 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.050
 change the name of interest on this 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.960
 then a new job is an example 3 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.200
 He plans to 3 ipad chests and when 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.330
 and we throw a panel to bleed a chest 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.610
 teleports but planned here and 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.220
 then you save and so did with each 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.160
 page i hope it looks more 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.240
 compact as it may be 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.590
 compact this thing well, I hope 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.000
 This video you liked all 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.000
 thanks for watching and all for now
