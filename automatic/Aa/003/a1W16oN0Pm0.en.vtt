00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.540
 hello and heartily says another 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.099
 video of me 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.650
 This time I want you my little one 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.830
 heck referring to the program windows 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.859
 live movie maker show what I currently have 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.150
 Extremely upset just because so 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.680
 various bugs are like if you 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.619
 inserts different effects or 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.260
 simply removes various things 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.640
 changed the timeline from the whole 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.679
 you end up being tough when you do something 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.579
 that does not change 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.829
 should and what I do instead of that 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.140
 you do not reasonably overlay here 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.660
 can bring in, for example, a 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.399
 Censorship was so a little bit 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.620
 what you can censor in the video 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.090
 usd and now I would like to join 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.820
 to remedy the video and show 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.570
 how to do that 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.520
 There is just once the method if you 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.850
 a video had already come for a short time 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.239
 One off that will probably be too 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.989
 take a long time to edit 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.270
 maybe you can already do that 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.770
 to solve a picture 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.299
 I can do that as a video lan , so to speak 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.950
 Tricky right , I tell myself that 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.360
 thought 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.640
 if you give me these two characters here 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.600
 and finally to insert overlay 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.600
 So at least as one was censorship 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.090
 one presses the old key gives 96 4 4 1 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.750
 then you have such a funny 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.159
 rectangular you can then 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.060
 enlarge accordingly and the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.799
 adjust background color something not so 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.079
 good solution is was last time 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.680
 but sometime had used 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.680
 ultimately 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.400
 but ultimately we are a right one 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.490
 want to have censorship a real one 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.049
 overlay then you can do it like this 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.360
 you have to program the resource egger 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.670
 download 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.409
 and finally those other clothes 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.939
 here 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.860
 I offer you to download later 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.680
 on 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.909
 ideally also and these two things 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.649
 Do you have to mean that to yourself? 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.700
 quite simply I have such an overlay 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.280
 what i meant 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.610
 the tutorial will just use one 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.170
 simple rectangle so to speak that to 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.319
 in the end it will be shown 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.750
 is then transparent and is easy to 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.910
 I have done that and painted 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.030
 otherwise such an icon so that you stop 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.550
 on an icon accordingly in the movie 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.200
 maker himself has not looked like that now 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.840
 tingling but it is enough to the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.989
 to describe the effect 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.200
 this is the first step we move 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.239
 us in the movie maker directory what 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.130
 then depending on which one with 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.140
 had system 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.660
 is different if you 64 bit 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.549
 like me, you go here in the x86 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.410
 folder and if not then that is in 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:51.060
 normal program location and scrolls 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.920
 finally in down here in windows 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.630
 live purely 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.870
 there is a folder of photo yourself 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.549
 gallery calls there goes in then 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.470
 you have the templates folder here 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.910
 So you add that you can do that 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.470
 Do it several times you can yes 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.530
 create different effects with it 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.060
 then you copy this whole story 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.410
 Simply here I have to now so 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.290
 said overlay forest so corners are yes 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.819
 then we see this one in here 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.829
 Of course, only at the next movie maker 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.549
 That's why I want that now 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.410
 here just goes again travels 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.340
 still apply a folder with effects 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.630
 not available 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.299
 I think that is not yet available 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.970
 you have to invest there then you pack 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:36.359
 tells this border overlay depending on 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.670
 we called this hna.de also the 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.739
 icon so he knows what psych 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.030
 company should name it best 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.280
 right then and then it's finally 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.000
 ans canned 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.980
 we have to go with the resource hacker now 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.709
 open this file to make it easy 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.010
 pure and call it the same as it does here 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.660
 stands and the file is finally 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.970
 here already in this dll 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.950
 but if there is any other image 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.169
 it's like if you download it now 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.389
 you have everything in it 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:11.520
 press her right-click and open 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.840
 replays resource 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.220
 Of course, the thing is me now 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.570
 I have not tested it yet 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.090
 different resolutions 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:22.170
 that is, if you have that effect now 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.880
 insert in the windows movie maker you have to 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.980
 of course now of the image here 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.300
 pay attention to the effect on the resolution 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.420
 I have a suitable resolution now 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.550
 I usually take that in 1280x720 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.080
 so i have the resolution now 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.160
 also adapted accordingly in the picture 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:44.640
 So this year I pack that now 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:50.490
 Finally, call an overlay 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:55.200
 the way it stood there was data image 1 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.570
 and 1033 press replays and forget that 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.030
 not to save whole 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.670
 The automatically puts an original dglg 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.800
 but I know that others are far 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:09.560
 managed and could then be in movie maker 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:12.090
 then open someone the film 1 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.940
 then it goes under visual effects 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.820
 Gold down and then there you have 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.320
 Click your effect and then you have 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:25.440
 the successful one is inserted and that is 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:27.030
 in your video yet kind and around 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.700
 In the end, then there are several more 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.490
 you have to create those things 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.400
 then place these templates in the template 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.630
 even where we were from this still 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.940
 copy times, so to speak 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:42.260
 Best always as well as take so 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.970
 rename 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.130
 Best this is here in front or old ever 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.330
 after we then what would the 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:54.050
 ultimately important 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:58.770
 sm effect folder then respectively 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:01.260
 More importantly, there was wanted was 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.720
 here this over effect template the 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.780
 you can easily with one 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:11.250
 editor open forest time is a file 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:14.130
 who those once again a sun xml 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.240
 style which is really only therefore 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.580
 easy to imitate 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.540
 we would have to have the whole 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.120
 file names correct 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.170
 So tackle the path to the icon like that 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.170
 should ultimately mean 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.190
 and below 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:33.420
 Here then synonymous would have to adapt the name 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:35.850
 the dll but I think the dll can 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.850
 always be the same this new effect 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:41.900
 names and stop the image has to be different 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:44.520
 so yes, I hope I liked it 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.760
 is a bit fun security windows 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.890
 here at this point to hack hand 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.780
 because this basic function annoys the nerves 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.850
 sometimes here from the program and yes 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:57.060
 I think that's a nice feature 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:07:00.230
 which one has added now and with it 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.230
 first down below
