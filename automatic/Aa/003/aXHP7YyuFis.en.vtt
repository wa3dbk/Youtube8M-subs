00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.830
 this look that is made with the palette 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.700
 with pencil and palette that had already 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.330

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.420
 this palette I really liked these colors 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.030
 this goes so much to the people who 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.900
 they have eyes 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.960
 Obscure as clear look like this, luce is 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.940
 a tone like here the camera looks like 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.329
 green but it's like everything as a color 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.780
 turquoise is in this part of here a 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.410
 electric blue tone here and another green 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.300
 as you look up here and I like it a lot 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.960
 that is made with this palette has 21 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.360
 colors if I'm not wrong 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.200
 and not used is fastened not mere 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.450
 I really do not think I would use much who knows 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.369
 the best later and there is the average 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.190

 Well, I put my first one on 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.190

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.560

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:37.060
 so now we are going to put this 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.060
 this shadow that is called a 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.930
 without all this you do not have a number 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.410
 half weird that is up to 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.410
 rosita 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.960
 and we are not going to apply it 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.899
 on the mobile eyelid only 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.050
 I'm combining a little bit of that line 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.050

 bow of the eyebrows I made this shadow and the 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.830

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.830
 vanilla shadow that is this 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.640
