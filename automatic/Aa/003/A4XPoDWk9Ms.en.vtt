 involved because they fight supports west in 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.480
 the atmosphere of the united in mexico already 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.620
 that when I was little I had 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.380
 around 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.900
 eight or nine or ten years or so like that 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.760
 I remember my uncle is called bernabé 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.170
 Mendez is in the sound that is called the 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.110
 Colombian heritage 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.060
 he had a so-called rock but if so 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.630
 as a clothes closet where they keep the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.670
 people because he had his voice and notes and 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.170
 here for there he was wearing he had his 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.540
 record player his lp records and then I 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.490
 invited constantly you know that it 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.310
 accompany me I'm going to take this notes 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.580
 the other one said dad, you know he 's from 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.500
 permission to give ricardo barrueta says then 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.800
 to accompany me to take things 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.990
 and then I was with him because I liked it and it's 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.850
 when they can put me a little more 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.920
 later my cousins had 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.780
 also their sound they saw the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.210
 sonideros that played English called 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.910
 a lot of attention and they started to 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.250
 touch they started buying their things their 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.920
 appliances your microphones and everything 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.020
 led to what I carry sonidero 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.000
 and sometimes in the dances in the 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.890
 which I went with them happy holidays to 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.780
 what they hired us for 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.030
 suddenly, if it takes you to the light of 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.280
 Suddenly the team suddenly turned off 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.380
 because the disc is suddenly scratched 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.270
 suddenly bounced the whistles to me 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.960
 It made me laugh a lot to see how 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.330
 people were like that 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.000
 I shouted not to be used I gave him a lot of laughter 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.620
 that I would see it to my cousins ​​who 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.690
 they were nervous when they started 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.890
 to whistle and that caused him a lot 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.870
 bile and I became interested 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.300
 much much more and more and more and more and 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.300
 later my cousin developed super 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.910
 as he invited me to do some 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.650
 pints since he organized dances and 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.560
 came to invite different sonideros 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.590
 the one that I remember the most is how to put this 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.550
 very good friend ma jin and did the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.800
 we put the drawings and then the 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.170
 it was really nice for me because 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.940
 I liked to draw and set us apart because it 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.880
 it combined what colo in the 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.680
 sonidero environment and formerly the 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.330
 dances were not done in classrooms 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.190
 regularization on the streets or 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.620
 long calls tracks that are the pieces 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.870
 some sporting places some 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.060
 play places where they play soccer 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.760
 basketball and so can they 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.800
 borrowed that place for what then for 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.500
 do some dances but well as you 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.990
 they could do them to be able to charge 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.430
 that money is for people to come in and pay 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.500
 a ticket for them 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.329
 it was very easy since they got 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.810
 postcards without sacks to the 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.579
 fences all around the court at 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.579
 do around the court they did 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.560
 that wall of pure costales but just 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.689
 charged the entrance of 10 or 15 pesos not 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.730
 there was a lot of what they charged and that's how it was 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:48.099
 as it began to involve much 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.840
 environment and I liked it afterwards 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.790
 go to the dances but my parents do not 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.739
 they already allowed me to tell myself that there was a 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.719
 boy then at 10 or 9 euros 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.519
 well they did not leave me even though 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:04:00.639
 I asked for permission the cousin did not 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.019
 they left parents to be able to attend the 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.419
 bars because then who would take care of me 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.939
 in those places and the truth then no no 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:10.030
 they left me and what is it because 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:12.459
 I got on the roof of my house and I 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.209
 it was listening in the distance how it 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:18.849
 I listened to the cumbia the salsa the rhythm 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.680
 the trumpets and that amazes me 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:23.889
 I liked even now when I 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.960
 I listen to a sound or I listen to a dance 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.490
 Far away I get a feeling 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.660
 incredible because it is something that has 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.520
 liked 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.460
 and really if you do not know about this 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.410
 environment is something very nice to know something 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.450
 different since there are many people who 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.310
 they do not know the environment and 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.110
 criticize and remember and when you do not know 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.390
 something you can not talk about anything else 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.390
 you know him and currently many friends 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.520
 sounds have given me that great support for 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.200
 that for this mind to arise more and not 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.330
 turn off because it 's really a 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.520
 environment that for me will last for 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.890
 always and remember 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.180
 Richard must speak on this occasion of 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.580
