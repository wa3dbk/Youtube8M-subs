00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
jet stream now look at the blue stuff

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.920 
jet stream now look at the blue stuff
you<00:01:19.740> think<00:01:20.250> we'd<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.729> done<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.360> by<00:01:21.630> now

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
you think we'd be done with this by now

this was a small water spout which means
it<00:03:03.300> started<00:03:03.660> out<00:03:03.750> over<00:03:04.230> water<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.740> then<00:03:04.830> it

it started out over water and then it

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.320 
it started out over water and then it
actually<00:03:05.070> moved<00:03:05.400> inland<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:06.000> little<00:03:06.240> bit

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
actually moved inland a little bit

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.000 
actually moved inland a little bit

there<00:03:08.880> was<00:03:09.000> actually<00:03:09.450> some<00:03:09.600> pretty<00:03:09.750> bad

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
there was actually some pretty bad

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.450 
there was actually some pretty bad
damage<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.470> know<00:03:10.560> what<00:03:10.710> though<00:03:10.830> that<00:03:11.070> was<00:03:11.280> not

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
damage you know what though that was not

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.040 
damage you know what though that was not
from<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.730> tornado<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.420> was<00:03:12.570> actually<00:03:12.900> just

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
from a tornado that was actually just

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.390 
from a tornado that was actually just
from<00:03:13.260> straight-line<00:03:13.680> winds<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.130> now<00:03:14.340> the

right okay this one's could be an

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:33.489 
right okay this one's could be an
interesting<00:04:32.090> one<00:04:32.509> because<00:04:32.539> any<00:04:33.020> has<00:04:33.289> gone

00:04:33.489 --> 00:04:33.499 
interesting one because any has gone

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:35.439 
interesting one because any has gone
negative<00:04:33.770> and<00:04:34.159> this<00:04:34.490> is<00:04:34.639> kind<00:04:34.849> of<00:04:34.969> its<00:04:35.240> be

negative and this is kind of its be
interesting<00:04:35.779> to<00:04:35.840> see<00:04:35.960> if<00:04:36.050> this<00:04:36.199> is<00:04:36.379> going<00:04:36.560> to

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
interesting to see if this is going to

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.050 
interesting to see if this is going to
