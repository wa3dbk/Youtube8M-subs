Robertson was still on his feet

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.370

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
maybe even gave him a little extra

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.400 
maybe even gave him a little extra
breathing<00:06:09.800> room<00:06:10.190> yeah<00:06:10.930> considering<00:06:11.930> the<00:06:12.200> fact

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
breathing room yeah considering the fact

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.470 
breathing room yeah considering the fact
that<00:06:12.530> he<00:06:12.680> was<00:06:12.800> undefeated<00:06:13.010> won<00:06:13.970> his<00:06:14.090> first<00:06:14.300> two

that he was undefeated won his first two
professional<00:06:14.990> fight<00:06:15.170> so<00:06:15.500> maybe<00:06:16.100> giving<00:06:16.460> him<00:06:16.580> a

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
professional fight so maybe giving him a

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.760 
professional fight so maybe giving him a
chance<00:06:16.940> to<00:06:17.270> try<00:06:17.510> to<00:06:17.540> turn<00:06:17.930> things<00:06:18.140> around<00:06:18.320> but

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
chance to try to turn things around but

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.760 
chance to try to turn things around but
based<00:06:19.370> on<00:06:19.610> the<00:06:20.360> way<00:06:20.510> things<00:06:20.570> were<00:06:20.990> going

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770
