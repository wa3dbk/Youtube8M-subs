gigahertz dual-core cpu now don't let
the<00:00:13.590> dual-core<00:00:14.009> name<00:00:14.250> fool<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:14.910> is

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
the dual-core name fool you this is

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.810 
the dual-core name fool you this is
still<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.299> very<00:00:15.719> good<00:00:16.080> cpu<00:00:16.619> why<00:00:17.250> one<00:00:17.550> with<00:00:17.699> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
still a very good cpu why one with the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.200 
still a very good cpu why one with the
dual<00:00:18.029> core<00:00:18.390> /<00:00:18.930> say<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.500> quad<00:00:19.859> core<00:00:20.130> AMD<00:00:20.640> cpu<00:00:21.180> or

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
dual core / say a quad core AMD cpu or

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.960 
dual core / say a quad core AMD cpu or
even<00:00:21.750> an<00:00:21.869> i3<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.439> pretty<00:00:23.160> much<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.519> save<00:00:23.699> money

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
even an i3 is pretty much to save money

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.490 
even an i3 is pretty much to save money
and<00:00:24.119> put<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.449> towards<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.869> graphics<00:00:25.289> card

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
and put that towards the graphics card

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.679 
and put that towards the graphics card
is<00:00:25.619> an<00:00:25.740> extremely<00:00:26.130> budget<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.730> build<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.240> to

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
is an extremely budget and build and to

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.060 
is an extremely budget and build and to
get<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> decent<00:00:28.080> graphics<00:00:28.349> card<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> build

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
get a decent graphics card in the build

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.890 
get a decent graphics card in the build
you<00:00:29.220> do<00:00:29.400> have<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.699> make<00:00:29.730> sacrifices<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.689> other

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
you do have to make sacrifices in other

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.290 
you do have to make sacrifices in other
areas<00:00:31.349> but<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:31.949> still<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.219> pretty<00:00:32.460> solid<00:00:32.759> cpu

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
areas but this still a pretty solid cpu

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.930 
areas but this still a pretty solid cpu
for<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> money<00:00:33.719> at<00:00:33.870> $63<00:00:34.770> there's<00:00:35.579> actually<00:00:35.880> a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
for the money at $63 there's actually a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.880 
for the money at $63 there's actually a
promo<00:00:36.270> code<00:00:36.480> right<00:00:36.719> now<00:00:36.750> fifteen<00:00:37.350> percent<00:00:37.680> off

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
promo code right now fifteen percent off

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.590 
promo code right now fifteen percent off
so<00:00:38.129> that's<00:00:38.280> pretty<00:00:38.579> good<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.000> right<00:00:39.450> now

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
so that's pretty good and right now

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.819 
so that's pretty good and right now
foresees<00:00:39.899> three<00:00:40.140> dollars<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.500> thought<00:00:40.680> this

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
foresees three dollars I thought this

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.040 
foresees three dollars I thought this
was<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> good<00:00:41.340> route<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.910> go<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.300> yeah<00:00:42.780> some<00:00:43.020> of

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
was a good route to go it yeah some of

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.380 
was a good route to go it yeah some of
the<00:00:43.290> newer<00:00:43.530> games<00:00:43.739> do<00:00:44.070> recommend<00:00:44.730> quad<00:00:45.090> cores

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the newer games do recommend quad cores

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.060 
the newer games do recommend quad cores
but<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:45.809> because<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.110> game<00:00:46.350> recommends<00:00:47.010> a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
but just because a game recommends a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.069 
but just because a game recommends a
quad<00:00:47.280> core<00:00:47.520> doesn't<00:00:47.940> suddenly<00:00:48.420> make<00:00:48.840> dual

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
quad core doesn't suddenly make dual

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.529 
quad core doesn't suddenly make dual
cores<00:00:49.430> insufficient<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.550> run<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> game<00:00:51.120> you

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
cores insufficient to run the game you

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.119 
cores insufficient to run the game you
can<00:00:51.660> still<00:00:51.899> run<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> game<00:00:52.410> maybe<00:00:52.710> not<00:00:52.980> at

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
can still run the game maybe not at

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.860 
can still run the game maybe not at
optimal<00:00:53.670> settings<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.180> optimal<00:00:54.629> performance

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
optimal settings and optimal performance

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.260 
optimal settings and optimal performance
but<00:00:55.440> you'll<00:00:55.710> run<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:55.980> number<00:00:56.280> was<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.239> I

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
but you'll run it number was so I

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.729 
but you'll run it number was so I
thought<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.809> was<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.960> good<00:00:58.170> choice<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.440> go

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
thought that was a good choice to go

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.049 
thought that was a good choice to go
with<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.250> four<00:00:59.460> hundred<00:00:59.699> dollar<00:00:59.820> bill

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
with in this four hundred dollar bill

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.670 
with in this four hundred dollar bill

this is a pretty solid motherboard like

this is a pretty solid motherboard like
i<00:01:06.960> said<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> micro<00:01:07.890> ATX<00:01:08.040> 0<00:01:08.490> navin<00:01:09.000> have

if<00:01:12.479> you're<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> budget-minded<00:01:13.170> gamer<00:01:13.860> like

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
if you're the budget-minded gamer like

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.469 
if you're the budget-minded gamer like
that<00:01:14.430> you're<00:01:14.670> probably<00:01:14.850> not<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.420> be

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
that you're probably not going to be

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.899 
that you're probably not going to be
upgrading<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.080> pc<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> lot<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.640> should

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
upgrading this pc a lot so that should

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.630 
upgrading this pc a lot so that should
be<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.270> fine<00:01:18.390> now<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.259> does<00:01:19.470> support<00:01:19.650> for<00:01:20.400> RAM

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
be just fine now it does support for RAM

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.090 
be just fine now it does support for RAM
slots<00:01:20.939> up<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.299> ddr3<00:01:21.930> 1600<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.710> that's<00:01:22.890> really

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
slots up to ddr3 1600 so that's really

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.130 
slots up to ddr3 1600 so that's really
good<00:01:23.220> sports<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.790> 32<00:01:24.210> gigabytes<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.750> RAM<00:01:24.960> so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
good sports up to 32 gigabytes of RAM so

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.440 
good sports up to 32 gigabytes of RAM so
that's<00:01:25.320> pretty<00:01:25.530> good<00:01:25.680> for<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.220> budget<00:01:26.880> oriented

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
that's pretty good for a budget oriented

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.899 
that's pretty good for a budget oriented
motherboard<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.799> upgrade<00:01:29.070> later<00:01:29.640> if

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
motherboard and you can upgrade later if

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.390 
motherboard and you can upgrade later if
you<00:01:30.060> want<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.360> say<00:01:30.479> go<00:01:30.720> for<00:01:30.930> an<00:01:31.020> i3<00:01:31.140> or<00:01:31.500> i5<00:01:31.680> you

also<00:02:31.230> like<00:02:31.710> I<00:02:31.860> said<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.310> motherboard<00:02:32.790> has

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
also like I said the motherboard has

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.690 
also like I said the motherboard has
four<00:02:33.210> ram<00:02:33.450> slots<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.140> is<00:02:34.410> say<00:02:34.710> you<00:02:35.220> know<00:02:35.340> six

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
four ram slots so is say you know six

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.640 
four ram slots so is say you know six
months<00:02:35.790> 12<00:02:36.480> months<00:02:36.570> 18<00:02:37.140> months<00:02:37.170> down<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.560> line

months 12 months 18 months down the line
you<00:02:37.800> want<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.250> get<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.610> 16<00:02:39.120> gigabyte

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
you want to get a 16 gigabyte

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.510 
you want to get a 16 gigabyte
configuration<00:02:40.350> going<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:41.100> do<00:02:41.310> have<00:02:41.460> that

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
configuration going you do have that

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.670 
configuration going you do have that
option<00:02:41.880> open<00:02:42.180> since<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:43.020> only<00:02:43.200> two<00:02:43.440> Rams

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
option open since this is only two Rams

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.040 
option open since this is only two Rams
lahaa<00:02:44.070> stick<00:02:44.490> so<00:02:44.790> if<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.660> want<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.930> do<00:02:46.020> that

lahaa stick so if you want to do that

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.960 
lahaa stick so if you want to do that
you<00:02:46.350> can<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:46.860> right<00:02:47.040> now<00:02:47.190> 8<00:02:47.430> gigabytes<00:02:47.820> is

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
you can but right now 8 gigabytes is

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.280 
you can but right now 8 gigabytes is
more<00:02:48.180> than<00:02:48.300> enough<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.870> wanted<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.140> make

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
more than enough and I wanted to make

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.900 
more than enough and I wanted to make
sure<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.500> could<00:02:49.710> fit<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:50.040> king<00:02:50.220> but<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.550> bring<00:02:50.700> in

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910

this<00:02:51.150> bill<00:02:51.420> which<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.230> kind<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.620> hard<00:02:52.800> thing

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
this bill which is kind of a hard thing

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.560 
this bill which is kind of a hard thing
to<00:02:53.130> do<00:02:53.280> since<00:02:53.520> Ram<00:02:53.940> has<00:02:54.060> been<00:02:54.240> one<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.480> those

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
to do since Ram has been one of those

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.060 
to do since Ram has been one of those
things<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:54.930> has<00:02:55.140> been<00:02:55.320> pretty<00:02:55.620> expensive

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
things that has been pretty expensive

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700
