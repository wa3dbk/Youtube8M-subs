00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.879
 all about video writings today 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.620
 I'm just going to tell you that I'm going to 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.320
 climb from time to time party villas 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.839
 gta 5 very occasionally not you 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.849
 do not worry about people and it's the video by 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.710
 fact that 7 to 5 I'll just upload it 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.080
 once in a while maybe once 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.000
 week or once every two weeks nothing 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.830
 let's say it's going to change nothing of the 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.179
 channel simply because maybe some 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:28.400
 good days I feel like playing 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.230
 too much to the call of duty or not 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.849
 have games and see what has gone up 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.950
 some fun race because you the 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.660
 I will go up simply dense to tell you that no 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.700
 is going to be regularly but from time to time 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.560
 when then it never comes badly to see me 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.570
 bank a bit in gta 5 so 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.220

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.620
 Like you can with like and favorite 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.820
 if you like it and until the next take 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:53.110
 karma that you hit me at 74 hours 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.110
 what the woman says 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.780
 What's up friends 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.680
 there it enters right in the wifi 774 now 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.030
 we are going to be the last of the 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.190
 classification that you do not know what 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.960
 if they put you 74 hours you will stay in the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.570
 the final classification because 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.520
 times the times because it's supposed to 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.619
 it's wrong very well because first it creates the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.909
 career 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.240

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.240

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.920
 I already have it 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:02:02.899
 in the east in the smart gap that 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.899
 we must seize the moment 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:14.959
 to the left as I go you give a touch 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.959
 down does not put the first person 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.660

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:34.410

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.380

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:10.200

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.200
 I do not know 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.260
 to be able to carry is not that difficult 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.850

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.890
 little but he said 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:36.709

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:17.729
