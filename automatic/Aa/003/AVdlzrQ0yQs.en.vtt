00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.870
 hello welcome again sound art in 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:10.250
 line the YouTube channel of sound art 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.170
 dot com mx today we will see what is rank 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.000
 dynamic 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.570
 let's see a very simple definition 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.020
 when we talk about dynamic range 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:29.640
 we talk about a from a distance or the 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.640
 margin that exists between a maximum value 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:38.530
 and a minimum value that we want to control 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:42.269
 maximum and minimum value of that of the 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:45.269
 amplitude of the sound that we are 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.269
 processing 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.490
 let's see some examples of values 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.800
 of minimum values 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:01:00.070
 that would be a good minimum value one 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:03.450
 it could be what is called floor 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.450
 noise background 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.450
 of a sound system 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.570
 another would be 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.570
 the threshold of hearing is to say where 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.840
 the sound begins to be heard 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.020
 perceived as those would be possible 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:29.020
 minimum values 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.020
 now let's see examples of maximum values 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.220
 one could be the level 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.220
 before saturation 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.790
 another would be 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.510
 the reference level 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.730
 and another could be the maximum level of 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.820
 our signal 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:55.200
 for example an instrument that is to say the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.230
 minimum and maximum level of change of 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.740
 amplitude of sound intensity that 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.740
 we are registering 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.810
 what is the use of knowing the dynamic range? 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.670
 to get better sound without 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.940
 cleaner saturation to protect 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.600
 our system 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.610
 to avoid saturations in the recording 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.240
 to better define the instruments in 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.240
 a mix 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.700
 we need to control it as with 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.660
 dynamic processors like which 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.660
 compressors and limiters 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.810
 let's see this graph of an instrument 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.630
 Recorded 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.580
 we see that there are variations that we call 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.480
 dynamic 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.600
 in the intensity of the sound if we put 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.290
 a line that tells us more or less the 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.290
 maximum level 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.480
 and we establish another line at level 0 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.430
 let's say let's think what is the level 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.700
 of noise floor or noise floor 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.340
 which is also known as no flower 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.550
 in this specific case this range that 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.760
 it exists here 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.440
 in what we call dynamic range is 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.770
 say the distance that there is from this 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.960
 minimum value until this peak until this 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.260
 point that we have here that is the range 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.260
 dynamic 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.300
 if the saturation was a little 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.300
 higher 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.810
 for example there is the dynamic range 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.650
 it would be up to this point from here until 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.650
 this point 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.629
 but right now for the purposes of a 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.049
 control of the dynamics by means of 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.280
 dynamic processors like compressors 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:05.189
 we could say that our range 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.530
 dynamic that we want to control is this 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:10.180
 that goes from this minimum level up 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.640
 this maximum level 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.209
 This is how he works in the 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.280
 compressors controlling this range 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:23.910
 dynamic and what do we do with 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:28.169
 this dynamic range reducing reducing it 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:31.389
 let's reduce this dynamic range to 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.639
 have a smaller distance between the value 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:37.810
 minimum and the maximum value something that we 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:40.960
 It helps a lot to give more power to 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.500
 sound and also to do more 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:48.250
 understandable for example the words 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.400
 in one in the voice in a voice sung to 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.630
 that works the compressors in another 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.180
 moment 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.800
 let's see how the compressor fits 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.680
 so that we can get 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.650
 this we do not have such a distance 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.960
 big between these two points is still in 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.960
