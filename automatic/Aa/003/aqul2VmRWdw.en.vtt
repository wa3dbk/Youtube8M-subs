00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.170
 this is better than having two cocks 

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:26.399
 i 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.730
 hello and welcome again i am cs and today 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.410
 I bring you a trick here on the map 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.450
 rails and good for it what 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.300
 we need would be the pack first 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.370
 jumper and well we created it 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.020
 for now I am teaching you the trick 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.760
 for a person is not worth it because more 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.820
 forward you will see how it can be done to 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.370
 two even and good if you want to do it 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.250
 for one I recommend lsl builder 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.020
 to be able to kill the truth much better 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.670
 easier and good the first thing we have 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.600
 what to do is place it right here 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:08.159
 that more or less make a hairline 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.159
 a little more like that 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.869
 In this trick we can to pasaros 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.310
 that we get the first one according to what 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.079
 you have to place correctly 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.689
 If you do not put it correctly when you 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.670
 metais you will not see either one side or the other 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.590
 the other one agrees or you'll see for a 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.659
 side as invisible and on the other side 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.700
 badly agree you have to see well by 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.649
 one side and the other side for both sides 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.869
 you have to see perfectly so that you 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.960
 has gone well because if you do not see that 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.790
 they will kill in the trick 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.740
 and well this is the trick itself and as 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.229
 you are watching the zombies I have left 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.350
 here shot with the builder and the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.939
 killed 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.799
 although now he had shot badly and not 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.080
 I gave them as you can see only 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.640
 they slipped 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.530
 If you want to kill them, you give them 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.240
 body and already contagia to all 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.720
 because what makes it more contagious 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.490
 so it looks 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.890
 and good as you can see now 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.890
 infect others with one shot 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.460
 and good to tell you that this trick also 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.100
 It can be done in groups as I have 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.050
 Said before 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.390
 now I will show you where my 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.800
 mate later you will see it and good 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.350
 As you can see, they also take 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.910
 things the truth that is pretty good 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.710
 the bad thing that many times is that some 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.660
 zombies get far away and move away 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.640
 and things can not be taken if 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.740
 you play alone but if you play with 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.300
 company the truth is that you can 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.700
 make good use of things for 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.980
 gas because your partner will choose it 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.270
 true and good as you see here already 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.340
 I teach the heap action when I was 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.370
 playing alone 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.590
 and until here everything later you will see 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.590
 as a group game and nothing until soon 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.900
 do not 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.120
 yes 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.210
 good 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.400
 to me 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
 Y 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.290
 all right 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.940
 if you have 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.660
 the port 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.960
 goodbye
