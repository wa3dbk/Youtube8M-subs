heat detection in Andheri is sometimes

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.190 
heat detection in Andheri is sometimes
done<00:00:09.460> as<00:00:09.700> the<00:00:09.880> animals<00:00:10.270> are<00:00:10.389> moving<00:00:10.540> to<00:00:10.930> and

this type of environment also as animals
come<00:00:36.850> into<00:00:37.059> heat<00:00:37.300> they<00:00:38.020> tend<00:00:38.290> to<00:00:38.440> group

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
come into heat they tend to group

active<00:00:42.070> groups<00:00:42.609> and<00:00:42.940> as<00:00:43.390> you<00:00:43.510> can<00:00:43.660> see<00:00:43.840> here<00:00:44.109> we

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
active groups and as you can see here we

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.900 
active groups and as you can see here we
have<00:00:44.500> noticeable<00:00:44.920> signs<00:00:45.190> of<00:00:45.370> animals<00:00:45.730> really

Wonju to mount but notice again that

Wonju to mount but notice again that
they're<00:00:48.309> not<00:00:48.429> mounting<00:00:48.879> on<00:00:49.000> this<00:00:49.149> type<00:00:49.359> of

they're not mounting on this type of
surface<00:00:50.339> if<00:00:51.339> we<00:00:51.429> watch<00:00:51.699> the<00:00:51.940> animals<00:00:52.390> we<00:00:52.539> can

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
surface if we watch the animals we can

surface if we watch the animals we can
tend<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:53.019> follow<00:00:53.260> these<00:00:53.559> around<00:00:53.859> because<00:00:54.100> they

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
tend to follow these around because they

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:55.919 
tend to follow these around because they
they<00:00:54.640> will<00:00:54.820> generally<00:00:55.089> separate<00:00:55.629> from<00:00:55.809> the

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:55.929 
they will generally separate from the

they will generally separate from the

herd when we are actually seeing high

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.110 
herd when we are actually seeing high
activity<00:00:58.749> of<00:00:59.079> estrus<00:00:59.499> in<00:01:00.070> in<00:01:00.429> these<00:01:00.699> animals

activity of estrus in in these animals

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.849 
activity of estrus in in these animals
this<00:01:01.600> would<00:01:01.780> also<00:01:01.960> be<00:01:02.079> true<00:01:02.199> of<00:01:02.589> beef<00:01:02.829> cattle

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
this would also be true of beef cattle

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.950 
this would also be true of beef cattle
if<00:01:03.370> your<00:01:03.489> heat<00:01:03.670> checking<00:01:04.059> you<00:01:04.480> would<00:01:04.629> normally

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
if your heat checking you would normally

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.720 
if your heat checking you would normally
find<00:01:04.989> these<00:01:05.320> animals<00:01:05.740> outside<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.490> group

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
find these animals outside the group

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.060 
find these animals outside the group
which<00:01:07.659> three<00:01:07.870> or<00:01:07.990> four<00:01:08.200> may<00:01:08.350> be<00:01:08.409> mounting<00:01:08.890> one

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
which three or four may be mounting one

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.030 
which three or four may be mounting one
another

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.190 

again<00:01:15.940> note<00:01:16.150> that<00:01:16.180> these<00:01:16.420> animals<00:01:16.660> are<00:01:17.050> not

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
again note that these animals are not

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.950 
again note that these animals are not
really<00:01:17.590> mounting<00:01:18.100> or<00:01:18.490> allowing<00:01:19.090> mounts<00:01:19.510> here

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
really mounting or allowing mounts here

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.260 
really mounting or allowing mounts here
animal<00:01:20.710> has<00:01:20.890> mounted<00:01:21.400> but<00:01:21.940> again<00:01:22.120> the

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
animal has mounted but again the

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.510 
animal has mounted but again the
slippery<00:01:22.660> floor<00:01:22.960> sometimes<00:01:23.620> makes<00:01:24.370> it<00:01:24.460> hard

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
slippery floor sometimes makes it hard

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.210 
slippery floor sometimes makes it hard
for<00:01:24.910> the<00:01:25.030> animals<00:01:25.420> and<00:01:25.570> they<00:01:25.800> will<00:01:26.800> not<00:01:26.950> tend

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
for the animals and they will not tend

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.850 
for the animals and they will not tend
to<00:01:27.310> do<00:01:27.460> this<00:01:27.900> here's<00:01:28.900> a<00:01:28.960> clear<00:01:29.260> example<00:01:29.380> what

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
to do this here's a clear example what

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.740 
to do this here's a clear example what
happens<00:01:30.190> on<00:01:30.340> a<00:01:30.370> slick<00:01:30.700> for<00:01:30.940> and<00:01:31.180> why<00:01:31.270> animals

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
happens on a slick for and why animals

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.080 
happens on a slick for and why animals
again<00:01:32.050> do<00:01:32.680> not<00:01:32.710> like<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.250> mount<00:01:33.400> on<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.700> cement

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
again do not like to mount on the cement

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.590 
again do not like to mount on the cement
floor<00:01:35.250> once<00:01:36.250> out<00:01:36.490> on<00:01:36.700> dirt<00:01:37.000> notice<00:01:37.450> the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
floor once out on dirt notice the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.180 
floor once out on dirt notice the
increase<00:01:37.990> of<00:01:38.050> activity<00:01:38.650> of<00:01:38.740> these<00:01:38.890> same

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
increase of activity of these same

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.960 
increase of activity of these same
animals<00:01:41.100> they<00:01:42.100> tend<00:01:42.370> again<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.790> group

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
animals they tend again to group

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.140 
animals they tend again to group
together<00:01:43.120> and<00:01:44.160> quickly<00:01:45.160> show<00:01:45.730> estrus

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
together and quickly show estrus

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.860 
together and quickly show estrus
activity<00:01:47.550> we'd<00:01:48.550> like<00:01:48.790> on<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.420> cow<00:01:49.600> that<00:01:49.660> you

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
activity we'd like on the cow that you

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.960 
activity we'd like on the cow that you
just<00:01:50.050> see<00:01:50.229> to<00:01:50.410> see<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.590> more<00:01:50.860> strong<00:01:51.280> standing

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
just see to see a more strong standing

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.910 
just see to see a more strong standing
response<00:01:52.420> rather<00:01:52.690> than<00:01:52.930> moving<00:01:53.229> off<00:01:53.410> but

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
response rather than moving off but

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.440 
response rather than moving off but
again<00:01:54.130> these<00:01:54.250> animals<00:01:54.640> are<00:01:54.729> coming<00:01:55.030> into<00:01:55.180> heat

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
again these animals are coming into heat

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.650 
again these animals are coming into heat
or<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:57.130> out<00:01:57.310> of<00:01:57.460> heat<00:01:57.610> in<00:01:57.940> most<00:01:58.150> cases<00:01:58.390> these

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
or going out of heat in most cases these

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.480 
or going out of heat in most cases these
animals<00:01:59.080> here<00:01:59.260> are<00:01:59.410> starting<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.130> come<00:02:00.310> into

animals here are starting to come into
