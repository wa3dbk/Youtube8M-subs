00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.340 
there's a secret I think it's an
umbrella<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:40.470> leave<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.979> house<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:42.320> yeah<00:01:43.320> I

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
umbrella and leave the house is yeah I

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.380 
umbrella and leave the house is yeah I
think<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.369> mean<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:44.939> something<00:01:45.119> like

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
think like I mean it's something like

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.940 
think like I mean it's something like
this<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.930> then<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.560> know<00:01:46.680> like

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
this and then have it like you know like

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.969 
this and then have it like you know like
a<00:01:46.979> scarf<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.899> yet<00:01:48.899> layering<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.680> think<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
a scarf and yet layering is I think the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.889 
a scarf and yet layering is I think the
best<00:01:50.159> option<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:51.000> cold<00:01:51.240> outside<00:01:51.390> which

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
best option it's cold outside which

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.719 
best option it's cold outside which
means<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.350> hot<00:01:52.560> inside<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:53.189> all<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.460> heat

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
means it's hot inside with all that heat

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.850 
means it's hot inside with all that heat
and<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.299> can<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.600> very<00:01:54.840> harsh<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.259> your<00:01:55.350> skin

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
and that can be very harsh on your skin

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.910 
and that can be very harsh on your skin
lots<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.759> moisturizer<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.810> your<00:01:58.140> mid<00:01:58.259> afire<00:01:58.560> I

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
have I can sleep not with I could not

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.560 
have I can sleep not with I could not
sleep<00:02:01.560> without<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.950> humidifier<00:02:02.540> because<00:02:03.540> I

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
sleep without a humidifier because I

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.060 
sleep without a humidifier because I
think<00:02:03.719> that's<00:02:04.079> really<00:02:04.350> important<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.920> keep

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
think that's really important to keep

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.880 
think that's really important to keep
your<00:02:05.130> skin<00:02:05.520> moist<00:02:05.729> because<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.240> heat<00:02:06.450> inside

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
your skin moist because the heat inside

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.710 
your skin moist because the heat inside
the<00:02:06.979> house<00:02:07.130> dries<00:02:07.520> dries<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:08.149> out<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:08.509> much
