00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
of snow stuff there we're gonna want a

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.620 
of snow stuff there we're gonna want a
bit<00:02:56.350> of<00:02:56.380> shadow<00:02:56.770> in<00:02:57.130> there<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.850> in<00:02:58.150> there<00:02:58.390> as

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
bit of shadow in there and in there as

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.690 
bit of shadow in there and in there as
well

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
well

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.930 
well
and<00:03:02.640> we're<00:03:03.640> gonna<00:03:03.760> want<00:03:04.000> some<00:03:05.880> kind<00:03:06.880> of

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
and we're gonna want some kind of

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.280 
and we're gonna want some kind of
hairiness<00:03:09.210> and<00:03:10.210> also<00:03:10.660> I<00:03:10.720> think<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:11.080> might

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
hairiness and also I think you might

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.790 
hairiness and also I think you might
want<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.650> darken<00:03:11.890> up<00:03:12.220> there<00:03:13.560> what's<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.620> cool

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
want to darken up there what's a cool

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.310 
want to darken up there what's a cool
antlers<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:16.090> I'm<00:03:16.300> only<00:03:16.480> drawing<00:03:16.780> one<00:03:17.110> of<00:03:17.260> the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
antlers and I'm only drawing one of the

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.750 
antlers and I'm only drawing one of the
antlers<00:03:17.740> because<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:18.010> think<00:03:18.070> if<00:03:18.280> you<00:03:18.370> draw<00:03:18.550> both

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
antlers because I think if you draw both

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.040 
antlers because I think if you draw both
of<00:03:19.000> them<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.330> starts<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:19.690> get<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:19.840> bit

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
of them it starts to get a bit

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.670 
of them it starts to get a bit
complicated<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.870> then<00:03:23.080> it<00:03:23.200> won't<00:03:23.350> be<00:03:23.500> easy

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
complicated and then it won't be easy

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.880 
complicated and then it won't be easy
anymore<00:03:24.510> most<00:03:25.510> people<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:26.050> think<00:03:26.110> won't<00:03:26.620> notice

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
anymore most people I think won't notice

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.640 
anymore most people I think won't notice
that<00:03:27.370> it's<00:03:27.700> just<00:03:27.910> kind<00:03:28.120> of<00:03:28.180> giving<00:03:28.480> the

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
that it's just kind of giving the

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.070 
that it's just kind of giving the
impression<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.890> what's<00:03:30.850> going<00:03:31.150> on<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.930> I

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
impression of what's going on and I

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.490 
impression of what's going on and I
think<00:03:32.140> we<00:03:32.410> could<00:03:32.590> probably<00:03:32.680> put<00:03:33.070> some<00:03:33.250> snow

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
think we could probably put some snow

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.280 
think we could probably put some snow
around<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.620> place<00:03:35.830> like<00:03:36.130> that<00:03:36.780> get<00:03:37.780> all<00:03:38.020> the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
around the place like that get all the

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.640 
around the place like that get all the
things<00:03:38.500> there<00:03:38.800> and<00:03:39.040> you<00:03:39.160> can<00:03:39.310> maybe<00:03:39.490> have<00:03:39.820> some

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
things there and you can maybe have some

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.620 
things there and you can maybe have some
some<00:03:41.650> trees<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:42.670> things<00:03:42.820> in<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.209> background

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
some trees and things in the background

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.340 
some trees and things in the background
just<00:03:43.780> to<00:03:43.900> give<00:03:44.050> it<00:03:44.170> better<00:03:44.370> atmosphere<00:03:49.320> well<00:03:50.320> I

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
just to give it better atmosphere well I

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.990 
just to give it better atmosphere well I
