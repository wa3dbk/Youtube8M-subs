traditional<00:02:25.320> sound<00:02:25.590> honestly<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.610> didn't

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
traditional sound honestly I didn't

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.330 
traditional sound honestly I didn't
think<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.510> would<00:02:27.600> be<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.780> very<00:02:28.020> good<00:02:28.320> mashup<00:02:29.130> but

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
think it would be a very good mashup but

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.250 
think it would be a very good mashup but
in<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.940> long<00:02:30.150> run<00:02:30.180> I'm<00:02:30.540> very<00:02:30.780> pleased<00:02:31.080> with

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
in the long run I'm very pleased with

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.750 
in the long run I'm very pleased with
the<00:02:31.380> way<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:31.650> record<00:02:32.010> turned<00:02:32.280> out<00:02:32.490> as<00:02:32.730> a

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
the way this record turned out as a

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.030 
the way this record turned out as a
whole<00:02:33.210> there<00:02:33.660> are<00:02:33.690> definitely<00:02:34.320> some<00:02:34.680> songs

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
whole there are definitely some songs

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.860 
whole there are definitely some songs
that<00:02:35.340> don't<00:02:35.490> really<00:02:35.730> stand<00:02:36.150> out<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.570> me<00:02:36.600> as

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
that don't really stand out to me as

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.140 
that don't really stand out to me as
much<00:02:37.290> for<00:02:37.560> example<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.460> end<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:38.940> record

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
much for example the end of the record

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.210 
much for example the end of the record
struggles<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.930> lot<00:02:40.110> more<00:02:40.350> than<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.650> first<00:02:40.920> part

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
struggles a lot more than the first part

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.330 
struggles a lot more than the first part
I<00:02:41.430> think<00:02:41.670> tracks<00:02:42.210> like<00:02:42.570> oil<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.140> water<00:02:43.340> slow

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
I think tracks like oil and water slow

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.790 
I think tracks like oil and water slow
down<00:02:44.610> really<00:02:45.240> kind<00:02:45.630> of<00:02:45.720> break<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.320> pace<00:02:46.560> of

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
down really kind of break the pace of

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.220 
down really kind of break the pace of
this<00:02:46.950> one<00:02:47.190> meteorites<00:02:48.180> kind<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.750> feels<00:02:48.990> like<00:02:49.110> a

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
this one meteorites kind of feels like a

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.100 
this one meteorites kind of feels like a
rehash<00:02:49.830> of<00:02:50.100> up<00:02:50.340> we<00:02:50.490> go<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:51.150> terms<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.600> its<00:02:51.780> scent

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
rehash of up we go in terms of its scent

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.470 
rehash of up we go in terms of its scent
line<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.770> sounding<00:02:53.190> very<00:02:53.400> similar<00:02:54.300> in

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
line and sounding very similar in

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.990 
line and sounding very similar in
production<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:56.010> instrumentation<00:02:56.640> on

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
production and the instrumentation on

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.730 
production and the instrumentation on
that<00:02:57.240> one<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:58.050> thought<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.530> was

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
that one and I thought that that was

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.800 
that one and I thought that that was
kind<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.130> cheap<00:02:59.370> move<00:02:59.640> there<00:02:59.970> it's<00:03:00.300> not<00:03:00.510> all

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
kind of a cheap move there it's not all

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.510 
kind of a cheap move there it's not all
bad<00:03:01.110> towards<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.680> end<00:03:01.830> of<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.980> record<00:03:02.160> but

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
bad towards the end of the record but

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.040 
bad towards the end of the record but
things<00:03:02.820> are<00:03:03.030> definitely<00:03:03.150> more<00:03:03.720> on<00:03:03.840> the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
things are definitely more on the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.960 
things are definitely more on the
mediocre<00:03:04.680> side<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.250> fence<00:03:05.520> which<00:03:05.760> is

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
mediocre side of the fence which is

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.840 
mediocre side of the fence which is
definitely<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:06.960> shame<00:03:07.350> how<00:03:07.950> we<00:03:08.010> do<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.520> tries<00:03:08.820> to

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
definitely a shame how we do it tries to

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.030 
definitely a shame how we do it tries to
have<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.150> little<00:03:09.480> bit<00:03:09.570> more<00:03:09.750> fun<00:03:10.080> as<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.320> pop<00:03:10.680> song

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
have a little bit more fun as a pop song

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.030 
have a little bit more fun as a pop song
but<00:03:11.580> doesn't<00:03:12.480> really<00:03:12.600> push<00:03:12.990> its<00:03:13.200> way<00:03:13.290> too<00:03:13.440> far

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
but doesn't really push its way too far

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.340 
but doesn't really push its way too far
into<00:03:14.250> my<00:03:14.460> head<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.940> mean<00:03:15.300> it<00:03:15.540> definitely<00:03:15.810> is

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
into my head I mean it definitely is

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.590 
into my head I mean it definitely is
very<00:03:16.380> catchy<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.490> something<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.210> can<00:03:18.360> be

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
very catchy and something that can be

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.200 
very catchy and something that can be
considered<00:03:18.810> ear<00:03:19.380> warming<00:03:19.890> even<00:03:20.040> but<00:03:20.490> it's<00:03:20.970> not

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
considered ear warming even but it's not

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.500 
considered ear warming even but it's not
exactly<00:03:21.720> something<00:03:22.050> I<00:03:22.440> would<00:03:22.620> consider<00:03:22.770> a

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
exactly something I would consider a

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.060 
exactly something I would consider a
long-lasting<00:03:24.510> hit<00:03:24.930> she's<00:03:25.440> done<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.890> whole<00:03:26.010> lot

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
long-lasting hit she's done a whole lot

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.980 
long-lasting hit she's done a whole lot
better<00:03:26.580> but<00:03:26.910> getting<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.540> something<00:03:27.810> that

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
better but getting to something that

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.280 
better but getting to something that
actually<00:03:28.490> really<00:03:29.490> has<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:30.150> lot<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:30.959> momentum

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
actually really has a lot of momentum

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.590 
actually really has a lot of momentum
and<00:03:31.860> power<00:03:32.100> to<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.610> we<00:03:32.940> get<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.360> opening

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
and power to it we get to the opening

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.340

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
of of that song that Avril Lavigne did

for the Alice soundtrack titled Alice
and<00:04:02.010> 2010<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:02.910> thought<00:04:03.360> that<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:03.660> was<00:04:03.870> very

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
and 2010 I thought that that was very

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.290 
and 2010 I thought that that was very
cool<00:04:04.770> because<00:04:04.800> I<00:04:05.340> really<00:04:05.670> like<00:04:05.850> that<00:04:06.030> song

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
cool because I really like that song

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.210 
cool because I really like that song
lights<00:04:06.930> doesn't<00:04:07.350> really<00:04:07.470> get<00:04:07.620> into<00:04:07.860> that<00:04:07.950> same

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
lights doesn't really get into that same

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.220 
lights doesn't really get into that same
vocal<00:04:08.550> approach<00:04:09.030> but<00:04:09.420> it's<00:04:09.720> just<00:04:09.930> that<00:04:10.080> it's

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
vocal approach but it's just that it's

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.710 
vocal approach but it's just that it's
very<00:04:10.290> dark<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.280> kind<00:04:11.700> of<00:04:11.820> has<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.240> brooding

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
very dark and kind of has a brooding

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.699 
very dark and kind of has a brooding
feel<00:04:13.410> about<00:04:13.950> it<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.340> love<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.690> visceral<00:04:16.260> nature

of<00:04:16.830> this<00:04:17.010> one<00:04:17.220> it's<00:04:17.400> just<00:04:17.640> right<00:04:18.390> there<00:04:18.780> you

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
close your eyes and you dissipate into

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.810 
close your eyes and you dissipate into
the<00:04:21.930> music<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.680> it<00:04:22.950> is<00:04:23.040> an<00:04:23.220> incredible

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
experience I like the use of kind of the

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.909 
experience I like the use of kind of the
80s<00:04:26.700> sounding<00:04:27.180> sense<00:04:27.570> almost<00:04:28.260> like<00:04:28.500> Lights

the<00:04:34.439> comparisons<00:04:35.099> that<00:04:35.189> are<00:04:35.370> made<00:04:35.520> throughout

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:35.879 
the comparisons that are made throughout

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.730 
the comparisons that are made throughout
that<00:04:36.029> track<00:04:36.389> it's<00:04:36.629> kind<00:04:37.020> of<00:04:37.080> like<00:04:37.259> science

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
that track it's kind of like science

styles<00:04:40.860> synth<00:04:41.249> show<00:04:41.610> up<00:04:41.789> on<00:04:42.029> tracks<00:04:42.389> like

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:42.659 
styles synth show up on tracks like

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:45.649 
styles synth show up on tracks like
speeding<00:04:43.229> and<00:04:43.379> the<00:04:44.039> same<00:04:44.340> see<00:04:44.759> I<00:04:44.969> think<00:04:45.300> that

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
speeding and the same see I think that

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.779 
speeding and the same see I think that
speeding<00:04:46.020> doesn't<00:04:46.469> particularly<00:04:47.249> well<00:04:47.460> just

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
speeding doesn't particularly well just

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.640 
speeding doesn't particularly well just
because<00:04:47.939> of<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:48.240> way<00:04:48.330> that<00:04:48.509> that<00:04:48.599> song<00:04:48.930> flows

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
because of the way that that song flows

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.189 
because of the way that that song flows
it's<00:04:50.310> got<00:04:50.550> a<00:04:50.580> certain<00:04:51.060> nuance<00:04:51.509> to<00:04:51.689> it<00:04:52.020> that

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
it's got a certain nuance to it that

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.290 
it's got a certain nuance to it that
actually<00:04:52.710> works<00:04:53.129> a<00:04:53.370> little<00:04:53.639> bit<00:04:53.819> more<00:04:54.150> than

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
actually works a little bit more than

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.540 
actually works a little bit more than
the<00:04:54.419> same<00:04:54.659> see<00:04:55.050> in<00:04:55.259> my<00:04:55.710> opinion<00:04:55.860> those<00:04:56.340> songs

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
the same see in my opinion those songs

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.909 
the same see in my opinion those songs
are<00:04:56.879> kind<00:04:57.210> of<00:04:57.270> in<00:04:57.449> similar<00:04:57.900> veins<00:04:58.259> I<00:04:58.590> talked

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
are kind of in similar veins I talked

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.469 
are kind of in similar veins I talked
about<00:04:59.039> a<00:04:59.189> few<00:04:59.430> tracks<00:04:59.699> that<00:04:59.939> I<00:04:59.999> didn't<00:05:00.270> really

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
about a few tracks that I didn't really

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:01.670 
about a few tracks that I didn't really
like<00:05:00.629> towards<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.110> end<00:05:01.289> of<00:05:01.439> the<00:05:01.529> album

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
like towards the end of the album

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.129 
like towards the end of the album
slowdown<00:05:02.550> being<00:05:02.939> one<00:05:03.270> of<00:05:03.389> those<00:05:03.569> just<00:05:03.900> because

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
slowdown being one of those just because

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.320 
slowdown being one of those just because
of<00:05:04.259> the<00:05:04.349> fact<00:05:04.529> that<00:05:04.800> I<00:05:04.949> feel<00:05:05.550> like<00:05:05.819> it's<00:05:05.999> two

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
of the fact that I feel like it's two

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.570 
of the fact that I feel like it's two
tried<00:05:06.839> and<00:05:07.080> true<00:05:07.349> it<00:05:07.560> plays<00:05:07.800> it<00:05:08.009> a<00:05:08.159> little<00:05:08.490> bit

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
tried and true it plays it a little bit

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.610 
tried and true it plays it a little bit
too<00:05:08.879> safe<00:05:09.210> it's<00:05:09.539> speaking<00:05:09.749> of<00:05:10.020> a<00:05:10.110> relationship

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
too safe it's speaking of a relationship

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.589 
too safe it's speaking of a relationship
where<00:05:11.189> everything<00:05:11.610> is<00:05:11.759> just<00:05:11.909> going<00:05:12.240> out<00:05:12.449> of

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
where everything is just going out of

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.329 
where everything is just going out of
control<00:05:12.689> lights<00:05:13.349> can't<00:05:13.650> get<00:05:13.830> a<00:05:13.860> handle<00:05:14.039> on

00:05:14.329 --> 00:05:14.339 
control lights can't get a handle on

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:17.029 
control lights can't get a handle on
things<00:05:14.639> it's<00:05:15.270> going<00:05:15.539> south<00:05:15.990> quickly<00:05:16.379> and<00:05:16.889> she

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
things it's going south quickly and she

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.279 
things it's going south quickly and she
just<00:05:17.189> wants<00:05:17.520> to<00:05:17.639> slow<00:05:17.939> things<00:05:18.389> down<00:05:18.629> and<00:05:19.139> just

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
just wants to slow things down and just

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.800 
just wants to slow things down and just
kind<00:05:19.499> of<00:05:19.529> reel<00:05:19.919> the<00:05:20.580> relationship<00:05:21.300> back<00:05:21.539> in

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
kind of reel the relationship back in

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.050 
kind of reel the relationship back in
before<00:05:22.080> it<00:05:22.439> turns<00:05:22.860> into<00:05:23.009> nothing<00:05:23.550> it's<00:05:23.879> not

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
before it turns into nothing it's not

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.239 
before it turns into nothing it's not
that<00:05:24.300> memorable<00:05:24.629> it's<00:05:25.229> not<00:05:25.439> doing<00:05:26.009> anything

00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:26.249 
that memorable it's not doing anything

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:28.519 
that memorable it's not doing anything
to<00:05:26.460> really<00:05:26.999> put<00:05:27.210> a<00:05:27.240> unique<00:05:27.629> identity<00:05:28.259> on

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:28.529 
to really put a unique identity on

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:31.399 
to really put a unique identity on
itself<00:05:29.069> so<00:05:29.460> I'm<00:05:29.819> saying<00:05:30.089> skip<00:05:30.629> that<00:05:30.870> one<00:05:30.930> the

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
itself so I'm saying skip that one the

but this new lights record little

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:16.040 
but this new lights record little
machines<00:06:14.520> I<00:06:14.879> think<00:06:15.360> that<00:06:15.509> there<00:06:15.659> are<00:06:15.689> some

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
machines I think that there are some

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.050 
machines I think that there are some
flaws<00:06:16.349> that<00:06:16.379> I<00:06:16.649> can't<00:06:16.889> really<00:06:17.009> look<00:06:17.219> past<00:06:17.610> some

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
flaws that I can't really look past some

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.459 
flaws that I can't really look past some
of<00:06:18.089> the<00:06:18.210> tracks<00:06:18.479> that<00:06:18.749> I'm<00:06:18.899> just<00:06:19.080> not<00:06:19.259> totally

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:19.469 
of the tracks that I'm just not totally

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:21.700 
of the tracks that I'm just not totally
onboard<00:06:19.919> with<00:06:20.460> a<00:06:20.490> little<00:06:20.909> bit<00:06:21.029> of<00:06:21.120> lackluster

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
onboard with a little bit of lackluster

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.019 
onboard with a little bit of lackluster
instrumentation<00:06:22.710> what<00:06:23.219> I<00:06:23.370> do<00:06:23.490> like<00:06:23.789> the<00:06:23.909> way

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:24.029 
instrumentation what I do like the way

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:25.790 
instrumentation what I do like the way
that<00:06:24.180> the<00:06:24.330> synthesizers<00:06:24.990> are<00:06:25.020> toned<00:06:25.409> I<00:06:25.620> think

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
that the synthesizers are toned I think

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.040 
that the synthesizers are toned I think
the<00:06:25.889> mixing<00:06:26.370> is<00:06:26.520> done<00:06:27.029> pretty<00:06:27.270> well<00:06:27.389> on<00:06:27.719> the

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
the mixing is done pretty well on the

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.989 
the mixing is done pretty well on the
majority<00:06:28.469> of<00:06:28.589> the<00:06:28.680> tracks<00:06:28.979> lights<00:06:29.669> gave<00:06:29.969> a

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:29.999 
majority of the tracks lights gave a

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:31.519 
majority of the tracks lights gave a
pretty<00:06:30.419> good<00:06:30.569> vocal<00:06:30.930> performance<00:06:31.379> all

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:31.529 
pretty good vocal performance all

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:33.290 
pretty good vocal performance all
throughout<00:06:32.009> this<00:06:32.189> thing<00:06:32.460> and<00:06:32.729> I<00:06:32.999> can<00:06:33.149> tell

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
throughout this thing and I can tell

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.730 
throughout this thing and I can tell
that<00:06:33.419> there<00:06:33.569> was<00:06:33.599> actually<00:06:34.110> some<00:06:34.259> effort<00:06:34.560> put

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
that there was actually some effort put

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.369 
that there was actually some effort put
into<00:06:34.889> this<00:06:35.069> so<00:06:35.399> for<00:06:35.610> me<00:06:35.729> it's<00:06:35.879> a<00:06:35.999> 3.5<00:06:36.599> out<00:06:37.080> of<00:06:37.139> 5

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:37.379 
into this so for me it's a 3.5 out of 5
