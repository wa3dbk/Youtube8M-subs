00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.740
 from samoa the tension 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.770
 if we passed 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.170
 to 60 percent 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.659
 two protesters were families that went with guys 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:11.909
 no more than six years 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:15.389
 there he founded what he did not find us 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.079
 were two women were approaching those families 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.189
 they were asking him and scoring in a city of Isfahan 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.189
 so it seems 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.220
 where we started 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.220

 that approached these families while we saw the above 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.740
 the people who hit 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.770

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.900
 was approaching women 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.430
 thirty meters from the raft 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.430
 talk to each person and look 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.400
 they wrote down in the form 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.400
 two letters the gilad glue like at school 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.010
 absent presidents present already absent 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.710
 women of the payroll movement teresa rodrÃ­guez and the trousseau 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.710
 dictated a can uncover and this week 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.930
 basically for 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.920
 something that we are going to see now 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.850
 and that is previously a document 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.250
 of banorte-ixe 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.250
 audio problems 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.830
 well first let's see the protesters shouting with banners and sticks but 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.080
 later 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.610
 a recent document 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.580
 where the first one is talking to three women in the first one was 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.530
 impersonating 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.310
 to the son 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.179
 kira piquetero and that march could not go 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:17.699
 because he has a changa 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:20.099
 then to take care of the plan 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.479
 this woman the mother of this person 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:24.969
 he took his place 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:29.019
 time is running out with two women two mothers of three luque boys 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.149
 they spoke directly 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:35.330
 with us explaining that if they did not go to the march 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.889
 they were going to take them out 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:40.849
 to download the plan 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.319
 what these people 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.759
 almost extorted 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.739
 there that this march 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.989
 many cases there were sticks and balaclavas 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.559
 and in most cases 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:53.909
 need 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.799
