some<00:01:19.810> time<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:20.380> thing<00:01:20.590> that's<00:01:20.799> special<00:01:20.920> about

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
some time the thing that's special about

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.560 
some time the thing that's special about
digging<00:01:21.610> and<00:01:21.729> special<00:01:22.090> moves<00:01:22.240> that<00:01:22.420> they're

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
digging and special moves that they're

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.280 
digging and special moves that they're
kind<00:01:22.750> of<00:01:22.840> like<00:01:23.189> defensive<00:01:24.869> when<00:01:25.869> they<00:01:25.990> start

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
kind of like defensive when they start

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.899 
kind of like defensive when they start
off<00:01:26.409> if<00:01:26.649> you<00:01:26.740> shoot<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:26.979> projectile<00:01:27.430> item<00:01:27.790> he

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
off if you shoot a projectile item he

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.389 
off if you shoot a projectile item he
can<00:01:28.060> roll<00:01:28.299> under<00:01:28.659> it<00:01:28.810> and<00:01:28.990> attack<00:01:29.920> so<00:01:30.280> they

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
can roll under it and attack so they

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.039 
can roll under it and attack so they
kind<00:01:30.610> of<00:01:30.640> start<00:01:30.880> off<00:01:31.119> defensively<00:01:31.689> and<00:01:31.930> then

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
kind of start off defensively and then

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.679 
kind of start off defensively and then
they<00:01:32.170> end<00:01:32.409> up<00:01:32.670> offensively<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:34.299> same<00:01:34.509> with

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
they end up offensively the same with

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.450 
they end up offensively the same with
kind<00:01:34.930> of<00:01:34.990> like<00:01:35.110> a<00:01:35.200> dodging<00:01:35.680> punch<00:01:35.950> that<00:01:36.159> he<00:01:36.280> has

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
kind of like a dodging punch that he has

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.580 
kind of like a dodging punch that he has
well<00:01:36.790> basically<00:01:37.149> this<00:01:37.840> initial<00:01:38.200> movin<00:01:38.469> see

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
well basically this initial movin see

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.980 
well basically this initial movin see
takes<00:01:38.860> a<00:01:38.950> step<00:01:39.189> back<00:01:39.219> so<00:01:39.640> if<00:01:39.759> your<00:01:40.180> opponent<00:01:40.750> is

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
takes a step back so if your opponent is

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.719 
takes a step back so if your opponent is
attacking<00:01:41.500> you<00:01:41.649> he<00:01:42.100> takes<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.460> step<00:01:42.700> back

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
attacking you he takes a step back

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.359 
attacking you he takes a step back
avoids<00:01:43.360> that<00:01:43.770> attack<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:45.100> then<00:01:45.189> basically

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
avoids that attack and then basically

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.510 
avoids that attack and then basically
punches<00:01:46.090> when<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.869> opponent<00:01:47.110> is<00:01:47.530> open<00:01:48.189> I'm

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
punches when the opponent is open I'm

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.130 
punches when the opponent is open I'm
more<00:01:48.670> susceptible<00:01:48.969> to<00:01:49.210> attacks<00:01:49.689> he's<00:01:50.110> a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
more susceptible to attacks he's a

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.350 
more susceptible to attacks he's a
really<00:01:50.469> good<00:01:50.619> strategy<00:01:51.310> Clary<00:01:51.640> he's<00:01:51.939> not<00:01:52.149> like

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
really good strategy Clary he's not like

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.270 
really good strategy Clary he's not like
a<00:01:52.390> beginner's<00:01:52.869> type<00:01:53.079> of<00:01:53.200> player<00:01:53.409> but<00:01:53.710> when<00:01:54.130> you
