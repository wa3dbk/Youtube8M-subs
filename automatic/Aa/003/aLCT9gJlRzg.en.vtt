00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.519 
about them which is weird because if
it's<00:04:21.400> not<00:04:21.489> listed<00:04:21.849> online<00:04:22.210> how<00:04:23.169> do<00:04:23.229> they<00:04:23.500> know

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:23.529 
it's not listed online how do they know

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:25.379 
it's not listed online how do they know
about<00:04:23.680> it<00:04:24.099> but<00:04:24.279> it's<00:04:24.460> just<00:04:24.550> kind<00:04:24.880> of<00:04:24.940> funny<00:04:25.150> I

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
about it but it's just kind of funny I

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.240 
about it but it's just kind of funny I
just<00:04:26.139> had<00:04:26.380> to<00:04:26.590> get<00:04:26.770> these<00:04:26.979> key

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
just had to get these key

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.490 
just had to get these key
even<00:04:27.880> though<00:04:28.060> I'm<00:04:28.300> not<00:04:28.330> a<00:04:28.540> fan<00:04:28.840> of<00:04:28.870> snap<00:04:29.320> on

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
even though I'm not a fan of snap on

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.910 
even though I'm not a fan of snap on
cases<00:04:29.880> because<00:04:30.880> they<00:04:31.420> have<00:04:31.690> Hawaii<00:04:32.380> on<00:04:32.680> them

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
cases because they have Hawaii on them

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.190 
cases because they have Hawaii on them
so<00:04:33.400> I<00:04:33.460> had<00:04:33.700> to<00:04:33.730> get<00:04:34.090> them<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:34.510> add<00:04:34.660> them<00:04:34.690> to<00:04:35.050> my

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
going to get any link catching inside

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.560 
going to get any link catching inside
also<00:05:08.680> on<00:05:08.980> something<00:05:09.970> I<00:05:10.060> forgot<00:05:10.210> to<00:05:10.390> mention

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
also on something I forgot to mention

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.970 
also on something I forgot to mention
about<00:05:11.520> you<00:05:12.520> can<00:05:12.730> see<00:05:12.970> some<00:05:13.560> flowers<00:05:14.560> I'm

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
about you can see some flowers I'm

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.620 
about you can see some flowers I'm
actually<00:05:15.250> not<00:05:15.580> sure<00:05:15.640> if<00:05:15.910> you<00:05:16.000> can<00:05:16.150> see<00:05:16.210> that

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
actually not sure if you can see that

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.680 
actually not sure if you can see that
like<00:05:16.990> some<00:05:17.430> design<00:05:18.430> printing<00:05:19.030> going<00:05:19.390> on<00:05:19.570> the

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
like some design printing going on the

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.320 
like some design printing going on the
sides<00:05:19.930> here<00:05:20.260> on<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:20.500> clear<00:05:20.860> so<00:05:21.520> I<00:05:21.550> think<00:05:21.970> they

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
sides here on the clear so I think they

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.570 
sides here on the clear so I think they
should<00:05:22.540> have<00:05:22.570> just<00:05:22.900> made<00:05:23.620> the<00:05:23.770> design<00:05:24.160> go<00:05:24.370> all

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
should have just made the design go all

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.240 
should have just made the design go all
the<00:05:24.669> way<00:05:24.700> up<00:05:24.970> to<00:05:25.000> the<00:05:25.180> edge<00:05:25.390> here<00:05:26.100> but<00:05:27.100> I<00:05:27.130> don't

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
the way up to the edge here but I don't

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.370 
the way up to the edge here but I don't
know<00:05:27.460> if<00:05:27.580> they<00:05:27.730> just<00:05:27.940> wanted<00:05:28.270> to<00:05:28.450> show<00:05:28.630> show

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
know if they just wanted to show show

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.670 
know if they just wanted to show show
off<00:05:29.590> the<00:05:29.740> chrome<00:05:30.010> bezel<00:05:30.220> but<00:05:30.820> on<00:05:30.970> each<00:05:31.300> of<00:05:31.900> the

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
off the chrome bezel but on each of the

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.630 
off the chrome bezel but on each of the
case<00:05:33.330> maybe<00:05:34.330> this<00:05:34.630> one<00:05:34.840> isn't<00:05:35.169> as<00:05:35.350> bad<00:05:35.710> but<00:05:36.070> on

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
case maybe this one isn't as bad but on

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.540 
case maybe this one isn't as bad but on
this<00:05:36.970> one<00:05:37.240> there's<00:05:37.720> like<00:05:38.050> where<00:05:38.800> the<00:05:39.040> printing

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
this one there's like where the printing

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.850 
this one there's like where the printing
stops<00:05:40.000> here<00:05:40.300> on<00:05:40.450> the<00:05:40.570> side<00:05:40.780> can<00:05:41.350> see<00:05:41.590> some

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
stops here on the side can see some

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.659 
stops here on the side can see some
right<00:05:42.070> there<00:05:42.310> in<00:05:42.430> the<00:05:42.460> corner<00:05:42.850> and<00:05:44.100> over<00:05:45.100> here
