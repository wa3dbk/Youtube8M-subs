00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.179
 this is where you at all and larry max 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.619
 today to introduce my farm to 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.960
 100% automatic flowers 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.850
 so here in the last video his 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.820
 powers that it was semi-automatic 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.029
 so had to use feeling now 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.710
 it's 100% automatic because I have 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.160
 discovered that the ten younger sisters 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.399
 could grow grass when 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.870
 they were stuck to the grass so the 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.410
 system a little bit changed in 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.340
 below so I'm going to do my little 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.329
 loan demonstration of the goodville 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.969
 the bonhomie of it's good we are 70 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.530
 spencer so this problem is that apart 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.800
 an automatic reloading system 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.910
 that is to say the game metal and 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.390
 subscriptions in a safe and some 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.780
 thinkers clues must be obliged to 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.180
 obliged to remove it by hand that's 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.630
 no problem you can pass like this and 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.170
 to do a few times here I am you 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.170
 we have team system 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.180
 Here it makes the flowers grow is 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:31.410
 broke 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:33.540
 automatically one is a hockey has it 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.350
 then we have the mind cards 10 pensser 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.430
 below who passes and who soon looking 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.100
 all the systems tchekhov power it 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.570
 must see this product as much we 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.570
 do not go without an listing 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.280
 so sometimes he misses it but the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.400
 part of the time it resumes in a 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:01.770
 next post to the passage the war 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.680
 lemanic art hopper widows first 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.830
 system through the blocks well that's it 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.020
 really very very well so how's that 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:16.070
 market 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:24.600
 so already to make the grass appear 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:28.350
 monday spencer here who is one who is 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.510
 like that on the grass so when the asset 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.890
 grew grass 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:37.440
 so it's connected like that so a double 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.989
 m version to put son who there 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.340
 go up because it will be pretty hot because it 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:49.110
 is it would come right over it 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:54.420
 serves tic for genetic 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:59.430
 oh yes it's true so here we are 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:05.310
 have the pistons use it broke the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:08.670
 the goodness of keke put therefore concern 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.060
 all these clock exceptions that I you 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.980
 showed right away 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:20.030
 tech here are simply pistons 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.900
 like that finally nazi cross eaters 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:29.800
 we could think of that you put some 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:39.950
 repeaters like that a little block in front 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:41.720
 and ashton pounds every time and 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.989
 then a nice money 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.780
 you see that that's it so it's 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.100
 maybe better friendly enough block 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:56.530
 who has passed 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:04:00.520
 so that's when this clock gerlier a 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.850
 exit here the exit 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:08.350
 opposite you have to go back to rest for 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:11.590
 let time here like that you and 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.540
 to see that you do not laugh it's 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.370
 very fast 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:20.500
 in fact these tracks we grow grass 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:25.300
 and it is pushed back directly into 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.760
 forging then impoverishes 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.070
 exit is useless but she like 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.730
 needed to move the blister 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.610
 con and it like that and we take the 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.190
 last exit here so here I put a 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.510
 piston to enable / disable in 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.630
 take the opportunity to pass what 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.340
 to link them 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.250
 sorry so that's the hasty bind 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:55.600
 your spencer we can freedom in 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:59.290
 underneath so an aston be powered 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:04.140
 thanks to the block when it will be there a 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.140
 sandwich that we will agree 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:15.160
 when even boutin ashton goes alas 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.220
 steadily there repeaters that will 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.080
 feed this block that was going through there so 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.620
 there you put a dilemma penthouse 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.800
 repeaters and a double inverter that 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:30.220
 connected to the ten spectators were the 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.630
 good city so below in game all 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.000
 simple you put a numerical scheme 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:39.150
 art that will go through all below 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.150
 the grass when it's for everything picked up 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.270
 then 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.330
 for the station where they have 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:52.720
 systems that's all stupid so you 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:56.690
 hopper here who are watching the chest that's 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:06:00.260
 next hopper is a link comparator 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:05.630
 an opponent who feed him this 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:07.760
 stone so coleman cards to items that 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:11.180
 will activate the satellite - named upper of the 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.650
 taste so activate the comparator so 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.170
 it will prevent the same card from leaving 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.860
 as long as he is not full and when he 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:22.250
 has nothing in mayer automatically 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:24.790
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.780
 will have more if this is the case the monkeys m 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.550
 subscribe to the match n 6 has not done 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.550
 I tell you you
