enormous<00:00:30.259> amounts<00:00:30.529> to<00:00:30.650> find<00:00:30.800> out<00:00:30.949> about

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:31.159 
enormous amounts to find out about

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:32.790 
enormous amounts to find out about
themselves<00:00:31.429> if<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:32.119> conditions<00:00:32.570> are<00:00:32.689> right

themselves if the conditions are right
and<00:00:33.800> I<00:00:33.890> feel<00:00:34.100> it's<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.280> great<00:00:34.490> the<00:00:35.240> great<00:00:35.450> role

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
and I feel it's the great the great role

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.790 
and I feel it's the great the great role
of<00:00:35.780> a<00:00:35.840> teacher<00:00:35.990> you<00:00:36.260> know<00:00:36.380> when<00:00:36.500> I<00:00:36.530> was<00:00:36.680> saying

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
of a teacher you know when I was saying

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.340 
of a teacher you know when I was saying
moving<00:00:37.130> to<00:00:37.250> a<00:00:37.280> different<00:00:38.180> metaphor<00:00:39.170> an

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
moving to a different metaphor an

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.840 
moving to a different metaphor an
organic<00:00:39.680> metaphor<00:00:40.040> I<00:00:40.070> think<00:00:40.280> it's<00:00:40.370> going<00:00:40.610> from

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
organic metaphor I think it's going from

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.360 
organic metaphor I think it's going from
an<00:00:41.030> industrial<00:00:41.660> metaphor<00:00:42.350> to<00:00:42.590> an<00:00:42.680> agriculture

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
an industrial metaphor to an agriculture

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.100 
an industrial metaphor to an agriculture
and<00:00:43.460> agricultural<00:00:43.970> one<00:00:44.120> because<00:00:44.930> you<00:00:44.990> think

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
and agricultural one because you think

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.010 
and agricultural one because you think
of<00:00:45.230> you<00:00:45.350> know<00:00:45.470> a<00:00:45.500> great<00:00:46.300> gardener<00:00:47.300> great

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
of you know a great gardener great

of you know a great gardener great
farmer<00:00:48.970> depends<00:00:49.970> upon<00:00:50.770> plants<00:00:51.770> growing<00:00:52.010> under

that<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.560> me<00:01:27.679> is<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:27.859> great<00:01:28.009> gift<00:01:28.159> of<00:01:28.369> teaching

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
that to me is the great gift of teaching

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.309 
that to me is the great gift of teaching
you<00:01:28.819> know<00:01:28.939> to<00:01:28.999> recognize<00:01:29.630> that<00:01:29.810> growth<00:01:30.079> is

00:01:30.309 --> 00:01:30.319 
you know to recognize that growth is

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:31.660 
you know to recognize that growth is
possible<00:01:30.799> at<00:01:30.979> any<00:01:31.189> time

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
possible at any time

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.489 
possible at any time
like<00:01:32.329> in<00:01:32.509> Death<00:01:32.689> Valley<00:01:32.719> you<00:01:33.170> know<00:01:33.289> in<00:01:33.409> the

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499 
like in Death Valley you know in the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:34.870 
like in Death Valley you know in the
most<00:01:33.649> deathless<00:01:34.100> place<00:01:34.310> on<00:01:34.490> earth<00:01:34.609> there's

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
most deathless place on earth there's

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.489 
most deathless place on earth there's
life<00:01:35.090> there<00:01:35.389> if<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:36.170> know<00:01:36.289> what<00:01:36.409> the

00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:36.499 
life there if you know what the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:38.770 
life there if you know what the
conditions<00:01:36.950> are<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:38.179> great<00:01:38.359> challenge

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
conditions are and the great challenge

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.940 
conditions are and the great challenge
for<00:01:38.810> teaching<00:01:39.200> I<00:01:39.259> think<00:01:39.469> it's<00:01:39.560> not<00:01:39.679> just<00:01:39.889> to

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
for teaching I think it's not just to

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.139 
for teaching I think it's not just to
know<00:01:40.069> your<00:01:40.219> discipline<00:01:40.670> but<00:01:40.789> to<00:01:40.880> know<00:01:40.999> your

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
know your discipline but to know your

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.789 
know your discipline but to know your
students<00:01:41.569> and<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.200> know<00:01:42.469> what<00:01:42.649> the

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
students and to know what the

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.319 
students and to know what the
pedagogical<00:01:43.159> ratio<00:01:43.549> is<00:01:43.729> that<00:01:43.909> will<00:01:43.999> make<00:01:44.179> them

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
pedagogical ratio is that will make them

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:45.520 
pedagogical ratio is that will make them
flourish<00:01:44.659> and<00:01:44.810> become<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.109> best<00:01:45.289> thing<00:01:45.409> they

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
flourish and become the best thing they

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.969 
flourish and become the best thing they
can<00:01:45.590> be<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:46.520> I<00:01:46.700> think<00:01:46.999> that<00:01:47.329> it's<00:01:47.899> not<00:01:48.619> just

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
can be and I think that it's not just

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.190 
can be and I think that it's not just
something<00:01:49.100> for<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.369> young<00:01:49.579> and<00:01:50.200> increasing

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
something for the young and increasing

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.599 
something for the young and increasing
it's<00:01:51.289> something<00:01:51.530> we<00:01:51.619> see<00:01:51.770> we<00:01:52.219> should<00:01:52.429> see<00:01:52.549> is

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
it's something we see we should see is

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.399 
it's something we see we should see is
intergenerational<00:01:53.170> rather<00:01:54.170> than<00:01:54.289> to

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
intergenerational rather than to

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:55.270 
intergenerational rather than to
something<00:01:54.619> that<00:01:54.649> happens<00:01:54.920> at<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.039> beginning

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
something that happens at the beginning

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.559 
something that happens at the beginning
of<00:01:55.310> our<00:01:55.429> logic<00:01:55.759> should<00:01:55.909> enjoy<00:01:56.209> throughout<00:01:56.450> the

of our logic should enjoy throughout the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:02.420 
of our logic should enjoy throughout the
whole<00:01:56.689> of<00:01:56.810> it
