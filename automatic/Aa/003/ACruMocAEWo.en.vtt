August so I feel the need to jazz it up
a<00:00:26.089> little<00:00:26.269> bit<00:00:26.509> and<00:00:26.689> step<00:00:27.349> outside<00:00:27.589> my<00:00:28.250> comfort

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
a little bit and step outside my comfort

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.740 
a little bit and step outside my comfort
zone<00:00:28.910> in<00:00:29.419> terms<00:00:30.050> of<00:00:30.349> how<00:00:30.679> I<00:00:30.710> wear<00:00:31.160> my<00:00:31.339> hair<00:00:31.640> so<00:00:32.360> I

zone in terms of how I wear my hair so I
have<00:00:33.380> a<00:00:33.590> another<00:00:34.629> yarn<00:00:35.629> twist<00:00:36.079> style<00:00:37.010> that

I've<00:00:38.030> envisioned<00:00:38.840> and<00:00:39.110> we'll<00:00:40.039> see<00:00:40.370> how<00:00:40.610> it

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
I've envisioned and we'll see how it

00:00:40.640 --> 00:03:32.460 
I've envisioned and we'll see how it
turns<00:00:40.820> out

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:04:44.520 

the

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.240 

okay<00:04:45.530> so<00:04:46.070> i<00:04:46.639> like<00:04:47.509> it<00:04:47.780> i<00:04:47.960> am<00:04:48.650> not<00:04:48.919> too<00:04:49.220> sure

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
okay so i like it i am not too sure

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.810 
okay so i like it i am not too sure
about<00:04:49.940> this<00:04:50.599> part<00:04:50.960> up<00:04:51.139> here<00:04:51.340> I'm<00:04:52.340> not<00:04:52.580> really

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
about this part up here I'm not really

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.520 
about this part up here I'm not really
feeling<00:04:53.300> that<00:04:53.509> I<00:04:53.720> think<00:04:54.110> it<00:04:54.199> might<00:04:54.320> look

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
feeling that I think it might look

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.029 
feeling that I think it might look
better<00:04:54.770> if<00:04:55.250> it<00:04:55.400> was<00:04:55.699> a<00:04:56.060> pompadour<00:04:56.659> or<00:04:57.349> maybe<00:04:57.740> if

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
better if it was a pompadour or maybe if

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.830 
better if it was a pompadour or maybe if
I<00:04:58.280> didn't<00:04:58.789> do<00:04:58.880> anything<00:04:59.120> to<00:04:59.449> it<00:04:59.479> at<00:04:59.690> all<00:04:59.780> and

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
I didn't do anything to it at all and

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.620 
I didn't do anything to it at all and
just<00:05:00.199> had<00:05:00.530> it<00:05:00.740> just<00:05:01.400> smooth<00:05:02.030> back<00:05:02.300> with<00:05:02.510> the

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
just had it just smooth back with the

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.399 
just had it just smooth back with the
rest<00:05:02.780> of<00:05:02.990> my<00:05:03.139> hair<00:05:03.409> but<00:05:03.889> I<00:05:03.919> definitely<00:05:04.460> see<00:05:05.120> the

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
rest of my hair but I definitely see the

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:10.210 
rest of my hair but I definitely see the
potential<00:05:06.409> and<00:05:06.680> I<00:05:07.130> do<00:05:07.190> like<00:05:07.810> this<00:05:08.810> I<00:05:09.139> like<00:05:10.010> how

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
potential and I do like this I like how

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.210 
potential and I do like this I like how
that<00:05:10.250> turned<00:05:10.849> out<00:05:11.060> i<00:05:11.120> love<00:05:11.810> that<00:05:12.470> i<00:05:12.710> think<00:05:12.919> it

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
that turned out i love that i think it

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.670 
that turned out i love that i think it
probably<00:05:13.250> would<00:05:13.729> look<00:05:13.940> better<00:05:14.419> if<00:05:14.810> my<00:05:14.840> twists

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
probably would look better if my twists

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.370 
probably would look better if my twists
were<00:05:15.800> longer<00:05:16.130> and<00:05:16.580> I<00:05:17.330> could<00:05:17.570> really<00:05:17.599> wrap<00:05:18.199> it

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
were longer and I could really wrap it

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.600 
were longer and I could really wrap it
around<00:05:19.000> more<00:05:20.000> but<00:05:20.479> i<00:05:20.949> like<00:05:21.949> it<00:05:21.979> i<00:05:22.310> think<00:05:22.370> it

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
around more but i like it i think it

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.339 
around more but i like it i think it
came<00:05:22.729> out<00:05:22.789> really<00:05:22.970> cute<00:05:23.479> i<00:05:23.690> like<00:05:24.080> how<00:05:24.289> that

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
came out really cute i like how that

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:26.770 
came out really cute i like how that
looks<00:05:24.500> I<00:05:25.010> think<00:05:25.760> the<00:05:26.060> thing<00:05:26.300> though<00:05:26.479> you<00:05:26.539> have

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
looks I think the thing though you have

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.600 
looks I think the thing though you have
to<00:05:26.810> be<00:05:26.990> careful<00:05:27.260> this<00:05:27.620> pulling<00:05:28.070> back<00:05:28.280> I<00:05:28.520> do

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
to be careful this pulling back I do

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.909 
to be careful this pulling back I do
feel<00:05:29.060> a<00:05:29.090> little<00:05:29.270> bit<00:05:29.479> of<00:05:29.599> tension<00:05:29.840> on<00:05:30.139> my<00:05:30.169> edges

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
feel a little bit of tension on my edges

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.310 
feel a little bit of tension on my edges
so<00:05:31.400> I<00:05:31.430> just<00:05:31.760> have<00:05:31.909> to<00:05:31.940> kind<00:05:32.210> of<00:05:32.300> make<00:05:32.780> sure<00:05:33.020> that

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
so I just have to kind of make sure that

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.350 
so I just have to kind of make sure that
the<00:05:33.470> twists<00:05:33.800> are<00:05:34.070> loose<00:05:34.370> because<00:05:34.849> heaven

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
the twists are loose because heaven

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.779 
the twists are loose because heaven
knows<00:05:35.750> I<00:05:36.229> don't<00:05:36.889> want<00:05:37.039> to<00:05:37.099> lose<00:05:37.310> a<00:05:37.340> little<00:05:37.639> bit

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
knows I don't want to lose a little bit

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.719 
knows I don't want to lose a little bit
of<00:05:37.909> edges<00:05:38.300> that<00:05:38.419> I<00:05:38.479> do<00:05:38.599> have<00:05:39.080> so<00:05:40.039> just<00:05:40.580> be

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
of edges that I do have so just be

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.240 
of edges that I do have so just be
careful<00:05:41.030> of<00:05:41.389> that<00:05:41.560> so<00:05:42.560> i<00:05:42.590> think<00:05:42.770> i'm<00:05:43.070> going<00:05:43.159> to

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
careful of that so i think i'm going to

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.740 
careful of that so i think i'm going to
wear<00:05:43.340> my<00:05:43.400> hair<00:05:43.699> like<00:05:43.729> this<00:05:43.909> to<00:05:44.210> work<00:05:44.389> I'm<00:05:44.599> not

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
wear my hair like this to work I'm not

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.330 
wear my hair like this to work I'm not
sure<00:05:44.990> when<00:05:45.229> I'm<00:05:45.320> going<00:05:45.440> to<00:05:45.530> put<00:05:45.740> on<00:05:45.979> it<00:05:46.010> I

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
sure when I'm going to put on it I

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.719 
sure when I'm going to put on it I
definitely<00:05:46.699> do<00:05:47.330> like<00:05:47.630> something<00:05:48.560> on<00:05:48.860> my<00:05:49.460> hair

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
definitely do like something on my hair

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.779 
definitely do like something on my hair
it<00:05:49.849> looks<00:05:50.030> very<00:05:50.120> plain<00:05:50.800> without<00:05:51.800> something<00:05:52.400> so

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
it looks very plain without something so

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:54.670 
it looks very plain without something so
i'll<00:05:53.090> probably<00:05:53.330> jazz<00:05:53.720> it<00:05:53.930> up<00:05:54.020> with<00:05:54.080> the<00:05:54.289> scarf

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
i'll probably jazz it up with the scarf

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.149 
i'll probably jazz it up with the scarf
or<00:05:55.340> with<00:05:55.789> a<00:05:55.820> headband<00:05:56.419> not<00:05:57.289> really<00:05:57.500> sure<00:05:57.740> but

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:58.159
