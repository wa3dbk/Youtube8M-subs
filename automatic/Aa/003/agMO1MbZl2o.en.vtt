00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
screen so we're gonna take a look at how

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.549 
screen so we're gonna take a look at how
to<00:00:53.880> calibrate<00:00:54.450> a<00:00:54.540> monitor<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.079> build<00:00:55.440> a

to calibrate a monitor and build a
printer<00:00:55.829> profile<00:00:56.280> now<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.510> device<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.899> I'm

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
printer profile now the device that I'm

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.660 
printer profile now the device that I'm
going<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> use<00:00:58.290> is<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.040> one<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.370> use<00:00:59.550> in

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
going to use is the one that I use in

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.280 
going to use is the one that I use in
the<00:00:59.760> field<00:00:59.940> which<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.480> an<00:01:00.629> X<00:01:00.809> right<00:01:00.989> color

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
the field which is an X right color

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.600 
the field which is an X right color
monkey<00:01:01.620> because<00:01:01.860> it<00:01:02.040> can<00:01:02.160> calibrate<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
monkey because it can calibrate a

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.789 
monkey because it can calibrate a
monitor<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.570> make<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> printer<00:01:04.259> profile

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
monitor it can make a printer profile

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.489 
monitor it can make a printer profile
and<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.179> also<00:01:06.329> use<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:06.899> you<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.020> a

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:07.499 
and you can also use it if you have a

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:09.319 
and you can also use it if you have a
projector<00:01:08.219> to<00:01:08.249> calibrate<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.789> projector<00:01:09.240> as

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:09.329 
projector to calibrate the projector as

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.160 
projector to calibrate the projector as
well<00:01:10.130> but<00:01:11.130> what<00:01:12.090> you're<00:01:12.240> about<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.630> see<00:01:12.780> holds

the device is connected and that I'm

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.929 
the device is connected and that I'm
going<00:01:50.819> to<00:01:50.939> have<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.359> set<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.349> device<00:01:52.669> here<00:01:53.669> so

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
going to have to set the device here so

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.609 
going to have to set the device here so
let<00:01:54.060> me<00:01:54.149> show<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.299> how<00:01:54.419> to<00:01:54.509> do<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.749> it's

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
let me show you how to do that it's

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.929 
let me show you how to do that it's
fairly<00:01:55.950> straightforward<00:01:56.279> we're<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.849> this

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
fairly straightforward we're in this

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.459 
fairly straightforward we're in this
position<00:01:57.149> right<00:01:57.539> here<00:01:57.599> and<00:01:57.959> what<00:01:58.229> we're<00:01:58.380> going

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
position right here and what we're going

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.389 
position right here and what we're going
to<00:01:58.529> do<00:01:58.709> is<00:01:58.950> go<00:01:59.189> from<00:01:59.340> there<00:01:59.609> to<00:01:59.789> there<00:02:01.189> now<00:02:02.189> that

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
to do is go from there to there now that

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.219 
to do is go from there to there now that
we<00:02:02.489> have<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:03.319> we're<00:02:04.319> gonna<00:02:04.409> click<00:02:04.819> calibrate

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
we have that we're gonna click calibrate

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.300 
we have that we're gonna click calibrate
what's<00:02:07.229> gonna<00:02:07.349> happen<00:02:07.679> now<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.039> device

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
what's gonna happen now is the device

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.710 
what's gonna happen now is the device
it's<00:02:08.489> gonna<00:02:08.580> calibrate<00:02:09.090> itself<00:02:09.360> it's<00:02:09.570> going

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
it's gonna calibrate itself it's going

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.940 
it's gonna calibrate itself it's going
to<00:02:09.780> check<00:02:09.990> to<00:02:10.080> see<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.410> everything's<00:02:10.770> in

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
to check to see that everything's in

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.230 
to check to see that everything's in
order<00:02:11.070> and<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:11.640> right<00:02:11.820> and<00:02:11.970> then<00:02:12.090> it's

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
order and that it's right and then it's

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.180 
order and that it's right and then it's
good<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.420> go<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:12.960> that<00:02:13.290> it's<00:02:13.500> zeroed<00:02:13.830> itself

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
good to go and that it's zeroed itself

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.840 
good to go and that it's zeroed itself
out<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.430> that

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
out so that

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.600 
out so that
it<00:02:15.120> now<00:02:15.660> has<00:02:16.320> an<00:02:16.530> own<00:02:16.710> set<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.010> variables<00:02:17.550> that

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
it now has an own set of variables that

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.890 
it now has an own set of variables that
are<00:02:17.760> programmed<00:02:17.910> into<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.630> it's<00:02:18.750> going<00:02:18.840> to

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
are programmed into it and it's going to

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.380 
are programmed into it and it's going to
match<00:02:19.110> those<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:20.280> once<00:02:20.460> that's<00:02:20.610> done<00:02:20.880> we're

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
match those and once that's done we're

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.910 
match those and once that's done we're
going<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.540> move<00:02:21.690> into<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.960> next<00:02:22.170> phase<00:02:22.320> which

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
going to move into the next phase which

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.280 
going to move into the next phase which
is<00:02:23.630> calibrating<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.720> monitor

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
is calibrating the monitor

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.350 
is calibrating the monitor
okay<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:26.790> as<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.090> can<00:02:27.180> see<00:02:27.240> right<00:02:27.900> here<00:02:29.360> we're

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
okay so as you can see right here we're

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.690 
okay so as you can see right here we're
going<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.540> move<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.770> into<00:02:32.580> the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
going to move this so that into the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.340 
going to move this so that into the
calibration<00:02:33.360> position<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:33.960> let's<00:02:34.140> back<00:02:34.320> that

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
calibration position so let's back that

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.670 
calibration position so let's back that
out<00:02:35.660> it's<00:02:36.660> fairly<00:02:36.870> straightforward<00:02:37.200> again

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
out it's fairly straightforward again

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.420 
out it's fairly straightforward again
click<00:02:38.370> right<00:02:38.580> there<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:39.860> once<00:02:40.860> that's<00:02:41.100> done

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
click right there and once that's done

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.260 
click right there and once that's done
we<00:02:42.420> click<00:02:42.890> Next<00:02:44.390> now<00:02:46.520> this<00:02:47.520> is<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.790> only<00:02:47.940> time

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
we click Next now this is the only time

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.140 
we click Next now this is the only time
you<00:02:48.480> use<00:02:48.660> this<00:02:48.840> gadget<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.970> that's<00:02:50.970> why<00:02:51.120> I

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
you use this gadget and that's why I

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.120 
you use this gadget and that's why I
generally<00:02:51.600> don't<00:02:51.690> put<00:02:51.960> it<00:02:52.050> in<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.260> bag<00:02:52.500> but

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
generally don't put it in the bag but

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.240 
generally don't put it in the bag but
what<00:02:53.280> we're<00:02:53.370> gonna<00:02:53.460> do<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.730> put<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.030> in<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.210> bag

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
what we're gonna do is put it in the bag

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.450 
what we're gonna do is put it in the bag
zip<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.370> up<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:57.350> then<00:02:58.350> place<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:59.010> color

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
zip it up and then place the color

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.650 
zip it up and then place the color
monkey<00:02:59.820> right<00:03:00.240> there<00:03:00.480> on<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.530> square<00:03:02.660> just

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
monkey right there on the square just

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.570 
monkey right there on the square just
like<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.290> click<00:03:05.510> Next<00:03:07.340> what's<00:03:08.340> going<00:03:08.520> to

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
like that and click Next what's going to

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.850 
like that and click Next what's going to
happen<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.960> software<00:03:10.350> is<00:03:10.470> gonna<00:03:10.680> run

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
happen is that the software is gonna run

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.830 
happen is that the software is gonna run
through<00:03:11.070> a<00:03:11.100> series<00:03:11.520> of<00:03:11.580> colors<00:03:12.060> at<00:03:12.360> different

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
through a series of colors at different

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.290 
through a series of colors at different
values<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.740> it's<00:03:14.130> going<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.340> measure<00:03:14.580> what

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
values and it's going to measure what

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.700 
values and it's going to measure what
are<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.540> known<00:03:15.780> quantities<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:16.530> what<00:03:16.620> are

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
are the known quantities and what are

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.960 
are the known quantities and what are
the<00:03:16.800> measured<00:03:17.130> quantities<00:03:17.580> it's<00:03:17.730> going<00:03:17.910> to

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
the measured quantities it's going to

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.580 
the measured quantities it's going to
build<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.240> profile<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.930> it's<00:03:19.080> going<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.260> zero

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
build a profile and it's going to zero

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.740 
build a profile and it's going to zero
out<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:20.010> monitor<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.880> that<00:03:20.910> what<00:03:21.270> I<00:03:21.300> see<00:03:21.630> on

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
out the monitor so that what I see on

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.660 
out the monitor so that what I see on
the<00:03:21.900> monitor<00:03:22.320> is<00:03:22.590> going<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:23.100> be<00:03:23.220> what<00:03:23.520> it<00:03:23.640> is

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
the monitor is going to be what it is

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.690 
the monitor is going to be what it is
that<00:03:23.910> I'm<00:03:24.000> going<00:03:24.210> to<00:03:24.330> get<00:03:24.630> in<00:03:25.020> a<00:03:25.440> print<00:03:25.770> so<00:03:26.490> that

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
that I'm going to get in a print so that

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.780 
that I'm going to get in a print so that
I'm<00:03:26.970> not<00:03:27.200> calibrating<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.290> monitor<00:03:28.790> an

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
I'm not calibrating the monitor an

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.760 
I'm not calibrating the monitor an
uncalibrated<00:03:30.150> monitor<00:03:30.870> for<00:03:31.140> as<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.290> correction

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
uncalibrated monitor for as a correction

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.800 
uncalibrated monitor for as a correction
curve<00:03:31.950> for<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.220> monitor<00:03:32.550> for<00:03:32.670> example<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.240> can

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
curve for the monitor for example I can

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.240 
curve for the monitor for example I can
make<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.020> look<00:03:34.200> beautiful<00:03:34.560> on<00:03:35.070> an

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
make it look beautiful on an

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.770 
make it look beautiful on an
uncalibrated<00:03:35.580> monitor<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.450> when<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:36.570> make<00:03:36.750> a

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
uncalibrated monitor and when I make a

uncalibrated monitor and when I make a
print<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.380> print<00:03:37.620> will<00:03:37.740> tend<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.100> be<00:03:38.220> magenta

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
print the print will tend to be magenta

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.400 
print the print will tend to be magenta
and<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.030> reason<00:03:39.270> why<00:03:39.360> that<00:03:39.570> is<00:03:39.750> is<00:03:39.960> monitors

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
and the reason why that is is monitors

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.980 
and the reason why that is is monitors
tend<00:03:40.740> to<00:03:40.860> be<00:03:40.980> blue<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:42.060> what<00:03:42.210> occurs<00:03:42.510> is<00:03:42.780> I'm

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
tend to be blue so what occurs is I'm

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.500 
tend to be blue so what occurs is I'm
adding<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.950> appropriate<00:03:44.100> amounts<00:03:44.850> of<00:03:45.000> color

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
adding the appropriate amounts of color

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.180 
adding the appropriate amounts of color
to<00:03:45.750> compensate<00:03:46.350> for<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.620> blueness<00:03:46.980> of<00:03:47.130> the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
to compensate for the blueness of the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.650 
to compensate for the blueness of the
monitor<00:03:47.670> but<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.030> printer<00:03:48.390> is<00:03:48.480> going<00:03:48.510> to

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
monitor but the printer is going to

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.960 
monitor but the printer is going to
print<00:03:48.990> what<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.350> is<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.680> send<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:50.940> I

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
print what it is that I send it so I

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.760 
print what it is that I send it so I
will<00:03:51.270> get<00:03:51.390> a<00:03:51.450> file<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:52.170> does<00:03:52.350> not<00:03:52.500> look<00:03:52.740> like

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
will get a file that does not look like

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.350 
will get a file that does not look like
the<00:03:53.040> monitor<00:03:53.460> here<00:03:53.820> what's<00:03:54.000> going<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.210> occur

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
the monitor here what's going to occur

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.710 
the monitor here what's going to occur
is<00:03:54.630> what<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:54.840> see<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.380> what<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.650> get<00:03:56.450> so<00:03:57.450> now<00:03:57.660> we

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
is what I see is what I get so now we

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.930 
is what I see is what I get so now we
have<00:03:58.140> created<00:03:58.770> a<00:03:59.100> profile<00:03:59.550> and<00:03:59.670> what's<00:03:59.820> going

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
have created a profile and what's going

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.760 
have created a profile and what's going
to<00:04:00.030> come<00:04:00.210> up<00:04:00.420> is<00:04:00.630> it's<00:04:00.870> going<00:04:00.960> to<00:04:01.020> I'm<00:04:01.440> going<00:04:01.680> to

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
to come up is it's going to I'm going to

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.230 
to come up is it's going to I'm going to
get<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.300> reminders<00:04:04.610> one<00:04:05.610> week<00:04:05.790> two<00:04:06.060> weeks

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
get the reminders one week two weeks

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.800 
get the reminders one week two weeks
four<00:04:06.540> weeks<00:04:06.570> I<00:04:06.960> usually<00:04:07.470> set<00:04:07.710> this<00:04:07.860> at<00:04:08.040> 1<00:04:08.220> week

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
four weeks I usually set this at 1 week

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.680 
four weeks I usually set this at 1 week
but<00:04:09.810> what<00:04:09.960> I<00:04:09.990> tend<00:04:10.320> to<00:04:10.440> do<00:04:11.150> any<00:04:12.150> time<00:04:12.390> I'm<00:04:12.540> going

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
but what I tend to do any time I'm going

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.960 
but what I tend to do any time I'm going
to<00:04:12.810> do<00:04:12.930> mission-critical<00:04:13.470> work<00:04:14.070> I<00:04:14.340> will

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
to do mission-critical work I will

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.030 
to do mission-critical work I will
calibrate<00:04:15.540> my<00:04:15.570> monitor<00:04:16.170> when<00:04:16.380> we<00:04:16.500> do<00:04:16.859> these

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
calibrate my monitor when we do these

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.810 
calibrate my monitor when we do these
videos<00:04:17.220> when<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.299> work<00:04:18.960> on<00:04:19.170> big<00:04:19.560> art<00:04:20.040> I<00:04:20.370> will

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
videos when I work on big art I will

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.310 
videos when I work on big art I will
always<00:04:21.090> make<00:04:21.239> sure<00:04:21.450> that<00:04:21.630> my<00:04:21.780> monitor<00:04:22.200> is

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
always make sure that my monitor is

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.909 
always make sure that my monitor is
calibrated<00:04:22.979> is<00:04:23.400> it<00:04:23.640> necessary<00:04:24.500> it<00:04:25.500> makes<00:04:25.740> me

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
calibrated is it necessary it makes me

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.010 
calibrated is it necessary it makes me
feel<00:04:26.070> good<00:04:26.310> but<00:04:27.150> at<00:04:27.270> least<00:04:27.450> once

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
feel good but at least once

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.689 
feel good but at least once
week<00:04:28.199> you<00:04:28.500> should<00:04:28.560> calibrate<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.340> monitor

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
week you should calibrate the monitor

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.400 
week you should calibrate the monitor
and<00:04:29.910> that's<00:04:30.569> a<00:04:30.690> very<00:04:30.810> important<00:04:31.259> thing<00:04:31.379> and

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
and that's a very important thing and

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.080 
and that's a very important thing and
you<00:04:31.530> can<00:04:31.650> set<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.919> software<00:04:32.310> up<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.460> do<00:04:32.580> it<00:04:32.699> so

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
you can set the software up to do it so

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.279 
you can set the software up to do it so
what<00:04:33.210> we're<00:04:33.300> gonna<00:04:33.360> do<00:04:33.569> now<00:04:33.780> is<00:04:34.080> we're<00:04:34.199> going

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
what we're gonna do now is we're going

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.570 
what we're gonna do now is we're going
to<00:04:34.410> hit<00:04:34.580> next<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:36.830> I<00:04:37.830> can<00:04:37.979> take<00:04:38.159> a<00:04:38.190> look<00:04:38.400> at

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
to hit next and I can take a look at

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.499 
to hit next and I can take a look at
before<00:04:39.560> after<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:42.120> reason<00:04:42.360> why<00:04:42.419> you're

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
before after and the reason why you're

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:43.760 
before after and the reason why you're
not<00:04:42.599> going<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.870> see<00:04:43.020> much<00:04:43.229> difference<00:04:43.650> is

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
not going to see much difference is

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.980 
not going to see much difference is
because<00:04:43.919> I<00:04:44.129> calibrate<00:04:45.060> my<00:04:45.419> monitor<00:04:45.780> quite

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
because I calibrate my monitor quite

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.580 
because I calibrate my monitor quite
frequently<00:04:46.440> we'll<00:04:47.190> hit<00:04:47.310> next<00:04:47.370> and<00:04:49.039> we're<00:04:50.039> done

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
frequently we'll hit next and we're done

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.680 
frequently we'll hit next and we're done
now<00:04:52.590> that<00:04:52.770> we've<00:04:52.889> done<00:04:53.099> that<00:04:53.400> let's<00:04:54.000> build<00:04:54.389> a

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
now that we've done that let's build a

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
now that we've done that let's build a
printer<00:04:55.409> profile

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
printer profile

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.140 
printer profile
now<00:04:58.710> that<00:04:58.919> we've<00:04:59.039> calibrated<00:04:59.340> our<00:04:59.759> monitor

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
now that we've calibrated our monitor

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.640 
now that we've calibrated our monitor
what<00:05:00.300> we're<00:05:00.419> going<00:05:00.569> to<00:05:00.630> do<00:05:00.840> is<00:05:01.050> build<00:05:01.319> a

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
what we're going to do is build a

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.920 
what we're going to do is build a
printer<00:05:02.220> profile<00:05:02.759> using<00:05:03.270> the<00:05:03.360> color<00:05:03.569> monkey

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
printer profile using the color monkey

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.570 
printer profile using the color monkey
now<00:05:04.169> what's<00:05:04.949> going<00:05:05.130> to<00:05:05.159> happen<00:05:05.400> is<00:05:05.490> we're

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
now what's going to happen is we're

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.520 
now what's going to happen is we're
gonna<00:05:05.669> print<00:05:05.849> out<00:05:05.970> two<00:05:06.240> test<00:05:06.990> charts<00:05:07.380> or

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
gonna print out two test charts or

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.830 
gonna print out two test charts or
targets<00:05:08.039> that<00:05:08.280> are<00:05:08.370> gonna<00:05:08.460> look<00:05:08.699> like<00:05:08.880> this<00:05:09.150> so

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
targets that are gonna look like this so

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.080 
targets that are gonna look like this so
I've<00:05:10.020> already<00:05:10.169> done<00:05:10.319> the<00:05:11.009> the<00:05:11.460> target<00:05:11.759> so

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
I've already done the the target so

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.089 
I've already done the the target so
let's<00:05:12.270> take<00:05:12.449> a<00:05:12.479> look<00:05:12.750> at<00:05:12.870> how<00:05:13.050> to<00:05:13.110> create<00:05:13.710> the

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
let's take a look at how to create the

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.279 
let's take a look at how to create the
target<00:05:14.659> so<00:05:15.659> we're<00:05:15.750> going<00:05:15.840> to<00:05:15.930> come<00:05:16.080> over<00:05:16.110> here

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
target so we're going to come over here

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.120 
target so we're going to come over here
to<00:05:16.680> our<00:05:16.970> interface<00:05:17.970> and<00:05:18.389> we're<00:05:18.479> gonna<00:05:18.569> click

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
to our interface and we're gonna click

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.920 
to our interface and we're gonna click
profile<00:05:20.130> my<00:05:20.400> printer<00:05:20.849> and<00:05:21.509> what<00:05:21.659> you're<00:05:21.780> going

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
profile my printer and what you're going

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.779 
profile my printer and what you're going
to<00:05:22.020> get<00:05:22.169> is<00:05:22.349> this<00:05:22.469> dialog<00:05:22.949> box<00:05:22.979> create<00:05:23.610> a<00:05:23.639> new

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:05.470 
is that we didn't measure the target

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.969 
is that we didn't measure the target
correctly<00:08:07.289> so<00:08:08.289> now<00:08:08.470> we're<00:08:08.650> going<00:08:08.740> to<00:08:08.800> measure

00:08:08.969 --> 00:08:08.979 
correctly so now we're going to measure

00:08:08.979 --> 00:08:11.669 
correctly so now we're going to measure
the<00:08:09.159> target
