shot showing pretty much the flight path
of<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.960> Batarang<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:59.210> realize<00:01:00.210> I'm<00:01:00.449> kind<00:01:00.719> of

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
of the Batarang I realize I'm kind of

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.630 
of the Batarang I realize I'm kind of
point<00:01:01.170> blanking<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.829> here<00:01:02.250> really

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
point blanking it here really

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.359 
point blanking it here really
short-range<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.989> wanted<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.040> be<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
short-range but I wanted to be in the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.920 
short-range but I wanted to be in the
shot<00:01:05.610> too<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:08.610> amount<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.000> spin<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.390> get<00:01:09.689> from

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
shot too the amount of spin I get from

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.359 
shot too the amount of spin I get from
each<00:01:10.080> throw<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.500> pretty<00:01:10.890> consistent<00:01:13.369> this

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
each throw is pretty consistent this

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.700 
each throw is pretty consistent this
next<00:01:14.790> shot<00:01:14.939> lands<00:01:15.420> almost<00:01:15.659> exactly<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.680> same

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
next shot lands almost exactly the same

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.550 
next shot lands almost exactly the same
as<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.220> first<00:01:17.460> one<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:21.420> batarangs<00:01:21.990> throw

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
as the first one the batarangs throw

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.120 
as the first one the batarangs throw
kind<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.340> knives<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.360> kind<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.780> like

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
kind of like knives and kind of like

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:33.480 
kind of like knives and kind of like
shuriken<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.400> not<00:01:26.670> exactly<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:27.810> either<00:01:28.020> one

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:43.560 

here's<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.420> shot<00:01:34.780> of<00:01:34.960> an<00:01:35.080> impact

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.069 

and<00:01:44.570> here's<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.229> shot<00:01:45.590> of<00:01:46.659> double<00:01:47.659> Batarang

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
and here's a shot of double Batarang

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.980 
and here's a shot of double Batarang
throws<00:01:50.109> using<00:01:51.109> two<00:01:51.319> at<00:01:51.469> once<00:01:51.710> I<00:01:52.689> can't<00:01:53.689> quite

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
throws using two at once I can't quite

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.260 
throws using two at once I can't quite
hit<00:01:54.229> multiple<00:01:54.770> targets<00:01:56.200> but<00:01:57.789> this<00:01:58.789> is<00:01:58.939> still

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
hit multiple targets but this is still

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.199 
hit multiple targets but this is still
fun<00:01:59.509> anyway<00:02:00.310> all<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.670> flaws<00:02:01.969> in<00:02:02.000> your

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.209 
fun anyway all the flaws in your

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.010 
fun anyway all the flaws in your
technique<00:02:02.780> come<00:02:03.049> out<00:02:03.229> in<00:02:03.380> slow<00:02:03.709> motion<00:02:05.020> that

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
technique come out in slow motion that

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.350 
technique come out in slow motion that
shot<00:02:06.380> was<00:02:06.590> kind<00:02:06.890> of<00:02:06.950> lopsided<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:07.969> there's<00:02:08.299> a

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
shot was kind of lopsided so there's a

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.460 
shot was kind of lopsided so there's a
bit<00:02:08.599> of<00:02:08.629> wobble<00:02:09.200> as<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.560> batarangs<00:02:10.069> fly<00:02:11.470> still

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
bit of wobble as the batarangs fly still

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.710 
bit of wobble as the batarangs fly still
they're<00:02:12.769> pretty<00:02:13.069> massive<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.450> has<00:02:14.690> a

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
they're pretty massive so it has a

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.300 
they're pretty massive so it has a
little<00:02:15.049> effect<00:02:15.500> on<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.829> point<00:02:16.069> of<00:02:16.130> impact<00:02:18.310> by

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
little effect on the point of impact by

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.460 
little effect on the point of impact by
the<00:02:19.370> way<00:02:19.610> these<00:02:19.870> over-the-shoulder<00:02:20.870> shots

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
the way these over-the-shoulder shots

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.130 
the way these over-the-shoulder shots
are<00:02:21.709> taken<00:02:21.739> at<00:02:22.160> about<00:02:22.870> 20<00:02:23.870> feet<00:02:24.079> away<00:02:25.959> which<00:02:26.959> is

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
are taken at about 20 feet away which is

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:39.730 
are taken at about 20 feet away which is
a<00:02:27.170> bit<00:02:27.920> further<00:02:28.220> than<00:02:28.459> these<00:02:29.230> side<00:02:30.230> shots

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.420 

from<00:02:40.280> here<00:02:40.550> you<00:02:40.700> can<00:02:40.820> see<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:42.430> double

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
from here you can see the double

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.610 
from here you can see the double
Batarang<00:02:43.970> seem<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.510> spin<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.900> little<00:02:45.080> bit<00:02:45.230> more

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
Batarang seem to spin a little bit more

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.400 
Batarang seem to spin a little bit more
as<00:02:45.740> they<00:02:45.950> fly<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.720> think<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:47.840> couldn't<00:02:48.170> throw

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
as they fly I think I couldn't throw

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.760 
as they fly I think I couldn't throw
them<00:02:48.790> quite<00:02:49.790> as<00:02:49.970> hard<00:02:50.270> so<00:02:50.720> they<00:02:51.290> had<00:02:51.410> more<00:02:51.710> time

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
them quite as hard so they had more time

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.620 
them quite as hard so they had more time
to<00:02:52.190> spin<00:02:52.520> as<00:02:52.670> they<00:02:52.880> were<00:02:52.940> going<00:02:53.300> through<00:02:53.330> the

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
to spin as they were going through the

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:04.900 
to spin as they were going through the
air<00:02:58.990> and<00:02:59.990> here's<00:03:00.320> another<00:03:00.470> impact<00:03:01.010> shot<00:03:03.910> by

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
air and here's another impact shot by

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.730 
air and here's another impact shot by
the<00:03:04.970> way<00:03:05.060> I<00:03:05.180> mentioned<00:03:05.570> knives<00:03:06.020> and<00:03:06.260> Sheratons

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
the way I mentioned knives and Sheratons

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.770 
the way I mentioned knives and Sheratons
I'm<00:03:06.920> not<00:03:07.100> an<00:03:07.280> expert<00:03:07.610> at<00:03:07.790> either<00:03:08.210> one<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.510> those

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
I'm not an expert at either one of those

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.580 
I'm not an expert at either one of those
so<00:03:09.460> tips<00:03:10.460> on<00:03:10.930> throwing<00:03:11.930> technique<00:03:12.350> would<00:03:12.530> be

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
so tips on throwing technique would be

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:21.550 
so tips on throwing technique would be
appreciated<00:03:16.540> here's<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.570> ceramic<00:03:18.200> tile<00:03:20.560> which

appreciated here's a ceramic tile which
I<00:03:21.740> almost<00:03:22.040> bull's-eyed<00:03:23.140> lucky<00:03:24.140> shot

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.309 

and<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.319> obvious<00:03:35.470> target<00:03:37.110> something<00:03:38.110> you

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
and the obvious target something you

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.710 
and the obvious target something you
don't<00:03:38.500> get<00:03:38.709> to<00:03:38.860> see<00:03:39.099> in<00:03:39.280> real<00:03:39.519> life<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:40.150> wobble

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
don't get to see in real life the wobble

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.559 
don't get to see in real life the wobble
is<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.140> battering<00:03:41.560> impacts<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.579> wood<00:03:45.569> and

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
is the battering impacts the wood and

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.199 
is the battering impacts the wood and
there's<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.079> golf<00:03:47.290> cart<00:03:47.590> rolling<00:03:47.860> and

there's the golf cart rolling and

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.720 
there's the golf cart rolling and
ruining<00:03:49.209> everything<00:03:50.310> well<00:03:51.310> that's<00:03:51.489> all<00:03:51.670> I

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
ruining everything well that's all I

have for this time I'll see you know
code<00:03:55.090> shots<00:03:55.569> of<00:03:56.069> misses<00:03:57.069> and<00:03:57.370> bounces<00:03:58.470> from

code shots of misses and bounces from
the<00:04:00.250> batarangs<00:04:00.819> and<00:04:01.090> you'll<00:04:01.390> get<00:04:01.510> an<00:04:01.659> idea<00:04:01.780> of

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
the batarangs and you'll get an idea of

the batarangs and you'll get an idea of
what<00:04:03.159> causes<00:04:03.700> some<00:04:04.540> throwing<00:04:05.019> weapons<00:04:05.379> to

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
what causes some throwing weapons to

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.710 
what causes some throwing weapons to
bounce<00:04:06.430> off<00:04:06.700> even<00:04:07.030> though<00:04:07.150> you<00:04:07.209> thought<00:04:07.450> you

bounce off even though you thought you

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.680 
bounce off even though you thought you
