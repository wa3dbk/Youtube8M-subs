00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.370 
my own path while they go trying to jump
around<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.570> we'll<00:01:45.750> see<00:01:45.869> what<00:01:46.110> ends<00:01:46.320> up

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
around and we'll see what ends up

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.770 
around and we'll see what ends up
happening<00:01:46.579> so<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.759> see<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.450> most

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
happening so you can see the most

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.740 
happening so you can see the most
difficult<00:01:49.290> part<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.799> my<00:01:50.100> method<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.750> simply

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
difficult part of my method is simply

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.840 
difficult part of my method is simply
knowing<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.290> route<00:01:52.439> because<00:01:53.130> after<00:01:53.670> that

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
knowing the route because after that

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.609 
knowing the route because after that
it's<00:01:54.119> easy<00:01:54.420> there's<00:01:54.659> no<00:01:54.810> jumping<00:01:55.259> they're<00:01:55.470> so

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
it's easy there's no jumping they're so

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.410 
it's easy there's no jumping they're so
worrying<00:01:55.860> about<00:01:56.009> gorgons<00:01:56.520> or<00:01:56.700> anything<00:01:57.270> and

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
worrying about gorgons or anything and

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.179 
worrying about gorgons or anything and
here<00:01:58.079> we<00:01:58.200> are<00:01:58.290> coming<00:01:58.649> around<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.979> last

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
here we are coming around the last

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.060 
here we are coming around the last
little<00:01:59.520> bend<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.229> one<00:02:01.229> more<00:02:01.409> left<00:02:01.649> turn<00:02:01.890> and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
little bend and one more left turn and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.450 
little bend and one more left turn and
boom<00:02:02.909> amen<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.430> a

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
boom amen this is it this is a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.219 
boom amen this is it this is a
completely<00:02:05.880> safe<00:02:06.149> area<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:07.020> right

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
completely safe area this is right

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.490 
completely safe area this is right
before<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:08.190> jump<00:02:08.610> puzzle<00:02:09.000> we<00:02:09.660> are<00:02:09.869> safe<00:02:10.259> in

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
before the jump puzzle we are safe in

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.470 
before the jump puzzle we are safe in
here<00:02:10.770> now<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.280> rest<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.610> my<00:02:11.700> group<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:12.030> out

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
here now the rest of my group is out

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.920 
here now the rest of my group is out
doing<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.959> jumping<00:02:13.349> on<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.620> bold

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
doing the jumping on the bold

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.880 
doing the jumping on the bold
and<00:02:14.530> they<00:02:14.859> got<00:02:15.069> cut<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:17.170> there<00:02:17.409> you<00:02:17.439> have<00:02:17.560> an

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
and they got cut so there you have an

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.979 
and they got cut so there you have an
actual<00:02:18.040> kind<00:02:18.459> of<00:02:18.579> side<00:02:18.879> by<00:02:19.090> side<00:02:19.359> comparison

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
actual kind of side by side comparison

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.080 
actual kind of side by side comparison
on<00:02:20.140> what<00:02:20.439> method<00:02:20.590> might<00:02:20.920> work<00:02:21.099> better<00:02:21.310> jumping

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
on what method might work better jumping

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.880 
on what method might work better jumping
around<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.480> boulders<00:02:22.870> or<00:02:23.079> doing<00:02:23.530> my<00:02:23.680> run

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
around the boulders or doing my run

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.099 
around the boulders or doing my run
method<00:02:24.099> and<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.819> can<00:02:24.939> kind<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.239> see<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.810> run

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
method and you can kind of see the run

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.709 
method and you can kind of see the run
method<00:02:26.379> that<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.709> did<00:02:27.040> really<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.150> little<00:02:28.569> bit

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:28.719 
method that I did really is a little bit

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.949 
method that I did really is a little bit
better<00:02:29.159> we<00:02:30.159> didn't<00:02:30.430> die<00:02:30.609> so<00:02:31.450> now<00:02:31.629> that<00:02:31.810> I've

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
better we didn't die so now that I've

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.140 
better we didn't die so now that I've
actually<00:02:32.260> had<00:02:32.650> my<00:02:32.859> first<00:02:33.219> chance<00:02:33.519> at<00:02:33.730> running

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
actually had my first chance at running

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.479 
actually had my first chance at running
through<00:02:34.480> this<00:02:34.629> and<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:35.139> do<00:02:35.200> indeed<00:02:35.739> feel<00:02:36.219> like<00:02:36.400> I

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
through this and I do indeed feel like I

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.949 
through this and I do indeed feel like I
know<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:36.909> pathway<00:02:37.329> on<00:02:37.540> my<00:02:37.689> own<00:02:37.840> without

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
know the pathway on my own without

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.050 
know the pathway on my own without
having<00:02:38.349> to<00:02:38.409> follow<00:02:38.560> anyone<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.159> said<00:02:39.280> hey<00:02:39.760> guys

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
know they're just in disbelief a little

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.520 
know they're just in disbelief a little
bit<00:02:51.340> they<00:02:51.639> don't<00:02:52.060> necessarily<00:02:52.419> know<00:02:53.169> what<00:02:53.409> to

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
bit they don't necessarily know what to

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.839 
bit they don't necessarily know what to
think<00:02:53.560> yet<00:02:53.919> because<00:02:54.250> they<00:02:54.340> haven't<00:02:54.489> done<00:02:54.639> it

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
think yet because they haven't done it

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.429 
think yet because they haven't done it
the<00:02:55.239> only<00:02:55.389> thing<00:02:55.540> they've<00:02:55.720> ever<00:02:55.870> seen<00:02:56.019> is
