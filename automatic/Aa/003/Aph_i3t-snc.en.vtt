00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.510
 hello friends we are young 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.360
 man looking for a united states job 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.400
 here's a work visa each one bit he 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.530
 is somewhere money let's say conditionally 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.080
 in Moscow looking for a job 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:24.460
 but Moscow, he works in the department 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.029
 famous big american companies 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.830
 and here he has an experience because 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.269
 every conversation that occurs to him 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:36.870
 force cool frame there still they ask 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:40.510
 about him there all sorts of things plus they 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.030
 Often he does not write this as I already have 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.639
 check local and that all on the edge 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.350
 carry it all they still say oh 

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:50.710
 References Vodka works in this 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.359
 companies yes give references 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.909
 in view of whom we can call 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:58.149
 who can describe you as 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:01:00.459
 the reference rule is wanted at your level 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.559
 management is not at your level 

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:07.660
 worker of you work together with someone and 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:10.420
 then there is well, as if anxiety 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.780
 the check will I work suddenly they now 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.870
 how to take yes will call there to the main 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.670
 office I'm not for it in minneapolis and will start 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.310
 applied and asked how it was in Moscow 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.090
 or who they will call you or start mine 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.270
 This reference call and I have not yet 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.130
 quit I still work they stone 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.920
 will become worse and so on in 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.320
 general 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.229
 a whole lot of trouble associated with it 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.380
 I want to say that these are problems 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:43.729
 such more speculative why because 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.369
 what is it procedures such enough 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.979
 they are there hundreds of thousands of times 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.690
 occur daily in the country and there 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:57.140
 there is a certain regulation 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:59.659
 mean you no how to say no one 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.600
 call the company where you work before 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.929
 you will be given a job offer and you 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.769
 subscribers understand that is to collect 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:13.100
 references and thereby damaging the person 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:15.230
 it is impossible it was simply forbidden 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.700
 in history when it was tried for that 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.730
 the man worked somewhere everything was fine 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.280
 and then how they start to call them 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.220
 he helps him get fired and so on 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.470
 this is responsibility 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.690
 so while it is speculative such 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.239
 Script is possible I will tell you more 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.830
 even not only in theory but also in practice 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.079
 such a scenario is possible 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.180
 it sometimes happens though quite often 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.040
 it happens then when you have 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.109
 dealing with nonprofessionals 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.060
 here's a man who just doesn't understand 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.280
 what is he doing here and we got a resume 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.460
 talk to you for five minutes and went by myself 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:54.630
 very smart turned out to be here 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.460
 that is, once again practice in 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.260
 exceptionally rare cases it may 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:03.930
 happen but in general then I would be on your 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.850
 the place is quietly neglected because 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.130
 it happens very rarely here for me 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.050
 year there are 500 600 students plus can still 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.210
 be the same from past issues 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.430
 who are turning there 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.500
 don't know help and winters help through 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.900
 a stencil to help all those that have a 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.610
 say there livers and fro over the year but 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.550
 Now this can be there at one time 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.730
 a thousand will happen to literally 1000 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.620
 man therefore it is very rare i 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.810
 I understand anxiety, I understand that what 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.300
 rough and suddenly it happens but should not 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.380
 that's how the united states so not 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.250
 should happen 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.720
 and if something happens you can 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.060
 theoretical again you can present 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.160
 claims 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.760
 there about this to someone who is in it 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.280
 guilty I'm not bringing you this 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.920
 it doesn't get any easier but it should 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.630
 become a texture because it is a thing because 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.890
 which people from are responsible and 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.960
 accordingly, the probability that it is 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.150
 less happen that's all 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.270
 means how are you going 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:08.110
 talking to a recruiter or there with 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.070
 man of and charms and he tells you 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.130
 give references 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.620
 and it happens at such an early stage 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.020
 there was an interview there was nothing and I will leave 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.590
 to articulate why he thinks references 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.440
 you imagine 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.660
 if there is nothing like this 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.880
 that there are people who don't have rap and 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.410
 so you can interview them 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.380
 anything and then say giving 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.230
 he has no france, therefore, especially 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.180
 recruiters who worry in advance 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.430
 they say come on rapper and not in that 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.050
 meaning they call now will 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.520
 but in the sense that when it will be necessary 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:45.610
 calling a lady there is usually two missing 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:49.440
 reference but just in case 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:53.740
 call someone asking to give 3 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.300
 if you give 3 earlier yes yes first two 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.520
 get through and the process will stop 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.480
 no one wants it again 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.160
 deal usually as a company 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.430
 more impressive they themselves do not collect 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.850
 references they take out there for 300 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.970
 dollars 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.340
 someone has a few companies 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.550
 very powerful who are doing this 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.080
 and there are small but they are means 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.350
 for a little money to do it why 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.600
 This is important because if I myself collected 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.000
 references further I hired someone and this 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.570
 to whom I poured it there on china spied or 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.600
 there will be no finger to show there were 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.400
 cases mean or is there something else 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.000
 technical espionage or are there any 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.310
 violations 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.620
 then they are responsible if they 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.320
 transferred this process to the side 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.720
 then they are not responsible but bear 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.610
 responsibility here so the company and her 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.860
 accordingly there is insurance and there on 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:53.960
 a large amount of apparently I do not know where and how 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:56.810
 Kim will prompt lawyers and then transfer 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.090
 of liability occurs and therefore little 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.520
 in the least, a solid company will not become 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.470
 do this knowing that in theory there is 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.570
 risk and lawyer of this company they 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.880
 they say themselves do not do better give 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.190
 better go there and so on 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.560
 so the process is often something mostly 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.260
 the specialists do it they collect rap 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.210
 princes experts know what to do 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.240
 as it brings much more order 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.370
 for example in california you can't 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.600
 according to local laws up to californian 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:29.960
 you can't ask 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:31.940
 more than he actually worked in 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.919
 what positions and what day is he 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.320
 day transitions go away that 's all you 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:38.510
 now if i as an employer i no longer 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.850
 I have the right to say if I only have 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.220
 no written permission from employee 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.530
 say more about it these are the ones 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.139
 legal framework which is clamped 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:51.830
 employer and people who collect 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:53.960
 refrain everyone knows about it so i 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.550
 quite often there I give ref times 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.330
 I can say that they ask they 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.440
 call and they say did this work 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.660
 then they do not even speak and when 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.789
 worked they say he is his mold 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.400
 remembered that it was from April 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:10.190
 there until January of this you confirm 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:13.880
 you don't even need to check yes or there 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.740
 something else and sometimes they ask 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.240
 may i ask how much money he has 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.789
 got it . 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.620
 we say this candy for our camp 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:24.830
 I understand very much thank you very much disappeared 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.569
 20 seconds for everything 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.630
 happens when professionals work 

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:31.099
 and they know what they are doing here 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:33.289
 actually such a story about and appreciate 

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:35.710
 minutes for any of their network people there know 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:37.610
 more subtle questions 

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:40.160
 specifically on duties performed 

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.680
 something else but it could be there one of 

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.810
 ten here today 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.460
 nobody 's torturing so much 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.349
 further if they torture and become 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.650
 listen to me according to the law i'm nothing 

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:53.440
 I can not say so do not be offended 

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:55.880
 like this , don't worry 

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.490
 the main thing is looking for a job find a job 

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:01.909
 come and let everything be fine with 

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:04.360
 this side of you will not beat anything 

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:04.360
 does not care
