00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.970 
getting in the way whilst you're firing
this<00:04:13.209> means<00:04:13.510> that<00:04:13.599> you<00:04:13.810> can<00:04:14.019> stay<00:04:14.349> on<00:04:14.380> targets

the kill now the silencer doesn't really

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.409 
the kill now the silencer doesn't really
improve<00:04:20.349> your<00:04:20.590> aim<00:04:20.829> but<00:04:21.400> instead<00:04:21.880> it<00:04:22.150> keeps
