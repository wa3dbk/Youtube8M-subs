hi<00:00:01.079> I'm<00:00:01.290> Robert<00:00:01.500> Martin<00:00:01.920> in<00:00:02.100> this<00:00:02.370> video<00:00:02.639> we're

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hi I'm Robert Martin in this video we're

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.329 
hi I'm Robert Martin in this video we're
going<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.389> talk<00:00:03.629> about<00:00:03.840> developing<00:00:04.830> lower

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
going to talk about developing lower

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.730 
going to talk about developing lower
body<00:00:05.700> strength<00:00:06.029> since<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:07.049> started<00:00:07.529> this

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
body strength since I started this

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.459 
body strength since I started this
series<00:00:08.189> of<00:00:08.429> 10<00:00:08.670> videos<00:00:09.120> I've<00:00:10.080> had<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.260> lot<00:00:10.410> of

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
series of 10 videos I've had a lot of

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.499 
series of 10 videos I've had a lot of
requests<00:00:10.980> for<00:00:11.010> information<00:00:11.509> specifically

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
requests for information specifically

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.509 
requests for information specifically
about<00:00:12.750> both<00:00:13.230> upper<00:00:13.620> body<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:13.950> lower<00:00:14.219> body

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
about both upper body and lower body

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.129 
about both upper body and lower body
strength<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.299> that's<00:00:15.690> what<00:00:15.839> I'm<00:00:15.929> going<00:00:16.049> to

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
strength so that's what I'm going to

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.710 
strength so that's what I'm going to
give<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.350> now<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.369> order<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.640> develop<00:00:18.330> lower

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
give you now in order to develop lower

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.510 
give you now in order to develop lower
body<00:00:18.990> strength<00:00:19.289> we<00:00:19.619> want<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.890> look<00:00:20.010> at<00:00:20.220> both

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
body strength we want to look at both

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.480 
body strength we want to look at both
pushing<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.420> pulling<00:00:21.900> strength<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.859> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
pushing and pulling strength so the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.160 
pushing and pulling strength so the
easiest<00:00:23.640> way<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.119> develop<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> pushing

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
easiest way to develop the pushing

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.259 
easiest way to develop the pushing
strength<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.740> with<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.220> squatting<00:00:26.730> motion<00:00:27.090> but

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
strength is with a squatting motion but

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.570 
strength is with a squatting motion but
if<00:00:27.840> all<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.199> have<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.470> your<00:00:28.680> own<00:00:28.949> body<00:00:29.279> weight

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
if all you have is your own body weight

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.130 
if all you have is your own body weight
that's<00:00:30.119> not<00:00:30.300> going<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.539> be<00:00:30.570> very<00:00:30.750> challenging

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
that's not going to be very challenging

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.459 
that's not going to be very challenging
I<00:00:31.560> mean<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.859> can<00:00:32.040> do<00:00:32.570> bodyweight<00:00:33.570> squats<00:00:34.050> but

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
I mean you can do bodyweight squats but

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.830 
I mean you can do bodyweight squats but
because<00:00:34.980> these<00:00:35.280> muscles<00:00:35.910> are<00:00:36.120> big<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.660> strong

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
because these muscles are big and strong

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.450 
because these muscles are big and strong
the<00:00:37.200> biggest<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.680> strongest<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:38.100> your<00:00:38.219> body

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
the biggest and strongest in your body

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.119 
the biggest and strongest in your body
that's<00:00:39.270> very<00:00:39.570> easy<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:40.200> do<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.680> need<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.980> make

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
that's very easy to do you need to make

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.100 
that's very easy to do you need to make
it<00:00:41.309> more<00:00:41.460> intense<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.090> some<00:00:42.329> kind<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.660> way<00:00:42.719> now

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
it more intense in some kind of way now

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.750 
it more intense in some kind of way now
if<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.739> want<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.950> build<00:00:44.070> endurance<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.610> can

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
if you want to build endurance you can

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.369 
if you want to build endurance you can
do<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> lot<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.149> those<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.719> do<00:00:45.809> high<00:00:46.050> reps

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
do a lot of those you can do high reps

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.340 
do a lot of those you can do high reps
I've<00:00:46.980> done<00:00:47.309> actually<00:00:47.820> over<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> thousand

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
I've done actually over a thousand

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.860 
I've done actually over a thousand
consecutive<00:00:50.219> bodyweight<00:00:50.700> squats<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.690> that's

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
consecutive bodyweight squats but that's

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.540 
consecutive bodyweight squats but that's
about<00:00:52.260> building<00:00:52.680> endurance<00:00:52.949> not<00:00:53.340> about

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
about building endurance not about

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.459 
about building endurance not about
building<00:00:54.000> maximal<00:00:54.510> strength<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.140> let's<00:00:55.350> look

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
building maximal strength so let's look

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.049 
building maximal strength so let's look
at<00:00:55.620> ways<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.800> make<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.219> exercise<00:00:56.610> more

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
at ways to make the exercise more

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.240 
at ways to make the exercise more
intense<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:58.079> do<00:00:58.230> fewer<00:00:58.559> reps<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.100> not

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
intense so you can do fewer reps and not

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.479 
intense so you can do fewer reps and not
take<00:00:59.489> all<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.820> time<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:01.590> easiest<00:01:02.039> way<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.219> do

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
take all that time the easiest way to do

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.090 
take all that time the easiest way to do
that<00:01:02.520> with<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> squat<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:04.920> do

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that with a with a squat is to just do

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.550 
that with a with a squat is to just do
it<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.339> one<00:01:05.519> leg<00:01:05.790> now<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.330> understand<00:01:07.080> that's<00:01:07.320> a

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
it on one leg now I understand that's a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.410 
it on one leg now I understand that's a
easier<00:01:08.250> said<00:01:08.280> than<00:01:08.610> done<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.090> i'm<00:01:09.270> going<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
easier said than done but i'm going to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.530 
easier said than done but i'm going to
show<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.600> ways<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.110> get<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:12.150> easiest

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
show you ways to get there the easiest

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.899 
show you ways to get there the easiest
way<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.810> do<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.380> begin<00:01:13.799> with<00:01:14.010> if<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.580> can't

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
way to do it to begin with if you can't

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.789 
way to do it to begin with if you can't
go<00:01:15.210> all<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.689> way<00:01:15.720> down<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.350> come<00:01:16.770> back

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
go all the way down and then come back

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.219 
go all the way down and then come back
up<00:01:17.009> with<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.450> strength<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.810> one<00:01:18.990> leg

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
up with just the the strength of one leg

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.219 
up with just the the strength of one leg
is<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:20.280> sit<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> chair<00:01:21.240> behind<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.659> hold<00:01:22.049> one

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
is to sit a chair behind you hold one

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.679 
is to sit a chair behind you hold one
leg<00:01:22.439> out<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.650> front<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.159> sit<00:01:24.119> down<00:01:24.150> onto<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
leg out in front and sit down onto the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.539 
leg out in front and sit down onto the
chair<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:25.229> stand<00:01:25.530> back<00:01:25.650> up<00:01:25.799> you'll

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
chair and then stand back up you'll

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.539 
chair and then stand back up you'll
develop<00:01:26.820> some<00:01:27.150> strength<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.659> way<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.549> when

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
develop some strength that way and when

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.730 
develop some strength that way and when
you<00:01:29.670> feel<00:01:30.420> comfortable<00:01:30.960> going<00:01:31.110> past<00:01:31.500> that

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
you feel comfortable going past that

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.649 
you feel comfortable going past that
point<00:01:31.979> especially<00:01:32.939> if<00:01:33.030> you're<00:01:33.150> traveling

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
point especially if you're traveling

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.569 
point especially if you're traveling
like<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.990> was<00:01:34.229> when<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.500> created<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.189> entire

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
like I was when I created this entire

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.280 
like I was when I created this entire
system<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.180> you've<00:01:36.299> got<00:01:36.390> your<00:01:36.570> suitcase<00:01:36.840> with

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
system and you've got your suitcase with

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.499 
system and you've got your suitcase with
you<00:01:37.520> push<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> chair<00:01:38.670> out<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.119> way<00:01:39.240> put

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
you push the chair out of the way put

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.149 
you push the chair out of the way put
your<00:01:39.540> suitcase<00:01:40.020> down<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.470> floor<00:01:40.650> sit<00:01:40.950> down

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
your suitcase down on the floor sit down

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.740 
your suitcase down on the floor sit down
onto<00:01:41.430> your<00:01:41.579> suitcase<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.210> then<00:01:42.329> stand<00:01:42.659> back

onto your suitcase and then stand back

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.780 
onto your suitcase and then stand back
up<00:01:42.930> eventually<00:01:43.829> you'll<00:01:44.040> develop<00:01:44.430> enough

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
up eventually you'll develop enough

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.219 
up eventually you'll develop enough
strength<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.149> where<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.570> go<00:01:45.689> down<00:01:45.899> all

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
strength to where you can go down all

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.469 
strength to where you can go down all
the<00:01:46.259> way<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:46.890> come<00:01:47.130> back<00:01:47.159> up<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:48.180> it's

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
the way and then come back up but it's

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.410 
the way and then come back up but it's
also<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.780> good<00:01:49.020> idea<00:01:50.030> until<00:01:51.030> you're<00:01:51.180> really

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
also a good idea until you're really

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.569 
also a good idea until you're really

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.330 
very effectively both at the same time
now<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.959> develop<00:02:40.380> lower<00:02:40.560> body<00:02:40.890> pulling

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
from from a from an extended position

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.880 
from from a from an extended position
like<00:04:01.500> this<00:04:01.730> on<00:04:02.730> your<00:04:02.910> back<00:04:03.470> you're<00:04:04.470> just<00:04:04.680> going

your legs in all the way up your butt
and<00:04:12.650> back<00:04:13.650> out<00:04:13.890> again<00:04:13.950> I<00:04:14.760> like<00:04:15.390> to<00:04:15.510> make<00:04:15.660> this<00:04:15.870> a

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
and back out again I like to make this a

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.830 
and back out again I like to make this a
little<00:04:16.169> bit<00:04:16.380> more<00:04:16.620> intense<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.120> little<00:04:18.479> bit

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
little bit more intense and a little bit

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.800 
little bit more intense and a little bit
more<00:04:18.989> difficult<00:04:19.200> by<00:04:19.739> by<00:04:20.729> sometimes<00:04:21.390> doing<00:04:21.599> it

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
more difficult by by sometimes doing it

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.670 
more difficult by by sometimes doing it
like<00:04:21.959> this<00:04:22.200> up<00:04:22.820> in

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
like this up in

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.180 
like this up in
out<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:26.120> down<00:04:26.509> kind<00:04:26.900> of<00:04:26.930> make<00:04:27.080> it<00:04:27.199> a<00:04:27.320> four-part

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
out and down kind of make it a four-part

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.730 
out and down kind of make it a four-part
motion<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:29.180> with<00:04:29.449> that<00:04:29.479> I<00:04:29.630> do<00:04:29.780> breathing<00:04:30.380> I

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
motion and with that I do breathing I

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.900 
motion and with that I do breathing I
inhale<00:04:31.490> on<00:04:31.699> the<00:04:31.820> up<00:04:32.530> exhale<00:04:33.530> on<00:04:33.740> this<00:04:34.340> part

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.340 

inhale<00:04:37.910> again<00:04:38.060> on<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.449> out<00:04:38.600> and<00:04:38.630> then<00:04:39.020> exhale

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
inhale again on the out and then exhale

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.800 
inhale again on the out and then exhale
on<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.650> down<00:04:39.889> so<00:04:40.190> you've<00:04:40.910> made<00:04:41.120> that<00:04:41.180> a<00:04:41.360> little

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
on the down so you've made that a little

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.350 
on the down so you've made that a little
bit<00:04:41.900> more<00:04:42.050> difficult<00:04:42.229> motion<00:04:42.889> and<00:04:43.250> that<00:04:44.120> will

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
bit more difficult motion and that will

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.189 
bit more difficult motion and that will
hit<00:04:44.690> these<00:04:45.500> hamstring<00:04:46.130> muscles<00:04:46.520> very

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
hit these hamstring muscles very

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.040 
hit these hamstring muscles very
effectively<00:04:48.430> so<00:04:49.430> again<00:04:50.300> this<00:04:50.630> is<00:04:50.810> a<00:04:50.840> great

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
effectively so again this is a great

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.260 
effectively so again this is a great
piece<00:04:51.259> of<00:04:51.470> piece<00:04:51.979> of<00:04:52.100> equipment<00:04:52.490> to<00:04:52.550> have<00:04:52.729> it

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
piece of piece of equipment to have it

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.939 
piece of piece of equipment to have it
disassembles<00:04:54.080> it's<00:04:54.259> easier<00:04:54.530> to<00:04:54.620> throw<00:04:54.800> it

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
disassembles it's easier to throw it

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.100 
disassembles it's easier to throw it
easy<00:04:55.220> to<00:04:55.400> throw<00:04:55.520> in<00:04:55.729> your<00:04:55.850> suitcase<00:04:56.060> now<00:04:56.840> if

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
easy to throw in your suitcase now if

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.589 
easy to throw in your suitcase now if
you<00:04:57.199> don't<00:04:57.320> have<00:04:57.560> one<00:04:57.770> yet<00:04:57.949> get<00:04:58.699> it<00:04:58.849> and<00:04:59.180> while

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599 
you don't have one yet get it and while

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.050 
you don't have one yet get it and while
you're<00:04:59.630> waiting<00:04:59.990> for<00:05:00.139> it<00:05:00.229> to<00:05:00.320> arrive<00:05:01.060> again

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
you're waiting for it to arrive again

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.370 
you're waiting for it to arrive again
let's<00:05:02.360> say<00:05:02.449> you're<00:05:02.599> traveling<00:05:03.050> you're<00:05:03.199> in<00:05:03.320> a

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
let's say you're traveling you're in a

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.400 
let's say you're traveling you're in a
hotel<00:05:03.560> room<00:05:03.889> most<00:05:04.669> hotel<00:05:05.060> rooms<00:05:05.300> have<00:05:05.990> chairs

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
hotel room most hotel rooms have chairs

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.050 
hotel room most hotel rooms have chairs
so<00:05:06.919> just<00:05:07.880> grab<00:05:08.090> a<00:05:08.240> chair<00:05:08.570> and<00:05:08.840> you<00:05:09.410> can

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
so just grab a chair and you can

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.420 
so just grab a chair and you can
approximate<00:05:11.060> that<00:05:11.090> same<00:05:11.889> motion<00:05:12.889> and<00:05:13.160> hit

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
approximate that same motion and hit

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.770 
approximate that same motion and hit
these<00:05:13.610> muscles<00:05:14.000> back<00:05:14.180> here<00:05:14.360> it's<00:05:14.479> not<00:05:14.630> as

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
these muscles back here it's not as

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.330 
these muscles back here it's not as
effective<00:05:15.199> as<00:05:15.320> it<00:05:15.470> is<00:05:15.590> with<00:05:15.770> the<00:05:15.860> power<00:05:16.099> wheel

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
effective as it is with the power wheel

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.830 
effective as it is with the power wheel
because<00:05:17.090> you<00:05:17.180> don't<00:05:17.330> get<00:05:17.449> the<00:05:17.539> range<00:05:17.720> of

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
because you don't get the range of

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.499 
because you don't get the range of
motion<00:05:17.990> but<00:05:18.320> you<00:05:18.979> can<00:05:19.250> do<00:05:19.520> it<00:05:19.639> all<00:05:20.090> you<00:05:20.270> do<00:05:20.389> is

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509 
motion but you can do it all you do is

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.900 
motion but you can do it all you do is
is<00:05:20.750> set<00:05:21.050> the<00:05:21.169> chair<00:05:21.380> there<00:05:21.940> put<00:05:22.940> your<00:05:23.320> heels<00:05:24.320> on

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
is set the chair there put your heels on

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.320 
is set the chair there put your heels on
the<00:05:25.910> chair<00:05:26.210> and<00:05:26.740> lift<00:05:28.060> now<00:05:29.060> you<00:05:29.120> can

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
the chair and lift now you can

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.409 
the chair and lift now you can
definitely<00:05:29.570> feel<00:05:29.960> that<00:05:30.550> in<00:05:31.550> your<00:05:31.610> hamstrings

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
definitely feel that in your hamstrings

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.469 
definitely feel that in your hamstrings
but<00:05:33.289> again<00:05:33.680> it's<00:05:34.220> not<00:05:34.490> as<00:05:34.789> effective<00:05:35.330> as<00:05:35.449> the

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
but again it's not as effective as the

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.540 
but again it's not as effective as the
power<00:05:35.810> wheel<00:05:36.050> because<00:05:37.039> you<00:05:37.190> don't<00:05:37.340> get<00:05:37.460> the

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
power wheel because you don't get the

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.580 
power wheel because you don't get the
same<00:05:37.699> range<00:05:37.970> of<00:05:38.090> motion<00:05:38.389> so<00:05:39.260> there<00:05:39.440> you<00:05:39.560> go

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
same range of motion so there you go

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.010 
same range of motion so there you go
there's<00:05:40.010> lower<00:05:40.849> body<00:05:41.180> pushing<00:05:41.599> strength

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
there's lower body pushing strength

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.260 
there's lower body pushing strength
lower-body<00:05:42.289> pulling<00:05:42.949> strength<00:05:43.280> hope<00:05:44.120> you

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
lower-body pulling strength hope you

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.080 
lower-body pulling strength hope you
