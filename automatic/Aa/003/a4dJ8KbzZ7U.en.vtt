well<00:00:00.599> fatty<00:00:00.870> liver<00:00:01.260> is<00:00:01.439> exactly<00:00:02.250> what<00:00:02.460> it

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
well fatty liver is exactly what it

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.160 
well fatty liver is exactly what it
sounds<00:00:02.939> it's<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.240> fat<00:00:03.419> in<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:03.689> liver

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
sounds it's a fat in the liver

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.380 
sounds it's a fat in the liver
now<00:00:04.740> it's<00:00:04.950> caused<00:00:05.220> by<00:00:05.250> many<00:00:05.850> different<00:00:06.000> things

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
now it's caused by many different things

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.680 
now it's caused by many different things
then<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.080> issue<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.649> overweight<00:00:08.330> you<00:00:09.330> can<00:00:09.540> get

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
then the issue is overweight you can get

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.089 
then the issue is overweight you can get
fatty<00:00:10.019> liver<00:00:10.320> from<00:00:10.559> having<00:00:10.889> high<00:00:11.040> cholesterol

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
fatty liver from having high cholesterol

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.660 
fatty liver from having high cholesterol
diabetes<00:00:12.650> pre-diabetes<00:00:13.650> or<00:00:14.160> insulin

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
diabetes pre-diabetes or insulin

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.430 
diabetes pre-diabetes or insulin
resistance<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.450> can<00:00:15.480> get<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.839> from<00:00:15.960> alcohol

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
resistance you can get it from alcohol

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.109 
resistance you can get it from alcohol
and<00:00:16.470> also<00:00:17.010> there's<00:00:17.220> some<00:00:17.279> drugs<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.850> cause

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
and also there's some drugs that cause

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.960 
and also there's some drugs that cause
fatty<00:00:18.449> liver<00:00:18.800> fat<00:00:19.800> gets<00:00:20.189> into<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> liver<00:00:20.789> and

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
fatty liver fat gets into the liver and

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.720 
fatty liver fat gets into the liver and
clogs<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.689> liver<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.289> simple<00:00:22.769> term<00:00:23.010> that

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
clogs the liver in a simple term that

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.550 
clogs the liver in a simple term that
prevents<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.600> from<00:00:24.720> doing<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.109> functions

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
prevents it from doing the functions

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.250 
prevents it from doing the functions
that<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.830> needs<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.220> do<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.660> lead<00:00:27.960> to

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
that it needs to do and it can lead to

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.439 
that it needs to do and it can lead to
inflammation<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.250> liver<00:00:29.400> not<00:00:29.730> everybody

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
inflammation in the liver not everybody

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.749 
inflammation in the liver not everybody
with<00:00:30.779> fatty<00:00:31.050> liver<00:00:31.410> has<00:00:31.710> inflammation<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.669> the

will show up to 30% can have an
inflammatory<00:00:38.579> response<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> liver<00:00:40.140> that

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
inflammatory response in the liver that

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.770 
inflammatory response in the liver that
then<00:00:40.590> causes<00:00:41.160> scarring<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.879> liver<00:00:42.090> they

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
then causes scarring of the liver they

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.930 
then causes scarring of the liver they
can<00:00:42.930> cause<00:00:43.140> cirrhosis<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:44.160> sometimes<00:00:44.640> liver

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
can cause cirrhosis and sometimes liver

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.680 
can cause cirrhosis and sometimes liver
cancer

fatty liver is the marker for coronary
vascular<00:00:49.110> disease<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.739> fact<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.309> worry<00:00:51.059> about

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
vascular disease in fact I worry about

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.869 
vascular disease in fact I worry about
cirrhosis<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.949> thing<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.219> kills<00:00:53.640> most

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
cirrhosis but the thing that kills most

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.549 
cirrhosis but the thing that kills most
people<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.449> fatty<00:00:54.690> liver<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.170> coronary

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
people with fatty liver is coronary

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.250 
people with fatty liver is coronary
vascular<00:00:56.129> disease<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:57.480> look<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:57.870> underlying

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
vascular disease we look for underlying

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.319 
vascular disease we look for underlying
causes<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.010> fatty<00:00:59.219> liver<00:00:59.489> such<00:00:59.730> as<00:00:59.879> diabetes

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
causes of fatty liver such as diabetes

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.630 
causes of fatty liver such as diabetes
someone<00:01:01.260> may<00:01:01.440> know<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:02.039> diabetes<00:01:02.579> or

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
someone may know they have diabetes or

someone may know they have diabetes or
they<00:01:02.910> don't<00:01:03.059> know<00:01:03.180> they<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.570> diabetes<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
they don't know they have diabetes and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.179 
they don't know they have diabetes and
we<00:01:04.409> find<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.860> macaulay<00:01:05.339> as<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.360> look<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.869> it

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
we find that macaulay as we look for it

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.859 
we find that macaulay as we look for it
other<00:01:08.189> things<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:08.790> be<00:01:08.909> insulin<00:01:09.360> resistance

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
other things can be insulin resistance
