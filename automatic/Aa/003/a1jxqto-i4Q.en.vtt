all<00:00:01.020> right<00:00:01.260> I<00:00:01.290> guess<00:00:01.469> this<00:00:01.680> would<00:00:01.770> be<00:00:01.860> a<00:00:01.949> good

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
all right I guess this would be a good

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.420 
all right I guess this would be a good
time<00:00:02.340> for<00:00:02.370> another<00:00:02.790> update<00:00:04.400> unfortunately<00:00:05.400> I

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
time for another update unfortunately I

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.700 
time for another update unfortunately I
really<00:00:05.640> haven't<00:00:05.910> done<00:00:06.029> much<00:00:06.470> and<00:00:09.530> only<00:00:10.530> thing

I've done is just sort of working on the
flash<00:00:13.049> suppressor<00:00:14.719> and<00:00:15.719> just<00:00:16.320> made<00:00:17.130> a

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
flash suppressor and just made a

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.580 
flash suppressor and just made a
recuperator<00:00:17.850> assembly<00:00:18.510> today<00:00:18.779> or<00:00:19.170> finished

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
recuperator assembly today or finished

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.800 
recuperator assembly today or finished
making<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:21.380> and<00:00:22.400> as<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.519> can<00:00:23.640> see<00:00:23.699> just<00:00:23.939> test

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
making it and as you can see just test

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:37.280 
making it and as you can see just test
fitting<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.920> ago<00:00:26.220> make<00:00:26.910> sure<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:36.290> like

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
fitting it and ago make sure it's like

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.959 
fitting it and ago make sure it's like
how<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:37.620> supposed<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:39.950> so<00:00:40.950> we'll<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:41.879> it

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
how it's supposed to so we'll see if it

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:56.330 
how it's supposed to so we'll see if it
works<00:00:42.270> if<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.140> doesn't<00:00:43.500> I'll<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.489> keep<00:00:55.340> it's

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
works if it doesn't I'll just keep it's

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.029 
works if it doesn't I'll just keep it's
not<00:00:56.489> bad<00:00:56.670> at<00:00:56.789> all<00:00:57.469> spring<00:00:58.469> tension<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.859> pretty

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
not bad at all spring tension is pretty

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.569 
not bad at all spring tension is pretty
good<00:01:00.440> everything<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.590> nice<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.800> crisp<00:01:02.250> and

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
good everything is nice and crisp and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.570 
good everything is nice and crisp and
it's<00:01:03.570> not<00:01:03.719> much<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.110> lagging<00:01:04.379> issue<00:01:04.979> as<00:01:05.400> far

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
it's not much of a lagging issue as far

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.190 
it's not much of a lagging issue as far
as<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:06.060> know<00:01:06.210> friction<00:01:06.750> goes<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:09.080> it's<00:01:10.080> gonna

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
as you know friction goes and it's gonna

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.770 
as you know friction goes and it's gonna
be<00:01:10.350> held<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.650> place<00:01:10.770> with<00:01:10.890> by<00:01:11.670> little<00:01:12.180> nuts<00:01:12.420> and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
be held in place with by little nuts and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.910 
be held in place with by little nuts and
bolt<00:01:13.909> on<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.030> front<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> back<00:01:15.860> let<00:01:16.860> me

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
bolt on the front on the back let me

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.109 
bolt on the front on the back let me
just<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.430> out

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.260 

very<00:01:24.119> simple<00:01:24.420> assembly<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.970> little

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
very simple assembly and this little

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.359 
very simple assembly and this little
this<00:01:27.750> little<00:01:27.869> bracket<00:01:28.320> portion<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.250> then

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
this little bracket portion and then

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.609 
this little bracket portion and then
that<00:01:30.000> hole<00:01:30.270> right<00:01:30.299> there<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.810> for<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> full

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
that hole right there is for the full

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.270 
that hole right there is for the full
auto<00:01:31.740> bolt<00:01:32.189> lock<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:34.979> gonna<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
auto bolt lock and it's just gonna be a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.660 
auto bolt lock and it's just gonna be a
solid<00:01:35.610> block<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.939> paper<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.360> goes<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.780> there

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
solid block of paper that goes in there

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.410 
solid block of paper that goes in there
and<00:01:39.829> it's<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.100> gonna<00:01:41.220> prevent<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:42.210> gum<00:01:42.390> from

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and it's just gonna prevent the gum from

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.319 
and it's just gonna prevent the gum from
taking<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.079> full<00:01:43.259> Waddell<00:01:43.560> bolt<00:01:44.210> and<00:01:45.210> I'll

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
taking in the full Waddell bolt and I'll

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.030 
taking in the full Waddell bolt and I'll
go<00:01:45.450> into<00:01:45.630> more<00:01:45.840> detail<00:01:46.200> when<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.409> actually<00:01:46.649> make

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
go into more detail when I actually make

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.440 
go into more detail when I actually make
it<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.399> that's<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.600> enough<00:01:49.970> this<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.149> just<00:01:51.360> a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
it so that's that enough this is just a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.710 
it so that's that enough this is just a
spring-loaded<00:01:51.960> plunger<00:01:53.270> little<00:01:54.270> block<00:01:54.540> right

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
spring-loaded plunger little block right

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.740 
spring-loaded plunger little block right
here<00:01:55.610> so

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.060 

just<00:01:59.750> press<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.560> plunger<00:02:02.050> and<00:02:03.050> bring<00:02:03.920> this

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
just press the plunger and bring this

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:16.740 
just press the plunger and bring this
down<00:02:04.420> down<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:05.450> little<00:02:05.780> bit<00:02:06.050> lift<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.710> up

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.000 

spring<00:02:18.250> spring<00:02:19.250> down<00:02:19.640> that<00:02:20.300> stuff<00:02:21.010> little

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
spring spring down that stuff little

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.420 
spring spring down that stuff little
copper<00:02:22.340> tube<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:25.520> so<00:02:26.420> you<00:02:26.690> know<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.860> can<00:02:28.100> see

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
copper tube and so you know you can see

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.240 
copper tube and so you know you can see
how<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:30.530> locks<00:02:30.950> in<00:02:31.250> place

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
how it locks in place

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.860 
how it locks in place
yeah<00:02:34.330> it's<00:02:35.330> actually<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:35.660> little<00:02:35.780> bit

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
yeah it's actually a little bit

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.199 
yeah it's actually a little bit
different<00:02:36.110> from<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.470> original<00:02:37.100> design<00:02:37.900> but

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
different from the original design but

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:47.160 
different from the original design but
yeah<00:02:41.209> I<00:02:41.239> just<00:02:41.540> pretty<00:02:42.380> much<00:02:42.440> simplified<00:02:42.830> it

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.150 

that's<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:48.470> mean<00:02:49.270> should<00:02:50.270> work<00:02:50.480> fine<00:02:51.160> either

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
that's I mean should work fine either

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.310 
that's I mean should work fine either
way<00:02:52.340> so<00:02:52.550> we'll<00:02:53.150> see<00:02:53.330> what<00:02:53.450> happens<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.110> so

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
way so we'll see what happens and so

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.920 
way so we'll see what happens and so
that's<00:02:54.590> pretty<00:02:54.860> much<00:02:54.980> it

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
that's pretty much it

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.650 
that's pretty much it
I've<00:02:56.930> also<00:02:57.140> been<00:02:58.239> started<00:02:59.239> working<00:02:59.510> on<00:02:59.540> this

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
I've also been started working on this

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.229 
I've also been started working on this
little<00:02:59.840> side<00:03:00.110> project<00:03:00.850> British<00:03:01.850> uh<00:03:01.940> some<00:03:02.120> of

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
little side project British uh some of

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.300 
little side project British uh some of
you<00:03:02.390> will<00:03:02.930> be<00:03:02.959> able<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.290> tell<00:03:03.620> what<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.280> is

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
you will be able to tell what it is

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.870 
you will be able to tell what it is
already<00:03:05.830> but<00:03:06.830> yeah<00:03:07.010> just<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.400> frame<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
already but yeah just the frame the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:16.750 
already but yeah just the frame the
receiver<00:03:08.239> I<00:03:08.920> am<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:11.440> barrel<00:03:12.820> so<00:03:15.370> not<00:03:16.370> sure<00:03:16.640> if

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
receiver I am a barrel so not sure if

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.449 
receiver I am a barrel so not sure if
you<00:03:16.910> guys<00:03:17.090> can<00:03:17.330> see<00:03:17.630> it<00:03:17.810> or<00:03:18.019> not<00:03:18.230> but<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:22.340> is

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
you guys can see it or not but it is

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.170
