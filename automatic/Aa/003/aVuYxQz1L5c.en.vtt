invasion there do you I do approve of
the<00:04:15.260> invasion<00:04:15.530> because<00:04:16.039> I<00:04:16.220> think<00:04:16.280> it<00:04:16.489> was<00:04:16.549> all

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
the invasion because I think it was all

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.539 
the invasion because I think it was all
about<00:04:16.910> regime<00:04:17.209> change<00:04:17.479> and<00:04:18.019> I<00:04:18.440> think<00:04:18.709> Bush<00:04:19.310> was

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
about regime change and I think Bush was

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.339 
about regime change and I think Bush was
basically<00:04:19.970> quite<00:04:20.539> gung-ho<00:04:20.840> about<00:04:21.019> the

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
basically quite gung-ho about the

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.710 
basically quite gung-ho about the
factory's<00:04:21.680> been<00:04:21.709> about<00:04:22.460> regime<00:04:23.060> change<00:04:23.270> there

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
factory's been about regime change there

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.460 
factory's been about regime change there

was no way

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.320 
was no way
a that<00:04:25.070> Tony<00:04:25.310> Blair<00:04:25.640> would<00:04:25.880> have<00:04:25.970> ever<00:04:26.120> got

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
a that Tony Blair would have ever got

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.880 
a that Tony Blair would have ever got
that<00:04:26.360> through<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.840> houses<00:04:27.200> of<00:04:27.260> parliament<00:04:27.320> if

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
that through the houses of parliament if

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.950 
that through the houses of parliament if
it<00:04:28.220> said<00:04:28.430> it<00:04:28.520> was<00:04:28.610> purely<00:04:28.940> about<00:04:29.660> regime

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
it said it was purely about regime

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.870 
it said it was purely about regime
change<00:04:30.200> he<00:04:30.980> said<00:04:31.250> it<00:04:31.340> was<00:04:31.430> about<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.730> weapons

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
change he said it was about the weapons

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.790 
change he said it was about the weapons
of<00:04:32.180> mass<00:04:32.330> destruction<00:04:32.720> that<00:04:33.290> was<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.650> final

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
of mass destruction that was the final

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.950 
of mass destruction that was the final
thing<00:04:34.130> that<00:04:34.160> I<00:04:34.580> felt<00:04:35.150> was<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.750> full

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
thing that I felt was the full

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.230 
thing that I felt was the full
justification<00:04:36.800> for<00:04:37.220> going<00:04:37.250> as<00:04:37.700> we<00:04:38.060> now<00:04:38.210> know

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
justification for going as we now know

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.990 
justification for going as we now know
that<00:04:38.780> dossier<00:04:39.500> was<00:04:39.980> incorrect<00:04:40.640> that<00:04:40.790> dossier

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
that dossier was incorrect that dossier

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.900 
that dossier was incorrect that dossier
was<00:04:41.450> wrong<00:04:41.690> however<00:04:42.530> we<00:04:43.100> still<00:04:43.130> got<00:04:43.520> rid<00:04:43.700> of<00:04:43.730> an

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
was wrong however we still got rid of an

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.640 
was wrong however we still got rid of an
evil<00:04:44.180> dictator<00:04:44.270> and<00:04:44.930> let's<00:04:45.140> keep<00:04:45.350> this<00:04:45.470> in
