pears would never give out as much juice
as<00:02:29.489> Apple<00:02:29.849> to<00:02:29.939> do<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.239> I'm<00:02:30.299> not<00:02:30.420> completely

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
as Apple to do so I'm not completely

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.660 
as Apple to do so I'm not completely
like<00:02:31.379> worried<00:02:31.769> it's<00:02:31.950> gonna<00:02:32.099> be<00:02:32.189> super<00:02:32.430> liquidy
