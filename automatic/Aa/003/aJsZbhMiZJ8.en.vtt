00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.839 

again<00:03:48.739> I<00:03:48.769> haven't<00:03:49.010> been<00:03:49.219> playing<00:03:49.310> guitar<00:03:49.519> all

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
again I haven't been playing guitar all

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.819 
again I haven't been playing guitar all
that<00:03:50.030> long<00:03:50.239> so<00:03:50.689> I'm<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.810> little<00:03:51.079> sloppy<00:03:51.379> with<00:03:51.560> it

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
that long so I'm a little sloppy with it

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.229 
that long so I'm a little sloppy with it
but<00:03:51.980> those<00:03:52.159> are<00:03:52.219> all<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.609> right<00:03:52.730> chords

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
but those are all the right chords

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.209 
but those are all the right chords
remember<00:03:53.689> to<00:03:53.780> tune<00:03:53.959> down<00:03:53.989> a<00:03:54.230> half<00:03:54.469> a<00:03:54.620> step<00:03:54.890> and

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:55.219 
remember to tune down a half a step and

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:56.500 
remember to tune down a half a step and
use<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:55.459> delay<00:03:55.819> if<00:03:55.939> you<00:03:56.030> have<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.299> because<00:03:56.359> it

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
use a delay if you have it because it

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.709 
use a delay if you have it because it
sounds<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:56.930> million<00:03:57.260> times<00:03:57.469> better
