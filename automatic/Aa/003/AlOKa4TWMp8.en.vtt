hi folks doc here back to do the next

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.930 
hi folks doc here back to do the next
segment<00:00:13.209> on<00:00:13.389> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
segment on the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.189 
segment on the
homemade<00:00:15.570> mufflers<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.170> DIY<00:00:16.650> exhaust<00:00:18.050> as<00:00:19.050> you

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
homemade mufflers the DIY exhaust as you

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.779 
homemade mufflers the DIY exhaust as you
can<00:00:19.380> see<00:00:19.560> just<00:00:19.860> shooting<00:00:20.130> from<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.430> front<00:00:20.640> of

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
can see just shooting from the front of

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.630 
can see just shooting from the front of
mule<00:00:21.330> here<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:22.560> pipes<00:00:22.830> have<00:00:23.039> been<00:00:23.070> reoriented

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
mule here the pipes have been reoriented

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.550 
mule here the pipes have been reoriented
so<00:00:24.509> what<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:24.960> did<00:00:25.079> is<00:00:26.840> you<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:28.020> probably<00:00:28.289> just

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
so what I did is you can probably just

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.260 
so what I did is you can probably just
see<00:00:28.919> so<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:29.579> get<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.759> better<00:00:29.849> angle<00:00:29.970> on

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
see so you can get a better angle on

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.250 
see so you can get a better angle on
that<00:00:31.460> just<00:00:32.460> where<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:32.969> exits<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.390> block<00:00:33.660> it's

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
that just where it exits the block it's

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.310 
that just where it exits the block it's
been<00:00:34.469> cut<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.980> tacked<00:00:35.219> again<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.079> right<00:00:37.079> here

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
been cut and tacked again and right here

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.440 
been cut and tacked again and right here
it's<00:00:37.559> been<00:00:37.739> cut<00:00:37.980> intact<00:00:38.399> again<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:39.030> reorient

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
it's been cut intact again to reorient

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.860 
it's been cut intact again to reorient
them<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:41.219> what<00:00:41.370> I've<00:00:41.489> got<00:00:41.640> going<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.390> can

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
kind of see from the front is the stubs

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.899 
kind of see from the front is the stubs
come<00:00:47.370> out<00:00:47.519> now<00:00:48.379> and<00:00:49.379> they're<00:00:49.559> actually

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909 
come out now and they're actually

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:52.189 
come out now and they're actually
backing<00:00:50.909> up<00:00:51.179> against<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> garage<00:00:51.659> door<00:00:52.019> here

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
backing up against the garage door here

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.450 
backing up against the garage door here
they're<00:00:52.350> actually<00:00:52.469> at<00:00:52.769> equal<00:00:53.100> height<00:00:53.280> and

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
they're actually at equal height and

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.639 
they're actually at equal height and

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
location now after a little bit of

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.299 
location now after a little bit of
adjustment<00:00:57.469> so<00:00:58.469> that's<00:00:58.829> what<00:00:58.980> we've<00:00:59.129> got

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
slicing on these pipes and then I put

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.090 
slicing on these pipes and then I put
put<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> wire<00:01:22.110> wheel<00:01:22.320> on<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> grinder<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.010> blew

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
rat rod ash doesn't come up with

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.670 
rat rod ash doesn't come up with
something<00:02:44.690> just<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.930> make<00:02:45.080> a<00:02:45.110> couple<00:02:45.410> of<00:02:45.500> turn

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
something just to make a couple of turn

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.380 
something just to make a couple of turn
down<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.190> that<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.459> exhaust<00:02:46.730> isn't<00:02:46.970> pointed

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
down so that the exhaust isn't pointed

00:02:47.390 --> 00:03:30.360 
down so that the exhaust isn't pointed
directly<00:02:47.480> at<00:02:47.810> my<00:02:47.989> legs

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.729 

okay<00:03:31.370> so<00:03:31.430> here<00:03:31.790> we<00:03:31.910> have<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:32.239> our<00:03:32.450> new<00:03:33.440> exhaust

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
okay so here we have it our new exhaust

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.479 
okay so here we have it our new exhaust
system<00:03:34.299> now<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:36.830> only<00:03:37.010> thing<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.250> really<00:03:37.459> have

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.009 
system now the only thing I really have
left<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:37.910> do<00:03:38.030> is<00:03:38.120> to<00:03:38.239> throw<00:03:38.360> some<00:03:38.599> paint<00:03:38.780> on

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
left to do is to throw some paint on

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
and I haven't actually picked up the

and I haven't actually picked up the
paint<00:03:43.519> yet<00:03:43.700> so<00:03:43.910> I<00:03:43.940> won't<00:03:44.180> be<00:03:44.269> doing<00:03:44.390> that<00:03:44.540> just

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
paint yet so I won't be doing that just

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.850 
paint yet so I won't be doing that just
yet<00:03:45.370> but<00:03:46.370> I've<00:03:46.940> got<00:03:46.970> everything<00:03:47.620> burned<00:03:48.620> in

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
I've got the tips clamped on and

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.130 
I've got the tips clamped on and
everything<00:03:56.329> went<00:03:56.480> pretty<00:03:56.600> well

everything went pretty well
they've<00:03:57.799> been<00:03:57.920> welded<00:03:58.310> up<00:03:58.840> little<00:03:59.840> holes

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
they've been welded up little holes

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.750 
they've been welded up little holes
where<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.350> relief<00:04:00.620> valves<00:04:00.980> were<00:04:01.100> on<00:04:01.459> both

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
where the relief valves were on both

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.650 
where the relief valves were on both
sides<00:04:02.380> and<00:04:03.519> I<00:04:04.519> did<00:04:04.850> have<00:04:05.030> a<00:04:05.060> bit<00:04:05.299> of<00:04:05.329> a<00:04:05.450> fight

sides and I did have a bit of a fight
welding<00:04:06.260> that<00:04:06.290> thin<00:04:06.680> metal<00:04:07.569> because<00:04:08.569> I<00:04:08.600> don't

which I don't currently have and you do
that<00:04:23.960> a<00:04:23.990> little<00:04:24.110> bit<00:04:24.320> later<00:04:24.470> today<00:04:26.740> but<00:04:27.740> for

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
that a little bit later today but for

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.670 
that a little bit later today but for
the<00:04:28.039> purpose<00:04:28.669> at<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.450> moment<00:04:29.479> anyways<00:04:30.169> she's

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
the purpose at the moment anyways she's

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.580 
the purpose at the moment anyways she's
done<00:04:30.889> I've<00:04:31.880> got<00:04:31.910> those<00:04:32.240> chrome<00:04:32.840> tips<00:04:33.110> clamped

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
done I've got those chrome tips clamped

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.750 
done I've got those chrome tips clamped
on<00:04:33.740> and<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:35.210> might<00:04:35.660> wind<00:04:35.900> up<00:04:36.310> making<00:04:37.310> a<00:04:37.550> couple

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
on and I might wind up making a couple

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.140 
on and I might wind up making a couple
of<00:04:37.910> little<00:04:38.120> brackets<00:04:38.979> just<00:04:39.979> to<00:04:40.190> just<00:04:40.850> to<00:04:40.880> brace

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
of little brackets just to just to brace

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.560 
of little brackets just to just to brace
the<00:04:41.330> pipe<00:04:41.510> a<00:04:41.630> little<00:04:41.720> bit<00:04:41.960> further<00:04:42.260> against

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
the pipe a little bit further against

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.879 
the pipe a little bit further against
against<00:04:44.570> maybe<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:45.020> cooling<00:04:45.410> shroud<00:04:45.560> or

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
against maybe the cooling shroud or

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.310 
against maybe the cooling shroud or
something<00:04:46.520> close<00:04:46.729> by<00:04:47.030> just<00:04:47.300> to<00:04:47.990> provide<00:04:48.260> a

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
something close by just to provide a

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.600 
something close by just to provide a
little<00:04:48.410> extra<00:04:48.800> support<00:04:48.979> because<00:04:49.310> when<00:04:49.460> I<00:04:49.490> was

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
little extra support because when I was

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.070 
little extra support because when I was
running<00:04:49.820> it<00:04:50.000> I<00:04:50.090> noticed<00:04:50.389> it<00:04:50.479> was<00:04:50.600> wobbling<00:04:50.990> a

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
running it I noticed it was wobbling a

00:04:51.080 --> 00:05:30.480 
running it I noticed it was wobbling a
bit<00:04:51.200> but<00:04:51.410> let's<00:04:51.889> later<00:04:52.070> up

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.249 

anyway<00:05:31.490> she<00:05:31.669> sounds<00:05:31.940> pretty<00:05:32.120> good<00:05:32.270> to<00:05:32.389> me<00:05:32.419> I

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:33.259 
anyway she sounds pretty good to me I

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:34.779 
anyway she sounds pretty good to me I
think<00:05:33.680> I'm<00:05:33.949> going<00:05:34.039> to<00:05:34.099> go<00:05:34.220> ahead<00:05:34.280> and<00:05:34.490> fab<00:05:34.639> up

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
think I'm going to go ahead and fab up

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:36.700 
think I'm going to go ahead and fab up
some<00:05:35.000> brackets<00:05:35.259> somewhere<00:05:36.259> around<00:05:36.380> the<00:05:36.560> time

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
some brackets somewhere around the time

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.740 
some brackets somewhere around the time
that<00:05:36.770> I<00:05:36.919> paint<00:05:37.190> them<00:05:37.419> but<00:05:38.419> in<00:05:38.509> the<00:05:38.569> meantime

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
that I paint them but in the meantime

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.040 
that I paint them but in the meantime
there<00:05:39.680> she<00:05:39.889> is<00:05:39.919> I<00:05:40.789> like<00:05:41.270> the<00:05:41.389> sounds<00:05:41.750> it's
