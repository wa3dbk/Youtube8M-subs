00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.220
 in this appointment with chip leader 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.960
 the strategies of the pros to win the 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.000
 poker tournaments we will talk about how 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.040
 handle strong aces like ace woman or a 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.750
 subjects in a meter stage situation 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.030
 when our having this is the average 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.210
 of our stack will be between 35 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.420
 62 to explain everything in niccolÃ² matter 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.420
 Caramatti 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.170
 today we are talking about good middle axes in one 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.510
 intermediate stage of a tournament then ace 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.360
 jack ace woman does not already have a good ace 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.579
 how to play there is because you play them in 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.190
 different ways for example is always 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.290
 it is always necessary to make a three bet 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.670
 need to go to 8 for example with 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.650
 ace woman obviously the answers are 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.259
 always north that in poker is the answer 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.140
 First of all it depends on the main 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.280
 from internships to the position and to ours 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.340
 opponents 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.090
 we have an opponent who is very closed 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.470
 it is useless to go distressing a dish with 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.899
 the hand such as ace jack 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.110
 when we know that times 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.660
 call or we will go on with hands 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.420
 probably better in his enzo la 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.800
 better than our hand so 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.170
 generic so let's get folded 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.550
 only the worst hands and we hold on 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.190
 inside hands or better we do 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.259
 four hands from hands that we have to 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.170
 pass then this case could 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.810
 make more sense call and keep it 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.420
 with his returns with ten ace for 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.119
 example cappadonna kj then sleeves that 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.360
 we dominate in the case and we can play with it 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.250
 in post flop position how to manage the 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.409
 post flop for example is always one 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.119
 question of position opponents 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.829
 because it is hard to say how the game 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.750
 his woman in general post flop is obvious 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.860
 that is ace woman onna the game 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.630
 to the maximum 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.310
 but my position can afford to 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.230
 to call a bet even when not 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.420
 I hit because it is not that the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.549
 opponents always have a lot point 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.260
 strong I made a continuation bet with 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.110
 a closed point so maybe up 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.960
 lots of boards 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.150
 and then they will not continue to tar unless 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.470
 they hit and we could take us to 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.240
 home the dish is true that maybe it 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.250
 we will do it sometimes with the best hand 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.270
 because ace woman in that case is the hand 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.760
 better but let's get out 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.870
 of equity to the opponent who could 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.670
 improve comes we go to not show 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.260
 our hand so we don't do anymore 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.380
 of strategy and therefore this for 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.470
 example is one of the many options for 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.330
 play a less conventional way one 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.180
 hand like ace woman ace jack that 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.540
 normally it is seen as a hand with 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.700
 which you raise preflop when three 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.790
 to bet but then search in a way 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.130
 conventional ace woman for example and lo 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.070
 we will definitely inlet position because 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.200
 because range of our opponents when 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.570
 for year it elects position yes 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.450
 they will widen considerably so it is 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.250
 useless to call is enough to find us 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.560
 unfortunately not knowing what to do with one 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.870
 person who may have played a tide 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.420
 of hands and will hardly pay us 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.489
 when we show strength on an ace 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.560
 on a woman it is true that it could be necessary 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:38.760
 to do on the other hand though an opponent 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.930
 capable will tend to control the dish e 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.040
 so we want 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.870
 don't put us in this situation 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.900
 we can hide ours but each 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.540
 much but it is worthwhile however to play for 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.920
 value ace woman play for now only 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.230
 year especially with opponents who 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.840
 have a tendency to call so much off 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.180
 position the three bet especially with 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.879
 halo with very dominated hands then 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.129
 all women axes as they give 10 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.629
 cappadona obviously woman jack and then 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.859
 be playing in position against 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.959
 these adversaries that then hardly 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:11.700
 in a betted plate 3 they will manage to do 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.700
 move on to pass your own hand
