00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
that guy's going over the wall so

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.730 
that guy's going over the wall so
basically<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.450> there<00:01:28.409> are<00:01:28.500> troops

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
basically it's like there are troops

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.749 
basically it's like there are troops
back<00:01:29.100> here<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.670> then<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.689> there's<00:01:31.110> a

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
back here and then that there's a

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.690 
back here and then that there's a
cavalry<00:01:32.759> assault<00:01:34.100> against<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.159> Confederate

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
cavalry assault against the Confederate

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.330 
cavalry assault against the Confederate
so<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.810> horses<00:01:37.200> are<00:01:37.259> going<00:01:37.560> out<00:01:37.710> while<00:01:37.950> their

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
so the horses are going out while their

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.300 
so the horses are going out while their
troops<00:01:39.180> are<00:01:39.329> trying<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.720> go<00:01:39.840> over<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> wall<00:01:40.310> so

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
troops are trying to go over the wall so

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.690 
troops are trying to go over the wall so
let's<00:01:41.659> go<00:01:42.659> over<00:01:42.689> here<00:01:42.990> then<00:01:43.200> as<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:44.220> guy<00:01:44.369> shot

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
let's go over here then as the guy shot

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.149 
let's go over here then as the guy shot
on<00:01:44.820> shot<00:01:45.540> he's<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.439> wall<00:01:46.619> trying<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.009> go

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
on shot he's on the wall trying to go

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.560 
on shot he's on the wall trying to go
over<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:47.759> probably<00:01:48.149> got<00:01:48.299> shot<00:01:48.329> or

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.370 
over it but probably got shot or

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
but as you guys can see this is just a

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.780 
but as you guys can see this is just a
base<00:02:43.350> plate<00:02:43.620> doesn't<00:02:43.950> have<00:02:44.100> any<00:02:44.250> layers<00:02:44.490> or

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.410 
base plate doesn't have any layers or
anything<00:02:45.210> so<00:02:45.510> it's<00:02:46.250> not<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.310> great<00:02:47.610> mock<00:02:48.060> it's

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420
