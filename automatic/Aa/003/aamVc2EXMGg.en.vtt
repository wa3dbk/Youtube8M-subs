00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
look at my little meter here now there's

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.590 
look at my little meter here now there's
actually<00:02:36.080> three<00:02:36.530> sections<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:37.820> let's<00:02:38.270> say

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
actually three sections so let's say

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.240 
actually three sections so let's say
that's<00:02:38.930> because<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.320> pressed<00:02:39.740> and<00:02:39.890> held<00:02:40.040> three

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
that's because I pressed and held three

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.980 
that's because I pressed and held three
different<00:02:40.520> times<00:02:40.700> but<00:02:40.970> let's<00:02:41.180> say<00:02:41.420> this<00:02:41.720> last

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
different times but let's say this last

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.360 
different times but let's say this last
section<00:02:42.410> just<00:02:42.500> didn't<00:02:42.740> really<00:02:42.920> turn<00:02:43.070> out<00:02:43.250> like

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
section just didn't really turn out like

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.920 
section just didn't really turn out like
I<00:02:43.490> wanted<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.120> could<00:02:44.420> actually<00:02:44.540> hit<00:02:44.810> this

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
I wanted to you could actually hit this

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.720 
I wanted to you could actually hit this
backspace<00:02:45.500> button<00:02:45.710> which<00:02:45.980> then<00:02:46.190> highlight

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
backspace button which then highlight

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.970 
backspace button which then highlight
your<00:02:46.850> most<00:02:47.060> recent<00:02:47.630> clip<00:02:48.080> then<00:02:48.770> you<00:02:48.860> can

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
your most recent clip then you can

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.440 
your most recent clip then you can
actually<00:02:49.100> add<00:02:49.340> trash<00:02:49.640> it<00:02:49.850> will<00:02:49.940> delete<00:02:50.240> that

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
actually add trash it will delete that

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.480 
actually add trash it will delete that
so<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:50.780> don't<00:02:51.020> have<00:02:51.110> to<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.440> whole<00:02:51.770> whole<00:02:52.160> clip

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
so you don't have to a whole whole clip

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.920 
so you don't have to a whole whole clip
will<00:02:52.670> be<00:02:52.700> ruined<00:02:53.210> if<00:02:53.270> you<00:02:53.360> screw<00:02:53.630> up<00:02:53.660> one

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
will be ruined if you screw up one

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.090 
will be ruined if you screw up one

fancy panorama sweep across here alright
so<00:03:12.110> I<00:03:12.800> think<00:03:12.830> we're<00:03:13.070> ready<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:13.580> I'm<00:03:13.640> going<00:03:13.760> to

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
so I think we're ready so I'm going to

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.330 
so I think we're ready so I'm going to
go<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:13.970> next<00:03:14.360> step<00:03:14.570> and<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.980> next<00:03:16.010> step

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
go the next step and the next step

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.070 
go the next step and the next step
processes<00:03:17.210> and<00:03:17.390> then<00:03:17.480> takes<00:03:17.720> me<00:03:17.840> into<00:03:17.959> the

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
processes and then takes me into the

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.440 
processes and then takes me into the
filters<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:18.860> these<00:03:19.010> filters<00:03:19.370> show<00:03:19.700> up<00:03:19.850> on<00:03:20.000> the

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
filters so these filters show up on the

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.020 
filters so these filters show up on the
fly<00:03:20.780> as<00:03:21.200> you're<00:03:21.530> tapping<00:03:21.920> through<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.820> again

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
fly as you're tapping through and again

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.850 
fly as you're tapping through and again
I<00:03:23.090> believe<00:03:23.150> there's<00:03:23.480> about<00:03:23.570> 13<00:03:24.230> of<00:03:24.440> them<00:03:24.590> which

this<00:04:09.739> is<00:04:09.860> where<00:04:10.010> you're<00:04:10.190> gonna<00:04:10.280> have<00:04:10.459> to<00:04:10.519> wait

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
this is where you're gonna have to wait

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.090 
this is where you're gonna have to wait
a<00:04:10.700> little<00:04:11.000> bit<00:04:11.150> longer<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:11.720> as<00:04:12.590> compared<00:04:13.010> to

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
a little bit longer and as compared to

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.070 
a little bit longer and as compared to
photos<00:04:14.000> right<00:04:14.209> because<00:04:14.390> videos<00:04:14.690> they<00:04:14.870> have<00:04:14.900> to

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
photos right because videos they have to

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.570 
photos right because videos they have to
process<00:04:15.350> you<00:04:15.769> have<00:04:15.890> to<00:04:15.950> upload<00:04:16.250> them<00:04:16.459> they're

process you have to upload them they're

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.039 
process you have to upload them they're
obviously<00:04:16.820> going<00:04:16.940> to<00:04:17.000> be<00:04:17.060> bigger<00:04:17.330> file<00:04:17.750> size

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
obviously going to be bigger file size

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.780 
obviously going to be bigger file size
so<00:04:18.530> if<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:18.709> go<00:04:18.830> to<00:04:18.859> tier<00:04:19.220> data<00:04:19.489> plan<00:04:19.760> or

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
so if you go to tier data plan or

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.310 
so if you go to tier data plan or
something<00:04:20.120> like<00:04:20.209> that<00:04:20.419> might<00:04:21.049> want<00:04:21.109> to<00:04:21.200> be<00:04:21.290> a

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
something like that might want to be a

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.440 
something like that might want to be a
little<00:04:21.530> bit<00:04:21.680> careful<00:04:21.890> here<00:04:22.370> going<00:04:22.850> crazy<00:04:23.150> with

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
little bit careful here going crazy with

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.090 
little bit careful here going crazy with
the

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.590 
the
with<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.340> video-sharing<00:04:24.670> you<00:04:25.150> could<00:04:25.300> you

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
with the video-sharing you could you

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.060 
with the video-sharing you could you
know<00:04:25.690> hit<00:04:25.900> your<00:04:26.020> data<00:04:26.260> limit<00:04:26.590> faster<00:04:26.950> and

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
know hit your data limit faster and

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.860 
know hit your data limit faster and
things<00:04:27.220> like<00:04:27.340> that<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:28.480> can<00:04:28.600> see<00:04:28.750> it's

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
things like that you can see it's

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.990 
things like that you can see it's
uploading<00:04:29.110> it<00:04:29.890> will<00:04:30.130> take<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.400> minute

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
uploading it will take a minute

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.730 
uploading it will take a minute
so<00:04:31.510> we'll<00:04:31.630> just<00:04:31.750> sort<00:04:31.870> of<00:04:31.930> let<00:04:32.230> that<00:04:32.410> happen

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
so we'll just sort of let that happen

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.930 
so we'll just sort of let that happen
and<00:04:34.680> there<00:04:35.680> it's<00:04:35.800> done<00:04:35.980> so<00:04:36.310> I've<00:04:36.490> got<00:04:36.640> my<00:04:36.760> first
