00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
than ours for the mere fact that i think

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.469 
than ours for the mere fact that i think
we<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> very<00:01:38.490> good<00:01:38.790> offense<00:01:39.180> i<00:01:39.299> think

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
we have a very good offense i think

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.880 
we have a very good offense i think
texas<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.869> pretty<00:01:40.079> good<00:01:40.200> very<00:01:40.439> good<00:01:40.470> offense

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
