 cannon lost to checkered 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.420
 Bravo 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.719
 nothing 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.039
 fair play 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.649
 US 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.649
 currently I do not see them 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.550
 woerth 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.910
 then a little later but it must be said that it is one of the youngest 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.810
 of the young patriotic showman opted to position the pictures that 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.410
 it's on paper the communication advisor robert hue to the room 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.600
 applauds with his beard lied morocco can offer broadcasts 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.490
 berlin culture while striking 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.490
 m 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.900
 while the clubs of the elite we are trying to give you reason 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.420
 because I saw this week one of figaro 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.170
 who was finally explaining 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.710
 that it is to diversify for their oil supply 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.890
 that the united states of george bush 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.079
 you want to attack iraq 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.189
 so that's what it means you said that a few months ago while 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.320
 the world can fall on 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.810
 and you're waiting for me in the amazon story I thank you were the only contribution 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.710
 to invite me again in a mission of two strokes on a global scale 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.720
 is that everyone can say what he has to say but I'm not 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.550
 always agree people can talk that's it 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.160
 to look for his sister pressure because it was pretty good rating 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.410
 widespread 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.090
 for clermont 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.470
 it's a pleasure 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.470
 so all the amazon story of men passing ben yes how to see when we 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.830
 sees today every day this American arrogance continues and 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.260
 sinks the American people is total below this power 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.370
 nehru 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.080
 well specified that one can be anti-bush cents to 36 American will be 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.240
 surely even more diabetes 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.380
 amalgams are quickly made that you have already looked at and we can not 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.619
 appreciate charonne do not be anti-Semitic this is for example what 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.790
 I love anti-Semitism 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.210
 Several weeks 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.270
 they are ready very attractive and charabot 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.889
 woerth we are really present charonne 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.289
 so today this school jacques chirac eventually became 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:14.450
 for me I find that the 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.050
 I think that the idea of ​​an attitude 7% yes but without restraint and if I think 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.879
 that there are no more ambiguities in its preferential position 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:22.890
 German Chancellor 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.259
 the German Chancellor under the pressure of the Greens from elsewhere 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.599
 especially of files r elie way very clear there will be only we are 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.809
 against the American intervention in Iraq he understood with the green light of 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:36.469
 the un yes or the chiraquie is not quite the same thing and in addition to 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.539
 the national assembly he accepts 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.629
 that we have a debate on Iraq but he recommended to the President of 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:42.819
 The national assembly 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.579
 and it is not sanctioned by a vote yes for me I will not accept it I 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.629
 find that in the same way that we saw troops in Afghanistan 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.259
 without being consulted 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:54.739
 I can not in the name of what an executive to send French troops 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:59.799
 in iraq without the the the national representation being consulted I think 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.779
 that his position is friends of the wood the game was becoming so now everyone 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:06.180
 agree with you this is the pitch a real treat we always have the rating 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.130
 and finally to the first in France only a little barbaric and blind to have said 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.170
 what we are drinking it was a little bit it's a little bit me 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.549
 spoke out against the war 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.549
 americans in afghanistan and i was very severely 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.359
 criticized because I tell myself that it was a war against the people 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.299
 Afghan I maintain that this operation in the district has invalidated by the 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.209
 best intentions but bush he did something very bad to even 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.499
 if I think it's not to be missed 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.619
 when he said you are with us or against us ie the transform 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.809
 the black and white world she had no right to be 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:39.859
 a really problematic journey the bnf who claimed he had to choose 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.129
 we are really 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.279
 so I gave your positions last spring brought you to 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:48.280
 stop your presidential campaign 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.629
 we regret that she was not present because you would have 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.109
 doubt to revalue the SMIC rather than ministers' salaries 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.819
 but it's clear that I had some hits to beltran places for this 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.479
 concert at the site that is worth at first a possible rapprochement in the second round 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:05.789
 of honor with christmas I was convinced that we have the report 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:09.289
 but no it's not organized that way in which we see the 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:11.639
 rescue were working think it's unfortunate and and that class 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.759
 policy should accept at the rostrum 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:17.689
 freethinkers because the disputed vote of it is the pen who has it 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:20.930
 taken for an idiot on his behalf and percent and I think that left and the 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.319
 opportunities also to bring together people who have not mobilized 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:26.529
 first round so that you can especially a little fart 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:29.699
 offside but if you had been Honduran president terminals front 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.699
 national 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:43.129
 I do not know if we banned the national front 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:47.400
 good I do not always think about cardiff national front 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.930
 I think it's a big mistake to say that we have to ban the 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.680
 national front it reminds me 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.689
 these cases of eddy bertold brecht 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:56.800
 to the Germans 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.990
 to the German dictatorship in 53 when the people had risen up he had 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.979
 says if you do not like the people change course yes bordas can not 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.849
 to ban the national front is not only to make the hotel a victim 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.279
 which are things that are very fast 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:12.109
 i will play tunisia then became plague-stricken people who 

00:05:12.109 --> 00:05:15.239
 vote for him so the problem is not to forbid the national front to 

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:16.800
 do that for example left 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.050
 go to those who voted for the national front fire that she make a 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.080
 leftist politics 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.660
 I want the games were present republic jailers amnestied davie of 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.889
 Levi's 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.139
 he is a great champion like me I do judo for 15 years 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.650
 I must say that it is still a sacred champion pts 2 you would have been 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.039
 asked and Bernadette Chirac to stay the first lady of France 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.360
 if I am married I have a wife 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.500
 it is true that Bernadette has advantages for employees her charms to 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.650
 but it's clear that I could have been tempted 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.289
 need as it's not met 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.789
 d I think I think it's a funny side in his choice 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
 r 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:06.139
 I've never been president of what you would favor the lobby 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.229
 glory 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:11.360
 I am blonde and I am at least happy 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.469
 I am a human in 7 I am against the borders 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:18.589
 whatever it is ethnic geographical religious national 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.409
 I fight against the lobbies there are only you did not exist I find 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:24.469
 it's unfortunate 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:28.459
 would you have walked around and the costs of air too much of 

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:30.599
 Brégançon 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:31.719
 ap ap 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:35.610
 I would have made a stronger contrario to the afp paste 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.900
 for the moment I had you are the theatrical stunt at the theater of the 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.969
 golden hand your case 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:53.129
 since September 24th, to present a new show called divorce 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:54.289
 from patrick 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.969
 well it happened actually it was this summer I have a friend 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:59.979
 who citibank who was in a difficult time of his life divorce 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:01.719
 without his wife 

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:03.740
 go away the children have value 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.089
 I was a little bit game 

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:08.449
 a little bit his account his confidant my time 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:09.529
 and so 

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:12.589
 the world I was it was to make laugh what was not obvious 

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:16.339
 and oh that I worked for that and percent and then it gives this show 

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:19.999
 while we were playing then in this show other own character you 

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:21.499
 are invited to an evening of 

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:23.850
 of gala with the theme is the woman 

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.610
 but behind the scenes you wait to recite a poem 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.490
 and during this time so you're constantly bothered by Patrick's sap 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.730
 in the title 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.980
 at the checkout I left by his wife and who tell you on the phone 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.620
 that's it that's a bit like that it happened Thursday mr jean-paul 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.020
 ii 

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.150
 a bit caricatural but I think that's it and the game as well as those who 

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.300
 divorce who are in sensitive situations to come and see and laugh 

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.340
 because in fact she I think it's a moment in the limit 

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.979
 bringing to find the bape of self-mockery because that's what 

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:52.539
 makes me sad serious fate like that it takes camera that carries the 

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:54.729
 guilt while final 

00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:57.339
 his life adventure is growing it's classic and his men
