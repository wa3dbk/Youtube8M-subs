00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.160
 go everyone 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.630
 so here we are for a video 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.630
 so I want to show you 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:12.329
 one of the moments 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:17.000
 twenty years one of the lemieux buildings the most successful success up 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.679
 now 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.019
 Jacques 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.119
 finally this decree tel the last on the last video 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.929
 on the construction of stadiums coli and shu 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:28.329
 it is finished 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.369
 apart from the entry of players that I have not done yet and then from 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.369
 details that I would definitely have the end 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.590
 I'm not going I went to show all that I'm recovering well the day 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.110
 at night I'll do it after 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.830
 Let's go 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.830
 open your eyes 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.530
 here 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.600
 beautiful Swiss backstage stadium 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.540
 so I put another moment to do it 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.620
 because with terms mode the option that is about tibet for 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.100
 the elite 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.350
 and copy and paste 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.540
 it works halfway 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.540
 so the turns I have almost all the rockers in the hand 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.270
 m the site 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.740
 why use 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.740
 it is almost entirely handmade 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.050
 of course with% 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.530
 all the minitel 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.950
 the superbike axis 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.070
 slice the garlic 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.070
 so the rings I improved since the end of the last video 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.230
 I'm leaving if I'm here if you do not know if to exchange them to see the video 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.380
 after 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.380
 December the afp 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.110
 so the towers 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.820
 which comes out in malta paste 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.240
 blow their assert respected except 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.360
 Ravenclaw 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.120
 clearly blue then copper 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.690
 lille cooks a kraft 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.070
 and so I had to try to 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.390
 which is very good 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.650
 what I 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.910
 but good 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.910
 it's been clear at this point 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.649
 because at night it's hard to light a rotten thing 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.469
 but she finds that I am 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:23.059
 too badly done 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.059
 still you will be able 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:28.059
 find out 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.039
 angola is theirs 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:37.029
 the night stadium there the clouds 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.389
 watch at night 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.159
 we can still quite well 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.159
 rahim mashaie 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.729
 it can be said as well what is it doing here night and is hurt the 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.729
 day is limited in time that rame people 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.639
 how camel not why 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.639
 the kraft study does not train as much 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:06.739
 a polar one the microclimate as much for it 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:07.869
 on the stadium 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:10.869
 the nights 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:13.669
 it's not so much 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.669
 our hearts and it was hardly enlightened something like that 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:19.760
 I think the lot 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.760
 for the rest mystery sarah not too bad 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:27.179
 I do everything very high romance like celine 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.369
 six records the album is rare 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:34.749
 the pitot probes are more or less 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:37.749
 that the rings 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.499
 so here the student stands 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:44.369
 and in the bleachers 

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:46.590
 three business director 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.590
 guests 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.159
 So now I do not know why I was attacking 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:00.379
 I take this train 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.519
 asec and Hogwarts 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.620
 So here is the presentation of the politicized stage and for me very 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.620
 succeeded 13 very well here 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:14.899
 locke at 10 months what you think and if you have any 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:17.449
 improvements 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.739
 with its grounds and so on
