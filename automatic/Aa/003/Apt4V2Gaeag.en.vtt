00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.350
 to talk about launch we therefore know in depth 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.830
 rod and reel to make choices buy the product you are 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.779
 suits our expectations 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.869
 linguine alle fundamental in this case of a reel 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.070
 intended for medium to long distance fishing loaded with 0 35 thread 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.630
 very visible 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.269
 basically for reasons of recovery 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:26.849
 note that there are about ten additional vicio pierre laps of 45 pounds 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.419
 fundamental both when we practice launching 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.740
 and when we are fishing veret pro 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.680
 the cane 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.680
 very reliable classic type reel seat 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.070
 with a progressive parabolic action because these are the rods 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.510
 of yesterday and today is definitely anti tomorrow 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.410
 those that start with a high conicity 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.560
 handle large enough in diameter to then end 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.929
 you are not gradually narrowing 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.199
 this type of barrel allows us the best compromise between capacity of 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.030
 launching 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.120
 and fighting recovery ability of the prey respects the lipo canes 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.220
 parabolic 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.020
 which have the big advantages in recovering prey 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.020
 but they are extremely modest in capacity 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.610
 budget and type in the precision launch part 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.060
 the carfishing rods are on average two forever 12 and 13 + in length 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.680
 viper 3 60 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.130
 e3 90 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.040
 the length is a function of ours 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.969
 build of our weight 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:29.700
 big head types that loved me frontally 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.100
 long distance fishing rods a little longer fishing marginal distance or 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.070
 close 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.310
 canes can be used 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.759
 valkanela carfishing are obviously ringed because we use 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.260
 mainly intertwined important that the rings 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.710
 are able to support the abrasion caused by the braids 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.619
 fans rings that therefore Pythagoras silicon carbide are capable 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.619
 to operate without any problems even in the most difficult conditions 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.950
 marking must be accurate of the grandparents 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.280
 we understand 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.850
 in the open immediately 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.420
 the quality of the object 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.760
 let's go back to buying 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.430
 very refined binding 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.990
 wisely something dedicated to high performance rods 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.729
 very important aspect on which 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:18.949
 there is a lot of curiosity about the canes 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:21.379
 this rod with the aspic 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.180
 hospital the type of graft that brings the handle to connect with tip 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:30.839
 it must be said it is very important once the wrong cannes are closed 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:35.609
 all the manga in the space between the two ends of the pipes is not a mistake 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.149
 of construction as some believe 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:39.349
 this space 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.369
 and a kind of game that is granted 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:44.229
 because over time 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:48.249
 the part on the mine villa canne in this case the part of the tip 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:50.730
 andrea gradually to adjust 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.220
 until you find a perfect location in the male part then of the handle 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:03:00.139
 it is fundamental therefore that there is this space within each spic 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:01.740
 we absolutely must 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.450
 operate with paper and I am as we have seen some of these have been reduced 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.039
 thickness 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:11.739
 the veiling of a launching rod is made up of not six 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:16.809
 brass in progression starting from a first rather generous ring of 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:19.889
 average common diameter measurement 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.109
 40 in some cases 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.059
 six octagonals in progression 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:28.389
 but if the central rings are not fundamental 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.359
 very important 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.199
 the toe ring 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.149
 poke on it 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:38.680
 when odd cocks most of the efforts were launching station 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.549
 and recovery we imagine the great distance recovery 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.219
 all the main attraction let fall on a ring that a particular technician 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:48.639
 important 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.319
 therefore a high quality rod must have 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.249
 moody the trainer ants 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:58.409
 particularly generous and much larger in size and quality 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:59.810
 the sending tip is important 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.810
 of all the remaining series of rings 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.980
 bending companies and technical aspects that differentiate the various types of dogs 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:11.709
 festivities workshops free expression 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.889
 it is calculated in an extremely empirical way if you try to identify the 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:16.879
 weight 

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:21.629
 amount of weight that brings a 90 degree bend in the barrel itself 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:25.889
 fax using a tip to read in you I would try to simplify the speech 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.769
 bending weight measurement is done by applying a weight on the tip 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.710
 gradually 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.819
 24 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:34.909
 badoo 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:36.170
 at 90 degrees 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.740
 considering the bribes 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.669
 between the part 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.509
 of the. of the barrel and the handle indicatively as we have held 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.879
 well the free expression weight that we have identified that causes the 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:48.400
 90 degree pressure 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.659
 exactly the warp test 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:52.499
 so we have a subdivision 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:55.629
 generic of short medium-range canes 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.029
 free trap2 half 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:00.729
 balances 75 long range 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.009
 smasung ranger from two 75 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:04.909
 up to three and a half free 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:09.339
 over 3 and a half book are difficult reeds fair reuse you understand 

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:10.609
 even in extreme conditions
