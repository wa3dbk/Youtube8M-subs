hopefully the unsuspecting civilian
won't<00:00:20.039> think<00:00:20.310> twice<00:00:20.490> about<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.650> what

happens is this may be okay you have
entrance<00:00:25.350> like<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.650> maybe<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.099> extend<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
entrance like this maybe you extend the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.640 
entrance like this maybe you extend the
entrance<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.539> make<00:00:27.570> one<00:00:27.900> entrance<00:00:28.260> or<00:00:28.439> you

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
entrance you make one entrance or you

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.140 
entrance you make one entrance or you
can<00:00:28.830> make<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.189> from<00:00:29.250> any<00:00:29.460> entrance<00:00:29.820> they<00:00:30.000> can

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
can make it from any entrance they can

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.900 
can make it from any entrance they can
come<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.300> from<00:00:30.510> multiple<00:00:30.929> different<00:00:31.260> ways<00:00:31.910> but

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
come in from multiple different ways but

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.240 
come in from multiple different ways but
for<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.480> one<00:00:33.630> I'm<00:00:33.780> just<00:00:34.020> gonna<00:00:34.170> show<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
for this one I'm just gonna show you the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.060 
for this one I'm just gonna show you the
basics<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.239> what<00:00:36.540> happens<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:37.110> first<00:00:37.770> is

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
basics so what happens here first is

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.520 
basics so what happens here first is
someone<00:00:38.640> walks<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.110> they<00:00:40.350> try

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
someone walks in this and and they try

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.750 
someone walks in this and and they try
to<00:00:40.590> get<00:00:40.739> out<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.010> they<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.250> can't<00:00:41.460> because

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
to get out and they just can't because

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.470 
to get out and they just can't because
all<00:00:41.940> these<00:00:42.090> pressure<00:00:42.390> plates<00:00:42.719> are<00:00:42.980> are

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
all these pressure plates are are

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.940 
all these pressure plates are are
pushing<00:00:45.480> them<00:00:45.629> away<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.440> each<00:00:46.680> pressure

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
pushing them away and so each pressure

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.430 
pushing them away and so each pressure
plate<00:00:47.250> lifts<00:00:48.239> each<00:00:48.420> one<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.960> these<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.320> this

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
plate lifts each one of these so this

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.740 
plate lifts each one of these so this
won't<00:00:49.559> lift<00:00:49.739> too<00:00:49.980> because<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.370> touching<00:00:50.550> to

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
won't lift too because it's touching to

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.840 
won't lift too because it's touching to
but<00:00:51.750> each<00:00:51.930> one<00:00:51.960> lifts<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.610> they<00:00:53.699> don't

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
but each one lifts one so they don't

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.569 
but each one lifts one so they don't
open<00:00:54.239> at<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> same<00:00:54.449> time<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.579> that's

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
open at the same time and that's

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.830 
open at the same time and that's
partially<00:00:56.879> because<00:00:57.120> I'm<00:00:57.420> playing<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
partially because I'm playing on the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.770 
partially because I'm playing on the
flat<00:00:58.050> world<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.620> was<00:00:58.800> playing<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.780> full

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
flat world if I was playing on the full

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.369 
flat world if I was playing on the full
world<00:01:01.199> here<00:01:01.850> then<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.239> wouldn't<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.629> different

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
world here then it wouldn't be different

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.370 
world here then it wouldn't be different
because<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.920> would<00:01:05.659> be<00:01:06.659> able<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.869> go<00:01:06.990> deeper<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
because I would be able to go deeper and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.830 
because I would be able to go deeper and
make<00:01:07.710> wanna<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.880> each<00:01:09.060> one<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.299> these<00:01:09.450> open

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
make wanna like each one of these open

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.030 
make wanna like each one of these open
every<00:01:10.080> single<00:01:10.200> one<00:01:10.470> which<00:01:10.590> would<00:01:10.740> be<00:01:10.860> more

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
every single one which would be more

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.280 
every single one which would be more
efficient<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.900> harder<00:01:12.900> for<00:01:12.930> them<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> know

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
efficient and harder for them to know

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.640 
efficient and harder for them to know
cuz<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.280> way<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.360> honest<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:16.470> I

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
cuz like like this way to be honest if I

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.620 
cuz like like this way to be honest if I
double<00:01:17.250> jump<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> right<00:01:17.820> way<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.360> get<00:01:18.479> up

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
double jump the right way I can get up

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.570 
double jump the right way I can get up
and<00:01:18.780> glitch<00:01:19.439> out<00:01:19.619> kind<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.310> doesn't

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
and glitch out kind of but that doesn't

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.160 
and glitch out kind of but that doesn't
happen<00:01:20.700> if<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.000> get<00:01:21.180> one<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.659> open<00:01:21.900> them<00:01:22.020> all

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
happen if you get one to open them all

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.420 
happen if you get one to open them all
and<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.439> think<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.680> guys<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:22.979> understand<00:01:23.340> what

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
and I think you guys can understand what

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.010 
and I think you guys can understand what
that<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.420> long<00:01:24.570> video<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:24.960> I'm

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
that is this is just a long video so I'm

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.590 
that is this is just a long video so I'm
gonna<00:01:25.110> try<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.320> keep<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.560> moving<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
gonna try to keep on moving and so the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.560 
gonna try to keep on moving and so the
power<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.200> trap<00:01:28.650> part<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.460> uh

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
power of the trap part of this is uh

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.060 
power of the trap part of this is uh
when<00:01:30.570> they<00:01:30.659> stand<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:30.930> one<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.170> these<00:01:31.290> lava

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
when they stand on one of these lava

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.920 
when they stand on one of these lava
starts<00:01:32.460> pouring<00:01:32.729> down<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.450> by<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.600> time<00:01:33.689> they

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
starts pouring down and by the time they

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.630 
starts pouring down and by the time they
realize<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.380> pouring<00:01:34.710> out<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.280> too<00:01:35.490> late

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
realize it's pouring out it's too late

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.149 
realize it's pouring out it's too late
to<00:01:35.790> get<00:01:35.850> off<00:01:36.000> those<00:01:36.409> those<00:01:37.409> three<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.009> then

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
to get off those those three and then

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.350 
to get off those those three and then
they<00:01:38.250> burn<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.610> death<00:01:38.729> because<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.150> doesn't

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
they burn to death because it doesn't

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.870 
they burn to death because it doesn't
stop<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.900> I'm<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:41.009> creative<00:01:41.310> mode<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.579> I'm<00:01:41.729> not

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
stop and I'm in creative mode so I'm not

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.319 
stop and I'm in creative mode so I'm not
dying<00:01:42.090> here<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:43.460> yeah<00:01:44.460> let<00:01:44.820> me<00:01:44.880> clean<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.180> up

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
dying here and yeah let me clean this up

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.999 
dying here and yeah let me clean this up
and<00:01:45.509> come<00:01:45.840> right<00:01:45.930> back<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.740> i<00:01:46.770> got<00:01:46.920> this

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
and come right back so i got this

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.649 
and come right back so i got this
cleaned<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.399> here<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.240> i'm<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.509> going<00:01:48.630> to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
cleaned up here and i'm just going to

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.120 
cleaned up here and i'm just going to
show<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.899> what<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.079> looks<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.350> without<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
show you what it looks like without the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.460 
show you what it looks like without the
waba<00:01:50.310> actually<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:50.909> there<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.509> not<00:01:52.140> stocked

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
waba actually in there and not stocked

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.200 
waba actually in there and not stocked
up<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.189> just<00:01:53.220> opens<00:01:53.640> up<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:54.030> a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
up so it just opens up it's just a

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.929 
up so it just opens up it's just a
simple<00:01:54.479> opening<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:56.460> yeah<00:01:56.610> that's<00:01:56.759> what

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
simple opening and so yeah that's what

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.459 
simple opening and so yeah that's what
that<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:58.520> let's<00:01:59.520> show<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.119> what<00:02:01.079> happens

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
that is and let's show you what happens

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.050 
that is and let's show you what happens
over<00:02:02.180> her<00:02:03.680> what's<00:02:04.680> actually<00:02:04.950> setting<00:02:05.880> off

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
over her what's actually setting off

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.150 
over her what's actually setting off
that<00:02:06.360> chain<00:02:07.110> reaction<00:02:07.590> because<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:08.009> is

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
that chain reaction because this is

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.100 
that chain reaction because this is
pretty<00:02:08.369> self-explanatory<00:02:08.670> it's<00:02:09.629> basically

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
pretty self-explanatory it's basically

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.830 
pretty self-explanatory it's basically
just<00:02:10.200> pressure<00:02:10.649> plates<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.220> then

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
just pressure plates and then

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.440 
just pressure plates and then
and<00:02:11.989> a<00:02:12.080> sticky<00:02:12.349> piston<00:02:12.910> placed<00:02:13.910> right<00:02:14.180> there

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
and a sticky piston placed right there

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.570 
and a sticky piston placed right there
so<00:02:14.599> that's<00:02:14.720> pretty<00:02:14.989> self-explanatory<00:02:15.580> all

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
so that's pretty self-explanatory all

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.160 
so that's pretty self-explanatory all
the<00:02:16.730> way<00:02:16.790> around<00:02:16.910> here<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:17.690> each<00:02:17.870> one<00:02:17.900> of<00:02:18.050> these

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
the way around here so each one of these

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.110 
the way around here so each one of these
set<00:02:18.379> off<00:02:18.590> but<00:02:19.370> under<00:02:19.580> here<00:02:19.760> is<00:02:19.849> a<00:02:19.879> little

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
set off but under here is a little

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.360 
set off but under here is a little
trickier<00:02:20.569> part<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.110> like<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:21.980> said<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.160> was<00:02:22.340> a

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
trickier part and like I said I was a

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.479 
trickier part and like I said I was a
little<00:02:22.730> not<00:02:23.629> I<00:02:23.959> was<00:02:24.200> little<00:02:24.379> faulted<00:02:24.920> by<00:02:25.280> not

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
little not I was little faulted by not

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.400 
little not I was little faulted by not
being<00:02:25.760> able<00:02:25.879> to<00:02:25.970> go<00:02:26.090> deeper<00:02:26.420> than<00:02:26.540> this<00:02:27.080> block

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
being able to go deeper than this block

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.190 
being able to go deeper than this block
here<00:02:28.090> because<00:02:29.090> yeah<00:02:29.510> then<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.840> world<00:02:29.989> drops

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
here because yeah then the world drops

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.380 
here because yeah then the world drops
out<00:02:30.379> because<00:02:30.620> I'm<00:02:30.709> playing<00:02:30.860> in<00:02:31.040> flat<00:02:31.370> but<00:02:31.610> yeah

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
out because I'm playing in flat but yeah

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.910 
out because I'm playing in flat but yeah
that's<00:02:32.599> a<00:02:32.690> different<00:02:32.930> story<00:02:32.989> so<00:02:33.560> what<00:02:33.680> happens

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
that's a different story so what happens

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.890 
that's a different story so what happens
is<00:02:34.010> these<00:02:34.250> three<00:02:34.640> pressure<00:02:34.879> plates<00:02:35.180> yes<00:02:35.660> these

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
is these three pressure plates yes these

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.470 
is these three pressure plates yes these
two<00:02:36.260> end<00:02:36.470> ones<00:02:36.620> do<00:02:37.280> set<00:02:37.549> off<00:02:37.670> these<00:02:37.879> but<00:02:38.209> their

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
two end ones do set off these but their

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.470 
two end ones do set off these but their
main<00:02:38.629> job<00:02:38.930> is<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.590> set<00:02:39.769> off<00:02:39.890> this<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:40.730> let's

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
main job is to set off this and let's

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.809 
main job is to set off this and let's
follow<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:42.080> up<00:02:42.260> here<00:02:42.650> I'm<00:02:43.459> actually<00:02:43.610> going

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
follow this up here I'm actually going

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.930 
follow this up here I'm actually going
to<00:02:43.910> leave<00:02:44.090> this<00:02:44.329> on<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:45.049> signal<00:02:45.470> on<00:02:45.680> as<00:02:46.670> if

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
to leave this on the signal on as if

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.880 
to leave this on the signal on as if
someone<00:02:47.269> was<00:02:47.329> standing<00:02:47.569> on<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.810> plate<00:02:48.079> so<00:02:48.620> it

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
someone was standing on the plate so it

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.490 
someone was standing on the plate so it
goes<00:02:49.040> up<00:02:49.250> up<00:02:49.459> up<00:02:50.000> up<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.989> obviously<00:02:51.380> this

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
goes up up up up and obviously this

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.979 
goes up up up up and obviously this
would<00:02:51.620> all<00:02:51.739> be<00:02:51.769> hidden<00:02:52.269> may<00:02:53.269> be<00:02:53.450> an<00:02:53.569> amount<00:02:53.810> and

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
would all be hidden may be an amount and

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.410 
would all be hidden may be an amount and
maybe<00:02:54.200> in<00:02:54.319> something<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.709> don't<00:02:54.890> know<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.420> so

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
maybe in something I don't know and so

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.940 
maybe in something I don't know and so
up<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:56.930> you're<00:02:57.049> gonna<00:02:57.140> need<00:02:57.319> a<00:02:57.379> repeater<00:02:57.860> here

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
up and you're gonna need a repeater here

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.309 
up and you're gonna need a repeater here
I<00:02:58.519> don't<00:02:58.879> I<00:02:59.060> try<00:02:59.329> to<00:02:59.360> take<00:02:59.540> off<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.840> leg<00:03:00.049> so<00:03:00.260> I

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
I don't I try to take off the leg so I

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.490 
I don't I try to take off the leg so I
put<00:03:00.530> these<00:03:00.980> two<00:03:01.280> closest<00:03:01.790> together<00:03:02.049> up<00:03:03.049> up<00:03:03.319> up

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
put these two closest together up up up

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.039 
put these two closest together up up up
a<00:03:03.709> repeater<00:03:04.160> going<00:03:04.430> this<00:03:04.730> way<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.540> it<00:03:05.690> spans

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
a repeater going this way so it spans

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.660 
a repeater going this way so it spans
all<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:06.560> way<00:03:06.650> around<00:03:06.709> so<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.250> ones<00:03:07.400> that<00:03:07.519> come

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
all the way around so the ones that come

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.309 
all the way around so the ones that come
down<00:03:07.819> just<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.180> make<00:03:08.299> a<00:03:08.329> little<00:03:08.390> harder<00:03:09.110> on<00:03:09.230> the

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
down just to make a little harder on the

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.900 
down just to make a little harder on the
people<00:03:09.590> trying<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.239> escape<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:12.620> let<00:03:13.310> me<00:03:13.400> show

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
people trying to escape and let me show

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.970 
people trying to escape and let me show
you<00:03:13.970> what<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.150> mean<00:03:14.209> they're<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:15.530> this<00:03:15.709> comes

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
you what I mean they're so this comes

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.699 
you what I mean they're so this comes
all<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.220> way<00:03:16.340> around<00:03:16.519> and<00:03:17.139> these<00:03:18.139> are<00:03:18.200> sticky

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
all the way around and these are sticky

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.979 
all the way around and these are sticky
pistons<00:03:19.040> as<00:03:19.160> well<00:03:19.400> so<00:03:20.060> when<00:03:20.359> people<00:03:20.660> step<00:03:20.870> on

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
pistons as well so when people step on

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.990 
pistons as well so when people step on
the<00:03:21.290> pressure<00:03:21.500> plate<00:03:21.650> these<00:03:22.250> come<00:03:22.549> down<00:03:22.730> and

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
the pressure plate these come down and

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.800 
the pressure plate these come down and
these<00:03:23.810> come<00:03:24.109> up<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:25.030> so<00:03:26.030> yeah<00:03:26.329> that<00:03:26.600> makes

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
these come up and so yeah that makes

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.520 
these come up and so yeah that makes
that<00:03:27.049> you<00:03:27.620> like<00:03:27.829> the<00:03:27.980> easy<00:03:28.099> easier<00:03:28.790> there<00:03:29.060> and

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
that you like the easy easier there and

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.940 
that you like the easy easier there and
so<00:03:30.530> coming<00:03:31.099> even<00:03:31.280> further<00:03:31.639> up<00:03:32.000> up<00:03:32.329> up<00:03:32.799> we<00:03:33.799> have

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
so coming even further up up up we have

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.339 
so coming even further up up up we have
one<00:03:34.190> of<00:03:34.280> these<00:03:34.340> turn<00:03:34.760> off<00:03:34.940> switches<00:03:35.420> so<00:03:36.109> what<00:03:36.319> I

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
one of these turn off switches so what I

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.140 
one of these turn off switches so what I
mean<00:03:36.500> by<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:36.769> is<00:03:36.980> when<00:03:37.400> there's<00:03:37.579> no<00:03:37.670> signal

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
mean by that is when there's no signal

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.640 
mean by that is when there's no signal
going<00:03:38.389> into<00:03:38.569> that<00:03:38.660> right<00:03:38.810> toward<00:03:39.109> when<00:03:39.530> there

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
going into that right toward when there

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.819 
going into that right toward when there
is<00:03:39.739> a<00:03:39.769> signal<00:03:40.220> going<00:03:40.430> into<00:03:40.669> that<00:03:40.790> redstone<00:03:41.829> not

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
is a signal going into that redstone not

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.640 
is a signal going into that redstone not
redstone<00:03:43.250> that<00:03:43.900> red<00:03:44.900> torch<00:03:45.230> right<00:03:45.440> now

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
redstone that red torch right now

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.800 
redstone that red torch right now
redstone<00:03:45.950> torch<00:03:46.160> right<00:03:46.280> there<00:03:46.489> it's<00:03:47.299> on<00:03:47.540> and

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
redstone torch right there it's on and

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.680 
redstone torch right there it's on and
when<00:03:47.989> it's<00:03:48.109> on<00:03:48.730> these<00:03:49.730> sticky<00:03:50.090> pistons<00:03:50.510> all

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
when it's on these sticky pistons all

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.370 
when it's on these sticky pistons all
these<00:03:50.930> are<00:03:51.169> placed<00:03:51.440> on<00:03:51.650> words<00:03:52.010> are<00:03:52.280> on<00:03:52.819> and

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
these are placed on words are on and

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.659 
these are placed on words are on and
when<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:54.530> signal<00:03:54.709> goes<00:03:55.040> through<00:03:55.280> them<00:03:55.400> they

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
when the signal goes through them they

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.759 
when the signal goes through them they
get<00:03:55.819> pulled<00:03:56.090> away<00:03:56.209> so<00:03:56.780> that<00:03:56.810> pulling<00:03:57.349> away<00:03:57.470> is

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
get pulled away so that pulling away is

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.589 
get pulled away so that pulling away is
actually<00:03:58.069> what<00:03:58.190> sets<00:03:58.489> off<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.730> lava<00:03:59.239> chain

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
actually what sets off the lava chain

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.199 
actually what sets off the lava chain
reaction<00:04:00.049> here<00:04:00.319> let<00:04:01.130> me<00:04:01.220> under<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.849> signal

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
reaction here let me under the signal

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.620 
reaction here let me under the signal
and<00:04:02.440> so<00:04:03.459> I'll<00:04:04.459> do<00:04:04.609> it<00:04:04.730> with<00:04:04.790> water<00:04:05.060> cuz<00:04:05.329> waters

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
and so I'll do it with water cuz waters

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.110 
and so I'll do it with water cuz waters
a<00:04:05.690> little<00:04:05.810> bit<00:04:06.019> easier<00:04:06.560> yeah<00:04:06.910> now<00:04:07.910> I'll<00:04:08.000> just

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
a little bit easier yeah now I'll just

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.190 
a little bit easier yeah now I'll just
do<00:04:08.239> a<00:04:08.269> blah<00:04:08.480> blah<00:04:08.630> whatever<00:04:08.840> screw<00:04:09.709> it<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:11.540> so

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
do a blah blah whatever screw it and so

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.420 
do a blah blah whatever screw it and so
yeah<00:04:12.799> a<00:04:12.829> lot<00:04:13.069> of<00:04:13.190> it<00:04:13.280> goes<00:04:13.430> right<00:04:13.700> here<00:04:13.730> and

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
yeah a lot of it goes right here and

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.039 
yeah a lot of it goes right here and
yeah<00:04:16.430> so<00:04:16.789> when<00:04:16.970> this<00:04:17.120> someone<00:04:17.539> steps<00:04:17.840> on<00:04:18.019> it

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
yeah so when this someone steps on it

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.379 
yeah so when this someone steps on it
you<00:04:18.979> can

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
you can

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.589 
you can
happens<00:04:19.870> these<00:04:20.439> pistons<00:04:21.400> pull<00:04:21.759> back<00:04:22.090> you

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
happens these pistons pull back you

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:23.850 
happens these pistons pull back you
don't<00:04:22.780> meet<00:04:22.960> you<00:04:23.169> don't<00:04:23.319> really<00:04:23.469> need<00:04:23.650> all

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
don't meet you don't really need all

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.080 
don't meet you don't really need all
these<00:04:23.979> Pistons<00:04:24.340> I<00:04:24.430> have<00:04:24.550> I<00:04:24.580> just<00:04:24.729> had<00:04:24.999> this

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
these Pistons I have I just had this

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.580 
these Pistons I have I just had this
because<00:04:25.300> it<00:04:25.389> looks<00:04:25.569> better<00:04:25.749> personally<00:04:26.379> and

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
because it looks better personally and

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.869 
because it looks better personally and
you<00:04:27.370> really<00:04:27.909> don't<00:04:28.029> need<00:04:28.889> these<00:04:29.889> two<00:04:30.310> at<00:04:30.580> all

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:30.879 
you really don't need these two at all

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.689 
you really don't need these two at all
they<00:04:31.419> or<00:04:31.629> even<00:04:32.169> this<00:04:32.289> third<00:04:32.590> one<00:04:32.770> for<00:04:33.580> that

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
they or even this third one for that

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.010 
they or even this third one for that
matter<00:04:33.759> but<00:04:33.999> I<00:04:34.150> think<00:04:34.419> it<00:04:34.509> just<00:04:34.599> looks<00:04:34.810> better

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
matter but I think it just looks better

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.929 
matter but I think it just looks better
because<00:04:35.349> the<00:04:35.529> balance<00:04:35.889> knife<00:04:36.129> the<00:04:36.340> ability<00:04:36.699> to

00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:36.939 
because the balance knife the ability to

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:38.700 
because the balance knife the ability to
be<00:04:37.120> something<00:04:37.330> creative<00:04:37.810> obviously<00:04:38.650> if

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
be something creative obviously if

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.519 
be something creative obviously if
you're<00:04:38.770> doing<00:04:38.919> this<00:04:38.979> in<00:04:39.129> a<00:04:39.189> survival<00:04:40.439> you<00:04:41.439> know

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:41.529 
you're doing this in a survival you know

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:45.179 
you're doing this in a survival you know
PvP<00:04:41.949> match<00:04:42.189> type<00:04:43.150> arena<00:04:43.479> thing<00:04:43.979> then<00:04:44.979> you're

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:51.189 
which is one two three four five on each

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:53.309 
which is one two three four five on each
side<00:04:51.789> I<00:04:52.029> mean<00:04:52.330> on<00:04:52.449> one<00:04:52.659> side<00:04:52.870> you<00:04:52.990> don't<00:04:53.020> have

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319 
side I mean on one side you don't have

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.760 
side I mean on one side you don't have
you<00:04:53.500> wouldn't<00:04:53.710> even<00:04:53.770> need<00:04:54.009> these<00:04:54.279> and<00:04:55.770> so

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
you wouldn't even need these and so

you wouldn't even need these and so
watch<00:04:56.949> I'll<00:04:57.129> just<00:04:57.340> to<00:04:57.430> show<00:04:57.580> you<00:04:57.610> that<00:04:57.699> you

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:57.909 
watch I'll just to show you that you

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:01.200 
watch I'll just to show you that you
really<00:04:58.210> don't<00:04:58.360> need<00:04:58.569> any<00:04:58.900> of<00:04:59.680> these<00:05:00.129> or<00:05:00.550> any<00:05:00.969> of

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
really don't need any of these or any of

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.860 
really don't need any of these or any of
this<00:05:01.360> redstone<00:05:01.689> up<00:05:02.139> to<00:05:02.590> this<00:05:02.710> point<00:05:02.979> so<00:05:03.870> watch

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
this redstone up to this point so watch

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.369 
this redstone up to this point so watch
same<00:05:05.319> thing<00:05:05.860> will<00:05:06.069> happen<00:05:06.099> here<00:05:07.199> when<00:05:08.199> this

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
same thing will happen here when this

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.809 
same thing will happen here when this
goes<00:05:08.620> on<00:05:08.860> gets<00:05:09.520> pulled<00:05:09.789> away<00:05:09.909> lava<00:05:10.449> drops<00:05:11.020> and

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:11.819 
goes on gets pulled away lava drops and

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:15.119 
goes on gets pulled away lava drops and
person<00:05:12.819> under<00:05:13.150> here<00:05:13.479> dies<00:05:13.870> in<00:05:14.229> a<00:05:14.469> terrible

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.129 
person under here dies in a terrible

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.730 
person under here dies in a terrible
burning<00:05:16.060> death<00:05:16.889> and<00:05:18.060> so<00:05:19.060> yeah<00:05:19.389> guys<00:05:19.629> that's

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
burning death and so yeah guys that's

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.839 
burning death and so yeah guys that's
basically<00:05:20.740> it's<00:05:21.129> a<00:05:21.219> little<00:05:21.400> more<00:05:21.520> complicated

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
basically it's a little more complicated

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.179 
basically it's a little more complicated
my<00:05:22.150> usual<00:05:22.449> ones<00:05:22.569> I<00:05:22.659> hope<00:05:22.839> I<00:05:23.020> kind<00:05:23.770> of<00:05:23.830> kept<00:05:24.069> this

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:24.189 
my usual ones I hope I kind of kept this

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:26.909 
my usual ones I hope I kind of kept this
short<00:05:24.490> trying<00:05:25.180> to<00:05:25.300> explain<00:05:25.930> to<00:05:25.990> you<00:05:26.229> some<00:05:26.889> of

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
short trying to explain to you some of

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.850 
short trying to explain to you some of
my<00:05:27.039> old<00:05:27.219> concepts<00:05:27.699> like<00:05:28.259> you<00:05:29.259> know<00:05:29.379> I<00:05:29.409> by<00:05:29.800> the

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
my old concepts like you know I by the

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:30.809 
my old concepts like you know I by the
time<00:05:29.949> if<00:05:30.219> you've<00:05:30.339> been<00:05:30.430> watching<00:05:30.580> my<00:05:30.789> videos

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819 
time if you've been watching my videos

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:32.159 
time if you've been watching my videos
for<00:05:31.150> a<00:05:31.180> while<00:05:31.210> you<00:05:31.449> understand<00:05:31.930> how<00:05:32.050> this

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
for a while you understand how this

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.679 
for a while you understand how this
works<00:05:32.469> that<00:05:33.039> you<00:05:33.129> need<00:05:33.250> to<00:05:33.339> go<00:05:33.430> to<00:05:33.490> over<00:05:34.150> up<00:05:34.330> one

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:34.689 
works that you need to go to over up one

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:37.200 
works that you need to go to over up one
you<00:05:34.930> can't<00:05:35.169> you<00:05:35.589> can't<00:05:35.830> just<00:05:36.339> have<00:05:36.849> it<00:05:37.060> go

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
you can't you can't just have it go

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.990 
you can't you can't just have it go
directly<00:05:37.779> up<00:05:37.899> from<00:05:38.289> here<00:05:38.620> this<00:05:39.580> won't<00:05:39.759> work

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
directly up from here this won't work

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.999 
directly up from here this won't work
this<00:05:40.810> will<00:05:41.020> not<00:05:41.199> work<00:05:41.259> right<00:05:41.589> here<00:05:41.770> what<00:05:41.919> I'm

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:42.009 
this will not work right here what I'm

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:47.040 
this will not work right here what I'm
doing<00:05:42.189> here<00:05:42.370> watch<00:05:44.699> this<00:05:45.699> when<00:05:46.360> I<00:05:46.719> put<00:05:47.020> a

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
doing here watch this when I put a

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.740 
doing here watch this when I put a
signal<00:05:47.500> here<00:05:48.310> that's<00:05:49.210> not<00:05:49.360> going<00:05:49.479> to<00:05:49.569> turn<00:05:49.719> off

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
signal here that's not going to turn off

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.809 
signal here that's not going to turn off
and<00:05:50.110> it<00:05:50.469> has<00:05:50.620> to<00:05:50.649> be<00:05:50.889> going<00:05:51.159> in<00:05:51.250> the<00:05:51.339> same

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:51.819 
and it has to be going in the same

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:52.950 
and it has to be going in the same
direction<00:05:51.879> that<00:05:52.270> you<00:05:52.360> want<00:05:52.389> for<00:05:52.750> two

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
direction that you want for two

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.139 
direction that you want for two
