00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.950
 the practice is coming a moment very 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.930
 good for colombia the economy is 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.820
 improving the security issue is 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.180
 improving foreign investment 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.250
 is also growing in colombia and everything 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.439
 this causes demand to grow in the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.869
 As demand grows, the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.919
 offer in some way also has 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.869
 to be given to be able to satisfy all 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.460
 this amount passengers who are that 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.130
 they are mobilizing between Colombia 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.930
 europe and the rest of the world is there 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.940
 when we started to study the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.199
 possibility of increasing the number of 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.480
 frequencies however the agreement 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.269
 bilateral between Colombia and France not 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.649
 allows us more frequencies because 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.809
 is how it is subscribed and it would have to be 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.429
 sit down and check it then it was when 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.890
 we begin to contemplate the possibility 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.240
 to bring the other product colombia the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.130
 product klm 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.080
 and we came to the conclusion that it was the 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:03.820
 better option because the product of klm 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:06.910
 offers us new routes new network of 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.410
 destinations where to get to another 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.450
 airport that is the ski airport 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.300
 in amsterdam 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.790
 another product that is klm and with the 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.170
 arrival of klm because we say no 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.330
 we're just going to get to Bogota yes 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.250
 but we 're going to touch two destinations in 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.390
 colombia we will be in bogota and in 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.860
 cali 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.690
 the fact that we are 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.370
 complemented with air operation 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.409
 france is very important we go 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.670
 to offer combines tariff skill 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.070
 This means that the passenger 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.470
 can go with klm and come back with air 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.659
 france or vice versa the fact that 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.270
 let's have 2 jab in europe is also 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.790
 very important factor because having the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.869
 amsterdam team hub and the hub of 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.820
 Charles de Gaulle in Paris there is already a 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.460
 airlift between the two cities that 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.409
 allows a passenger if he can not 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.840
 move a destination on one side have 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.250
 the option of the other hop and vice versa 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.530
 same if you are having with air france 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.970
 then you have the option of both house and 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.680
 this causes our network to double 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.320
 this flight that is going to get electric 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.850
 Colombian at the inaugural will arrive 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.360
 with the new product with the new 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.430
 business class cabin with the new 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.210
 economic chain business chain 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.720
 class will offer seats that are full 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.670
 flat seeds that will recline 180 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.820
 degrees on that flight then it's going to go for 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.780
 come the president of the company 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:33.570
 precisely because of something of a 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.850
 a stage and an event as 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.870
 important as the arrival of klm to 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.599
 colombia after so long 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.830
 and we are going to start the operation with a 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:49.629
 plane type boeing triple 7 200 that has 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.610
 capacity for 318 passengers and therefore the 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.420
 fact of being able to combine Bogota with Cali 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.069
 It's going to be great because Cali is 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.099
 giving a very important ingredient that 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.950
 he does not give it to Bogota and it's the fact 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.920
 have better conditions 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.100
 operational I mean I qualified for 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.640
 to be 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.170
 a shorter one with respect to the closer 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.850
 at sea ​​level 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.290
 we have less weight restriction and 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.410
 balance that means we can 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.910
 leave cali full of cargo passengers and 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.530
 fuel to make a long flight 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.530
 hole as is the flight cal and amsterdam
