two levels down the road oh but I

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.529 
two levels down the road oh but I

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
thought it was so cool at this point in

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.729 
thought it was so cool at this point in
the<00:00:57.600> game<00:00:57.629> when<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.930> did<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.289> when<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.500> hadn't

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the game when I did it when I hadn't

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.139 
the game when I did it when I hadn't
been<00:00:58.829> taught<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.070> yet<00:00:59.489> not<00:00:59.699> telling<00:01:00.059> it

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
been taught that yet not telling it

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.990 
been taught that yet not telling it
manually<00:01:00.870> yeah<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.309> think<00:01:02.370> there's<00:01:02.670> even<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
manually yeah and I think there's even a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.520 
manually yeah and I think there's even a
multiplayer<00:01:03.480> achievement<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.080> doing<00:01:04.379> that

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
multiplayer achievement for doing that

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.770 
multiplayer achievement for doing that
that's<00:01:05.100> hilarious<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:06.150> doing<00:01:06.360> like<00:01:06.420> five
