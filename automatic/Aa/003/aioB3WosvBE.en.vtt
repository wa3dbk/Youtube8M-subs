00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.610
 yes hello together with another one 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.350
 block here on the channel and the last 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.570
 video has arrived really well as 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.390
 said there was a small raffle the 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.300
 question was how many bird spiders are 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.520
 here in a room and I have definitely 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.669
 100 entries got so right 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.829
 exactly many and two people when exactly 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.180
 the right number is also very appreciated 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.669
 many but a bit the active work 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.930
 I watched normal blogs 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.460
 got a few long messages 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.730
 we have a lot of fun made the 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.230
 to read all things and good ones 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.670
 the people actually do things 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.290
 I believe if I'm right 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.880
 remind the two people how exactly that 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.860
 We have estimated the correct number 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.180
 actually guessed and the people the 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.960
 the goods have been researched 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.910
 all 1 2 or 3 further less 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.520
 or too much appreciated so it was real 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.600
 really close and I arrive well and me 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.640

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.640
 need a little time for the things 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.990
 to build has to collect the questions where 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.520
 we can give away something and I like it 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.159

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:37.920
 Although that is acceptable 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:41.170
 Too thick end to the traffic 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.140

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.910

 that really funny steak 05 can do that 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.450
 leaving is not the fastest 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.520
 comeback but we can turn the opponent in 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.400
 the above makes defeat tokens or 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.160
