00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
that for the moment I think there might

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.020 
that for the moment I think there might
be<00:03:46.440> one<00:03:46.680> forget<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.070> plum<00:03:47.340> rings<00:03:47.549> have<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.790> look

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
be one forget the plum rings have a look

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.580

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
at but you know hey home and most of

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.099 
at but you know hey home and most of
wood<00:03:52.769> panel<00:03:53.130> effect<00:03:53.190> on<00:03:53.640> up<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.060> top<00:03:54.269> so<00:03:54.870> I

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
wood panel effect on up the top so I

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.259
