00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
of surfboard I think it's just the

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.630 
of surfboard I think it's just the
sensation<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.719> riding<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.860> wave<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.219> which<00:00:47.370> is

what<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.660> beautiful<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.200> think<00:00:49.410> what

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
what is so beautiful and I think what

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.040 
what is so beautiful and I think what
people<00:00:50.460> get<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.730> addicted<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.570> know<00:00:51.899> no

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
people get so addicted to so you know no

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.380 
people get so addicted to so you know no
matter<00:00:52.219> how<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.699> or<00:00:53.820> where<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.270> it

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
matter how you do it or where you do it

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.939 
matter how you do it or where you do it
or<00:00:54.480> why<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.660> do<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.320> think<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:55.800> that

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
or why you do it it's I think just that

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.229 
or why you do it it's I think just that
feeling<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.340> somebody<00:00:56.730> gets<00:00:56.940> when<00:00:57.120> they

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
feeling that somebody gets when they

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.959 
feeling that somebody gets when they
first<00:00:57.480> do<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.989> they<00:00:58.340> they<00:00:59.340> become<00:00:59.670> so<00:00:59.879> in

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
first do it that they they become so in

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.689 
first do it that they they become so in
love<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:00.329> surfing<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.350> they<00:01:01.469> find<00:01:02.399> waves

and they find like ways to do it
anywhere<00:01:05.189> that's<00:01:05.400> why<00:01:05.549> I'm<00:01:06.330> sure<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> first

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
anywhere that's why I'm sure the first

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.359

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
sort of like I guess in a lot of ways

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.370 
sort of like I guess in a lot of ways
it's<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:21.360> could<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.659> considered<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
it's it could be considered like the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.020 
it's it could be considered like the
backdrop<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> lot<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.490> surf<00:01:23.640> movies

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
backdrop of like a lot of surf movies

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.880 
backdrop of like a lot of surf movies
you<00:01:24.540> know<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.840> back<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.380> day<00:01:25.590> they<00:01:25.770> would

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
you know like back in the day they would

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.090 
you know like back in the day they would

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
just have 16 millimeter or just certain

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.950 
just have 16 millimeter or just certain
kind<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.369> film<00:01:29.640> i<00:01:29.820> think<00:01:30.000> all<00:01:30.180> surf<00:01:30.420> movies<00:01:30.810> in

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
kind of film i think all surf movies in

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.780 
kind of film i think all surf movies in
general<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:32.040> music<00:01:32.400> that's<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
general the music that's in the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.280 
general the music that's in the
background<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.509> what<00:01:33.659> sets<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.110> tone

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
background is really what sets the tone

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.770 
background is really what sets the tone
and<00:01:34.560> sets<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> mood<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:36.299> image<00:01:36.570> that's

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
and sets the mood of the image that's

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.950 
and sets the mood of the image that's
happening<00:01:37.229> whether<00:01:37.829> it's<00:01:38.040> dramatic<00:01:38.579> or<00:01:38.960> slow

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
happening whether it's dramatic or slow

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.340 
happening whether it's dramatic or slow
mo<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.439> moody<00:01:40.710> or<00:01:40.920> whatever<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.460> then<00:01:42.350> you

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
mo and moody or whatever and then you

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.690 
mo and moody or whatever and then you
know<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.470> think<00:01:43.560> music<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.220> thing<00:01:44.490> where

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
know I think music is a thing where

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.910

like when you go out and surf you always

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.210 
like when you go out and surf you always
you're<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:48.750> friends<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.500> travel<00:01:49.979> and
