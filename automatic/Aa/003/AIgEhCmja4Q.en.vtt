00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
well I have an interesting theory now

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.499 
well I have an interesting theory now
it's<00:00:10.440> probably<00:00:10.800> wrong<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.179> just

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
it's probably wrong and this is just

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.230 
it's probably wrong and this is just
speculation<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:13.590> take<00:00:14.219> all<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.490> this<00:00:14.820> with<00:00:15.059> a

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
speculation so take all of this with a

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.300 
speculation so take all of this with a
grain<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.509> salt<00:00:15.630> like<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.260> said<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.010> pure

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
grain of salt like I said this is pure

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.599 
grain of salt like I said this is pure
speculation<00:00:17.510> so<00:00:18.510> don't<00:00:19.289> get<00:00:19.380> mad<00:00:19.590> at<00:00:19.949> me<00:00:20.340> if

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
speculation so don't get mad at me if

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.880 
speculation so don't get mad at me if
like<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.510> ends<00:00:22.109> up<00:00:22.199> being<00:00:22.260> told<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.710> leave

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
off and wrong and all that now with that

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.040

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.919 
take away from this interview is that
they<00:02:04.920> won't<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.220> seeing<00:02:05.429> a<00:02:05.520> new<00:02:05.789> game<00:02:06.119> anytime

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
they won't be seeing a new game anytime

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.380 
they won't be seeing a new game anytime
soon<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.799> when<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.280> look<00:02:08.459> at<00:02:08.550> da<00:02:08.729> con<00:02:08.970> dog<00:02:09.149> and

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
soon and when you look at da con dog and

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.300 
soon and when you look at da con dog and
his<00:02:09.539> friend<00:02:09.869> they<00:02:10.470> haven't<00:02:10.860> had<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> game<00:02:11.280> in

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
his friend they haven't had a game in

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.250 
his friend they haven't had a game in
years<00:02:11.940> could<00:02:12.420> they<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.599> getting<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.959> new<00:02:13.050> game

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
years could they be getting a new game

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.229 
years could they be getting a new game
soon<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:13.890> know<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.670> could<00:02:14.910> just<00:02:15.090> be

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
soon and I know this could just be

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.089 
soon and I know this could just be
because<00:02:15.269> duck<00:02:15.720> hunt<00:02:15.959> is<00:02:16.140> more<00:02:16.590> iconic<00:02:16.709> than

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
because duck hunt is more iconic than

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.410 
because duck hunt is more iconic than
ice<00:02:17.400> climber<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:17.849> what<00:02:18.120> if<00:02:18.209> they're<00:02:18.390> a

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
ice climber so what if they're a

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.780 
ice climber so what if they're a
priority<00:02:19.290> because<00:02:19.440> there's<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.069> new<00:02:20.340> duck<00:02:20.580> hunt

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
priority because there's a new duck hunt

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.850 
priority because there's a new duck hunt
game<00:02:21.000> being<00:02:21.209> made<00:02:21.480> soon<00:02:21.750> but<00:02:22.019> who<00:02:22.530> would<00:02:22.650> make

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
game being made soon but who would make

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.610 
game being made soon but who would make
it<00:02:23.069> I<00:02:23.220> mean<00:02:23.849> if<00:02:24.090> Sakurai<00:02:24.720> plants<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.319> reviving

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
it I mean if Sakurai plants on reviving

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.250 
it I mean if Sakurai plants on reviving
a<00:02:25.860> franchise<00:02:26.340> then<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:27.569> one<00:02:27.780> would<00:02:28.049> make

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
a franchise then this one would make

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.380 
a franchise then this one would make
sense<00:02:28.650> since<00:02:28.890> really<00:02:29.849> out<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.000> all<00:02:30.209> the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
sense since really out of all the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.990 
sense since really out of all the
characters<00:02:30.540> in<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.170> smash<00:02:31.380> 4<00:02:31.590> roster<00:02:32.010> con<00:02:32.459> dog

is<00:02:33.299> really<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.660> only<00:02:33.810> one<00:02:34.049> who<00:02:34.200> hasn't<00:02:34.410> seen<00:02:34.560> a

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
is really the only one who hasn't seen a

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.830 
is really the only one who hasn't seen a
game<00:02:34.799> in<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.010> while<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.599> would<00:02:36.720> make

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
game in a while and that it would make

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.660 
game in a while and that it would make
total<00:02:37.140> sense<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.440> Sakurai<00:02:37.769> revived<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.340> but

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
total sense of Sakurai revived it but

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.550 
total sense of Sakurai revived it but
what<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:38.910> retro<00:02:39.390> was<00:02:39.569> working<00:02:39.870> on<00:02:40.019> it<00:02:40.170> now

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
what if retro was working on it now

have<00:03:22.769> so<00:03:23.190> much<00:03:23.340> personality<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:24.239> they

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
have so much personality and they

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.530 
have so much personality and they
definitely<00:03:24.900> deserve<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.530> revival<00:03:26.130> now<00:03:26.730> Sakurai

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
definitely deserve a revival now Sakurai

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.449 
definitely deserve a revival now Sakurai
could<00:03:27.840> make<00:03:28.049> this<00:03:28.260> but<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.680> feel<00:03:28.799> like<00:03:28.920> retro<00:03:29.160> is

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
could make this but I feel like retro is

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.879 
could make this but I feel like retro is
more<00:03:29.639> qualified<00:03:30.269> duck<00:03:30.870> on<00:03:31.049> strikes<00:03:31.410> me<00:03:31.620> as

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
more qualified duck on strikes me as

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.069 
more qualified duck on strikes me as
more<00:03:32.220> of<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.400> franchise<00:03:32.609> that<00:03:32.880> western<00:03:33.480> studio

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
more of a franchise that western studio

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.530 
more of a franchise that western studio
should<00:03:34.319> be<00:03:34.440> handling<00:03:34.889> or<00:03:35.430> what<00:03:35.910> if<00:03:36.000> Sakurai's

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
should be handling or what if Sakurai's

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.780 
should be handling or what if Sakurai's
or<00:03:36.959> in<00:03:37.170> retro<00:03:37.440> studios<00:03:37.859> collaborated<00:03:38.489> on<00:03:38.579> this

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
or in retro studios collaborated on this

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.330 
or in retro studios collaborated on this
yeah<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.299> is<00:03:39.480> kind<00:03:40.049> of<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.380> crazy<00:03:40.590> theory<00:03:41.040> and

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
yeah this is kind of a crazy theory and

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.309 
yeah this is kind of a crazy theory and
it's<00:03:41.910> probably<00:03:42.120> wrong<00:03:42.359> but<00:03:42.599> like<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.049> said<00:03:43.230> at

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
it's probably wrong but like I said at

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.870 
it's probably wrong but like I said at
the<00:03:43.410> beginning<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.739> this<00:03:43.859> video<00:03:44.040> it's<00:03:44.730> just

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
the beginning of this video it's just
