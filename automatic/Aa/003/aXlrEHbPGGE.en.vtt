00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.740
 hello my name is séverine meslif 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.779
 I created an equestrian center in Montceau 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.259
 it's okay with my husband and I invite you to 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.259
 come visit it 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.360
 we have always wanted to 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.489
 to settle down you do not really want to 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.160
 to work for others we had 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.070
 some waste did not last 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.600
 we did not like it so we 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.290
 peers is a sector and in view this 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.760
 farm more or less disused for sale 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.860
 and he told us why do not you 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.989
 it was an opportunity to settle in 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.730
 the region 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.840
 but there was nothing there is a farm at 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.210
 abandonment 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.610
 do not love me the house was dismounted 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.129
 two are in progress and then everything else 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.129
 little by little he decided to settle down 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.840
 anyway what makes us move forward I 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.820
 think it's the pressure what if we 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.680
 is not passionate I think that when 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.890
 we see the job to be done 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.200
 reduced the pros but no we always 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.480
 been passionate that's really what he 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.240
 we like it but hey someone who is 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.890
 not in the middle can not understand 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.950
 it's really we think this golden ball 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.960
 horse we go on vacation maybe 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.280
 what once a year and again this 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.470
 year we will not leave because we had 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.300
 big fees on our truck but 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.300
 otherwise it's all the time I 'm going 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.470
 in the us and we own it 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.810
 in fact they are entrusted to us a lot 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.830
 of teenagers who surrounded him over fire 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.030
 do not have time to come the week 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.550
 and every two days the competition does not 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.320
 never counted in my opinion in 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.090
 9.77 are quite a few owners 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.160
 also a whole is not mine after 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.290
 for the club there is taking a good 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.400
 Twenty ponies a dozen 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:14.500
 horses does that they only serve 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:17.800
 instruction one to 260 members of two 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.239
 years and a half since the firm anyway 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.070
 it is the instruction that gives life to the 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.220
 club one eponymous is what is more 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.220
 profitable 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.530
 I was always lifted the city in 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.480
 his arms when you arrive and here 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.790
 it was a little small but I want to tony 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.890
 to say we liked it so I got 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.299
 quite suitable and it's true that 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.799
 it's another quality now 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.689
 I would not return to live in 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.000
 city ​​as the passion of the horse we 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.780
 bring to the companion but you have 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.219
 still a better quality of life 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.569
 yes, if it's the city ​​we dreamed about 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:51.090
 because we are like we live from our 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.859
 passion that we are 200% with the choice 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.109
 in the morning scares but on the other hand it is 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.879
 very hard physically you have to say it's 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.010
 Monday to Sunday evening 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.200
 it's non-stop we ask 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.269
 days to it was finished most 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.010
 time it's 21h to yes it's a 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.659
 passion back if not I think he 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.659
 understands that we would have stopped
