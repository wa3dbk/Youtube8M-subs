originally start off with probably about

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.699 
originally start off with probably about
460<00:03:19.370> horsepower<00:03:21.100> 580<00:03:22.100> horsepower<00:03:22.370> holy<00:03:23.150> cow

custom exhaust all the way back catters
now<00:03:27.709> you<00:03:27.769> say<00:03:28.010> custom<00:03:28.459> is<00:03:28.580> this<00:03:28.760> thing

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
now you say custom is this thing

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.720 
now you say custom is this thing
full-blown<00:03:29.330> custom<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:29.840> begin<00:03:30.080> with<00:03:30.340> yeah<00:03:31.400> and

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
full-blown custom to begin with yeah and

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.520 
full-blown custom to begin with yeah and
so<00:03:31.910> then<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:32.180> wanted<00:03:32.450> even<00:03:32.540> more<00:03:32.720> custom<00:03:33.350> than

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
so then you wanted even more custom than

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.550 
so then you wanted even more custom than
that<00:03:33.709> it's<00:03:34.370> above<00:03:34.640> and<00:03:34.850> beyond<00:03:35.120> Wow<00:03:35.780> dude<00:03:36.200> how
