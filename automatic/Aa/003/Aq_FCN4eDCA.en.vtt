00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.559
 are born I dedicate the portability to it 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.620
 etc to explode some cannoncino with 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.290
 an absolutely unnatural movement 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.710
 which keeps martos attached to the legs 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.510
 marco marco frigatti here it is 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.769
 actually it is heating up 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.769
 [Music] 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.980
 marco impasto, please say le 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.810
 rules of this report this record 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.610
 consists in blowing up as already 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.519
 explained the largest number of balloons 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.300
 just using your back in a minute 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.760
 used you will have to arch your back 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.129
 backwards and so raee sit in 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.960
 substance the minimum to establish this 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.379
 new guinness world record of 10 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.409
 burst balloons here that gentleman 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:56.680
 what you see near marco prayed 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:01:01.030
 subsisting lorenzo with the face we are 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:05.379
 quite serious and isolated husband 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.270
 will be his assistant who asked her 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.930
 that he was allowed to pass i 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:14.700
 balloons this is the way it dates 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:18.299
 tax watch look really 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.299
 impressive ease 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.859
 and does it 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.240
 Fundamental places the movements in 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.420
 average facts to the guy has to warm up the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.460
 spine that muscles 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.870
 involved in this cooperation 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.340
 of Ischia 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.650
 always watch almost not having the plug 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.840
 dorsal to an elasticity where it was 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.840
 unbelievable 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.700
 the atavistic and credible comes from 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.829
 artistic gymnastics 5 I liked ha 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.899
 studied trained in the early years 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:58.850
 of the million strength that the country has 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:04.549
 important traditions in these two that 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:06.850
 is already aiming for the last few 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.780
 stretching exercises to be ready 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:14.530
 to his test and ata on itself 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.239
 let's learn in this position 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.470
 will try to break the record of the major 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.810
 number of burst balloons stands 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.240
 removing shoes with prefectures 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:33.000
 must have maximum support 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:35.670
 in short, we are a normal thing 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.600
 we ask for the assistance you are preparing to 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.600
 write the ball 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.430
 [Music] 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:54.319
 we really see it as truly unsightly 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:56.870
 why does it and something rubber thought 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.930
 on the back then played in March has 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.549
 I believe he used an ointment 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:08.109
 had a slight stretch in the days 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:08.109
 past during we are ready for yesterday 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.340
 second again 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.130
 this is the position taken by the 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.260
 starting position of a typical one 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.069
 positions taken 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.220
 the test started in installments as it pushes the 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.980
 ball but the hotel part and the 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.739
 lower back bends over if 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.590
 itself the most stressed area and that the 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.270
 central one just above the part 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.459
 lumbar area still in need 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.950
 of most here is this the most phase 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.840
 difficult and dangerous explained to me that 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.910
 not all the balloons recorded the same 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.650
 so the problem is that in the attempt 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.780
 to burst the balloon to push 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.400
 too much and therefore to arrive at a caronda 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.430
 muscle nodiscus 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.299
 or to the skeletal apparatus treated 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.230
 with which show is enabled where there are 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.130
 made of rubber 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.190
 the back 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.930
 explains unhindered and this is a 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.720
 other ball with copy 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:11.520
 is therefore immediately removed I remember 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.520
 nothing even that 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.500
 but for now this previous book of 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.500
 balloons 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.900
 you are living differently on the world that 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.490
 ca n't push brought give in 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.130
 attempt to exploit the ball not 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.460
 must lose shipping 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.260
 [Applause]
