00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
and for other people to connect you need

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.020 
and for other people to connect you need
to<00:01:26.369> give<00:01:26.549> them<00:01:26.900> this<00:01:28.100> port<00:01:29.100> number<00:01:29.189> after<00:01:29.880> your

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
to give them this port number after your

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.969 
to give them this port number after your
IP<00:01:30.240> address<00:01:30.450> let<00:01:31.320> me<00:01:31.380> show<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.590> how<00:01:31.799> that

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
IP address let me show you how that

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.219 
IP address let me show you how that
looks<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:35.700> let's<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.570> say<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.170> is

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
looks so let's just say that this is

looks so let's just say that this is
your<00:01:37.560> IP<00:01:37.740> address<00:01:38.150> by<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.210> way<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.570> don't

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
your IP address by the way if you don't

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.300 
your IP address by the way if you don't
know<00:01:39.840> what<00:01:39.960> your<00:01:40.079> IP<00:01:40.200> address<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:41.159> go<00:01:41.250> to

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
know what your IP address is just go to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.510 
know what your IP address is just go to
see<00:01:41.549> my<00:01:41.700> IP<00:01:42.350> dot-com<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.590> they'll<00:01:44.280> show<00:01:44.460> you

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
see my IP dot-com and they'll show you

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.980 
see my IP dot-com and they'll show you
it<00:01:45.170> okay<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.729> then<00:01:47.729> colon<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.479> then<00:01:48.600> your<00:01:48.780> port

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
it okay so then colon and then your port

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.510 
it okay so then colon and then your port
number<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:50.810> your<00:01:51.810> IP<00:01:52.020> address

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
number so your IP address

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.030 
number so your IP address
colon<00:01:53.549> that's<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.820> colon<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.560> then<00:01:55.560> your<00:01:55.799> port

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
colon that's a colon and then your port

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.240 
colon that's a colon and then your port
number<00:01:57.320> generally<00:01:58.320> your<00:01:58.500> port<00:01:58.710> numbers<00:01:58.979> like

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
number generally your port numbers like

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.450 
number generally your port numbers like
let's<00:02:00.240> see<00:02:00.420> how<00:02:00.570> many<00:02:00.750> digits<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.460> like

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
let's see how many digits is is like

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.020 
let's see how many digits is is like
five<00:02:02.670> digits

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
five digits

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.250 
five digits
doesn't<00:02:05.030> matter<00:02:05.120> though<00:02:05.360> as<00:02:05.900> long<00:02:06.050> as<00:02:06.170> it

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
doesn't matter though as long as it

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.219 
doesn't matter though as long as it
works<00:02:06.729> so<00:02:07.729> yeah<00:02:07.880> that's<00:02:08.660> how<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.810> do<00:02:08.959> it
