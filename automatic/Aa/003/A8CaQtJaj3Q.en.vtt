works<00:00:28.019> for<00:00:28.199> me<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:30.109> because<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.560> took<00:00:31.650> me<00:00:31.859> a

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
works for me and because it took me a

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.139 
works for me and because it took me a
long<00:00:32.040> time<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.460> find<00:00:32.610> something<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:32.940> was

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
probably about half and half or maybe

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.140 
probably about half and half or maybe
two<00:02:22.410> parts<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.010> one<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.430> one<00:02:23.610> part<00:02:23.850> this<00:02:23.970> one

two parts this one to one part this one

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.809 
two parts this one to one part this one
it<00:02:24.270> depends<00:02:24.569> kind<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:25.220> what<00:02:26.220> glory<00:02:26.489> goes<00:02:26.670> I

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
it depends kind of what glory goes I

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.290 
it depends kind of what glory goes I
just<00:02:27.000> stop<00:02:27.239> do<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.630> until<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:29.730> goes<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.090> color

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
just stop do it until it goes the color

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.070 
just stop do it until it goes the color
that<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.540> want<00:02:31.530> for<00:02:31.680> my<00:02:31.800> skin<00:02:32.069> so<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.600> know

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
that I want for my skin so I know

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.840 
that I want for my skin so I know
and<00:02:34.350> then<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.500> shake<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:34.920> for<00:02:35.040> UGS<00:02:35.400> mix<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.730> all

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
and then I shake it for UGS mix it all

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.130 
and then I shake it for UGS mix it all
up<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.480> then<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:38.030> warms<00:02:39.030> into<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.780> kind<00:02:40.019> of

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
up and then it warms into the kind of

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.310 
up and then it warms into the kind of
like<00:02:40.320> this<00:02:40.950> color<00:02:41.660> I'm<00:02:42.660> not<00:02:42.870> sure<00:02:43.050> if<00:02:43.170> that's

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
like this color I'm not sure if that's

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.250 
like this color I'm not sure if that's
really<00:02:43.620> showing<00:02:44.010> up<00:02:44.220> great<00:02:44.519> on<00:02:44.640> camera<00:02:45.260> cuz

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
really showing up great on camera cuz

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.810 
really showing up great on camera cuz
obviously<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.680> can<00:02:46.830> tell<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.130> my<00:02:47.190> face<00:02:47.519> look

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
obviously you can tell that my face look

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.320 
obviously you can tell that my face look
up<00:02:47.970> whiter<00:02:48.239> than<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:49.110> does<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.970> maybe<00:02:51.150> it's

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
up whiter than that does so maybe it's

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.990 
up whiter than that does so maybe it's
just<00:02:51.450> not<00:02:51.630> showing<00:02:51.959> up<00:02:52.050> very<00:02:52.080> well<00:02:52.730> but<00:02:53.730> if<00:02:53.880> I

just kind of do a little swatch there it

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.570

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.640 
that she was just like a stupid employee
or<00:04:00.450> whether<00:04:00.720> they<00:04:00.900> have<00:04:01.109> actually<00:04:01.230> stopped

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
or whether they have actually stopped

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.270 
or whether they have actually stopped
doing<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:01.950> now<00:04:02.070> and<00:04:02.970> w10<00:04:03.450> was<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:04.049> palest<00:04:04.680> one

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
doing it now and w10 was the palest one

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.000 
doing it now and w10 was the palest one
that<00:04:05.489> they<00:04:05.640> did<00:04:06.140> and<00:04:07.140> if<00:04:07.410> they<00:04:07.560> don't<00:04:07.769> do<00:04:07.920> it

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
that they did and if they don't do it

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.530 
that they did and if they don't do it
anymore<00:04:08.190> I<00:04:08.340> think<00:04:08.430> now<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.850> pale<00:04:09.150> explain<00:04:09.419> is

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540

anymore I think now the pale explain is

on top and it will change the colour of
it<00:05:24.639> for<00:05:24.760> some<00:05:24.880> reason<00:05:24.910> -<00:05:25.300> like<00:05:25.419> an<00:05:25.570> orange<00:05:25.930> you

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
it for some reason - like an orange you

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.890 
it for some reason - like an orange you
sort<00:05:26.289> of<00:05:26.410> color<00:05:26.800> and<00:05:27.330> this<00:05:28.330> is<00:05:28.389> actually<00:05:28.810> the

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
sort of color and this is actually the

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.360 
sort of color and this is actually the
only<00:05:28.960> one<00:05:29.110> that<00:05:29.320> I<00:05:29.380> found<00:05:29.620> that<00:05:29.770> doesn't<00:05:30.160> do

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
only one that I found that doesn't do

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.700 
only one that I found that doesn't do
that<00:05:30.520> so<00:05:30.820> this<00:05:31.750> is<00:05:31.810> the<00:05:31.930> power<00:05:32.169> that<00:05:32.260> I<00:05:32.410> always

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
that so this is the power that I always

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.290 
that so this is the power that I always
always<00:05:32.949> use<00:05:33.280> and<00:05:33.520> it's<00:05:33.610> really<00:05:33.789> cheap<00:05:34.000> as<00:05:34.150> well

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
always use and it's really cheap as well

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.540 
always use and it's really cheap as well
it's<00:05:34.419> like<00:05:34.539> $1.99<00:05:35.320> or<00:05:35.530> something<00:05:35.889> it<00:05:36.250> lasts

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
it's like $1.99 or something it lasts

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.250 
it's like $1.99 or something it lasts
quite<00:05:36.760> a<00:05:36.849> while<00:05:36.970> so<00:05:37.210> that's<00:05:37.840> what<00:05:38.020> I<00:05:38.050> always

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
quite a while so that's what I always

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.159 
quite a while so that's what I always
use<00:05:38.970> next<00:05:39.970> one<00:05:40.120> which<00:05:40.330> is<00:05:40.449> really<00:05:40.599> old<00:05:40.840> so<00:05:41.110> it

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
use next one which is really old so it

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.529 
use next one which is really old so it
looks<00:05:41.320> kind<00:05:41.470> of<00:05:41.500> gross<00:05:41.650> I'm<00:05:41.860> sorry<00:05:42.180> again<00:05:43.180> it's

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
looks kind of gross I'm sorry again it's

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.060 
looks kind of gross I'm sorry again it's

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
collection mm and it's called

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.620

color cream for a powder this is really

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.850 
color cream for a powder this is really
really<00:05:50.770> high<00:05:51.010> coverage<00:05:51.900> so<00:05:52.900> usually<00:05:53.620> I'll

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
really high coverage so usually I'll

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.399 
really high coverage so usually I'll
just<00:05:54.310> kind<00:05:54.669> of<00:05:54.789> get<00:05:55.030> it<00:05:55.150> and<00:05:55.330> put<00:05:55.510> it<00:05:55.630> like<00:05:55.810> here

under my eye and on my nose and then

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.000 
under my eye and on my nose and then
that's<00:06:00.669> kind<00:06:00.940> of<00:06:01.000> about<00:06:01.120> it<00:06:01.449> if<00:06:01.840> I<00:06:02.139> want<00:06:02.349> really

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
super like intense high coverage I'm

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.050 
super like intense high coverage I'm
doing<00:06:05.919> something<00:06:06.070> important<00:06:06.699> or<00:06:06.789> whatever

and then I'll put this one on top and

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.950 
and then I'll put this one on top and
then<00:06:15.280> I'll<00:06:15.430> put<00:06:15.669> this<00:06:15.940> one<00:06:16.150> on<00:06:16.180> ours<00:06:16.449> like<00:06:16.690> my

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
then I'll put this one on ours like my

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.100 
then I'll put this one on ours like my
whole<00:06:17.260> face<00:06:17.560> powder<00:06:17.889> and<00:06:18.280> that's<00:06:18.340> just<00:06:18.669> like

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
whole face powder and that's just like

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.200 
whole face powder and that's just like
insanely<00:06:20.110> like<00:06:20.830> crazy<00:06:21.190> high<00:06:21.460> coverage<00:06:21.880> and

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
insanely like crazy high coverage and

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.330 
insanely like crazy high coverage and
but<00:06:22.840> you<00:06:22.930> definitely<00:06:23.169> look<00:06:23.680> a<00:06:23.800> little<00:06:24.070> bit

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
but you definitely look a little bit

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.070 
but you definitely look a little bit
more<00:06:24.520> tan

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
more tan

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.779 
more tan
if<00:06:25.259> you<00:06:25.379> were<00:06:25.500> to<00:06:25.650> use<00:06:25.860> that<00:06:26.220> one<00:06:26.430> and<00:06:26.669> then

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
if you were to use that one and then

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:30.710 
if you were to use that one and then
that<00:06:27.030> one<00:06:27.090> um<00:06:28.490> so<00:06:29.490> yeah<00:06:29.699> that<00:06:30.120> is<00:06:30.270> what<00:06:30.479> I<00:06:30.509> use

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
that one um so yeah that is what I use

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.020 
that one um so yeah that is what I use
for<00:06:31.080> my<00:06:31.289> pale<00:06:31.530> foundation<00:06:31.740> obviously<00:06:32.669> I<00:06:32.699> hope

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
for my pale foundation obviously I hope

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.619 
for my pale foundation obviously I hope
you<00:06:33.180> can<00:06:33.330> tell<00:06:33.479> that<00:06:33.659> I<00:06:33.719> am<00:06:34.129> pretty<00:06:35.129> pale<00:06:35.759> so<00:06:36.599> I

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:36.629 
you can tell that I am pretty pale so I

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:38.679 
you can tell that I am pretty pale so I
can<00:06:36.900> go<00:06:37.259> back<00:06:37.289> a<00:06:37.500> little<00:06:37.740> bit

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:38.689 
can go back a little bit

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:44.119 
can go back a little bit
so<00:06:39.689> I<00:06:39.719> am<00:06:39.900> very<00:06:40.199> pale<00:06:40.680> and<00:06:42.469> it<00:06:43.469> has<00:06:43.680> taken<00:06:43.979> a

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:44.129 
so I am very pale and it has taken a

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:45.499 
so I am very pale and it has taken a
long<00:06:44.340> time<00:06:44.370> to<00:06:44.699> find<00:06:44.849> something<00:06:45.060> that<00:06:45.300> kind<00:06:45.449> of

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:45.509 
long time to find something that kind of

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:47.450 
long time to find something that kind of
matches<00:06:45.689> my<00:06:45.990> skin<00:06:46.259> tone<00:06:46.319> so<00:06:46.590> I<00:06:46.740> hope<00:06:46.949> the<00:06:47.159> trick

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
matches my skin tone so I hope the trick

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.189 
matches my skin tone so I hope the trick
of<00:06:47.639> using<00:06:48.180> this<00:06:48.330> one<00:06:48.569> and<00:06:48.689> mixing<00:06:48.960> it<00:06:49.080> in<00:06:49.169> with

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 
of using this one and mixing it in with

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.230 
of using this one and mixing it in with
stuff<00:06:49.620> helps<00:06:50.069> because<00:06:50.280> it<00:06:50.430> definitely<00:06:51.120> makes

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
stuff helps because it definitely makes

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.879 
stuff helps because it definitely makes
it<00:06:51.389> a<00:06:51.479> lot<00:06:51.900> lot<00:06:52.110> a<00:06:52.139> lot<00:06:52.319> lighter<00:06:52.560> that<00:06:52.830> I

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:52.889 
it a lot lot a lot lighter that I

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:54.200 
it a lot lot a lot lighter that I
couldn't<00:06:53.219> use<00:06:53.400> that<00:06:53.430> on<00:06:53.729> its<00:06:53.849> own<00:06:53.969> without

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
couldn't use that on its own without

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.420 
couldn't use that on its own without
this<00:06:54.509> one<00:06:54.689> so<00:06:55.289> maybe<00:06:55.469> even<00:06:55.800> if<00:06:55.919> you<00:06:56.039> don't<00:06:56.250> use

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
this one so maybe even if you don't use

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.450 
this one so maybe even if you don't use
those<00:06:56.639> foundations<00:06:57.240> just<00:06:57.629> mixing<00:06:58.080> this<00:06:58.460> with

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
those foundations just mixing this with

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.420 
those foundations just mixing this with
those<00:06:59.729> would<00:07:00.240> be<00:07:00.389> a<00:07:00.419> big<00:07:00.629> help<00:07:00.840> to<00:07:00.900> you<00:07:01.139> so<00:07:01.830> yeah
