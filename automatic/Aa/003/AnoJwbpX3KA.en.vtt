00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.630 

what<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.680> do<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.090> pull<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.600> stitch<00:00:30.930> out<00:00:31.200> a

but<00:00:55.300> you<00:00:55.420> never<00:00:56.220> deposit<00:00:57.220> the<00:00:59.100> loose<00:01:00.100> stitch

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:25.660

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:44.490 

I'm<00:01:26.030> going<00:01:26.210> to<00:01:26.270> start<00:01:26.509> knitting<00:01:27.170> normal

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.990 

that<00:01:45.500> tighten<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:45.980> up

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.050 

not<00:01:49.570> any<00:01:49.900> extra<00:01:50.050> looseness<00:01:50.560> in<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.880> whole

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.460 
not any extra looseness in the whole
column<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.790> also<00:01:55.120> when<00:01:55.270> you<00:01:55.390> start<00:01:55.750> on<00:01:56.230> these

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
column and also when you start on these

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.550 
column and also when you start on these
first<00:01:56.680> two<00:01:56.980> stitches<00:01:57.250> you<00:01:57.670> should<00:01:57.850> pull<00:01:58.210> these

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
first two stitches you should pull these

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.130

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
strands tight to take up the looseness

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.730 
strands tight to take up the looseness
from<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.830> next<00:02:03.100> time

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.100 

that's<00:02:06.280> how<00:02:06.490> I<00:02:06.640> avoid<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.920> ladders
