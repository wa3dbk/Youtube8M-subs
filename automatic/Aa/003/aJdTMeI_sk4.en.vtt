that's<00:00:56.190> not<00:00:56.370> optimal<00:00:56.820> when<00:00:56.969> your<00:00:57.090> goal<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.539> to

find an easier cheaper safer way to
clone<00:01:14.490> animals<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.000> they<00:01:15.270> decided<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.840> see<00:01:15.990> if

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
clone animals and they decided to see if

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.109 
clone animals and they decided to see if
white<00:01:16.500> blood<00:01:16.830> cells<00:01:17.189> could<00:01:17.430> work<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.790> they

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
white blood cells could work and they

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.510 
white blood cells could work and they
found<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.540> two<00:01:18.810> types<00:01:19.110> called<00:01:19.740> granulocytes

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520

accurate and as the procedure gets
cheaper<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.570> used<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.869> agriculture<00:01:49.590> so

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
cheaper it can be used in agriculture so

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.649 
cheaper it can be used in agriculture so
a<00:01:50.009> specific<00:01:50.369> line<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.939> cow<00:01:51.149> could<00:01:51.509> be

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
a specific line of cow could be

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.389 
a specific line of cow could be
reproduced<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.409> its<00:01:52.530> beef<00:01:52.710> quality<00:01:53.159> or<00:01:53.280> its

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
reproduced for its beef quality or its

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.100 
reproduced for its beef quality or its
milk<00:01:53.640> yield<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.600> particularly

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
milk yield and this is particularly

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.539 
milk yield and this is particularly
interesting<00:01:55.500> because<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.130> might<00:01:56.310> remember

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
interesting because you might remember

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.030 
interesting because you might remember
that<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.390> couple<00:01:57.600> months<00:01:57.869> ago<00:01:58.049> scientists

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
that just a couple months ago scientists

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.340 
that just a couple months ago scientists
created<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> first<00:01:59.880> cloned<00:02:00.299> human<00:02:00.780> embryo

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
created the first cloned human embryo

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.679 
created the first cloned human embryo
the<00:02:01.829> idea<00:02:02.130> being<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.460> stem<00:02:02.969> cells<00:02:03.270> from<00:02:03.479> that

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the idea being that stem cells from that

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.690 
the idea being that stem cells from that
embryo<00:02:04.110> could<00:02:04.680> be<00:02:04.829> used<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.189> make<00:02:05.369> people

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
embryo could be used to make people

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.510 
embryo could be used to make people
personalized<00:02:06.360> therapy<00:02:06.750> from<00:02:07.560> their<00:02:07.740> own<00:02:07.920> DNA

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
personalized therapy from their own DNA

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.880 
personalized therapy from their own DNA
so<00:02:08.819> creating<00:02:09.539> clones<00:02:09.929> from<00:02:10.289> blood<00:02:10.560> cells

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
so creating clones from blood cells

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.050 
so creating clones from blood cells
could<00:02:11.280> be

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
could be

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.610 
could be
ethically<00:02:12.420> make<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:13.050> whole<00:02:13.319> process

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
ethically make that whole process

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.520 
ethically make that whole process
cheaper<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.550> easier<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:15.209> how<00:02:15.569> far<00:02:15.959> away<00:02:16.140> are

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
cheaper and easier so how far away are

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.580 
cheaper and easier so how far away are
we<00:02:16.650> from<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.340> complete<00:02:17.880> human<00:02:18.420> clone<00:02:18.750> well
