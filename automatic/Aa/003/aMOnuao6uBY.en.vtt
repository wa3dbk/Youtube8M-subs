and I think I'm pretty you know in touch

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.900 
and I think I'm pretty you know in touch
with<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> adult<00:00:25.920> audience<00:00:26.369> but<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.580> want<00:00:26.820> to

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
surprised these are still surprised

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.830

these<00:01:17.100> are<00:01:17.250> still<00:01:17.430> functional<00:01:18.000> all<00:01:18.600> right<00:01:18.750> we

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
these are still functional all right we

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.429 
these are still functional all right we
see<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.049> got<00:01:19.140> some<00:01:19.590> red<00:01:19.770> glue<00:01:20.869> some<00:01:21.869> blue<00:01:22.110> goo

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
see we got some red glue some blue goo

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.440 
see we got some red glue some blue goo
oh<00:01:22.890> well<00:01:23.340> maybe<00:01:23.490> these<00:01:23.700> aren't<00:01:23.880> functions<00:01:24.330> I

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
oh well maybe these aren't functions I

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.230 
oh well maybe these aren't functions I
think<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.229> actual<00:01:25.680> glue<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:27.000> just

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
think this is actual glue with just

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.969 
think this is actual glue with just
dying<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.869> or<00:01:28.049> something<00:01:28.409> cuz<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.680> looks<00:01:28.829> like

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
dying it or something cuz it looks like

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.100 
dying it or something cuz it looks like
it's<00:01:29.100> separating<00:01:29.790> I'm<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:30.840> sure<00:01:31.049> I

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
it's separating I'm not sure I

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.420 
it's separating I'm not sure I
understand<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.770> might<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.100> eat<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
understand I might have to eat it

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.760 
understand I might have to eat it
