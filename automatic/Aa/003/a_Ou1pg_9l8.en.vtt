things that I'm asked to do teaching
organic<00:00:13.230> chemistry<00:00:13.679> which<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:13.980> my<00:00:14.130> first<00:00:14.370> love

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
organic chemistry which is my first love

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.279 
organic chemistry which is my first love
and<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.940> do<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.480> variety<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.900> different

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
and I do that in a variety of different

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.880 
and I do that in a variety of different
ways<00:00:16.440> lectures<00:00:17.430> tutorials<00:00:18.350> workshops<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.590> the

ways lectures tutorials workshops in the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.290 
ways lectures tutorials workshops in the
lab<00:00:20.070> I'm<00:00:20.400> also<00:00:20.580> very<00:00:20.970> interested<00:00:21.270> in

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
lab I'm also very interested in

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.970 
lab I'm also very interested in
eLearning<00:00:21.960> use<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.230> computers<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.769> assist

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
eLearning use of computers to assist

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.279 
eLearning use of computers to assist
learning<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.210> have<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> large<00:00:24.990> role<00:00:25.260> in

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
learning and so I have a large role in

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.710 
learning and so I have a large role in
that<00:00:25.500> area<00:00:25.830> too<00:00:25.949> we<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.490> two<00:00:27.060> main<00:00:27.300> strengths

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
that area too we have two main strengths

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.169 
that area too we have two main strengths
I<00:00:27.810> think<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:28.080> art<00:00:28.230> apart<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:29.130> first<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.760> our

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
I think in art apart the first is our

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.209 
I think in art apart the first is our
equipment<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.960> our<00:00:31.019> facilities<00:00:31.560> we've<00:00:31.980> had

very<00:00:32.700> substantial<00:00:33.329> investment<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:33.960> research

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
very substantial investment in research

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.400 
very substantial investment in research
labs<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.100> equipment<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.030> just<00:00:36.600> recently

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
labs and equipment and just recently

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.900 
labs and equipment and just recently
we've<00:00:37.680> had<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.860> brand<00:00:38.190> new<00:00:38.430> building<00:00:38.879> for

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
we've had a brand new building for

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.520 
we've had a brand new building for
teaching<00:00:39.450> labs<00:00:39.629> costing<00:00:40.079> twenty<00:00:40.350> five
