00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 in many of the videos and exercises 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.160
 stretches that I ask you I ask you 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.780
 make a movement of ante version or 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.910
 of retro version to make the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.370
 exercise is truly useful and 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.400
 cash and maybe you're from people 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.920
 that you do not know that you do not have integrated or 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.359
 that you have lost that movement I'm going to 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.760
 explain in this video how you can 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.760
 recover it as you can work it 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.600
 in any way the first thing is that 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.700
 know that it is the mind version and the retro 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.230
 good version you can look for it in others 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.030
 videos that I have published but are the 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.330
 forward and backward movements 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.970
 of the pelvis and the pelvis can 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.330
 turn on hips forward and 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:51.790
 backwards are these two movements if 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:54.280
 before retro if forward and towards 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.190
 back well there are people that when they 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.629
 you ask to do that what they do is this 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:06.170
 go back and it's I'm on the site and 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:10.070
 the movement is forward back 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.979
 is I did not not displaced the body of 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.659
 Okay maybe I insist if it's from 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.430
 those people who do not have this 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.520
 movement has released let's see two 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.799
 ways a simpler initial for the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.960
 that we are going to use a ball of 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.820
 football like this can also be 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.560
 perfectly a chair you can do it 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.869
 on a chair because of what is 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.820
 try to close the angle of the 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.399
 hips the angle with your femoral that you 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.159
 is going to make it a bit easier to do this 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.200
 movement is worth please get on 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.869
 the ball 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.899
 and on the ball the exercise would be 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.659
 just go tilt forward and 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.049
 back trying with hands 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.579
 placed on the hips feel that 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.520
 movement of when you come towards 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.710
 forward you arch your back and when you go 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.530
 backwards you pull them out 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.280
 you even take hump back you come 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.729
 forward you arch your back you're going 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.399
 back and you get out if you can 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.780
 do it in a chair without the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.799
 displacement of the ball 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.140
 it is simply trying to find 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:21.019
 if hands are important because they are 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.140
 to help you have a reference of what 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:27.140
 what do you do what happens according to 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.230
 another formula is to lend a hand in the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.560
 belly and one hand on the back and 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.730
 perform the same exercise of alante and 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.700
 back and feel the back drain 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.950
 ok if you've already managed to make this 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.620
 exercise in a sitting position you can 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.330
 move to perform it in standing position 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.700
 has a little more complex because 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.459
 the muscles are in a tension that 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.690
 makes it more difficult then in 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.090
 foot position 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.260
 We do exactly the same thing you put on 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:03.440
 there you will place your hands again 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:06.950
 in the pelvis if to perceive the 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.049
 movements and there you go to 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.319
 that is to try to perform it before version 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.840
 and re another version is very important that 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:20.700
 do not make much effort that you try 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.790
 doing it subtly here is more 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.019
 and above all less force if 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.480
 you try to make a lot of force in the 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.269
 tendency is to make the movements 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.209
 so forwards and backwards this does not 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:36.900
 it's a before version retro version yes 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.250
 but this is a retro version 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.150
 version 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.090
 retro versus retro version before versions 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.629
 agree these two movements are going to 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.250
 be very but very very important in 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:54.269
 many of the stretches of the 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.340
 exercises that indicated in my videos well 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.560
 that it will have been good that you have seen 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.810
 this video and that you have learned and that 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.790
 you have practiced this movement of 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.430
 any way I invite you to see 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.700
 those exercises those stretches in 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.489
 those who can put into practice 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.980
 to this key of the pelvic scale where 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.659
 you can find them here in this you 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.659
 online physiotherapy portal 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:19.659
 good 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.690
 to me
