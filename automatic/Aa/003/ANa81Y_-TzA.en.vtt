00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.550

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.870
 find for a very small videos 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.490
 informative a weight of the playsation 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.599
 case so a breaking news take 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.009
 how do you need this information and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.480
 terry so points is week when he 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.770
 laughs it's by the way 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.539
 winner appears on the screen and I'm going 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.070
 so do to dry so a code 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.630
 promotional so on the screen for the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.519
 xbox live so the first person who 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.410
 put it would have won so money 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.330
 so the thing is pretty long as wants 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.410
 to see it for sure it's not bad 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.789
 and then you can put so we 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.929
 are being a gem to the video because 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.160
 we were doing the video because you 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.420
 want to participate in its end it's 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.770
 nice too because you like the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.270
 video make a comment 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.860
 what are you doing today 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.840
 so i tell you about the dualshock 4 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.790
 at sony so playstation 4 at wholesale 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.230
 that's the dualshock second contest at 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.550
 level of the joystick I think you 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.690
 have seen that he's going to have a new design 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.879
 so I will answer you to a 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.680
 question that was a lot that was 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.050
 proposed a quote in quotation marks 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.000
 ie is that the joystick of the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.190
 playstation 3 will be compatible on the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.719
 playstation 4 and no, since it's okay 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.190
 so be the dualshock 3 was the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.199
 playstation 3 controller does not 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.550
 be compatit on the playstation 4 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.409
 this is done on purpose for you 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.489
 buy playstation 4 controller 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.840
 for the playstation 4 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.390
 in passing says he's going to have a screen 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.280
 touch etc etc I think the controller 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.380
 playstation 4 may be more expensive 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.600
 to inventions of 80 100 euros all 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.189
 loukili fee to -2 let's say of a 24 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.630
 hours in bros sony posted a video 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.250
 thus showing by giving 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.020
 additional raw information from the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.740
 joystick of the playstation 4 en route 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.659
 current shock 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.070
 4 and I give you is so these 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.170
 information there so we learn that the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.939
 blue bar that has a kia thorn the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.439
 controller prove to the sensors that will 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.810
 integrated into the console it will allow 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.530
 follow the dualshock 4 we see the manade 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.880
 the playstation 4 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.280
 so lucie the player changes position 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.990
 during a split-screen game the 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.909
 console can change the position of 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.259
 the player's game automatically there 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.000
 also claims to have changed the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.590
 sheep sensitivity the textures of the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.509
 jo stic which a small difference to 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.220
 level of texture also at the level of 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.110
 the sensitivity of the pimples that it is 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.670
 true it's going to be a renewal we're going 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.110
 say at the level of debt also the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.939
 shower to four will also incorporate a 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.420
 pregnant a good that like the 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.430
 wiimote 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.510
 so you know it as the wiimote in 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.100
 big a kind of 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.720
 two little soundtracks we're going 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.190
 to be able to hear noises I find 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.660
 that it was very badly done less 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.970
 clearly with the wiimote because I 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.410
 the shelter but if you want then is this 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.940
 that a lesson will be better on the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.960
 playstation 4 that I hope so because 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.760
 so it's true it'll be very 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.050
 disappointing so to better immerse the 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.210
 player in the game we of course for 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.710
 give a little more sound around you 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.030
 sony also talked about his account at 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.490
 1 without giving further details than 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.260
 so that from what he already had 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.640
 announced for the record the game will more 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.050
 easily share the content of these 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.400
 parts of his replays finally the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.350
 manufacturer explains that the surface 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.510
 touch would be used for gestures 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.010
 rather rudimentary like fahradi cesson 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.920
 basic voice in water to scroll 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.680
 a rock menu have rejected an object when 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.240
 of a game so that's this concert would have 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.310
 Algeria because basically it's all 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.720
 latest information about that the 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.790
 important thing it's just 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.140
 one with a sensor so when you 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.310
 have passed your controller that's fine 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.050
 follow after with the touch screen 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.880
 are waiting for me after a few more things 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.650
 slightly not actually in the end 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.240
 a lot more than that but 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.800
 it's forgetting for example in 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.810
 some play maybe we will need 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.040
 touch he finds himself actually 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.540
 new jim menu I think for example 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.370
 you want to send a video not 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.930
 used tactics or if you want 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.280
 do something to be sent from 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.450
 messages if the touch is good enough 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.500
 but it's true that after we ask ourselves 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.180
 a lot of questions about the price 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.100
 of the controller because that's for sure 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.510
 it will not be 60 euros the controller is 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.130
 not possible via a touch screen that 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.739
 is embedded in it and a soundtrack 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.019
 renewed as where there is some kind of 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.459
 way there you'll hear some noise 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.360
 squarely by your controller but it's 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.019
 true that in fact finally it's a 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.820
 kind of mini console we will find 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.100
 with the adaptation 4 so the all 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.300
 last clubs want it all 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.790
 latest information about the 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.140
 question '' 4 thank you m a little chama the 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.970
 video you do as you want or 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.080
 simply follow me in fact you 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.090
