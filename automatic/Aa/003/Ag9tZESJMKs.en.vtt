between<00:00:51.090> these<00:00:51.480> two<00:00:51.750> posts<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
between these two posts is that the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.130 
between these two posts is that the
regular<00:00:53.280> reverb<00:00:53.670> has<00:00:53.879> an<00:00:54.000> external<00:00:54.360> hose<00:00:54.750> that

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
regular reverb has an external hose that

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.979 
regular reverb has an external hose that
mounts<00:00:55.469> at<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.829> post<00:00:56.160> head<00:00:56.789> right<00:00:57.480> here<00:00:57.809> and

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
mounts at the post head right here and

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.000 
mounts at the post head right here and
then<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.680> reverb<00:00:59.039> still<00:00:59.460> stealth<00:00:59.940> will<00:01:00.210> be<00:01:00.390> a

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
then the reverb still stealth will be a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.920 
then the reverb still stealth will be a
internal<00:01:02.010> routing<00:01:02.340> type<00:01:02.730> hose<00:01:03.059> gives<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
internal routing type hose gives it a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.050 
internal routing type hose gives it a
very<00:01:03.960> clean<00:01:04.530> look<00:01:04.559> gives<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.580> ability<00:01:05.700> to

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
very clean look gives it the ability to

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.330 
very clean look gives it the ability to
not<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.900> any<00:01:07.110> tangling<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.830> case<00:01:08.189> of

not have any tangling in case of

not have any tangling in case of

only certain frames are able to

only certain frames are able to

it's an awesome awesome looking post

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.010 
it's an awesome awesome looking post
both<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.100> them<00:01:17.250> are<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.549> work<00:01:17.729> great

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
both of them are going to work great

both of them are going to work great
both<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.049> them<00:01:19.350> work<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> most<00:01:20.759> part<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
both of them work for the most part the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.609 
both of them work for the most part the

between<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:25.110> two<00:01:25.350> internals<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.280> fact

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
between the two internals is the fact

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.700 
between the two internals is the fact

it's<00:01:44.460> pretty<00:01:44.700> much<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:44.939> refinements<00:01:45.869> for
