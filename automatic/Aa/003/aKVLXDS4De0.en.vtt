00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
you can for instance in a C scale you

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.380 
you can for instance in a C scale you
have<00:01:38.410> three<00:01:38.619> notes<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:40.180> then<00:01:40.330> five<00:01:40.570> more<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
next thing is to keep the thumb way in

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.070 
next thing is to keep the thumb way in
or<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.369> knuckle<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:46.600> thumb<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:47.020> the

or the knuckle the thumb and the

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.139 
or the knuckle the thumb and the
forefinger<00:01:47.500> determine<00:01:48.220> everything<00:01:48.550> all<00:01:49.030> the

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
forefinger determine everything all the

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.740 
forefinger determine everything all the
power<00:01:49.360> comes<00:01:49.509> from<00:01:49.930> these<00:01:50.170> two<00:01:50.470> things<00:01:50.740> and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
power comes from these two things and

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.230 
power comes from these two things and
when<00:01:52.750> you<00:01:52.830> change<00:01:53.830> positions<00:01:54.430> handful<00:01:55.119> to

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
when you change positions handful to

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.450 
when you change positions handful to
handful<00:01:55.690> the<00:01:56.200> thumb<00:01:56.470> always<00:01:56.770> determines

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
handful the thumb always determines

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.670 
handful the thumb always determines
where<00:01:58.180> you<00:01:58.210> go<00:01:58.510> and<00:01:58.840> how<00:01:58.960> far<00:01:59.260> at<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.470> hand

so a thumb and over the knuckle not over
the<00:02:04.690> nail<00:02:04.869> in<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.290> minute<00:02:05.560> we'll<00:02:05.650> see<00:02:05.830> what

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
the nail in a minute we'll see what

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.900 
the nail in a minute we'll see what
happens<00:02:06.400> if<00:02:06.549> you<00:02:06.640> don't<00:02:06.820> do<00:02:07.000> that<00:02:08.790> okay<00:02:09.790> when

you practice the various positions

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.490 
you practice the various positions
always<00:02:12.280> practice<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:13.209> next<00:02:13.390> higher<00:02:13.840> position

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
always practice the next higher position

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.370

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
you should be thinking away to the next

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:30.270 
you should be thinking away to the next
handful<00:02:24.310> which<00:02:25.209> is<00:02:25.390> if<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.890> reason<00:02:30.190> you

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
handful which is if the reason you

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.729 
handful which is if the reason you
practice<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.180> next<00:02:31.540> higher<00:02:31.780> handful<00:02:32.410> first

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
practice the next higher handful first

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.030 
practice the next higher handful first
is<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.760> it<00:02:34.180> needs<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.600> have<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.900> very<00:02:35.049> specific

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
is that it needs to have a very specific

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.009 
is that it needs to have a very specific
position<00:02:36.220> based<00:02:36.940> on<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.239> thumb<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.660> play<00:02:37.870> it

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
position based on the thumb to play it

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.830 
position based on the thumb to play it
well

and this will help you flip over and

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.400 
and this will help you flip over and
just<00:03:53.450> get<00:03:53.660> there<00:03:53.930> you<00:03:54.049> just<00:03:54.079> think<00:03:54.500> away<00:03:54.739> to<00:03:56.410> if

the<00:04:44.330> beats<00:04:47.920> this<00:04:48.920> way<00:04:49.130> you<00:04:49.190> avoid<00:04:49.520> hitting<00:04:49.820> the

the beats this way you avoid hitting the

the beats this way you avoid hitting the
thumb<00:04:50.240> loudly<00:04:50.540> when<00:04:51.020> it's<00:04:51.170> turn<00:04:51.410> comes<00:04:51.740> up<00:04:51.950> so

thumb loudly when it's turn comes up so
how<00:04:52.670> do<00:04:52.730> you<00:04:52.850> do<00:04:52.970> this<00:04:53.180> you<00:04:53.480> didn't<00:04:53.750> memorize

so<00:05:20.130> what<00:05:20.280> you're<00:05:20.400> doing<00:05:20.430> is<00:05:20.669> blocking<00:05:21.240> out<00:05:21.389> the

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
so what you're doing is blocking out the

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.879 
so what you're doing is blocking out the
position<00:05:21.990> which<00:05:22.200> it<00:05:22.320> becomes<00:05:22.500> really

position which it becomes really

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.170 
position which it becomes really
important<00:05:23.400> when<00:05:23.430> you<00:05:23.580> go<00:05:23.700> up<00:05:23.790> two<00:05:24.000> octaves

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
important when you go up two octaves

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:34.580 
important when you go up two octaves
because<00:05:25.139> you<00:05:25.230> notice<00:05:25.410> the<00:05:25.590> beats<00:05:25.830> are<00:05:26.070> this<00:05:33.590> so

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
because you notice the beats are this so

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.360 
because you notice the beats are this so

here<00:05:43.260> I'm<00:05:43.919> having<00:05:44.280> to<00:05:44.520> move<00:05:44.639> up<00:05:44.790> almost<00:05:45.000> an

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
here I'm having to move up almost an

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:55.159 
here I'm having to move up almost an
octave<00:05:52.880> so<00:05:53.880> you<00:05:53.970> think<00:05:54.210> it's<00:05:54.330> hard<00:05:54.600> just<00:05:54.810> to

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
octave so you think it's hard just to

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:02.870 
octave so you think it's hard just to
move<00:05:55.350> the<00:05:55.680> beats<00:05:56.430> up<00:06:01.160> its<00:06:02.160> you're<00:06:02.400> hard<00:06:02.700> would

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
move the beats up its you're hard would

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.550 
move the beats up its you're hard would
be<00:06:03.030> to<00:06:03.120> maintain<00:06:03.300> a<00:06:03.570> good<00:06:03.810> hand<00:06:04.080> position

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
be to maintain a good hand position

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.960 
be to maintain a good hand position

more abstract ideas here's a bebop if

notes and then eight more each one is a

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:47.180 
notes and then eight more each one is a
little<00:06:40.380> hint<00:06:44.810> but<00:06:45.810> it<00:06:45.900> sounds<00:06:46.169> like<00:06:46.289> one<00:06:46.530> scale

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
little hint but it sounds like one scale

little hint but it sounds like one scale
euler<00:06:47.690> array<00:06:48.690> of<00:06:48.870> notes<00:06:49.169> but<00:06:49.979> you<00:06:50.099> cannot

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
euler array of notes but you cannot

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.520 
euler array of notes but you cannot

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.530 
think of note to note to note because

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.379 
think of note to note to note because
will<00:06:52.800> never<00:06:52.979> change<00:06:53.250> position<00:06:53.789> fast<00:06:54.060> enough

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:54.389 
will never change position fast enough

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:57.080 
will never change position fast enough
and<00:06:55.259> you<00:06:56.160> can't<00:06:56.430> think<00:06:56.580> of<00:06:56.669> the<00:06:56.729> next<00:06:56.940> though

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
and you can't think of the next though

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.290 
and you can't think of the next though
anyway<00:06:57.690> so<00:06:58.380> let's<00:06:58.650> think<00:06:58.770> of<00:06:59.009> groups<00:06:59.880> of<00:07:00.060> three

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
anyway so let's think of groups of three

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.909 
anyway so let's think of groups of three
to<00:07:00.330> four<00:07:00.599> to<00:07:00.720> five<00:07:00.780> notes<00:07:01.199> at<00:07:01.410> the<00:07:01.470> same<00:07:01.680> time

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 
to four to five notes at the same time

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:06.980 
to four to five notes at the same time
like<00:07:02.190> the<00:07:02.340> pentatonic<00:07:02.669> scale<00:07:05.900> there's<00:07:06.900> no

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:06.990 
like the pentatonic scale there's no

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.659 
like the pentatonic scale there's no
limit<00:07:07.380> how<00:07:07.530> fast<00:07:07.800> you<00:07:07.949> can<00:07:08.070> play<00:07:08.280> something

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:08.669 
limit how fast you can play something

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:11.629 
limit how fast you can play something
like<00:07:08.699> that<00:07:08.970> your<00:07:09.180> thinking<00:07:09.449> is<00:07:09.780> a<00:07:10.139> handful<00:07:10.830> to

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 
like that your thinking is a handful to

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:18.219 
like that your thinking is a handful to
handful<00:07:12.620> so<00:07:13.620> recapping<00:07:14.069> the<00:07:14.340> scalp<00:07:14.639> artist

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:18.229 

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:23.570 

you're<00:07:19.229> playing<00:07:19.530> two<00:07:19.770> little<00:07:20.039> handfuls<00:07:22.580> and

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 
you're playing two little handfuls and

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.490 
you're playing two little handfuls and
each<00:07:23.699> one<00:07:23.970> can<00:07:24.150> be<00:07:24.210> played<00:07:24.539> infinitely<00:07:25.229> fast

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.500 
each one can be played infinitely fast

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.640 
each one can be played infinitely fast
first<00:07:26.099> three<00:07:26.310> notes<00:07:26.599> I<00:07:27.599> played<00:07:28.110> an<00:07:28.229> infinitely

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:28.650 
first three notes I played an infinitely

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:33.140 
first three notes I played an infinitely
fast<00:07:28.919> slow<00:07:29.250> it<00:07:29.370> down<00:07:29.539> the<00:07:30.539> next<00:07:30.780> five<00:07:31.020> I<00:07:32.150> played

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.150 
fast slow it down the next five I played

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.760 
fast slow it down the next five I played
it<00:07:33.300> infinitely<00:07:33.690> fast<00:07:34.139> it<00:07:34.380> sounded<00:07:34.650> like<00:07:34.680> a

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:34.770 
it infinitely fast it sounded like a

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:40.610 
it infinitely fast it sounded like a
chord<00:07:35.159> now<00:07:35.460> slow<00:07:35.699> it<00:07:35.729> down<00:07:39.139> so<00:07:40.139> the<00:07:40.259> last<00:07:40.409> thing

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620 
chord now slow it down so the last thing

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.140 
chord now slow it down so the last thing
to<00:07:40.680> do<00:07:40.919> is<00:07:41.099> simply<00:07:41.250> just<00:07:41.430> jump<00:07:41.969> the<00:07:42.120> next

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.150 
to do is simply just jump the next

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.760 
to do is simply just jump the next
position<00:07:42.630> with<00:07:42.900> no<00:07:43.080> thumb<00:07:43.349> one<00:07:45.469> keep<00:07:46.469> the<00:07:46.590> beat

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:46.770 
position with no thumb one keep the beat

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.380 
position with no thumb one keep the beat
in<00:07:46.919> mind
