00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
which is nowhere near good enough to

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.990 
which is nowhere near good enough to
life<00:02:57.599> dream<00:02:57.989> so<00:02:58.260> yeah<00:02:59.159> the<00:02:59.400> moment<00:02:59.730> I'm<00:02:59.819> just

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
life dream so yeah the moment I'm just

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.550

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
I can upgrade because I didn't really

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.420 
I can upgrade because I didn't really
want<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.510> risk<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.930> chance<00:03:03.959> of<00:03:04.439> having<00:03:05.159> my

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
want to risk the chance of having my

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.069 
want to risk the chance of having my
internet<00:03:05.760> down<00:03:05.970> whilst<00:03:06.269> they<00:03:06.510> upgrade<00:03:06.870> it

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:28.159 
of the week kind of thing I think that'd
be<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.340> cool<00:04:26.849> idea<00:04:27.029> I<00:04:27.389> know<00:04:27.659> a<00:04:27.690> lot<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:27.930> other

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
be a cool idea I know a lot of other

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.810 
be a cool idea I know a lot of other
people<00:04:28.380> have<00:04:28.590> done<00:04:28.620> this<00:04:28.830> before<00:04:29.219> and<00:04:29.490> you

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
know obviously the gaming lemon if you

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.399
