00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
dating myself a little bit we did not

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.379 
dating myself a little bit we did not
have<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.230> when<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:07.529> did<00:00:07.790> sinus<00:00:08.790> surgery<00:00:09.240> back

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
have this when I did sinus surgery back

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.030 
have this when I did sinus surgery back
in<00:00:09.450> my<00:00:09.750> ent<00:00:10.230> days<00:00:10.410> we<00:00:10.590> had<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.800> do<00:00:10.920> the

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
in my ent days we had to do the

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.680 
in my ent days we had to do the
old-fashioned<00:00:11.700> Caldwell<00:00:12.150> lock<00:00:12.300> which<00:00:12.509> we

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
old-fashioned Caldwell lock which we

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.770 
old-fashioned Caldwell lock which we
still<00:00:13.259> sometimes<00:00:13.590> do<00:00:14.130> but<00:00:14.639> we<00:00:14.910> actually<00:00:15.059> would

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
still sometimes do but we actually would

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.890 
still sometimes do but we actually would
tap<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.920> bone<00:00:17.340> right<00:00:17.369> here<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:18.300> open<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.720> up

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
tap this bone right here to open it up

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.310 
tap this bone right here to open it up
you<00:00:19.109> did<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.730> much<00:00:20.939> much<00:00:21.720> slicker

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
you did it in a in a much much slicker

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.439 
you did it in a in a much much slicker
way<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:23.130> seems<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.609> drastic<00:00:24.180> but<00:00:24.330> that's

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
way that seems so drastic but that's

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.970 
way that seems so drastic but that's
exactly<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.050> way<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.380> used<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.619> do<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.920> in

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
exactly the way that we used to do it in

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.609 
exactly the way that we used to do it in
the<00:00:26.099> past<00:00:26.480> but<00:00:27.480> now<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.810> course<00:00:27.869> as<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.349> saw<00:00:28.529> in

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the past but now of course as you saw in

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.349 
the past but now of course as you saw in
the<00:00:28.680> video<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.490> have<00:00:29.730> what<00:00:30.150> we<00:00:30.240> call

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
the video we have what we call

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.420 
the video we have what we call
endoscopic<00:00:30.990> sinus<00:00:31.170> surgery<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:31.859> what<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.160> that

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
endoscopic sinus surgery so what is that

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.729 
endoscopic sinus surgery so what is that
so<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.360> endoscopes<00:00:33.989> they're<00:00:34.350> actually

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
so the endoscopes they're actually

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.799 
so the endoscopes they're actually
telescopes<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.760> are<00:00:36.270> hooked<00:00:36.510> up<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> a

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
telescopes that are hooked up to a

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.049 
telescopes that are hooked up to a
camera<00:00:37.110> into<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> light<00:00:37.890> source<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.879> gives

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
camera into a light source and it gives

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.450 
camera into a light source and it gives
us<00:00:39.210> bigger<00:00:39.809> magnification<00:00:40.800> improved

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
us bigger magnification improved

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.729 
us bigger magnification improved
visualization<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.840> allows<00:00:43.110> us<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.440> do<00:00:43.559> much

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
visualization it allows us to do much

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.130 
visualization it allows us to do much
more<00:00:43.980> precise<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.460> thorough<00:00:44.940> surgery<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.840> at

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
more precise and thorough surgery and at

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.020 
more precise and thorough surgery and at
the<00:00:46.200> same<00:00:46.379> time<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:47.010> much<00:00:47.219> less<00:00:47.460> invasive

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the same time it's much less invasive

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.750 
the same time it's much less invasive
it's<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.600> sameday<00:00:48.870> surgery<00:00:49.160> faster<00:00:50.160> recovery

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
it's a sameday surgery faster recovery

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.369 
it's a sameday surgery faster recovery
and<00:00:51.059> we've<00:00:51.300> got<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.719> up<00:00:51.930> here<00:00:52.110> because<00:00:52.140> we

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
and we've got this up here because we

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.630 
and we've got this up here because we
want<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.649> show<00:00:52.800> everyone<00:00:53.010> some<00:00:53.489> new

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
want to show everyone some new

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.209 
want to show everyone some new
technology<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.170> demo<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.739> for<00:00:55.800> us<00:00:56.129> and

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
technology so so demo this for us and

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.500 
technology so so demo this for us and
show<00:00:56.430> us<00:00:56.520> what<00:00:56.640> you're<00:00:56.789> doing<00:00:56.820> when<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.420> were

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
show us what you're doing when we were

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.910 
show us what you're doing when we were
watching<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.780> video<00:00:57.899> Jim<00:00:58.260> getting<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.530> surgery

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
watching the video Jim getting a surgery

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.240 
watching the video Jim getting a surgery
right<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.960> here<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.590> actually<00:01:01.770> called

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
right so this here is actually called

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.109 
right so this here is actually called
the<00:01:02.850> Hydra<00:01:03.180> breeder<00:01:03.449> it's<00:01:04.460> basically<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.610> spray

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the Hydra breeder it's basically a spray

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.990 
the Hydra breeder it's basically a spray
gun<00:01:06.150> or<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.540> water<00:01:06.810> gun<00:01:07.080> for<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.560> sinuses<00:01:08.100> you

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
gun or a water gun for the sinuses you

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.820 
gun or a water gun for the sinuses you
can<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.270> there's<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.540> tip<00:01:10.080> here<00:01:10.320> holds<00:01:10.680> like<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
can see there's a tip here holds like a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.250 
can see there's a tip here holds like a
hand<00:01:11.220> drill<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.570> straight<00:01:12.960> but<00:01:13.170> you

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
hand drill it's it's straight but you

actually have a wheel here it can turn

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.149 
actually have a wheel here it can turn
to<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> right<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.380> turn<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> left

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
to the right it can turn to the left

in fact fungus mold it really looks has

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.060 
in fact fungus mold it really looks has
a<00:01:30.210> consistency<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.900> molasses<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.619> peanut

a consistency of molasses and peanut
butter<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.369> how<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.579> actually<00:01:32.820> describe<00:01:33.390> it

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
butter is how we actually describe it

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.819 
butter is how we actually describe it
when<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.930> were<00:01:33.990> talking<00:01:34.200> about<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.590> type<00:01:34.799> of

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
when we were talking about this type of

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.350 
when we were talking about this type of
disease<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.310> we'll<00:01:35.549> see<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.030> song<00:01:36.240> in

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
disease so we'll see you this song in

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.390 
disease so we'll see you this song in
action<00:01:36.689> yes<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.079> can<00:01:37.229> see<00:01:37.470> how<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:38.220> getting

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
action yes you can see how it's getting

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.310
