of the pieces individually and assemble

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.450 
of the pieces individually and assemble
them<00:00:32.340> together<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:33.450> create<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:34.230> window<00:00:34.890> like

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
them together to create a window like

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.389 
them together to create a window like
this<00:00:35.760> well<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.469> was<00:00:37.469> playing<00:00:37.739> around<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.250> other

day and without even thinking about it I
just<00:00:41.390> created<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.510> window<00:00:43.219> exactly<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.430> this

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
just created a window exactly like this

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.440 
just created a window exactly like this
in<00:00:44.969> probably<00:00:45.809> 30<00:00:46.170> seconds<00:00:46.950> or<00:00:47.129> less<00:00:47.450> so

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450

see
what<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.860> will<00:02:13.980> do<00:02:14.160> is<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.670> gives<00:02:14.970> me<00:02:15.150> my

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
what that will do is that gives me my

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.100 
what that will do is that gives me my
panes<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.590> glass<00:02:19.700> just<00:02:20.700> like<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.270> so<00:02:21.540> now<00:02:21.720> I

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
panes of glass just like that so now I

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.780 
panes of glass just like that so now I

click<00:04:09.650> click<00:04:10.650> there<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:12.650> basically<00:04:13.650> we're

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
click click there and basically we're

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.550 
click click there and basically we're
going<00:04:14.160> to<00:04:14.220> do<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.459> same<00:04:14.730> thing<00:04:15.239> here<00:04:15.630> as<00:04:15.750> we

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
going to do the same thing here as we

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.880 
going to do the same thing here as we
did<00:04:16.799> in<00:04:17.600> cinema<00:04:18.600> 4d<00:04:18.780> pretty<00:04:19.350> much<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.829> only

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
did in cinema 4d pretty much the only

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.520 
did in cinema 4d pretty much the only
difference<00:04:20.549> is<00:04:20.729> the<00:04:21.299> names<00:04:21.539> of<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.870> tools<00:04:22.140> so

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
difference is the names of the tools so

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.589 
difference is the names of the tools so
let's<00:04:22.800> come<00:04:23.070> over<00:04:23.280> your<00:04:23.460> sweep<00:04:23.669> surface<00:04:24.090> and

I'm going to use the
I believe<00:04:26.189> that<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.550> radial<00:04:26.909> function<00:04:27.120> and

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
I believe that the radial function and

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.089 
I believe that the radial function and
sweep<00:04:28.710> inwards<00:04:30.139> press<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.289> spacebar<00:04:31.530> three
