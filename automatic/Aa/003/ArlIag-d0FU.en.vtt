00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.270
 feyenoord ajax is the first classic of this still young Sunday 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.209
 football season 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.249
 both teams started the competition stiffly but picked up in the second 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:13.979
 match with a win 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:17.689
 and now they face each other in the rotterdamse tub we were looking for old 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.029
 feyenoorder peter houtman to look ahead to the classic 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.200
 a big match like this against Ajax might come a little early for it 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.409
 current feyenoord 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.249
 year was very early in this season 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:30.220
 and no 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.280
 yes it happens that already when you look back to the last few weeks already 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.540
 so good looking 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.320
 given the larger SMEs, hour lists already mention shore and the same 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.870
 that seems a bit like that now 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.190
 who on that it that that the injured players have a lot to say makaay 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.890
 but on 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.080
 was again a rumor yes favorable prospect 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.590
 on the other hand 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.789
 and I'm coming again now 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:56.479
 actually goes for it 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:58.560
 to the clichÃ©s too quickly 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.310
 However, it is completely on its own again, but yes that Talpa radio is so common 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.300
 probably and that is basically also this competition 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.640
 although they are now playing evidence eighteenth place 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.060
 it's healthy and it's about that traditional struggle it's about that 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.340
 classic it is about the big clash between feyenoord and ajax yes 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.440
 in the end it is always the competition that lives so much among people 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.479
 for the netherlands at the game of the season is whatever the place stand 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.250
 and therefore the couple speaks to the future 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.480
 if you also have the game of the season 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.700
 And that also applies once again despite the fact that you also have to use all-tech soaps 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.250
 want from ajax or feyenoord 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.030
 you can restore what is next so next season 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.120
 from all sides cia 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.660
 from both sides they both really want to win me anyway 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.600
 the question is of course how the two teams are currently doing 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.340
 starting at feyenoord 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.630
 Certainly proof at the moment is still difficult to estimate, of course 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.560
 yes considering that injury list that misery we have all had 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.990
 certainly no no ideal preparation is known in that case 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.080
 of course there was pleasure on arrival 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.220
 in the training she said 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.080
 but I think as a goodbye I still know the time and get to the ground 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:14.019
 then then getting the bill calls for such a flight on a give anyway 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.089
 The hand of Verbeek is already clearly visible 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:21.459
 Well certainly look at what he has in particular the doctrine of creation 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:25.619
 he has been working hard on that since preparation, of course 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:29.479
 a very good base that everyone obviously has but also what he has 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:33.249
 many of them, of course, are in charge of playing ahead in their own house 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:37.739
 having it match the opponent to your game and not 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.739
 the other way around we unfortunately experienced everything 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:44.749
 yes i hope i can tell you i hope that will come true 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.159
 poor tutu ajax this season so far 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.809
 he will be very honest say enria you as a feyenoord man turned out to be me 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:54.059
 watch that very real weeks do 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:56.479
 just view it in the power ratios 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:59.799
 I also have to say that he expects quite a lot 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.029
 but also with sat against him, surrounded man himself was right with the man 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:05.179
 two years 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:06.749
 got on the pants 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:09.549
 and when I see what will walk 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:10.370
 I estimate 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.280
 7 a language is say if if maybe have the chance in for the league title 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:18.409
 was of course a bit of coffee grounds looking at that ajax again 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.689
 quite a bit of good the transfer market just expect a lot from it 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.909
 ajax and even though they have lost against Willem 2 and they already have one 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:26.969
 meager victory achieved against roda 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:29.799
 I expect us to fit in, he said he really wanted to participate 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.259
 and so it could just be a very difficult game for feyenoord 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.469
 what does topman himself expect from the Sunday game 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:38.269
 after about 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.810
 I also have to tell you wonderfully honest and certainly considering the list of 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.519
 because now his injury is gone 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.489
 the misery beforehand 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.690
 audio heart of data from somalis to genes 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.139
 slaughter is just 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.759
 yes for that matter I would 

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:56.489
 if it is a very nice game anyway 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.489
 the result is well balanced, it is a very nice competition 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.179
 and there is no loss of feyenoord then I have to go to this throne speech and then 

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:06.759
 its stupid I am an angel all very satisfied but may also be 5 4 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.909
 ears
