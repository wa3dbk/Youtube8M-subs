00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.350
 see 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.660
 Shows start with batteries 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.660
 she is 12 volt 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.510
 two times shorter than 3a 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.269
 so I stand a pen tank with 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.899
 the edge of the clip to contact the usual 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:54.140
 clerical 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.140
 and switch to turn off the lion during the day 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.769
 battery two wires depart here 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:06.360
 you can see that 21 goes to the device which 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:08.610
 I came up with this aluminum corner 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.759
 hole drilled and inserted 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.470
 spring as soon as we 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:19.380
 lock press the brake here is this nut and 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.539
 spring touches another going to him 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.190
 chain end 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:28.530
 the diode on the tape lights up 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:36.170
 I need to show it like this 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.170
 pulling the cable brake applies 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.700
 good approach to the second wire 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:49.520
 which comes from a battery that's it 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:53.390
 I soldered the place to this place but to the plus 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.480
 all tapes are connected in parallel therefore 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.990
 to any one could be the conclusion here their 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:04.670
 very much on the one she hyland tapes yet 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:09.890
 glued well so that problems with 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:17.650
 I was not glued and minus here 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.650
 and on the tape below it is minus 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:34.710
 I connected it together like this 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:37.400
 the boards twisted them together and here's the podbot 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:41.700
 which keeps the brakes here are so evident 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:48.480
 bolted on the right side similarly 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:50.540
 and I want to return the tape to avoid 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.850
 mud well so here it all looks 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.730
 from afar can't show hand not 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:07.760
 I pull on the brake here 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:07.760
 I pull for the traffic and now thanks for sunbathing
