00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
something I wanted to first point out

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.349 
something I wanted to first point out
that<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.320> most<00:00:22.529> like<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.279> package<00:00:24.150> that

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
that I most like is the package that

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.019 
that I most like is the package that
hasn't<00:00:24.570> been<00:00:24.779> opened<00:00:25.380> yet<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.859> these<00:00:26.490> cards

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
don't have the stickers on them that was

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.519 
don't have the stickers on them that was
like<00:00:29.820> probably<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.480> first<00:00:30.779> thing<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.080> noticed

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529

like probably the first thing I noticed
and<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.740> thought<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.070> was<00:00:32.160> really<00:00:32.340> cool

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
and I thought that was really cool

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.970 
and I thought that was really cool
because<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.030> hate<00:00:33.239> peeling<00:00:34.110> off<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.500> sticker

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
because I hate peeling off the sticker

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.330

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
and some of you are like me who just

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.230 
and some of you are like me who just
need<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.650> do<00:01:10.770> some<00:01:10.950> research<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.520> find<00:01:11.700> out<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
need to do some research to find out and

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.840 
need to do some research to find out and
it<00:01:12.330> also<00:01:12.540> comes<00:01:12.900> with<00:01:13.049> two<00:01:13.670> double<00:01:14.670> backer

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
giveaway it doesn't look too fancy it

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.679 
giveaway it doesn't look too fancy it
doesn't<00:01:44.549> look<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.670> special<00:01:44.970> but<00:01:45.390> after

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
doesn't look that special but after

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.810 
doesn't look that special but after
feeling<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.470> handling<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.700> definitely

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
feeling it and handling it it definitely

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.289 
feeling it and handling it it definitely
has<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.570> different<00:01:49.049> finish<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.460> like<00:01:51.119> you

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
has a different finish to it like you

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.850 
has a different finish to it like you
can<00:01:51.450> probably<00:01:51.630> see<00:01:51.869> just<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.259> reflections

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
can probably see just the reflections

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.219 
can probably see just the reflections
coming<00:01:53.070> off<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:53.700> kind<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.810> different

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
coming off but it's kind of a different

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.539 
coming off but it's kind of a different
