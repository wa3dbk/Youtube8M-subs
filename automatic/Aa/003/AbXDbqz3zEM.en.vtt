00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.720 
picked him up super easy and put him in
this<00:02:52.120> cage<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.450> he<00:02:52.810> just<00:02:53.019> explored<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:54.130> went

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
this cage and he just explored and went

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.840 
this cage and he just explored and went
right<00:02:54.970> for<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.299> hay<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:57.190> he's<00:02:57.609> quite

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
right for the hay so he's quite

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.120 
right for the hay so he's quite
confident<00:02:58.570> which<00:02:58.750> is<00:02:58.930> really<00:02:59.410> nice<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.650> see

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.039 
hungry so my plan is once I get the
table<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.250> don't<00:03:30.910> think<00:03:31.450> I<00:03:31.540> gonna<00:03:31.720> leave<00:03:31.930> it

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
table I don't think I gonna leave it

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:32.430 
table I don't think I gonna leave it
here

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
here

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.430 
here
I'd<00:03:33.250> possibly<00:03:33.760> like<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.209> either<00:03:34.840> connect<00:03:35.290> him

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
I'd possibly like to either connect him

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.259 
I'd possibly like to either connect him
here<00:03:35.829> or<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:36.780> could<00:03:37.780> connect<00:03:38.140> him<00:03:38.290> here<00:03:39.060> I'm<00:03:40.060> not

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
here or I could connect him here I'm not

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.660 
here or I could connect him here I'm not
exactly<00:03:40.600> sure<00:03:40.840> yet<00:03:40.989> once<00:03:41.620> I<00:03:41.799> get<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.069> table<00:03:42.489> I

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
exactly sure yet once I get the table I

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.539 
exactly sure yet once I get the table I
can<00:03:43.000> play<00:03:43.930> around<00:03:44.109> with<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.769> setup<00:03:45.160> because<00:03:45.370> I

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
can play around with the setup because I

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.990 
can play around with the setup because I
would<00:03:45.790> like<00:03:45.970> everybody<00:03:46.390> to<00:03:46.660> be<00:03:46.989> connected<00:03:47.560> and

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
would like everybody to be connected and

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.370 
would like everybody to be connected and
even<00:03:49.000> if<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.299> table<00:03:49.660> cover<00:03:49.840> is<00:03:50.049> a<00:03:50.079> bit<00:03:50.290> of

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
even if the table cover is a bit of

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.470 
even if the table cover is a bit of
floor<00:03:50.590> space<00:03:50.620> here<00:03:51.340> it<00:03:51.700> doesn't<00:03:52.120> interfere

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
floor space here it doesn't interfere

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.780 
floor space here it doesn't interfere
with<00:03:52.810> Seymour<00:03:53.410> since<00:03:53.769> he<00:03:53.920> can<00:03:54.100> run<00:03:54.370> all

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
with Seymour since he can run all

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.420 
with Seymour since he can run all
underneath<00:03:55.450> it<00:03:55.810> anyway<00:03:56.139> so<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:57.040> don't<00:03:57.130> think

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
underneath it anyway so I don't think

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.129 
underneath it anyway so I don't think
that<00:03:57.639> will<00:03:57.819> matter<00:03:58.000> where<00:03:58.389> the<00:03:58.600> table<00:03:58.959> gets

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
that will matter where the table gets

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.009 
that will matter where the table gets
set<00:03:59.850> but<00:04:00.850> as<00:04:00.970> for<00:04:01.180> right<00:04:01.299> now<00:04:01.360> he's<00:04:01.810> sitting

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
set but as for right now he's sitting

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.089 
set but as for right now he's sitting
here<00:04:02.379> and<00:04:03.190> I<00:04:03.849> know<00:04:03.909> people<00:04:04.209> are<00:04:04.360> gonna<00:04:04.420> ask

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
they're both on pain meds daily so I

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.160 
they're both on pain meds daily so I
think<00:04:18.160> putting<00:04:18.640> in<00:04:18.940> that<00:04:19.120> little<00:04:19.420> 7<00:04:19.780> month<00:04:19.959> old

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
think putting in that little 7 month old

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.620 
think putting in that little 7 month old
with<00:04:20.470> four<00:04:21.459> and<00:04:21.579> a<00:04:21.640> half<00:04:21.670> year<00:04:22.090> olds<00:04:22.330> just

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
with four and a half year olds just

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.900 
with four and a half year olds just
won't<00:04:22.870> be<00:04:23.110> fair<00:04:23.440> if<00:04:23.710> they<00:04:24.490> didn't<00:04:24.790> have

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
won't be fair if they didn't have

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.960 
won't be fair if they didn't have
arthritis<00:04:25.510> by<00:04:25.930> all<00:04:26.080> means<00:04:26.350> I<00:04:26.530> would<00:04:26.680> try<00:04:26.920> it

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
arthritis by all means I would try it

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.730 
arthritis by all means I would try it
but<00:04:27.970> I<00:04:28.000> just<00:04:28.240> think<00:04:28.480> he<00:04:29.020> would<00:04:29.170> be<00:04:29.320> too

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
but I just think he would be too

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.980 
but I just think he would be too
rambunctious<00:04:30.070> for<00:04:31.030> them<00:04:31.210> they're<00:04:31.600> kind<00:04:31.870> of

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.380 
rambunctious for them they're kind of
laid-back<00:04:32.740> in<00:04:33.280> I<00:04:33.580> wouldn't<00:04:33.940> want<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.210> cause
