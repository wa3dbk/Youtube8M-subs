00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.640 
that you jump clear of that vehicle try
to<00:02:03.280> land<00:02:03.550> on<00:02:03.760> both<00:02:04.060> feet<00:02:04.120> and<00:02:04.870> then<00:02:05.380> just

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
to land on both feet and then just

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.729 
to land on both feet and then just
shuffle<00:02:06.220> away<00:02:06.540> there<00:02:07.540> can<00:02:07.840> be<00:02:07.870> current<00:02:08.590> then

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
shuffle away there can be current then

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.589 
shuffle away there can be current then
going<00:02:09.039> into<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.369> ground<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:09.940> creating<00:02:10.360> some

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
going into the ground and creating some

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.750 
going into the ground and creating some
voltage<00:02:10.989> differences<00:02:11.680> around<00:02:12.010> that<00:02:12.250> vehicle

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
voltage differences around that vehicle

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.089 
voltage differences around that vehicle
so<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.540> entanglement<00:02:14.019> is<00:02:14.500> another<00:02:14.799> thing

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
so that entanglement is another thing

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.890 
so that entanglement is another thing
that<00:02:15.159> can<00:02:15.459> often<00:02:15.610> lead<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.209> or<00:02:16.629> cause

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
that can often lead to or cause

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.830 
that can often lead to or cause
additional<00:02:17.670> accidents<00:02:18.670> but<00:02:19.150> if<00:02:19.269> we<00:02:19.420> stay<00:02:19.629> in

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
additional accidents but if we stay in

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.360 
additional accidents but if we stay in
the<00:02:19.989> vehicle<00:02:20.110> in<00:02:20.440> most<00:02:20.620> cases<00:02:20.890> we're<00:02:21.220> like

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
with farm customers in the Midwest I see

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.610 
with farm customers in the Midwest I see
a<00:03:28.820> lot<00:03:28.970> of<00:03:29.030> damn<00:03:29.330> each<00:03:29.540> electrical<00:03:30.140> equipment

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
a lot of damn each electrical equipment

a lot of damn each electrical equipment
it<00:03:30.770> hasn't<00:03:31.160> been<00:03:31.280> fixed<00:03:31.580> I<00:03:31.820> encourage<00:03:32.510> you<00:03:32.540> to

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
it hasn't been fixed I encourage you to

it hasn't been fixed I encourage you to
look<00:03:32.900> around<00:03:33.230> see<00:03:33.650> where<00:03:33.800> that<00:03:33.980> is<00:03:34.220> get<00:03:34.820> it

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
look around see where that is get it

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.000 
look around see where that is get it
fixed<00:03:35.360> rather<00:03:35.630> than<00:03:35.900> leaving<00:03:36.200> it<00:03:36.470> in<00:03:36.650> the

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
fixed rather than leaving it in the

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.130 
fixed rather than leaving it in the
state<00:03:37.310> and<00:03:37.670> it<00:03:37.820> was<00:03:38.330> damaged<00:03:38.810> because<00:03:38.900> that

state and it was damaged because that

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.200 
state and it was damaged because that
can<00:03:39.290> lead<00:03:39.470> to<00:03:39.500> electrocution<00:03:40.280> hazards<00:03:40.910> in

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.340 
that's occurred the main thing that we
have<00:03:46.370> to<00:03:46.550> do<00:03:46.730> realize<00:03:47.450> is<00:03:47.750> that<00:03:47.900> we<00:03:48.020> need<00:03:48.200> to

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
have to do realize is that we need to

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.290 
have to do realize is that we need to
treat<00:03:48.650> every<00:03:49.250> wire<00:03:49.850> as<00:03:50.180> if<00:03:50.840> it<00:03:51.020> was<00:03:51.320> energized

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
treat every wire as if it was energized

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.150 
treat every wire as if it was energized
so<00:03:53.300> if<00:03:53.510> I<00:03:53.600> wire<00:03:53.810> is<00:03:54.020> hanging<00:03:54.350> low<00:03:54.590> that's

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
so if I wire is hanging low that's

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.370 
so if I wire is hanging low that's
fallen<00:03:55.580> on<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.850> ground<00:03:55.880> you<00:03:56.840> may<00:03:56.960> not<00:03:57.110> be<00:03:57.260> able

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
fallen on the ground you may not be able

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.170 
fallen on the ground you may not be able
to<00:03:57.530> tell<00:03:57.860> that<00:03:57.890> that<00:03:58.220> power<00:03:58.580> line<00:03:58.940> is

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
to tell that that power line is

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.900 
to tell that that power line is
energized<00:03:59.840> just<00:04:00.350> by<00:04:00.470> looking<00:04:00.890> at<00:04:01.040> it<00:04:01.100> and<00:04:01.430> so<00:04:01.880> I

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
energized just by looking at it and so I

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.520 
energized just by looking at it and so I
want<00:04:02.150> to<00:04:02.270> just<00:04:02.390> really<00:04:02.630> emphasize<00:04:03.170> that<00:04:03.470> point

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
want to just really emphasize that point

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.250 
want to just really emphasize that point
is<00:04:04.340> that<00:04:04.700> we<00:04:04.910> need<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.180> treat<00:04:05.360> all<00:04:05.510> wires<00:04:05.750> if

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
is that we need to treat all wires if

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.650 
is that we need to treat all wires if
they're<00:04:06.470> energized<00:04:06.950> and<00:04:07.250> if<00:04:07.760> they<00:04:07.970> could<00:04:08.270> harm

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
they're energized and if they could harm

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.290 
they're energized and if they could harm
you<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.110> never<00:04:09.860> take<00:04:10.130> it<00:04:10.190> for<00:04:10.340> granted<00:04:10.520> make

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
you and never take it for granted make

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.000 
you and never take it for granted make
sure<00:04:11.330> the<00:04:11.660> power<00:04:11.840> is<00:04:12.050> off<00:04:12.320> or<00:04:12.620> make<00:04:12.740> sure<00:04:12.890> you

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
sure the power is off or make sure you

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.130 
sure the power is off or make sure you
know<00:04:13.160> where<00:04:13.550> how<00:04:13.880> to<00:04:13.940> turn<00:04:14.270> the<00:04:14.390> power<00:04:14.570> off<00:04:14.720> to

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
know where how to turn the power off to

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.620 
know where how to turn the power off to
your<00:04:15.260> farmstead<00:04:15.830> before<00:04:16.609> you<00:04:16.790> work<00:04:17.030> on<00:04:17.239> any<00:04:17.450> of

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
your farmstead before you work on any of

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.420 
your farmstead before you work on any of
it<00:04:17.750> or<00:04:17.930> call<00:04:18.170> your<00:04:18.320> utility<00:04:18.859> company<00:04:19.310> if

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
it or call your utility company if

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.210 
it or call your utility company if
there's<00:04:19.609> any<00:04:19.820> question<00:04:20.060> about<00:04:20.600> that<00:04:21.470> and<00:04:21.739> have

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
there's any question about that and have

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.010 
there's any question about that and have
them<00:04:22.520> work<00:04:22.790> on<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.090> wires<00:04:23.330> rather<00:04:23.810> than

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
them work on the wires rather than

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.390 
them work on the wires rather than
approaching<00:04:24.590> it<00:04:24.710> ourselves

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
approaching it ourselves

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.460 
approaching it ourselves
you
