00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:34.670 
that's what the drum torque is telling
this<00:03:29.849> this<00:03:30.849> is<00:03:31.000> it<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:33.459> better<00:03:33.700> side<00:03:33.969> now

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
this this is it the better side now

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.050 
this this is it the better side now
let's<00:03:35.680> bring<00:03:35.980> up<00:03:36.189> the<00:03:36.939> response<00:03:37.450> head<00:03:38.879> just<00:03:39.879> a

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
let's bring up the response head just a

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.000 
let's bring up the response head just a
little<00:03:41.250> tension<00:03:42.250> is<00:03:42.609> really<00:03:43.030> loose<00:03:44.010> and

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
little tension is really loose and

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.319 
little tension is really loose and
remember<00:03:46.349> what<00:03:47.430> we<00:03:48.430> are<00:03:48.639> using

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
remember what we are using

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.190 
remember what we are using
it's<00:03:50.169> probably<00:03:50.560> got<00:03:50.680> around<00:03:50.769> six<00:03:51.639> or<00:03:51.760> seven

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
it's probably got around six or seven

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.720 
it's probably got around six or seven
whoops

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
whoops

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:01.319 
whoops
click<00:03:56.939> that's<00:03:57.939> it<00:03:59.099> drum<00:04:00.099> torque<00:04:00.370> from

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
click that's it drum torque from

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:17.129 
click that's it drum torque from
evidence<00:04:13.709> this<00:04:14.709> is<00:04:14.859> the<00:04:14.980> same<00:04:15.219> tension<00:04:16.139> this

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
evidence this is the same tension this

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.310 
evidence this is the same tension this
is<00:04:17.199> what<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.940> torque<00:04:18.940> told<00:04:19.269> us<00:04:19.419> okay<00:04:19.959> this<00:04:20.169> is

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
is what the torque told us okay this is

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.820 
is what the torque told us okay this is
the<00:04:20.409> same<00:04:20.680> tension<00:04:21.090> but<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.720> way<00:04:22.870> I'm<00:04:23.349> used<00:04:23.710> to

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
the same tension but the way I'm used to

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.670 
the same tension but the way I'm used to
tuning<00:04:24.370> my<00:04:24.550> my<00:04:25.770> toms<00:04:27.150> let's<00:04:28.150> bring<00:04:28.510> just<00:04:29.470> go

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
tuning my my toms let's bring just go

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:38.330 
tuning my my toms let's bring just go
back<00:04:29.889> to<00:04:29.919> a<00:04:30.070> hard<00:04:30.340> pitch<00:04:32.639> time<00:04:34.080> let's<00:04:35.080> see

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:47.189 

click<00:04:39.690> let's<00:04:40.690> see<00:04:40.900> how<00:04:41.139> to<00:04:41.650> change<00:04:41.979> the<00:04:42.099> sound

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.890 

this<00:04:48.199> is<00:04:48.319> it

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
this is it

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.290 
this is it
drum<00:04:50.900> torquey<00:04:51.349> from<00:04:51.680> Evans<00:04:52.689> again<00:04:55.300> the

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
drum torquey from Evans again the

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:06.350 
drum torquey from Evans again the
drumdial<00:04:56.860> okay

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360
