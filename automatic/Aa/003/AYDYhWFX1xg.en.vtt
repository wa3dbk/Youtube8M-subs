limited<00:02:53.980> edition<00:02:54.130> this<00:02:54.580> isn't<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:54.910> problem<00:02:55.120> for

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
limited edition this isn't a problem for

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.300

think<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.610> max<00:02:57.820> level<00:02:58.000> is<00:02:58.270> 130<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:59.230> highest

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
think the max level is 130 the highest

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.700
