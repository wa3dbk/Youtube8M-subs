headlines in the second half for the
penalty<00:00:38.340> set<00:00:38.640> but<00:00:38.760> there<00:00:38.850> was<00:00:38.940> some<00:00:39.090> other

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
penalty set but there was some other

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.970 
penalty set but there was some other
impressive<00:00:39.780> shade<00:00:40.110> maybe<00:00:40.230> even<00:00:40.559> better<00:00:40.739> than

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
impressive shade maybe even better than

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.580 
impressive shade maybe even better than
the<00:00:41.100> penalty<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.899> that's<00:00:42.899> my<00:00:43.020> job<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.410> man

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the penalty so that's my job a man

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.630 
the penalty so that's my job a man
should<00:00:43.800> be<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> first<00:00:44.100> person<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.430> tell<00:00:44.579> you

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
should be the first person to tell you

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.700 
should be the first person to tell you
that<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:45.450> what<00:00:45.570> we're<00:00:45.690> what<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.230> paid<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.559> do

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
that it's what we're what we paid to do

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.520 
that it's what we're what we paid to do
I<00:00:47.120> think<00:00:48.120> as<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.600> goalkeeper<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.200> come<00:00:49.379> here

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
I think as a goalkeeper you come here

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.840 
I think as a goalkeeper you come here
and<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.770> can't<00:00:50.070> fail<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.430> inspired<00:00:50.730> by

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and you can't fail to be inspired by

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.400 
and you can't fail to be inspired by
playing<00:00:51.030> an<00:00:51.180> unbelievable<00:00:51.809> stadium<00:00:52.170> against
