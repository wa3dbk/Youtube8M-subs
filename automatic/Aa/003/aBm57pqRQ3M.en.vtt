that's<00:00:57.879> one<00:00:58.059> thing<00:00:58.270> if<00:00:58.300> you've<00:00:58.510> never<00:00:58.660> skated

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
that's one thing if you've never skated

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.360 
that's one thing if you've never skated
these<00:00:59.170> before<00:00:59.590> tape<00:00:59.800> pay<00:00:59.980> close<00:01:00.219> attention

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
these before tape pay close attention

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.430 
these before tape pay close attention
because<00:01:00.940> you'll<00:01:01.090> see<00:01:01.270> standard<00:01:01.899> sizing<00:01:02.260> here

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
because you'll see standard sizing here

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.930 
because you'll see standard sizing here
until<00:01:02.680> you<00:01:02.770> get<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:03.039> about<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.399> back<00:01:03.670> and

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
until you get to about the back and

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.910 
until you get to about the back and
that's<00:01:04.359> where<00:01:04.629> you<00:01:04.749> get<00:01:04.869> more<00:01:05.079> extension<00:01:05.770> on

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
that's where you get more extension on

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.800 
that's where you get more extension on
both<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.340> sole<00:01:06.639> of<00:01:06.819> it<00:01:06.969> and<00:01:07.119> on<00:01:07.539> the<00:01:07.630> negative

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
both the sole of it and on the negative

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.449 
both the sole of it and on the negative
side<00:01:08.229> so<00:01:08.259> you're<00:01:08.590> gonna<00:01:08.679> get<00:01:08.950> a<00:01:09.130> little<00:01:09.369> bit

00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:09.459 
side so you're gonna get a little bit

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:10.919 
side so you're gonna get a little bit
better<00:01:09.549> grinding<00:01:09.999> surface<00:01:10.179> on<00:01:10.539> there<00:01:10.749> which

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:10.929 
better grinding surface on there which

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:12.569 
better grinding surface on there which
helps<00:01:11.200> with<00:01:11.289> your<00:01:11.319> lock<00:01:11.619> ins<00:01:11.889> and<00:01:12.100> if<00:01:12.459> you're

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
helps with your lock ins and if you're

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:14.010 
helps with your lock ins and if you're
gonna<00:01:12.670> be<00:01:12.850> end<00:01:12.969> up<00:01:13.060> doing<00:01:13.270> fishes<00:01:13.689> or<00:01:13.840> anything

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
reduction in slide speed though so it's

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.649 
reduction in slide speed though so it's
great<00:01:20.920> set<00:01:21.639> up<00:01:21.729> to<00:01:21.819> go<00:01:21.969> if<00:01:22.119> it<00:01:22.240> is<00:01:22.329> a<00:01:22.359> little<00:01:22.539> bit

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
great set up to go if it is a little bit

about this skate that I want to point
out<00:01:54.159> is<00:01:54.399> the<00:01:54.639> change<00:01:54.939> to<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.450> liner<00:01:55.810> they<00:01:56.709> went

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:56.889 
out is the change to the liner they went

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:58.049 
out is the change to the liner they went
with<00:01:57.009> a<00:01:57.039> little<00:01:57.219> bit<00:01:57.429> different<00:01:57.700> set<00:01:57.849> up<00:01:57.939> on

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:58.059 
with a little bit different set up on

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:59.609 
with a little bit different set up on
the<00:01:58.149> line<00:01:58.299> of<00:01:58.329> this<00:01:58.509> time<00:01:58.779> no<00:01:58.989> longer<00:01:59.020> are<00:01:59.499> they

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
the line of this time no longer are they

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.429 
the line of this time no longer are they
using<00:01:59.950> Phoenix<00:02:00.309> liner<00:02:00.549> this<00:02:00.789> is<00:02:00.849> called<00:02:01.209> the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
using Phoenix liner this is called the

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.260 
using Phoenix liner this is called the
USD<00:02:02.439> basic<00:02:03.249> liner<00:02:03.489> although<00:02:04.029> there<00:02:04.179> really

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
USD basic liner although there really

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.749 
USD basic liner although there really
isn't<00:02:04.450> anything<00:02:05.079> too<00:02:05.499> basic<00:02:05.919> about<00:02:06.130> it<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.429> want

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
isn't anything too basic about it I want

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.369 
isn't anything too basic about it I want
to<00:02:06.849> show<00:02:07.119> you<00:02:07.179> here<00:02:07.539> it's<00:02:07.929> a<00:02:08.050> little<00:02:08.289> bit

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
to show you here it's a little bit

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.559 
to show you here it's a little bit
thicker<00:02:08.649> in<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.159> sidewalls<00:02:09.579> so<00:02:10.269> not<00:02:10.420> only

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
thicker in the sidewalls so not only

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.000 
thicker in the sidewalls so not only
will<00:02:10.689> that<00:02:10.719> be<00:02:10.929> support<00:02:11.409> but<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.650> also<00:02:11.739> gives

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
will that be support but it also gives

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.760 
will that be support but it also gives
you<00:02:12.069> more<00:02:12.099> comfort

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
you more comfort

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.800 
you more comfort
and<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.550> actual<00:02:14.030> tongue<00:02:14.390> has<00:02:14.630> been

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
and the actual tongue has been

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.450 
and the actual tongue has been
reinforced<00:02:15.320> in<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.500> front<00:02:15.770> here<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.160> you're

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
reinforced in the front here so you're

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.580 
reinforced in the front here so you're
going<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.640> get<00:02:16.760> less<00:02:16.970> lace<00:02:17.600> bite<00:02:17.900> as<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.290> flex

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
going to get less lace bite as you flex

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.530 
going to get less lace bite as you flex
so<00:02:19.130> great<00:02:19.430> overall<00:02:19.700> changes<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.330> liner

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
so great overall changes to the liner

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.900 
so great overall changes to the liner
it's<00:02:20.810> nice<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.140> comfortable<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.710> again<00:02:22.250> will

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
it's nice and comfortable and again will

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.540 
it's nice and comfortable and again will
fit<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.150> lot<00:02:23.300> of<00:02:23.390> different<00:02:23.690> foot<00:02:23.810> shapes<00:02:24.550> last

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
fit a lot of different foot shapes last

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.650 
fit a lot of different foot shapes last
