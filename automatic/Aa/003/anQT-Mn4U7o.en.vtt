00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.420
 hello everyone welcome to lethal 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.950
 crisis' today I come to talk to you as you see 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.260
 here from the tail rather than talking 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.270
 do an experiment but let's 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.639
 introduce a little of the subject 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.699
 supposedly the cocacola as we 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:19.330
 try to make believe with your advertising is 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:21.070
 a soda that gives joy to life is 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.320
 as a friend already in our life more than 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.630
 the whole house of the closeness that we have 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.210
 in this soda that is so much taken 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.289
 although it should not be the truth because 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.989
 is very good 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.390
 and there's a lot of talk about it in 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.370
 around which good before I used to 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.350
 clean the blood of accidents 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.100
 car right now is used to clean 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.550
 or to remove rust oxidation 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.519
 screws and is supposedly composed 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.480
 only water giant scents 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.480
 sugar 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.640
 and little more and good 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.020
 Well, there was also a lot of clear talk about the 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.750
 secret formula of the valves that 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.010
 nobody knows it in theory but we 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.720
 what are we going to do is going to be a bottle 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.220
 of two liters of alcohol we're going to 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.680
 put in a pot and we're going to 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.760
 heat until it evaporates what is 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.040
 all the water and all the gas that goes and 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.360
 let's see what's left in the background in 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.340
 quality if it's sugar 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.770
 obviously it will not be white that the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.780
 had black color of the tail but 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.159
 let's see what's left in the background of 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.020
 the pot so let's go there 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.759
 well then we are here with a 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.170
 200 people bottle with what 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.409
 first thing we'll have to do is going to be 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.749
 pour it into the pot 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.999
 to warm it does not need to 

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:39.999
 very strong fire so let's go there 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.579
 Well, what we have here are 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.799
 two liters of coca cola that to my liking 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.689
 it does not look very appetizing in these 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.480
 moments the truth so we 've already 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.940
 put to heat here we have 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.800
 so let's wait a few minutes or 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.770
 a few hours I do not know how long it will take for 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.900
 evaporate everything and you will see the quantities 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.560
 of sugar left in the background you see 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.709
 that is already bubbling 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.330
 in a while in a few hours we return good 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.599
 Well having passed approximately 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.870
 about three hours fixed with what we 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.330
 we have found that I do not know very well how 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.160
 call us the truth I imagine that in your 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.950
 most part as I said before would be 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.160
 composed of sugar but I'm also not 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.810
 very sure it 's a very strange mass 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.810
 similar to oil 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.159
 It costs to move 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.190
 well as oil as I say and good 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.980
 look 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.810
 How is a soda that 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.380
 supposedly it is water as is 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.000
 cocacola good flavorings more etcetera 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.660
 but after all, it's supposed to be 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.560
 water look at what we find when 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.780
 We evaporate what is really water 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.140
 look every time we take two liters of 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.410
 coca cola fixes 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.450
 what we take 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.580
 now I'm going to put some more shots 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.850
 so you can see what it really is 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.230
 when you see Coca-Cola but you'll have 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.700
 simoncito to the desire to continue drinking 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.700
 jackson this at least 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.290
 Well evidently although I have already done 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.599
 before this was sugar I can not say 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.909
 very well of what is done I think that the 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.590
 viscosity is achieved by sugar 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.049
 that contains the water with which you can see 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.889
 which is a lot but apart from that no 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:12.079
 I can not even imagine how much 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:13.609
 components that the cocacola will carry 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:17.319
 will take this dough that stays here 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.319
 when what is water has evaporated 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.360
 so I really can not say very 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:25.280
 well what is this mass composed of 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.229
 although according to I could not discover it by 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.229
 some method that I can not reach 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.980
 would interest the truth that good if 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.220
 you know something more about this dough you can 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.220
 comment 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.820
 well we have here a shot of this 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.590
 same mass which slips from 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.730
 you see that now it is directly 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.730
 like oil 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.070
 and good to finish the video here you can 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.800
 see how I've solidified here a little bit of 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.050
 that comment from under which I do not know very 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.689
 well what is it but not knowing what I want 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:06.089
 go back to drink that drink sometime 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:06.089
 you see that it is a bit strange 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.450
 and this is an extreme good about 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.150
 alcohol has been the effort on the 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.820
 silver paper is that good to give already has 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.320
 a color like that looked like the tail 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.170
 as I say very lightning 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.290
 and I will also say a data when 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.630
 knew or warmed the big tail in the 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:30.250
 kitchen my kitchen furniture are from 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:34.420
 wood and wood as you already know is 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.980
 covered with varnish to protect it then 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:40.700
 the vapors of the lime with which 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:43.070
 evaporated have made a very function 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.560
 corrosive on my furniture rather 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.900
 about the varnish of my furniture and have 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.250
 disintegrated the whole band in all the 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.020
 neighborhood and for when I wanted to realize 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.120
 the furniture of my kitchen the wood of my 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.070
 kitchen was full as a kind 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.080
 of half melted balls that 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.140
 creator slipped the varnish that had 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.200
 been corroded by these vapors that almost 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:08.360
 it could be called cocacola toxic 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.040
 so I do not expect you to understand a 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.610
 little of what is this drink then 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.610
 call it like that 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.099
 and nothing 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:20.060
 I hope you liked it and until another 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.060
 goodbye
