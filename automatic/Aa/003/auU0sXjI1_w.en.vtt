today<00:00:04.370> we're<00:00:04.550> going<00:00:04.640> to<00:00:04.730> do<00:00:05.300> a<00:00:05.330> case<00:00:05.630> that<00:00:05.899> I

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:05.960 
today we're going to do a case that I

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.179 
today we're going to do a case that I
think<00:00:06.230> you'll<00:00:06.350> find<00:00:06.529> interesting<00:00:06.770> it's

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
think you'll find interesting it's

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:09.310 
think you'll find interesting it's
actually<00:00:07.580> a<00:00:07.610> relatively<00:00:08.240> complex<00:00:08.660> case<00:00:08.990> where

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
actually a relatively complex case where

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.930 
actually a relatively complex case where
there<00:00:09.500> are<00:00:09.680> four<00:00:10.010> teeth<00:00:10.520> we're<00:00:10.850> gonna

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
there are four teeth we're gonna

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.870 
there are four teeth we're gonna
lengthen<00:00:11.650> from<00:00:12.650> the<00:00:12.860> patient's<00:00:13.309> left<00:00:13.490> central

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
lengthen from the patient's left central

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.330 
lengthen from the patient's left central
back<00:00:14.120> to<00:00:14.300> the<00:00:14.389> first<00:00:14.630> premolar<00:00:15.050> and<00:00:15.440> then

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
back to the first premolar and then

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.370 
back to the first premolar and then
there's<00:00:17.060> also<00:00:17.240> some<00:00:17.390> eroded<00:00:17.900> areas<00:00:18.170> on<00:00:18.290> the

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
there's also some eroded areas on the

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.380 
there's also some eroded areas on the
enamel<00:00:18.590> that<00:00:18.830> we'll<00:00:18.980> be<00:00:19.130> building<00:00:19.730> back<00:00:20.060> out

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
enamel that we'll be building back out

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.019 
enamel that we'll be building back out
on<00:00:20.900> the<00:00:20.960> facial<00:00:21.619> and<00:00:22.130> all<00:00:22.670> this<00:00:22.789> will<00:00:22.939> be<00:00:23.000> done

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
on the facial and all this will be done

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.210 
on the facial and all this will be done
with<00:00:23.180> freehand<00:00:23.720> bonding<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:24.380> I<00:00:24.859> think<00:00:25.100> we'll

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
with freehand bonding and I think we'll

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.769 
with freehand bonding and I think we'll
get<00:00:25.400> a<00:00:25.430> very<00:00:25.730> nice<00:00:26.090> improvement<00:00:26.600> for<00:00:26.689> this

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
get a very nice improvement for this

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.359 
get a very nice improvement for this
patient<00:00:27.199> it<00:00:27.619> will<00:00:27.740> also<00:00:27.980> do<00:00:28.100> a<00:00:28.130> little

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
patient it will also do a little

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.880 
patient it will also do a little
cosmetic<00:00:28.850> contouring<00:00:29.539> on<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:29.720> lower<00:00:29.930> for<00:00:30.349> a

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
cosmetic contouring on the lower for a

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.400 
cosmetic contouring on the lower for a
pretty<00:00:31.580> dramatic<00:00:31.939> change<00:00:32.269> where<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.170> teeth

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
pretty dramatic change where the teeth

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.320 
pretty dramatic change where the teeth
have<00:00:33.559> worn<00:00:33.800> and<00:00:33.949> evenly<00:00:34.220> on<00:00:34.940> this<00:00:35.120> patient

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330 
have worn and evenly on this patient

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.209 
have worn and evenly on this patient
we'll<00:00:35.690> deal<00:00:36.290> with<00:00:36.320> occlusion<00:00:36.829> a<00:00:36.890> little<00:00:37.100> bit

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
we'll deal with occlusion a little bit

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.030 
we'll deal with occlusion a little bit
and<00:00:37.660> end<00:00:38.660> up<00:00:38.870> with<00:00:39.140> an<00:00:39.380> overall<00:00:39.829> better

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
and end up with an overall better

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.569 
and end up with an overall better
aesthetic<00:00:41.000> and<00:00:41.180> functional<00:00:41.480> situation<00:00:45.579> okay

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
aesthetic and functional situation okay

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.560 
aesthetic and functional situation okay
so<00:00:46.640> we've<00:00:47.000> got<00:00:47.030> a<00:00:47.239> little<00:00:48.010> piece<00:00:49.039> shaped<00:00:50.000> or

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
so we've got a little piece shaped or

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.590 
so we've got a little piece shaped or
pea-sized<00:00:51.079> up<00:00:51.530> part<00:00:52.070> portion<00:00:52.789> of<00:00:53.149> the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
pea-sized up part portion of the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.819 
pea-sized up part portion of the
microphone<00:00:53.989> composite<00:00:54.559> in<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:55.640> b0i<00:00:56.710> also<00:00:57.710> do

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
microphone composite in the b0i also do

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.119 
microphone composite in the b0i also do
this<00:00:57.949> in<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:58.250> b1<00:00:59.350> I'll<00:01:00.350> just<00:01:00.530> take<00:01:00.680> a<00:01:00.710> mylar

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
this in the b1 I'll just take a mylar

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.749 
this in the b1 I'll just take a mylar
strip<00:01:01.520> set<00:01:02.090> it<00:01:02.210> across<00:01:02.570> these<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.580> push<00:01:04.580> it

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
strip set it across these and push it

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.270 
strip set it across these and push it
down<00:01:04.789> so<00:01:05.360> that<00:01:05.390> I<00:01:05.509> create<00:01:06.050> a<00:01:06.080> polished<00:01:06.649> or<00:01:06.920> more

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
down so that I create a polished or more

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.149 
down so that I create a polished or more
shiny<00:01:07.700> surface<00:01:08.240> on<00:01:08.450> these<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:09.590> then<00:01:10.040> we'll

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
shiny surface on these and then we'll

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.340 
shiny surface on these and then we'll
just<00:01:10.280> Curie<00:01:10.610> to<00:01:10.729> unfor<00:01:11.240> about<00:01:11.420> ten<00:01:11.659> seconds<00:01:12.170> I

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
just Curie to unfor about ten seconds I

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.000 
just Curie to unfor about ten seconds I
tried<00:01:13.189> to<00:01:13.900> push<00:01:14.900> that<00:01:14.930> mylar<00:01:15.500> strip<00:01:15.680> down<00:01:15.799> in<00:01:15.950> a

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
tried to push that mylar strip down in a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.950 
tried to push that mylar strip down in a
way<00:01:16.130> that<00:01:16.159> I'll<00:01:16.460> have<00:01:16.640> one<00:01:16.909> portion<00:01:17.750> of<00:01:17.840> this

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
way that I'll have one portion of this

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.770 
way that I'll have one portion of this
little<00:01:18.200> customized<00:01:18.770> Shay<00:01:18.920> tab<00:01:19.159> that's<00:01:19.340> thin

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
little customized Shay tab that's thin

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.030 
little customized Shay tab that's thin
another<00:01:20.780> portion<00:01:21.080> that's<00:01:21.380> thicker<00:01:21.680> so<00:01:22.009> that

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
another portion that's thicker so that

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.420 
another portion that's thicker so that
the<00:01:22.479> thickness<00:01:23.479> of<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.869> material<00:01:24.369> can<00:01:25.369> be

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
the thickness of the material can be

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.510 
the thickness of the material can be
used<00:01:25.939> to<00:01:26.740> judge<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.950> shade<00:01:28.189> as<00:01:28.310> well<00:01:30.520> all

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
used to judge the shade as well all

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.039 
used to judge the shade as well all
right<00:01:31.580> now<00:01:32.060> again<00:01:32.360> this<00:01:32.540> template<00:01:32.900> has<00:01:32.990> been

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
right now again this template has been

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.260 
right now again this template has been
setting<00:01:33.530> in<00:01:33.619> a<00:01:33.740> dark<00:01:34.070> area<00:01:34.280> we've<00:01:34.549> placed<00:01:35.060> it

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
setting in a dark area we've placed it

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.380 
setting in a dark area we've placed it
in<00:01:35.360> a<00:01:35.450> drawer<00:01:36.070> and<00:01:37.070> then<00:01:37.700> it's<00:01:37.850> carefully

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
in a drawer and then it's carefully

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.539 
in a drawer and then it's carefully
positioned<00:01:39.170> if<00:01:39.470> you<00:01:39.560> are<00:01:39.680> using<00:01:39.920> any<00:01:40.130> sort<00:01:40.490> of

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
positioned if you are using any sort of

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.270 
positioned if you are using any sort of
bite<00:01:41.500> block<00:01:42.500> we<00:01:42.740> want<00:01:42.920> to<00:01:42.979> make<00:01:43.100> certain

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
bite block we want to make certain

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.039 
bite block we want to make certain
that's<00:01:43.579> out<00:01:43.700> of<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.880> way<00:01:44.000> before<00:01:44.060> we<00:01:44.540> come<00:01:44.900> in

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
that's out of the way before we come in

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.590 
that's out of the way before we come in
with<00:01:45.170> this<00:01:45.380> step<00:01:45.820> it's<00:01:46.820> also<00:01:46.939> important<00:01:47.540> that

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
with this step it's also important that

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.410 
with this step it's also important that
in<00:01:47.810> approximately<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:49.759> material<00:01:50.210> in<00:01:50.329> the

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
in approximately the material in the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.730 
in approximately the material in the
template<00:01:50.780> was<00:01:50.960> not<00:01:52.030> over<00:01:53.170> between<00:01:54.170> one<00:01:54.530> tooth

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
template was not over between one tooth

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.280 
template was not over between one tooth
and<00:01:54.920> another<00:01:55.420> and<00:01:56.420> then<00:01:56.540> as<00:01:56.689> at<00:01:56.869> its<00:01:57.020> place

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
and another and then as at its place

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.209 
and another and then as at its place
I'll<00:01:57.649> use<00:01:57.829> this<00:01:59.079> other<00:02:00.079> cosmid<00:02:00.680> instrument

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
I'll use this other cosmid instrument

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.660 
I'll use this other cosmid instrument
which<00:02:01.369> is<00:02:01.520> called<00:02:01.759> a<00:02:01.880> multi-use<00:02:02.509> instrument

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
which is called a multi-use instrument

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.059 
which is called a multi-use instrument
to<00:02:05.560> shape<00:02:06.560> this

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:16.420 

Composite<00:02:10.069> now

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.580 

want<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.150> allow<00:02:17.390> space<00:02:17.659> for<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.290> facial

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
want to allow space for the facial

layers that I'll be using but I want
this<00:02:22.849> to<00:02:22.909> completely<00:02:23.569> create<00:02:24.019> the<00:02:24.230> lingual
