do get the digi card as well included
but<00:00:59.289> let's<00:00:59.949> have<00:01:00.219> a<00:01:00.280> look<00:01:00.370> at<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.940> figure

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
but let's have a look at the figure

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.469 
but let's have a look at the figure
first<00:01:01.480> how<00:01:01.870> cool<00:01:02.199> is<00:01:02.800> that<00:01:03.190> a<00:01:03.640> lots<00:01:03.969> going<00:01:04.239> on

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
first how cool is that a lots going on

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.170 
first how cool is that a lots going on
with<00:01:04.660> this<00:01:04.869> and<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.890> lots<00:01:06.220> of<00:01:06.399> colors<00:01:06.759> as<00:01:06.970> well

holes in both hands we have the tail
sticking<00:01:18.430> out<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:18.939> rear<00:01:19.090> we<00:01:19.210> do<00:01:19.360> have

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
sticking out to the rear we do have

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.140 
sticking out to the rear we do have
moving<00:01:20.710> limbs<00:01:21.130> as<00:01:21.310> well<00:01:21.490> so<00:01:21.670> you<00:01:21.729> can<00:01:21.850> move<00:01:22.030> the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
moving limbs as well so you can move the

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.990 
moving limbs as well so you can move the
head<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.900> arms<00:01:23.380> will<00:01:23.530> move<00:01:23.560> as<00:01:23.920> well<00:01:24.070> under

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
head the arms will move as well under

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.120 
head the arms will move as well under
the<00:01:25.119> legs<00:01:25.479> and<00:01:25.869> it<00:01:25.930> is<00:01:26.080> one<00:01:26.290> of<00:01:26.409> the<00:01:26.530> meteor

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
the legs and it is one of the meteor

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.530 
the legs and it is one of the meteor
figures<00:01:27.490> of<00:01:27.640> all<00:01:27.729> it<00:01:27.850> feels<00:01:28.060> bigger<00:01:28.329> because

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
figures of all it feels bigger because

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.149 
figures of all it feels bigger because
it<00:01:28.780> is<00:01:28.990> a<00:01:29.200> combined<00:01:30.159> figure<00:01:30.460> x<00:01:30.850> 4<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.829> there<00:01:33.040> you

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
it is a combined figure x 4 so there you

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.300 
it is a combined figure x 4 so there you
have<00:01:33.310> it<00:01:33.460> very<00:01:33.840> very<00:01:34.840> cool<00:01:35.110> this<00:01:35.380> will<00:01:36.040> measure

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
have it very very cool this will measure

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.539 
have it very very cool this will measure
6<00:01:36.790> centimeters<00:01:37.689> in<00:01:38.170> height<00:01:38.229> and<00:01:38.979> there<00:01:39.189> is<00:01:39.369> the

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
6 centimeters in height and there is the

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.990 
6 centimeters in height and there is the
proof<00:01:39.790> of<00:01:40.060> that<00:01:40.509> now<00:01:41.290> you<00:01:41.350> can<00:01:41.860> use<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.610> digit

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
proof of that now you can use the digit

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.590 
proof of that now you can use the digit
code<00:01:43.149> in<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.960> dizzy<00:01:44.409> fusion<00:01:45.130> loader<00:01:45.640> you<00:01:46.390> can

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
code in the dizzy fusion loader you can

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.210 
code in the dizzy fusion loader you can
see<00:01:46.780> we<00:01:46.869> have<00:01:47.020> these<00:01:47.200> numbers<00:01:47.409> on<00:01:47.829> the<00:01:48.040> front

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
see we have these numbers on the front

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.880 
see we have these numbers on the front
so<00:01:48.369> I'll<00:01:48.490> bring<00:01:48.700> that<00:01:48.880> in<00:01:49.090> we<00:01:49.570> have<00:01:49.689> 1<00:01:50.020> 2<00:01:50.439> 3<00:01:50.470> 4

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
so I'll bring that in we have 1 2 3 4

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.520 
so I'll bring that in we have 1 2 3 4
and<00:01:51.610> that<00:01:51.880> is<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.210> code<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.630> unlock<00:01:52.810> the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
and that is the code to unlock the

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.160 
and that is the code to unlock the
Shoutmon<00:01:54.070> Fusion<00:01:54.909> a<00:01:55.090> phrase<00:01:55.390> so<00:01:55.780> all<00:01:55.930> you<00:01:56.020> need

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
Shoutmon Fusion a phrase so all you need

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.380 
Shoutmon Fusion a phrase so all you need
to<00:01:56.290> do<00:01:56.409> is<00:01:57.159> put<00:01:57.430> these<00:01:57.549> cards<00:01:57.880> in<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.390> loader

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
to do is put these cards in the loader

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:11.430 
to do is put these cards in the loader
it's<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.479> game<00:02:01.689> out<00:02:01.990> with<00:02:02.140> 1<00:02:02.350> 2<00:02:03.159> 3<00:02:07.140> 2<00:02:08.140> 3<00:02:10.260> and<00:02:11.260> there

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
it's a game out with 1 2 3 2 3 and there

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.039 
it's a game out with 1 2 3 2 3 and there
you<00:02:11.500> go<00:02:11.680> that<00:02:12.310> is<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.730> phrase<00:02:12.970> is<00:02:13.239> unlocks

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
you go that is the phrase is unlocks
