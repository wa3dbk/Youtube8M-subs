00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.110
 In the United States, thirteen out of twenty cans are recycled. 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.330
 What proportion of cans are recycled? 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.305
 If thirteen of the twenty cans are recycled. 

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:17.625
 If thirteen on twenty, 

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:27.930
 It can be written thirteen divided by twenty, or thirteen by twenty. 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.679
 If we do this, we will get a decimal fraction, 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.970
 The decimal fraction can be converted to 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.670
 Percentage directly. 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.060
 Thirteen division of twenty. 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.260
 In this case, divide the smaller number 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.050
 On the largest number. 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.805
 If we get a value less than one true. 

00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:44.680
 And because we will get a value less than one, 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.580
 I'll put a decimal point here. 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.250
 I will add some zeros, 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.970
 As much as we need. 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.590
 We can say: Twentieth in the number thirteen times zero. 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.980
 Zero hit twenty equals zero. 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.340
 Now thirteen minus minus equals thirteen. 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.030
 Now let us down this zero. 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.660
 Now there are twenty in the hundred and thirty? 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.280
 Lennar, there is - five hit twenty equals one hundred. 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.730
 Six struck twenty equals one hundred and twenty. 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.430
 If it repeats six times. 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.950
 Six struck twenty equals one hundred and twenty. 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.280
 Subtract. 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.590
 And get ten. 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.600
 Let us go down another zero. 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.780
 Twentieth times are repeated five times in the 100th number. 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.830
 Five hit twenty equals a hundred. 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.140
 So are you here? 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.400
 This written as a decimal fraction, is sixty-five percent. 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.980
 A decimal fraction is sixty-five of a hundred. 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.910
 If we want to write it as a percentage 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.920
 We must multiply it by a hundred. 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.490
 Or, you can move the decimal point 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.540
 By two places to the right. 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.930
 This will equal sixty-five percent. 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.890
 Now, there is another way to solve. 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.240
 You can say, literally% means literally 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.770
 Per hundred. 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:08.060
 Thirteen out of twenty equals (what) a hundred? 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.970
 To convert twenty to a hundred - lance rugs. 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.870
 To convert twenty to one hundred, hit it in five. 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.880
 Let's hit the rugs in five as well. 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.360
 Thirteen struck five, for Len, fifteen plus fifty, and equal sixty-five. 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.519
 This method is faster 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.060
 To resolve, especially if considered 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.100
 Conversion from twenty to one hundred is easy. 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.420
 Because you hit the number by five. 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.575
 We can do the same with Thirteen. 

00:02:32.575 --> 00:02:34.580
 Thus we get sixty-five on a hundred, 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.572
 It is the same as the sixty-five, 

00:02:37.572 --> 00:02:40.290
 Let me write a percent symbol - sixty-five percent. 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.450
 For reminders only, the ratio literally means 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.080
 Per hundred, sixty-five percent.
