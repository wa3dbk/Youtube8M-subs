be really cool another change wheres

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.250 
be really cool another change wheres
noting<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.480> guess<00:00:18.630> there<00:00:18.750> was<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> change<00:00:19.109> to

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
noting is I guess there was a change to

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.160 
noting is I guess there was a change to
brawler<00:00:19.760> where<00:00:20.760> brawler<00:00:21.150> one<00:00:21.480> no<00:00:21.689> longer<00:00:21.840> has

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
brawler where brawler one no longer has

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.679 
brawler where brawler one no longer has
the<00:00:22.380> additional<00:00:22.740> modded<00:00:23.369> melee<00:00:23.699> hit<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.570> only

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
the additional modded melee hit it only

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.990 
the additional modded melee hit it only
has<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.140> health<00:00:25.380> regained<00:00:25.949> from<00:00:26.430> each<00:00:26.580> male<00:00:26.910> a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
has the health regained from each male a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.939 
has the health regained from each male a
hit<00:00:27.210> whereas<00:00:27.869> brawler<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.349> stays<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.800> same

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
hit whereas brawler to stays the same

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.519 
hit whereas brawler to stays the same
honestly<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.640> think<00:00:30.240> that's<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.720> very<00:00:30.990> welcome

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
honestly I think that's a very welcome

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.900 
honestly I think that's a very welcome

that<00:00:32.940> would<00:00:33.090> just<00:00:33.239> run<00:00:33.329> around<00:00:33.480> with<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.840> Mata

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
that would just run around with the Mata

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.549 
that would just run around with the Mata
to<00:00:34.290> buy<00:00:34.440> for<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> entire<00:00:35.160> game<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:36.559> we're
