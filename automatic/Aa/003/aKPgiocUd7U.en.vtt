it to give motivation because I know

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.200 
it to give motivation because I know

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
football they don't like exercise so I

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.630 
football they don't like exercise so I
look<00:01:32.280> for<00:01:33.110> motivation<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.920> take<00:01:35.250> more

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
look for motivation and we can take more

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.140 
look for motivation and we can take more
from<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.210> players<00:01:36.540> if<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.590> use<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.280> ball<00:01:38.520> in

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
from the players if you use the ball in

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.270 
from the players if you use the ball in
the<00:01:39.360> exercise<00:01:39.960> well<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> think<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:40.979> terms<00:01:41.009> of

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
the exercise well I think in terms of

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.260 
the exercise well I think in terms of
coming<00:01:41.460> from<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.700> break<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.060> know<00:01:42.180> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
coming from the break you know you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.819 
coming from the break you know you
always<00:01:42.540> lose<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.750> bit<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:42.990> fitness<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.680> main

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
always lose a bit of fitness so the main

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.170 
always lose a bit of fitness so the main
problem<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.369> get<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.610> back<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.909> know<00:01:45.030> and

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
problem is to get it back you know and

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.910 
problem is to get it back you know and
it's<00:01:45.329> always<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.600> lot<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.899> work<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:46.890> a

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
it's always a lot of work and it's a

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.590 
it's always a lot of work and it's a
type<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.130> training<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.579> we<00:01:47.670> did<00:01:47.909> understands

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
type of training that we did understands

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.760 
type of training that we did understands
the<00:01:48.750> type<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.020> training<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.470> will<00:01:49.649> never

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
the type of training that you will never

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.200 
the type of training that you will never
do<00:01:50.040> when<00:01:50.250> you're<00:01:50.369> on<00:01:50.490> your<00:01:50.670> own<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:51.060> know<00:01:51.180> you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
do when you're on your own you know you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.179 
do when you're on your own you know you
will<00:01:51.390> never<00:01:51.540> push<00:01:51.810> yourself<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.350> far<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.950> has

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
will never push yourself that far it has

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.740 
will never push yourself that far it has
been<00:01:53.220> tough<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.000> think<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.329> players<00:01:54.659> who

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
been tough and I think that players who

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.389 
been tough and I think that players who
encourage<00:01:55.110> each<00:01:55.200> other<00:01:55.439> nobody<00:01:56.070> except

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
encourage each other nobody except

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.550 
encourage each other nobody except
outdoor<00:01:56.790> was<00:01:57.000> too<00:01:57.149> tired<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.600> woken<00:01:57.960> up<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.320> I

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
outdoor was too tired and woken up so I

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.770 
outdoor was too tired and woken up so I
think<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.130> was<00:01:59.250> good<00:01:59.430> having<00:01:59.759> experienced<00:02:00.689> a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
think it was good having experienced a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.660 
think it was good having experienced a
fitness<00:02:01.079> training<00:02:01.380> like<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.219> terms<00:02:02.520> of

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
fitness training like that in terms of

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.880 
fitness training like that in terms of
the<00:02:02.790> training<00:02:03.000> ID<00:02:03.390> poured<00:02:03.719> into<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.560> board<00:02:04.799> in

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
the training ID poured into the board in

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.950 
the training ID poured into the board in
another<00:02:05.159> dimension<00:02:05.430> inter<00:02:06.149> came<00:02:06.450> which<00:02:06.780> I

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
another dimension inter came which I

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.330 
another dimension inter came which I
thought<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.619> was<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> positive<00:02:08.009> thing<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.610> was

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
thought it was a positive thing and was

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.859 
thought it was a positive thing and was
because<00:02:09.759> if<00:02:09.880> some<00:02:10.030> keep<00:02:10.239> us<00:02:10.390> in<00:02:10.509> good<00:02:10.690> shape

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
because if some keep us in good shape

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.850 
because if some keep us in good shape
for<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.380> remainder<00:02:11.680> of<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.890> season<00:02:13.860> balance

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
for the remainder of the season balance

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.890 
for the remainder of the season balance
is<00:02:15.099> required<00:02:15.250> on<00:02:15.670> camp<00:02:15.970> if<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.360> train<00:02:16.599> twice<00:02:16.840> a

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
is required on camp if you train twice a

mentally and physically between sessions

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.390 
mentally and physically between sessions

because<00:02:36.640> they<00:02:36.849> soften<00:02:37.239> up<00:02:37.360> my<00:02:37.540> muscles<00:02:37.750> you

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
because they soften up my muscles you

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.690 
because they soften up my muscles you
know<00:02:38.200> after<00:02:38.440> two<00:02:38.590> training<00:02:38.950> sessions<00:02:39.310> we<00:02:39.580> have

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
know after two training sessions we have

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.610 
know after two training sessions we have
a<00:02:39.760> few<00:02:39.970> hours<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.300> rest<00:02:40.330> we<00:02:40.630> train<00:02:40.870> again<00:02:41.170> where

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
a few hours of rest we train again where

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.930 
a few hours of rest we train again where
the<00:02:41.739> massaging<00:02:42.190> comes<00:02:42.370> in<00:02:42.549> I<00:02:42.640> think<00:02:42.850> it's

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
the massaging comes in I think it's

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.759

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
muscles wherever there's a slight knock

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.800 
muscles wherever there's a slight knock
or<00:02:48.100> easily<00:02:48.430> that's<00:02:49.030> important<00:02:49.480> for<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.690> body

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810
