00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.930 
toggle SSH and you hit enable and it
should<00:04:26.950> work<00:04:26.980> I'm<00:04:27.430> going<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.670> do<00:04:27.760> a<00:04:27.790> little

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
should work I'm going to do a little

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.410 
should work I'm going to do a little
test<00:04:28.180> here<00:04:28.680> to<00:04:29.790> hopefully<00:04:30.790> improve<00:04:30.880> myself

test here to hopefully improve myself

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.180 
test here to hopefully improve myself
right<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:32.050> not<00:04:32.590> waste<00:04:32.830> this<00:04:33.010> whole<00:04:33.430> video<00:04:33.730> on
