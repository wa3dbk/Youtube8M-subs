00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.930
 today I'm going to make a change snack in 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:22.000
 reality is a dinner disguised as a local 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:22.000
 because I'm not going to take it 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.390
 families have television in the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.180
 room where they meet to fight that 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.530
 TV show want to see instead 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:37.230
 singles we have television 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.239
 and this was what decided me to start it 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.350
 to watch the game Pick my 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.629
 home because 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.660
 we all know what it really means 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.940
 when they invite you to watch TV a aldo 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.670
 driving is super always go in 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.219
 super league I never lose hope that 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.500
 the exuberant nature of the fruits 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.079
 the vegetables find me a handsome 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.049
 bachelor who asks me to pass a 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.600
 good papaya although I wondered if I 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:07.860
 like more wide or long chili 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.360
 this is my recipe for wings sauce buffalo 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.220
 I want to help, I do it with strips of 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.220
 breast and sauce valentina 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.270
 I'm going to see 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:29.540
 and that I love jae tempers 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.140
 ay I noticed your card 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.090
 Aztec bank credit did not pass 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.540
 poor thing that is so distressed with his 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.660
 beer carton and his chelas 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.990
 and there is nothing sexier 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:48.050
 their miserable names and how I am 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.050
 Good Samaritan woman, I said no 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.350
 worry and / or payment are strong numbers 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.690
 I was not going to miss the opportunity 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.290
 then he very kindly took me away 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.909
 watch the game with your friends 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.640
 or 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.649
 I was two hours dead of cold and 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.410
 bored on the court of your fast color 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:13.690
 seeing as his team the athletic one of 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.690
 portals called the opposing team 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.950
 good 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.540
 l 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.630
 To accompany the chicken, a 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:34.360
 piece of cheese and yogurt two spoons 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.930
 of mayonnaise a bit of fresh grass 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.720
 that we have dust because in this case 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.590
 I have a little cilantro and all the 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.620
 smoothies 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.530
 'it does not have its very round participation 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.390
 sexy and she thinks herself an athlete because she plays 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.390
 soccer every Wednesday 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.769
 this day he got all the goals and not 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.810
 he knew what to tell me he just approached and 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:05.319
 he offered me a chela I told him you know 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.319
 prefer a Cuba 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:12.580
 because while I saw you I could only 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.580
 think about rock and roll 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.010
 he smiled like a five year old boy and 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.170
 hovering he approached from kiss on the 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.170
 vocation in front of all his friends 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.060
 love 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.379
 Hi, I'm from sheep, I know what 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.379
 do 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:51.610
 or I'm going to score goal mom without needing 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.610
 the languages my brother-in-law's friends 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.150
 when the chicken is golden it turns off 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.390
 pan and here comes the trick you throw 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:05.019
 a little square of butter and do not forget 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.480
 to put the valentina sauce nothing can 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.629
 fail we will be in bed eating 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.849
 and drinking and we all know that nothing 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.550
 excites a man more than a woman who 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:19.709
 he knows football 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:22.630
 but my opinion is because you know more than 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:26.610
 he loses interest 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:31.410
 if he wins the elections to celebrate then 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:35.160
 the anyway we're going to finish 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.160
 exchanging shirts 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.080
 success is in anticipation 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.419
 I bought coca 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.790
 and I can not load a guard
