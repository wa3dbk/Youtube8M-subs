the crank just the turning of the pedals

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.160 
the crank just the turning of the pedals
it's<00:00:50.739> so<00:00:51.190> smooth<00:00:51.610> and<00:00:52.239> just<00:00:52.420> this<00:00:52.630> great<00:00:52.870> sense

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
it's so smooth and just this great sense

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.110 
it's so smooth and just this great sense
of<00:00:53.410> every<00:00:54.160> bit<00:00:54.340> of<00:00:54.370> energy<00:00:54.579> that<00:00:54.850> I'm<00:00:54.940> putting

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
of every bit of energy that I'm putting

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.970 
of every bit of energy that I'm putting
into<00:00:55.360> the<00:00:55.480> pedal<00:00:55.630> stroke<00:00:55.870> is<00:00:56.410> going<00:00:56.500> right

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
into the pedal stroke is going right

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.950 
into the pedal stroke is going right
into<00:00:57.190> this<00:00:57.340> bike<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:58.180> I'm<00:00:58.630> not<00:00:58.780> wasting

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
into this bike and I'm not wasting

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.110 
into this bike and I'm not wasting
anything<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.980> just<00:01:00.160> that<00:01:00.280> smoothness<00:01:00.820> just

anything and just that smoothness just

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.549 
anything and just that smoothness just
gives<00:01:01.300> you<00:01:01.360> this<00:01:01.450> real<00:01:01.750> sense<00:01:02.020> of<00:01:02.260> control

the<00:01:04.449> other<00:01:04.600> thing<00:01:04.899> is<00:01:05.259> we<00:01:05.439> put<00:01:05.649> this<00:01:05.770> Ram<00:01:06.130> right

00:01:06.419 --> 00:01:06.429 
the other thing is we put this Ram right

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:09.419 
the other thing is we put this Ram right
on<00:01:06.579> this<00:01:06.759> bike<00:01:07.030> this<00:01:07.479> Ram<00:01:07.780> bread<00:01:08.020> is<00:01:08.679> probably

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:09.429 
on this bike this Ram bread is probably

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:11.940 
on this bike this Ram bread is probably
the<00:01:10.060> top<00:01:10.299> of<00:01:10.509> the<00:01:10.569> line<00:01:10.780> in<00:01:11.109> the<00:01:11.229> mechanical

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
the top of the line in the mechanical

the top of the line in the mechanical
shifting<00:01:12.639> these<00:01:12.789> days<00:01:13.090> they've<00:01:13.509> got<00:01:13.749> this<00:01:13.869> new

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
shifting these days they've got this new

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.739 
shifting these days they've got this new
system<00:01:14.259> at<00:01:14.530> shrimp<00:01:14.799> called<00:01:15.340> SRAM<00:01:15.609> 22<00:01:16.119> you're

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:16.749 
system at shrimp called SRAM 22 you're

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:18.120 
system at shrimp called SRAM 22 you're
used<00:01:16.929> to<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.139> doubles<00:01:17.469> in<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.619> past<00:01:17.889> where

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
used to the doubles in the past where

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.529 
used to the doubles in the past where
you<00:01:18.219> have<00:01:18.369> that<00:01:18.490> like<00:01:18.700> weird<00:01:18.999> middle<00:01:19.179> shift

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
you have that like weird middle shift

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:21.120 
you have that like weird middle shift
they've<00:01:19.840> eliminated<00:01:20.079> that<00:01:20.619> because<00:01:20.979> the

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
they've eliminated that because the

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.980 
they've eliminated that because the
derailleur<00:01:21.459> is<00:01:21.700> wide<00:01:21.939> enough<00:01:22.119> to<00:01:22.450> take<00:01:22.659> in<00:01:22.840> the

derailleur is wide enough to take in the
whole<00:01:23.020> range<00:01:23.439> of<00:01:23.649> gearing<00:01:23.979> here<00:01:24.490> they've<00:01:24.670> kind

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
whole range of gearing here they've kind

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.660 
whole range of gearing here they've kind

of struck this perfect balance the 52:36

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.300 
of struck this perfect balance the 52:36
gives<00:01:28.329> you<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.509> full<00:01:28.749> range<00:01:28.780> of<00:01:29.200> gears<00:01:29.439> to<00:01:30.130> make

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
gives you a full range of gears to make

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.010 
gives you a full range of gears to make
up<00:01:30.459> for<00:01:30.609> the<00:01:30.670> fact<00:01:30.880> that<00:01:31.060> this<00:01:31.389> ring<00:01:31.659> here<00:01:31.959> is

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
up for the fact that this ring here is

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.660 
up for the fact that this ring here is
not<00:01:32.170> quite<00:01:32.439> as<00:01:32.649> small<00:01:32.920> as<00:01:33.130> what<00:01:33.279> you<00:01:33.369> get<00:01:33.520> on<00:01:33.639> a

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
not quite as small as what you get on a

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.120 
not quite as small as what you get on a
compact<00:01:34.149> they've<00:01:34.899> added<00:01:35.350> two<00:01:35.560> teeth<00:01:35.829> on<00:01:36.039> the

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
compact they've added two teeth on the

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.830 
compact they've added two teeth on the
big<00:01:36.310> ring<00:01:36.520> here<00:01:36.819> so<00:01:36.999> you<00:01:37.090> have<00:01:37.119> a<00:01:37.240> 28<00:01:37.600> that

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
big ring here so you have a 28 that

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.260 
big ring here so you have a 28 that
comes<00:01:38.049> standard<00:01:38.350> with<00:01:38.529> it<00:01:38.969> so<00:01:39.969> that's<00:01:40.149> your

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
comes standard with it so that's your

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.969 
comes standard with it so that's your
hill<00:01:40.420> climbing<00:01:40.689> gear<00:01:41.049> you<00:01:41.499> know<00:01:41.619> it's<00:01:41.829> not

hill climbing gear you know it's not

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.709 
hill climbing gear you know it's not
double<00:01:42.340> triple<00:01:42.579> but<00:01:42.939> the<00:01:43.149> bike<00:01:43.359> that<00:01:43.569> weighs

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
double triple but the bike that weighs

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:46.050 
double triple but the bike that weighs
15<00:01:44.289> pounds<00:01:44.319> you're<00:01:45.310> not<00:01:45.490> gonna<00:01:45.609> need<00:01:45.849> that

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
15 pounds you're not gonna need that

feeling you know when you're designing a
break<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:16.129> one<00:02:16.310> problem<00:02:16.580> can<00:02:16.849> be<00:02:17.000> like

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
break the one problem can be like

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.820

they're<00:02:17.510> too<00:02:17.720> grippy<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:18.319> squeeze<00:02:18.650> in

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
they're too grippy and you squeeze in

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.259 
they're too grippy and you squeeze in
the<00:02:18.920> bike<00:02:19.099> kind<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.400> jerks<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.879> as<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.120> come

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
the bike kind of jerks you as you come

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.150 
the bike kind of jerks you as you come
to<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.420> stop<00:02:20.540> or<00:02:21.290> if<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:21.620> don't<00:02:21.709> have<00:02:21.860> enough

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
to a stop or if you don't have enough

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.100 
to a stop or if you don't have enough
power<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.519> you<00:02:22.640> can't<00:02:22.879> stop<00:02:23.180> it's<00:02:23.390> no<00:02:23.540> good<00:02:23.810> so

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
power and you can't stop it's no good so

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.960 
power and you can't stop it's no good so
they've<00:02:24.769> done<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.010> great<00:02:25.190> thing<00:02:25.280> kind<00:02:25.849> of

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.309 
they've done a great thing kind of
splitting<00:02:26.299> the<00:02:26.420> difference<00:02:26.540> on<00:02:26.900> these<00:02:26.989> brakes

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
splitting the difference on these brakes

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.970 
splitting the difference on these brakes
so<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.910> squeeze<00:02:29.120> them<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:29.900> as<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.680> pull<00:02:30.950> it

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
so you squeeze them and as you pull it

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.770 
so you squeeze them and as you pull it
kind<00:02:31.250> of<00:02:31.280> comes<00:02:31.549> to<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.730> nice<00:02:31.910> smooth<00:02:32.239> stuff<00:02:32.569> we

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
have a sense of control but it's not

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.030 
have a sense of control but it's not
jerky<00:02:35.150> in<00:02:35.239> any<00:02:35.420> way<00:02:35.629> so<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.319> really<00:02:36.739> liked<00:02:36.950> that
