00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.860
 hello good afternoon everyone and welcome 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.920
 to this small micro comparative between 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.900
 the tablet of lenovo and you tie me or my 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.340
 boss depending on the country where you live and 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.150
 the first generation ipad mini 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.250
 presented in October 2012 we have already 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.750
 done a little more comparative 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.730
 extensive so now what are we going to 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.710
 do is going to be a micro comparative 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.120
 for those who want to leave a little 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.220
 doubts about the differences between 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.100
 both tablets on the one hand we have the 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.290
 Lenovo tablet that comes with a 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.470
 pretty affordable price of 130 euros and 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.870
 4.2 good android comes out with 4.1 but it 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.629
 You can upgrade to 4.2 as system 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.610
 operative on the other hand we have the ipad 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.489
 mini although a price is presented 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.380
 rather higher than 330 euros what 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.040
 they are 200 euros more than what it costs 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.159
 Lenovo tablet and arrives with IOS 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.090
 upgradeable to ios 7.0 that comes out 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.149
 week 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.189
 well, other differences 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.600
 notorious here we are faced with a 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.880
 7-inch screen versus a 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.619
 8-inch screen the resolution of 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.319
 this screen is a bit smaller than the 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.990
 lenovo tablet is 1024 x 600 pixels 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:34.959
 while the resolution of the ipad mini 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.959
 it is 1024 x 768 pixels 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.800
 and more things the panel is 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.780
 significantly different not 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.520
 only by its size but also by 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.090
 its visualization as we can see with the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.090
 mini sword 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.960
 the an as a function of the angle of vision 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.270
 more or less we see the same but with the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.540
 Lenovo tablet this is not the case 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.000
 Look, we rotate a bit and it shows 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.290
 that it costs a little more 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.420
 viewing the content well 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.360
 otherwise other differences at the level 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.880
 of hardware 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.710
 are that here we have a processor 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.030
 double core and here we also have 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.180
 a dual core but 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.819
 just an apple a5 processor and 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.939
 here an arm cortex a9 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.790
 more things the front camera is 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:28.180
 substantially different this one has a 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.730
 vga resolution of the tablet lenovo 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:36.069
 while the ipad mini presents a 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.650
 front camera with an HD resolution 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.520
 when making video conferences the 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.700
 difference is noted not so much but it shows 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.620
 following on the hardware side in the 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.910
 Lenovo tablet we do not have a camera 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.700
 rear 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.560
 while on the ipad mini if we 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.460
 we found before a rear camera of 5 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.870
 megapixels 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:03.110
 and video recording in hd well once 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:08.290
 said this the differences between both 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:12.560
 tablets that should be highlighted are therefore the 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:15.110
 weight and that is the the mini act has a 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.810
 weight of 312 grams the truth that 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:22.040
 practically not noticed while the 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.240
 Lenovo tablet arrives with 340 grams not 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.740
 However, ergonomics is also 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.750
 different because it's a tablet 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.760
 of 7 inches we can for example 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.250
 hold with one hand 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.650
 without big problems while the 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.370
 ipad mini we can not hold it 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.470
 completely with one hand 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.890
 well at least one with my hand 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.700
 because it's 8 inches in size 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.940
 level of the load of pages because no 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.090
 they have big differences let's do 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.180
 a little test here we're going to open the 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.260
 same page in both 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.260
 on both tablets 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.880
 and let's see which one takes longer to open it 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.490
 then in 3 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.190
 2 when it finishes loading I'm going to 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.690
 click on the next button and 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.940
 let's see how long it takes to load a 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.940
 page that is a bit of a nightmare 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.360
 as we see the ipad mini is a little more 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.800
 Quick 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.410
 well significantly faster to the 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.820
 time to load pages however is 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.130
 Of course there is also a difference 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.800
 of substantial price between both with what 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.380
 which you can save 200 euros if 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.820
 you prefer and do not mind waiting three or 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.729
 four are two more for each load of 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.539
 page 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.830
 otherwise we really are not going to 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.419
 compare much more to our 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.559
 characteristics that we have already done in 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:55.809
 another comparison and then nothing if they want 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:57.849
 follow thoroughly you can see the other one 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:05:01.020
 to enter my gadget world dotcom and 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.020
 nothing until the next
