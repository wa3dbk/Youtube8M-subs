3a for modern history acetal has really

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.730 
3a for modern history acetal has really
been<00:00:15.760> understanding<00:00:16.539> the<00:00:16.720> key<00:00:16.900> themes<00:00:17.320> of<00:00:17.619> the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
been understanding the key themes of the

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.040 
been understanding the key themes of the
course<00:00:17.770> and<00:00:18.400> that<00:00:18.880> was<00:00:19.090> quite<00:00:19.360> hard<00:00:19.419> to<00:00:19.750> nail

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
course and that was quite hard to nail

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.990 
course and that was quite hard to nail
that<00:00:20.289> to<00:00:20.680> know<00:00:20.800> how<00:00:20.919> what<00:00:21.160> put<00:00:21.490> the<00:00:21.579> key<00:00:21.730> themes

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
that to know how what put the key themes

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.730 
that to know how what put the key themes
of<00:00:22.180> the<00:00:22.300> course<00:00:22.329> was<00:00:22.779> so<00:00:22.930> basically<00:00:23.320> I<00:00:23.439> think<00:00:23.560> I

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
of the course was so basically I think I

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.929 
of the course was so basically I think I
could<00:00:23.890> explain<00:00:24.220> this<00:00:24.340> by<00:00:24.520> giving<00:00:24.759> you<00:00:24.849> an

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
could explain this by giving you an

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.170 
could explain this by giving you an
example<00:00:25.270> we<00:00:25.509> stand<00:00:25.779> in<00:00:25.869> America<00:00:26.349> between<00:00:27.180> 1919

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
example we stand in America between 1919

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.299 
example we stand in America between 1919
and<00:00:28.210> 1941<00:00:28.960> that<00:00:29.200> was<00:00:29.320> our<00:00:29.439> national<00:00:29.590> state<00:00:30.099> and

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:30.309 
and 1941 that was our national state and

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:32.910 
and 1941 that was our national state and
so<00:00:31.059> our<00:00:31.210> teacher<00:00:31.480> was<00:00:31.719> very<00:00:31.960> much<00:00:32.200> of<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:32.890> view

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
so our teacher was very much of the view

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.590 
so our teacher was very much of the view
that<00:00:33.250> you<00:00:33.370> should<00:00:33.520> approach<00:00:33.820> your<00:00:34.059> notes<00:00:34.390> you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
that you should approach your notes you

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.270 
that you should approach your notes you
should<00:00:34.750> approach<00:00:35.050> this<00:00:35.320> course<00:00:35.649> by<00:00:35.860> trying<00:00:36.160> to

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
should approach this course by trying to

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.340 
should approach this course by trying to
figure<00:00:36.550> out<00:00:36.670> what<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.360> big<00:00:37.600> idea<00:00:37.750> is<00:00:38.110> up

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
figure out what the big idea is up

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.540 
figure out what the big idea is up
because<00:00:38.530> at<00:00:38.800> the<00:00:38.890> end<00:00:38.920> of<00:00:39.129> the<00:00:39.219> day<00:00:39.340> that's

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
because at the end of the day that's

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.520 
because at the end of the day that's
what<00:00:39.760> they'll<00:00:39.910> be<00:00:39.940> examining<00:00:40.450> you<00:00:40.510> are<00:00:40.719> so<00:00:41.379> one

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
what they'll be examining you are so one

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.110 
what they'll be examining you are so one
of<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.710> big<00:00:41.860> ideas<00:00:42.010> in<00:00:42.280> that<00:00:42.430> period<00:00:42.940> for

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
of the big ideas in that period for

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.380 
of the big ideas in that period for
example<00:00:43.240> was<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:44.860> role<00:00:45.070> of<00:00:45.250> big<00:00:45.430> business<00:00:45.850> in

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
example was the role of big business in

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.140 
example was the role of big business in
creating<00:00:46.930> prosperity<00:00:47.170> within<00:00:48.130> America<00:00:48.579> so<00:00:49.030> we

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
creating prosperity within America so we

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.580 
creating prosperity within America so we
would<00:00:49.300> have<00:00:49.450> that<00:00:49.630> as<00:00:49.840> I<00:00:49.989> guess<00:00:50.200> one<00:00:50.380> of<00:00:50.470> our

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
would have that as I guess one of our

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.410 
would have that as I guess one of our
key<00:00:50.800> headings<00:00:51.190> and<00:00:51.430> then<00:00:51.880> we<00:00:52.030> would<00:00:52.150> make

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
key headings and then we would make

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.210 
key headings and then we would make
notes<00:00:52.750> corresponding<00:00:53.500> to<00:00:53.620> that<00:00:53.739> really

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
notes corresponding to that really

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.700 
notes corresponding to that really
having<00:00:54.520> a<00:00:54.640> strong<00:00:55.200> fundamental<00:00:56.200> grassroots

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
having a strong fundamental grassroots

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.920 
having a strong fundamental grassroots
understanding<00:00:57.460> of<00:00:57.610> what<00:00:58.120> those<00:00:58.329> key<00:00:58.630> themes

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
understanding of what those key themes

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.410 
understanding of what those key themes
entail<00:00:59.460> another<00:01:00.460> one<00:01:00.640> would<00:01:00.880> be<00:01:01.060> in<00:01:01.270> that

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
entail another one would be in that

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.209 
entail another one would be in that
period<00:01:01.780> conservatism<00:01:02.680> or<00:01:03.390> isolationism

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:11.160 

deregulation<00:01:09.219> key<00:01:09.820> aspects<00:01:10.240> like<00:01:10.450> that<00:01:10.659> big

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
deregulation key aspects like that big

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.590 
deregulation key aspects like that big
ideas<00:01:11.680> but<00:01:12.310> they<00:01:12.490> all<00:01:12.729> sort<00:01:13.000> of<00:01:13.090> linking

ideas but they all sort of linking

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.300 
ideas but they all sort of linking
together<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:14.259> when<00:01:14.409> an<00:01:14.530> essay<00:01:14.830> question<00:01:14.979> did

together and when an essay question did
come<00:01:15.340> up<00:01:15.610> you<00:01:15.729> could<00:01:15.880> effectively<00:01:16.240> write<00:01:16.600> your

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
come up you could effectively write your

this thing this thing this thing this
thing<00:01:22.630> of<00:01:22.750> this<00:01:22.870> thing<00:01:23.140> and<00:01:23.320> you've<00:01:23.770> known<00:01:23.979> so

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
thing of this thing and you've known so

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.130 
thing of this thing and you've known so
much<00:01:24.549> about<00:01:24.790> each<00:01:25.030> one<00:01:25.060> of<00:01:25.299> them<00:01:25.540> they<00:01:25.900> can

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
much about each one of them they can

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.050 
much about each one of them they can
effectively<00:01:26.530> adapt<00:01:26.979> them<00:01:27.220> to<00:01:27.369> any<00:01:27.520> question

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
effectively adapt them to any question

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.030 
effectively adapt them to any question
so<00:01:28.720> my<00:01:28.900> necks<00:01:29.110> but<00:01:29.320> one<00:01:29.470> in<00:01:29.560> history

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
so my necks but one in history

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.530 
so my necks but one in history
interestingly<00:01:30.369> enough<00:01:30.700> were<00:01:30.970> much<00:01:31.150> shorter

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
interestingly enough were much shorter

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.789 
interestingly enough were much shorter
than<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.780> other<00:01:31.900> subjects<00:01:32.350> they<00:01:32.470> were<00:01:32.530> really

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
than the other subjects they were really

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.070 
than the other subjects they were really
focusing<00:01:33.340> on<00:01:33.520> these<00:01:34.030> key<00:01:34.330> themes<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:34.750> I<00:01:34.840> found

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
focusing on these key themes and I found

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.350 
focusing on these key themes and I found
that<00:01:35.200> in<00:01:35.530> focusing<00:01:36.250> on<00:01:36.400> this<00:01:36.520> Kipling<00:01:36.970> budget

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
that in focusing on this Kipling budget

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.969 
that in focusing on this Kipling budget
address<00:01:37.810> all<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.080> points<00:01:38.380> of<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.590> syllabus

like<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.470> mean<00:03:22.710> ridiculous

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
like I mean ridiculous

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.220 
like I mean ridiculous
but<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.000> was<00:03:24.120> just<00:03:24.300> quite<00:03:24.690> cool<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.050> was

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
but it was just quite cool it was

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.890 
but it was just quite cool it was
something<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:25.680> really<00:03:26.660> gave<00:03:27.660> your

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
something that really gave your

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.660 
something that really gave your
marketing<00:03:28.320> from<00:03:28.500> yeah<00:03:28.650> hey<00:03:29.040> we're<00:03:29.310> here<00:03:29.460> and

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
marketing from yeah hey we're here and

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.800 
marketing from yeah hey we're here and
then<00:03:29.820> that<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.090> would<00:03:30.210> actually<00:03:30.330> thought

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
then that you would actually thought

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.080 
then that you would actually thought
about<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.800> other<00:03:31.950> thing<00:03:32.220> was<00:03:32.400> if

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
about it and the other thing was if

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.070 
about it and the other thing was if
you're<00:03:33.270> talking<00:03:33.480> about<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.930> organization

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
you're talking about the organization

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.930 
you're talking about the organization
talking<00:03:34.710> about<00:03:34.980> something<00:03:35.280> as<00:03:35.400> simple<00:03:35.550> as<00:03:35.790> the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
talking about something as simple as the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.330 
talking about something as simple as the
growth<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.180> skyscrapers<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:38.010> know<00:03:38.130> the

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
growth of skyscrapers you know the

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.100 
growth of skyscrapers you know the
importance<00:03:38.940> of<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.150> elevator<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:39.630> mean<00:03:39.810> people

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
importance of the elevator I mean people

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.810 
importance of the elevator I mean people
don't<00:03:40.200> really<00:03:40.530> consider<00:03:40.890> that<00:03:41.040> but<00:03:41.610> in

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
don't really consider that but in

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.580 
don't really consider that but in
hindsight<00:03:42.210> reading<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.080> actually<00:03:43.230> does

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
hindsight reading that it actually does

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.080 
hindsight reading that it actually does
make<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:43.830> lot<00:03:44.070> of<00:03:44.100> sense<00:03:44.280> in<00:03:44.460> the<00:03:44.550> context<00:03:45.000> of

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
make a lot of sense in the context of

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.030 
make a lot of sense in the context of
what<00:03:45.240> we<00:03:45.360> were<00:03:45.450> studying

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
what we were studying

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.980 
what we were studying
little<00:03:47.040> things<00:03:47.220> like<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.670> it's<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.660> fairly

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
little things like that it's a fairly

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.510 
little things like that it's a fairly
the<00:03:49.140> static<00:03:49.680> process<00:03:50.160> going<00:03:50.400> through

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
the static process going through

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.030 
the static process going through
readings<00:03:51.360> looking<00:03:51.780> for<00:03:51.990> that<00:03:52.110> that<00:03:52.350> nice<00:03:52.620> fact

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
readings looking for that that nice fact

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.060 
readings looking for that that nice fact
if<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.340> like<00:03:53.550> but<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:55.230> way<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.710> and<00:03:55.830> you

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
if you like but the way that you and you

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.830 
if you like but the way that you and you
have<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.460> be<00:03:56.550> able<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.760> memorize<00:03:56.880> less<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.720> the

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
have to be able to memorize less and the

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.690 
have to be able to memorize less and the
stuff<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.170> do<00:03:58.290> memorize<00:03:58.710> is<00:03:58.890> super<00:03:59.370> quality

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
stuff you do memorize is super quality

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.320 
stuff you do memorize is super quality
yeah<00:04:00.210> ok<00:04:00.690> it's<00:04:00.870> not<00:04:01.050> and<00:04:01.350> so<00:04:02.070> as<00:04:02.820> part<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.270> that

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
yeah ok it's not and so as part of that

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.320 
yeah ok it's not and so as part of that
with<00:04:03.630> it<00:04:03.780> also

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
with it also

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.090 
with it also
which<00:04:04.840> star<00:04:05.140> into<00:04:05.320> perspective<00:04:05.530> you've<00:04:05.920> been

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
which star into perspective you've been

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.460 
which star into perspective you've been
including<00:04:06.460> that<00:04:06.610> in<00:04:06.910> your<00:04:07.300> notes<00:04:07.540> as<00:04:07.720> well<00:04:07.900> all

this photo yeah there this to schools
that<00:04:13.060> I<00:04:13.180> thought<00:04:13.390> definitely<00:04:14.050> do<00:04:14.200> it

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
that I thought definitely do it

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.670 
that I thought definitely do it
historiography<00:04:14.920> you<00:04:15.820> know<00:04:15.970> Taylor<00:04:16.840> says<00:04:17.350> such

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
historiography you know Taylor says such

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.920 
historiography you know Taylor says such
and<00:04:17.860> such<00:04:18.100> about<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.880> origins<00:04:19.360> of<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.630> Second

World War
having<00:04:21.040> said<00:04:21.220> that<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:21.370> don't<00:04:21.489> think<00:04:21.790> it's

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
having said that I don't think it's

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.760 
having said that I don't think it's
enough<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.300> just<00:04:22.330> name<00:04:22.750> drop<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.350> throw<00:04:23.650> the

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
enough to just name drop and throw the

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.020 
enough to just name drop and throw the
BT<00:04:24.010> right<00:04:24.160> so<00:04:24.250> know<00:04:24.460> there<00:04:24.610> are<00:04:24.700> some<00:04:24.850> teachers

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
BT right so know there are some teachers

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.700 
BT right so know there are some teachers
that<00:04:25.240> absolutely<00:04:25.690> hated<00:04:26.110> with<00:04:26.200> their<00:04:26.350> passion

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
that absolutely hated with their passion

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.650 
that absolutely hated with their passion
I<00:04:26.920> think<00:04:27.400> it's<00:04:27.550> good<00:04:27.790> actually<00:04:27.970> at<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.420> end<00:04:28.450> of

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
I think it's good actually at the end of

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.390 
I think it's good actually at the end of
your<00:04:28.780> essay<00:04:28.930> perhaps<00:04:29.410> before<00:04:29.800> a<00:04:29.830> conclusion

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
your essay perhaps before a conclusion

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.030 
your essay perhaps before a conclusion
to<00:04:30.430> say<00:04:30.790> Taylor<00:04:31.540> are<00:04:31.840> you<00:04:32.020> such<00:04:32.290> and<00:04:32.530> such<00:04:32.740> and

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
to say Taylor are you such and such and

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.950 
to say Taylor are you such and such and
even<00:04:33.640> maybe<00:04:33.790> disagree<00:04:34.360> with<00:04:34.480> and<00:04:34.570> what<00:04:34.720> post

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
even maybe disagree with and what post

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.870 
even maybe disagree with and what post
potential<00:04:35.440> issues<00:04:35.800> with<00:04:35.830> warnings<00:04:36.370> abuse<00:04:36.700> are

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
potential issues with warnings abuse are

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.640 
potential issues with warnings abuse are
occurring<00:04:37.330> within<00:04:37.510> and<00:04:37.840> then<00:04:38.170> state<00:04:38.380> your<00:04:38.410> own

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
occurring within and then state your own

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.530 
occurring within and then state your own
reasons<00:04:39.040> for<00:04:39.340> agreeing<00:04:39.820> so<00:04:39.970> I<00:04:40.000> think<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.420> need

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
reasons for agreeing so I think you need

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.840 
reasons for agreeing so I think you need
to<00:04:40.600> bounce<00:04:40.900> off<00:04:41.250> historians<00:04:42.250> ideas<00:04:42.640> rather

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
to bounce off historians ideas rather

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.300 
to bounce off historians ideas rather
than<00:04:43.000> just<00:04:43.360> include<00:04:43.810> them<00:04:44.050> for<00:04:44.980> the<00:04:45.070> sake<00:04:45.280> of

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
than just include them for the sake of

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.340 
than just include them for the sake of
including<00:04:45.940> so<00:04:46.510> and<00:04:46.780> there<00:04:46.870> are<00:04:46.960> people<00:04:47.110> who

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
including so and there are people who

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.570 
including so and there are people who
may<00:04:47.500> have<00:04:47.530> names<00:04:47.800> up<00:04:48.040> as<00:04:48.190> well<00:04:48.400> that's

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
may have names up as well that's

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.070 
may have names up as well that's
probably<00:04:48.760> not<00:04:49.000> a<00:04:49.060> good<00:04:49.150> idea<00:04:49.360> right<00:04:49.660> that<00:04:49.990> they

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
probably not a good idea right that they

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.410 
probably not a good idea right that they
just<00:04:50.290> do<00:04:50.410> it<00:04:50.500> and<00:04:50.850> markers<00:04:51.850> don't<00:04:52.060> buy<00:04:52.210> into

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
just do it and markers don't buy into

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.520 
just do it and markers don't buy into
that<00:04:52.480> they<00:04:52.690> want<00:04:52.900> to<00:04:52.960> see<00:04:53.080> you're<00:04:53.230> actually

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
that they want to see you're actually

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.140 
that they want to see you're actually
using<00:04:53.770> it<00:04:54.040> rather<00:04:54.190> than<00:04:54.400> just<00:04:54.460> including<00:04:55.060> it

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
using it rather than just including it
