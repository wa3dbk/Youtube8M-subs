00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.340
 ok me, cara 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.050
 It's going to be really cool, you're going to be a 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.820
 just like this 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:16.940
 personally it will be a time to 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:19.550
 decoration on a path because 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.900
 the gold usually says in the interviews that 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.849
 one of the things that most influenced the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:29.570
 music was 1 and 2 nÃ© 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.970
 an influence there on that thing than 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.110
 be legal with instruments and the two that 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.750
 already played at the time so in 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.480
 great festivals I've had the opportunity 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.449
 of being on stage too large for 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.640
 A lot of people but okay, okay, I do not think so. 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.260
 It will be very cool the news was 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.440
 welcomed by all of us with very very 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:01:00.620
 very joyful comment very pleasure and 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:03.469
 people are focusing everything on me and said 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.810
 what is happening again already 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.520
 with the material will take advantage of this 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.710
 opportunity and disseminate banana 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.170
 seize or during pre and post 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.520
 festival is because it is a great 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.890
 opportunity but has a schedule 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.659
 country you also get there and touch 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.060
 your resume that touched here a 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.090
 very cool thing but I think this 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.200
 It's a bit of what people on our side are 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.329
 It's just like a big show that is 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.280
 fact a great show but one can find 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.270
 which may have other developments and is 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.329
 That's what we 're thinking about 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.329
 time 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.250
 is the chile was launched over a year 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.880
 and called for a very special appeal to the 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.399
 calm 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.229
 I have a big affection I think 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.149
 of the band if you liked a character from 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.119
 a personality who showed 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.219
 growth in artistic terms 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.810
 only unfortunately to know some 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.340
 things that got in the way a bit 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.789
 disclosure of the mount ne 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.530
 in the 80th year of the year, felipe left oma 8 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.819
 I came back from the problem in the voice 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.329
 finally that was an album that the 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.769
 people worked he 's live on the stage 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.950
 powder 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.840
 there was also not because the paul left the 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.230
 The band also first 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.239
 sickness account of his heart problem 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.250
 combining after his departure then it was 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.440
 a very turbulent period in any 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.970
 disk that I consider very good but the 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:31.989
 people can not judge him the way he 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:36.629
 I would consider it correct but only happens 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.629
 these things that are beyond our control 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.220
 but it is already in the truth at the moment 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.319
 working a new being and why now 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.359
 that the band of the new population 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.420
 working today that the government has not 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:51.549
 now they can understand how it is 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.950
 then it was actually that you insert 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.500
 a new composite whole produced 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.299
 matters are recorded but ariel whistle 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.700
 So the beginning of the second semester is 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.590
 with a new job, right? 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.690
 there we are going to tour with certainty of 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.310
 disclosure of this work, we ended up 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.810
 of songs following a routine in the 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.669
 makes split divide the entire career of the 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.290
 map 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:14.079
 but the focus now is a new job right? 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.940
 I think I love stupid people. 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.889
 not having touched so much is a book 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.419
 who do not argue the songs have a lot of 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.900
 force has a lot of power to be touched 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:25.239
 live I think I'm much better let's go well 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.329
 interesting but the circumstances 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.739
 did what we were not so many 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.180
 times to continue choosing 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.560
 We would wish right 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.620
 sure that blade to be 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.620
 different 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.010
 the row I think a lot of it, right? 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.840
 I also had the opportunity to play with 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:50.010
 several details that have to be willing 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.840
 and pleasure in playing several I performed 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.050
 I do not get much traveling said 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.930
 Load that I admire is a lot of good people. 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.670
 It's a guy I 'd like to play in. 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.470
 face to face what I think a lot 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.870
 beautiful what he plays I think he plays with 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.440
 category tastes great 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.540
 robert garcia they would certainly 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.420
 that I did not have this opportunity and that I 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.090
 I admire so much 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.730
 Let me see that more expensive 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.970
 If you were going to talk fast like that now 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.130
 first for example the scott 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.960
 harrison I 've already seen 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.450
 I already heard that it has already been touched 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.110
 times but I have never had the opportunity to 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.270
 make money with him is a guy who is 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.760
 a great influence is a guy who thinks 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.230
 that is only nearby is absorbing a lot of 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.480
 thing is not very musical is very 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:43.290
 different has the musical personality 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:46.080
 I really only care about you 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:49.050
 he would be one more and let's go there to close 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.010
 the 3 of this month to a guy that I still 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.770
 I did not have this contact so it would be 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.370
 very nice 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.370
 Oh really! 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:06.430
 water is only to follow the non-active 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.110
 I can think of the third goal and 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.590
 were to talk to talk just for talking is not 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.590
 truth 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.699
 the project is 2014 has a lot of people 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:21.400
 which is already starting now in 2013 and is 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:24.340
 will roll until 2014 for example studied 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.900
 marketing is announcing in 2014 will 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.570
 be launched in the second half of a 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:32.320
 Time and time to release this album. 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:35.290
 the right today is launching a whole series 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.740
 methodology of non-music teaching 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:42.340
 only to avoid more than musical theory 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.320
 harmony bass keyboard and battery 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:49.030
 these instruments plus materials 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.979
 Theoretical the guitar also this material 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.570
 teaching will be used not only in GPS 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.440
 three units in two and one in Brasilia 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.150
 floripa 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.919
 as in any other school of which 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.510
 they did this material material 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.360
 didactic with great differential 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.270
 great differentials is that they the fact 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.260
 I already saw in digital ipad format 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.120
 and iphone 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.010
 the video of each of the examples of 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.289
 phishing is being done very 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.350
 be very serious 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:22.870
 I think I'll talk 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:24.780
 I think when I see it is different from a 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.770
 lots of other things happening that 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.479
 some of them I can not speak because 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.419
 this was the one that were not released 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:33.970
 are mine but another participant who 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:35.289
 I can say that I have worked as 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:39.240
 always and song compositions 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:41.770
 instrumental I intend to release a solo CD 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.220
 are generated and marcelo's sheet 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.750
 Barbosa that for some time is not well 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.460
 be pushed forward because 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.830
 It always gives something else we have 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.900
 that giving priority in life I think 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:56.410
 things that are happening more force 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.880
 at this moment but I do not stop 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.610
 to work on that I have the songs to 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.220
 question of recording sounds 500 right? 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:06.099
 But there's a lot going on with me. 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.600
 I am sure that this issue of 

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:10.270
 methodology that I said 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.830
 eudes take is going to pay big part 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:16.090
 of the world of 2014 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:17.530
 the parallel I've always been inventing fashion 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.800
 You can not stop. 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.870
 the head is always a thousand times an hour and 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.290
 that only choose what is doing that one 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:28.570
 time because even with 14 practice 

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:32.770
 time the heavenly priorities and 

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:34.890
 demands see soon gets to have more 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.890
 news
