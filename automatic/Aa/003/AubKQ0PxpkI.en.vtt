holds and I believe the cartridges
weight<00:00:55.199> behind<00:00:55.500> here<00:00:56.809> although<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.170> might<00:00:58.470> be

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
weight behind here although I might be

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.329 
weight behind here although I might be
wrong<00:00:59.330> maybe<00:01:00.330> not<00:01:00.659> but<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.229> haven't<00:01:02.100> had<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
wrong maybe not but I haven't had to

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:03.859 
wrong maybe not but I haven't had to
change<00:01:02.400> the<00:01:02.760> cartridge<00:01:03.000> yet<00:01:03.449> white<00:01:03.659> it's

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:03.869 
change the cartridge yet white it's

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.080 
change the cartridge yet white it's
about<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.110> few<00:01:04.379> months<00:01:04.650> old<00:01:04.830> still<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:05.970> the
