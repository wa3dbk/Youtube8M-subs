but let's move on to the benchmarks so

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.260 
but let's move on to the benchmarks so
we<00:00:52.170> can<00:00:52.350> see<00:00:52.680> how<00:00:53.190> much<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.850> performance

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
we can see how much of a performance

00:00:54.270 --> 00:03:41.330 
we can see how much of a performance
difference<00:00:54.809> there<00:00:55.020> is

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.210 

there<00:03:42.340> you<00:03:42.790> have<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.390> as<00:03:43.510> you<00:03:43.900> saw<00:03:44.080> yourself

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
there you have it as you saw yourself

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.190 
there you have it as you saw yourself
these<00:03:45.220> are<00:03:45.280> some<00:03:45.880> really<00:03:46.210> good<00:03:46.540> results<00:03:46.750> from

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
these are some really good results from

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.100 
these are some really good results from

both processors all in all these two

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.620 
both processors all in all these two
CPUs<00:03:50.320> are<00:03:50.740> definitely<00:03:51.400> comparable<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:52.240> offer

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
CPUs are definitely comparable and offer

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.490

well it actually is newer but I mean the

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.920 
well it actually is newer but I mean the

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.230 
name already tells is based off the Ivy
Bridge<00:05:04.990> architecture<00:05:05.260> which<00:05:06.160> now<00:05:06.460> is<00:05:06.790> already

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
Bridge architecture which now is already

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.040 
Bridge architecture which now is already
older<00:05:07.930> however<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:09.190> 40<00:05:09.430> 20<00:05:09.820> K<00:05:10.030> supports<00:05:10.780> quad

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
older however the 40 20 K supports quad

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.100 
older however the 40 20 K supports quad
channel<00:05:11.320> memory<00:05:11.620> while<00:05:12.250> the<00:05:12.430> 47<00:05:13.090> 20k<00:05:13.480> only

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
channel memory while the 47 20k only

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.380 
channel memory while the 47 20k only
supports<00:05:14.560> dual<00:05:14.830> channel<00:05:15.340> therefore<00:05:16.150> you<00:05:16.240> can

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
supports dual channel therefore you can

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.150 
supports dual channel therefore you can
have<00:05:16.420> much<00:05:16.720> higher<00:05:16.900> Ram<00:05:17.200> capacities<00:05:17.860> if<00:05:18.040> you

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
have much higher Ram capacities if you

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.340 
have much higher Ram capacities if you
need<00:05:18.370> that<00:05:18.580> and<00:05:18.790> in<00:05:19.180> certain<00:05:19.450> applications

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
need that and in certain applications

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.860 
need that and in certain applications
you<00:05:20.830> will<00:05:20.980> really<00:05:21.670> benefit<00:05:22.210> from<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.600> quad

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
you will really benefit from the quad

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.500 
you will really benefit from the quad
channel<00:05:23.140> technology<00:05:23.730> the<00:05:24.730> power<00:05:24.940> consumption

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
channel technology the power consumption

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.980 
channel technology the power consumption
of<00:05:25.600> the<00:05:25.750> 40<00:05:26.020> 20<00:05:26.320> K<00:05:26.530> is<00:05:26.830> higher<00:05:27.520> but<00:05:28.090> the<00:05:28.210> 40<00:05:28.510> 20<00:05:28.810> K

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
of the 40 20 K is higher but the 40 20 K

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.440 
of the 40 20 K is higher but the 40 20 K
really<00:05:29.650> is<00:05:29.890> meant<00:05:30.130> for<00:05:30.220> overclocking<00:05:30.760> you

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
really is meant for overclocking you

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.940 
really is meant for overclocking you
really<00:05:31.780> don't<00:05:31.960> even<00:05:32.230> need<00:05:32.320> to<00:05:32.470> increase<00:05:32.770> the

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
really don't even need to increase the

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.970 
really don't even need to increase the
voltage<00:05:33.280> that<00:05:33.340> much<00:05:33.700> or<00:05:34.090> at<00:05:34.450> all<00:05:34.480> to<00:05:35.440> even<00:05:35.470> get

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
voltage that much or at all to even get

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.920 
voltage that much or at all to even get
to<00:05:36.250> 4.3<00:05:37.210> gigahertz

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
to 4.3 gigahertz

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.680 
to 4.3 gigahertz
and<00:05:38.020> that<00:05:38.710> overclock<00:05:39.250> blows<00:05:39.520> the<00:05:39.730> 47<00:05:40.420> decay

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
and that overclock blows the 47 decay

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.070 
and that overclock blows the 47 decay
away<00:05:40.930> already<00:05:41.860> and<00:05:42.190> the<00:05:42.640> good<00:05:42.880> thing<00:05:43.150> is<00:05:43.390> when

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
away already and the good thing is when

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.380 
away already and the good thing is when
not<00:05:44.380> increasing<00:05:45.010> the<00:05:45.130> voltage<00:05:45.310> the<00:05:46.030> power

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
not increasing the voltage the power

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.800 
not increasing the voltage the power
consumption<00:05:46.870> doesn't<00:05:47.560> grow<00:05:47.830> and<00:05:48.130> that's<00:05:48.550> good

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
consumption doesn't grow and that's good

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.159 
consumption doesn't grow and that's good
so<00:05:49.810> in<00:05:49.960> the<00:05:50.140> end<00:05:50.230> I'd<00:05:50.560> say<00:05:50.800> to<00:05:50.860> 4770k

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
so in the end I'd say to 4770k

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.850 
so in the end I'd say to 4770k
if<00:05:52.229> 40<00:05:52.560> 20<00:05:52.979> K<00:05:53.159> are<00:05:53.400> very<00:05:53.999> similar<00:05:54.539> the<00:05:54.930> 48<00:05:55.439> 20<00:05:55.680> K

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
if 40 20 K are very similar the 48 20 K

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.029 
if 40 20 K are very similar the 48 20 K
however<00:05:56.370> is<00:05:56.729> the<00:05:57.150> much<00:05:57.509> better<00:05:57.870> overclock

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
however is the much better overclock

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:01.279 
however is the much better overclock
it's<00:05:59.490> also<00:05:59.759> a<00:05:59.909> matter<00:06:00.120> of<00:06:00.360> how<00:06:00.749> much<00:06:01.020> you<00:06:01.169> can

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
it's also a matter of how much you can

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:02.450 
it's also a matter of how much you can
pay<00:06:01.499> for<00:06:01.529> the<00:06:01.800> motherboard

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
pay for the motherboard

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.640 
pay for the motherboard
once<00:06:02.969> again<00:06:03.120> we're<00:06:03.870> speaking<00:06:04.169> of<00:06:04.469> two

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
once again we're speaking of two

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.769 
once again we're speaking of two
different<00:06:05.039> platforms<00:06:05.759> the<00:06:06.150> mainstream

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:06.779 
different platforms the mainstream

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:09.439 
different platforms the mainstream
platform<00:06:07.289> and<00:06:07.499> the<00:06:07.740> extreme<00:06:08.189> platform<00:06:08.729> the

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
platform and the extreme platform the

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:11.719 
platform and the extreme platform the
mainstream<00:06:10.050> motherboards<00:06:10.499> for<00:06:10.529> TE<00:06:10.800> 4770k

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
mainstream motherboards for TE 4770k

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.510 
mainstream motherboards for TE 4770k
really<00:06:12.569> don't<00:06:12.779> cost<00:06:13.020> much<00:06:13.529> and<00:06:13.800> are<00:06:14.099> therefore

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
really don't cost much and are therefore

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.050 
really don't cost much and are therefore
pretty<00:06:15.509> affordable<00:06:15.900> the<00:06:16.650> 48<00:06:17.069> 20k<00:06:17.520> however

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
pretty affordable the 48 20k however

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.140 
pretty affordable the 48 20k however
requires<00:06:18.930> LGA<00:06:19.379> 2011<00:06:19.529> socket<00:06:20.069> boards<00:06:20.759> that

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
requires LGA 2011 socket boards that

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.019 
requires LGA 2011 socket boards that
obviously<00:06:21.870> cost<00:06:22.289> a<00:06:22.499> lot<00:06:22.620> more<00:06:22.759> so<00:06:23.759> which<00:06:23.999> of

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:24.029 
obviously cost a lot more so which of

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:26.719 
obviously cost a lot more so which of
these<00:06:24.360> two<00:06:24.419> processors<00:06:25.289> is<00:06:25.500> better<00:06:25.800> is<00:06:26.099> up<00:06:26.550> to

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
these two processors is better is up to

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:28.999 
these two processors is better is up to
your<00:06:26.879> needs<00:06:27.300> if<00:06:27.569> you<00:06:28.289> want<00:06:28.500> very<00:06:28.770> good

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:29.009 
your needs if you want very good

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:31.189 
your needs if you want very good
performance<00:06:29.430> while<00:06:30.090> still<00:06:30.509> maintaining<00:06:30.719> low

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 
performance while still maintaining low

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.159 
performance while still maintaining low
temperatures<00:06:31.919> then<00:06:32.610> go<00:06:32.969> for<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.240> 40<00:06:33.569> a<00:06:33.599> 20k

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
temperatures then go for the 40 a 20k

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.860 
temperatures then go for the 40 a 20k
and<00:06:34.439> overclock<00:06:35.340> it<00:06:35.370> I<00:06:35.759> really<00:06:36.599> hope<00:06:36.629> this

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
and overclock it I really hope this

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.070 
and overclock it I really hope this
