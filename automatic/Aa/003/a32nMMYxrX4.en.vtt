00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
so I just got my hands on the open

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.700 
so I just got my hands on the open
hardware<00:00:04.890> summit<00:00:05.520> badge<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:06.299> this<00:00:07.170> thing<00:00:07.440> is

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
hardware summit badge and this thing is

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.709 
hardware summit badge and this thing is
just<00:00:08.160> way<00:00:08.400> too<00:00:08.460> cool<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:09.179> had<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.840> share<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:11.719> it

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
just way too cool I had to share this it

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.589 
just way too cool I had to share this it
is<00:00:12.929> obviously<00:00:13.530> open-source<00:00:14.070> hardware<00:00:14.599> but

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
is obviously open-source hardware but

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.000 
is obviously open-source hardware but
the<00:00:15.750> thing<00:00:15.929> that's<00:00:16.080> really<00:00:16.260> nice<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:16.949> is

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
the thing that's really nice is this is

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.779 
the thing that's really nice is this is
an<00:00:17.310> e-ink<00:00:17.609> display<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.830> has<00:00:19.980> really<00:00:20.520> great

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
an e-ink display so it has really great

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.200 
an e-ink display so it has really great
contrast<00:00:21.830> really<00:00:22.830> nice<00:00:23.130> sharp<00:00:23.490> look<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.060> it

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
contrast really nice sharp look to it

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.450 
contrast really nice sharp look to it
and<00:00:24.359> being<00:00:25.109> inked<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.800> can<00:00:25.980> put<00:00:26.279> arbitrary

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
and being inked you can put arbitrary

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.310 
and being inked you can put arbitrary
stuff<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.210> here<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.779> gonna<00:00:27.900> come<00:00:28.109> loaded

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
stuff on here and it's gonna come loaded

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.209 
stuff on here and it's gonna come loaded
with<00:00:29.210> some<00:00:30.210> things<00:00:30.539> you'll<00:00:31.500> be<00:00:31.619> able<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:32.070> if

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
with some things you'll be able to if

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.100 
with some things you'll be able to if
you<00:00:32.369> wish<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.610> put<00:00:33.120> your<00:00:33.329> contact<00:00:33.719> information

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
you wish to put your contact information

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.080 
you wish to put your contact information
this<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> vCard<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.579> think<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.940> can

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
this is a vCard that I think you can

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.610 
this is a vCard that I think you can
scan<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.600> get<00:00:36.750> some<00:00:36.960> information<00:00:37.530> out<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:38.370> it

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
scan and get some information out of it

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.780 
scan and get some information out of it
we'll<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.739> different<00:00:40.920> images<00:00:41.489> for

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
we'll have different images for

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.340 
we'll have different images for
different<00:00:42.629> things<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.930> thought<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.260> was

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
different things I thought that was

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.529 
different things I thought that was
pretty<00:00:43.530> cool<00:00:43.710> but<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.730> thing<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.180> liked

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
pretty cool but the thing that I liked

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.069 
pretty cool but the thing that I liked
best<00:00:45.989> about<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.450> they<00:00:48.450> went<00:00:48.600> ahead<00:00:48.750> and

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
best about this is they went ahead and

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.209 
best about this is they went ahead and
loaded<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.920> schedule<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.410> I<00:00:55.410> went

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
loaded it with the schedule and I went

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.990 
loaded it with the schedule and I went
the<00:00:56.340> wrong<00:00:56.489> direction<00:01:00.289> so<00:01:01.309> if<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.520> was<00:01:02.730> wearing

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the wrong direction so if I was wearing

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.060 
the wrong direction so if I was wearing
the<00:01:03.300> badge<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.809> would<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.080> looking<00:01:04.409> down<00:01:04.680> at<00:01:04.920> it

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
the badge I would be looking down at it

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.810 
the badge I would be looking down at it
like<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:07.010> that<00:01:08.010> would<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.520> open

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
like this and that would be the open

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.000 
like this and that would be the open
hardware<00:01:09.030> summit<00:01:09.510> schedule<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.979> just

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
hardware summit schedule and I just

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.550 
hardware summit schedule and I just
thought<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.580> was<00:01:12.140> really<00:01:13.140> clever

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
thought that that was really clever

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.620 
thought that that was really clever
it's<00:01:14.070> loaded<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:14.670> last<00:01:15.150> year's<00:01:15.450> schedule

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
it's loaded with last year's schedule

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.749 
it's loaded with last year's schedule
but<00:01:18.630> being<00:01:19.140> able<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.470> load<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.950> with<00:01:20.159> useful

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
but being able to load this with useful

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.950 
but being able to load this with useful
information<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.540> pretty<00:01:21.979> pretty<00:01:22.979> nifty<00:01:23.960> so

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
information is pretty pretty nifty so

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.039 
information is pretty pretty nifty so
this<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:26.030> in<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.450> itself<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.710> Arduino<00:01:29.750> but<00:01:30.750> it

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
this is in of itself in Arduino but it

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.260 
this is in of itself in Arduino but it
can<00:01:31.200> also<00:01:31.350> act<00:01:31.710> as<00:01:31.829> an<00:01:32.009> Arduino<00:01:32.430> shield<00:01:32.759> if<00:01:33.090> you

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
can also act as an Arduino shield if you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.219 
can also act as an Arduino shield if you
wish<00:01:34.579> and<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:36.090> you've<00:01:36.240> got<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> nice<00:01:36.960> little

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
wish and then you've got a nice little

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.039 
wish and then you've got a nice little
ink<00:01:37.950> display<00:01:38.360> that<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.540> do<00:01:39.630> all<00:01:39.720> kinds<00:01:39.990> of

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
ink display that you can do all kinds of

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.140 
ink display that you can do all kinds of
stuff<00:01:40.110> with<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.640> yeah<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.939> just

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
stuff with it yeah this is just

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.740 
stuff with it yeah this is just
