00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.809
 how about friends say hello in this 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:10.130
 occasion I bring you the review of two of 

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:13.910
 the first two super saide trolleys 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.670
 of 2014 that is the chevrolet hs and of 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.710
 sound blaster these two carts are the 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:24.050
 first that will come out in the edition 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:27.169
 2013 2014 like this one with rims from 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.090
 gum the whole thing not sincerely 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.189
 I have been very disappointed with the carts 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.899
 of anta of rubber of 2014 not for that reason not 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.660
 I'm going to collect it but not this one 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.640
 good way to decrease for example in 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.970
 the case of this that is the most famous 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.610
 charro the ss that since October was already 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.520
 on the internet circulating the images this 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.010
 cart was the first one that came out this me 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.490
 even get this well in good 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.890
 conditions hung and apart get 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.060
 a dump that was all broken elvis 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.800
 so ready 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.020
 Well I did not get it I'm lying 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.890
 this one I know my friend beto the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.500
 he wins and he changed it for another one 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.580
 super and good and that this god after 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.510
 get this other to hung and good 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.720
 he is very father 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.300
 but it's disappointing to see how now 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.100
 a mattel has taken a new strategy 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.240
 with respect to this case 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.960
 to the super this year member here 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:33.760
 I have a little cart that is the 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:38.050
 same chevrolet ssp but it is the normal 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.490
 that differs from the new good we're going 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.450
 let's see and that's what I say it is 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:47.159
 disappointing to see that it is only 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.740
 precisely the color here 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.289
 it's practically because the color blue yes 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.999
 you see it is practically the same 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.729
 I would have to have the two carts to a 

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:58.380
 side of the other so he could say hey 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.740
 if it's a little different but it's 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.520
 exactly the same only 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.950
 llantitas 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.390
 this was looking for where they end up 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.170
 here they are 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.300
 On the 3rd, what are the 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.900
 that he reaches the other is 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.500
 unbalancing 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.439
 there it is there we can see the th there is a 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.400
 side and the artist is out of that 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:29.060
 practically the cart is the same is 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.630
 the same practically see the bernabÃ©u 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.180
 what do I mean what good looks if I 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.709
 I was grabbing for a taste that has a 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.140
 rim very similar even I have some 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.030
 bright same as the one of this one that if 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.920
 I know, I'll change them and put them on this 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.080
 is to look at it sideways we would not see the 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.239
 difference between one and another is seen 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.739
 practically the same 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.459
 I do not know if he is doing it to you right now 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.050
 so they are not as sought after as the 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.269
 that they do not have it or can not get 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.890
 new ones do not feel so bad but before 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:03.080
 if there is a big difference for example 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:06.080
 in the fair in 2007 of 2013 2007 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.590
 the model and 2013 the year it came out 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.030
 this cart this is normal but if 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.660
 you record it and you have the luck 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.790
 find the super since you realize 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.620
 the differences they had seen see the 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:25.100
 colors the wheels apart from winning the 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.430
 in front of the rear spoiler 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.710
 everything showed the difference between a 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.170
 super and one that was not 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.330
 or very very different and it was a plus 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.970
 Well now we do not see it now 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:43.230
 It's nothing so easy to do a custom as 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.000
 for example I had neither 71 challenger and 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.000
 as I was long before I got it 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.820
 I got the same model but in 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.700
 its normal edition and I put it anti late 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.290
 rubber and so it was left to see what I do not 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.410
 I liked the two I keep the two 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.240
 but the truth was very different 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.190
 car and it was really worth trying 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.980
 get the super unlike what 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.730
 that was normal although there had been 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.950
 some like for example the bolt that already 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.420
 the whole this explanation but that's what 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.030
 what do I want to do so you can see 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.370
 the difference between carts per 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.060
 example 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.940
 for example if we are talking about him 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.210
 the 67 Camaro also of the year 2013 that 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:31.020
 came out we see that brought the chest had 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.300
 metal chassis and everything and despite everything 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.610
 the color if it varied if you can 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.860
 see there see the difference the normal was 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.250
 more black and the other were more brown and more 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.320
 I need brought this brought the box and 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.050
 apart it brought the transurban in the 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.590
 part of alcatraz there is 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:53.610
 but see now if I do not deliver it mattel and 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:56.650
 so we do not have to help him well 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:00.990
 this is the chevrolet ss 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.990
 and then there is also the assembly store 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.720
 that all say they bring this defect that 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.720
 they drop the 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.700
 the name of this part of dating 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.950
 here loans 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.150
 the good thing is that as I collect it outside 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.460
 d 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.770
 the package can be put 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.900
 rubber inks 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.490
 and well, the assembly is 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.190
 practically the same here I have a 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.050
 assembly up this normal 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.640
 and you can see it has the same 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.280
 chevrolet 's business this is 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.050
 practically the same assembly be 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.850
 super also gave me the veto na won 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:44.100
 thank you veto I'm waiting for the camera and 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:45.690
 the mustang mate is too much and it's good 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.200
 the only difference even between the 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:51.930
 cartons is this part of here because 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.510
 both the normal ones and the 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.750
 cardboard the super brings the little yellow thing 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:00.000
 and it brings the coast of Mary just like it's all here 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.090
 what changes the color of the truck 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.040
 it's the same practically does not change 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.840
 much you see is not in the difference of 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.910
 colors these agents the same change 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.250
 much the little thing through that it comes 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:14.100
 drawn and it is brought a plastic 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.870
 separate but good these are the 2 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.810
 supers that I wanted to show you this 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.120
 year that I have hope as I tell you that 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.850
 drop the mustang max and he 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.620
 and the shrimp and well, there they are 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:29.370
 I hope you liked this 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:31.889
 review because we liked it a lot but there 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.360
 I hope you continue to see the 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.620
 videos and we are pending that they are 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.620
 all good regards
