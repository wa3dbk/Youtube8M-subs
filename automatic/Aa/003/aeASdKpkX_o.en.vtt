 so friends on your screens how 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.470
 the future will look like this is a helmet 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.480
 virtual reality oculus rift 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.400
 development kit 2 last of 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.200
 virtual reality developments 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.660
 which exists today 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.119
 facebook company itself has acquired this 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.670
 project for 2 billion dollars in our 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.570
 hands got oculus rift for developers 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.790
 second version 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.890
 and we decided to show you what 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.019
 so it is. 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.360
 Let's start with what awaits us in 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.879
 box for developers and so there is 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.190
 a set of interchangeable lenses for myopia and 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.989
 hyperopia special tracking 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.989
 camera that tracks your 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.940
 position in space itself 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.989
 oculus rift helmet 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.180
 In which special sensors are inserted 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.659
 eye screen sensors napkin 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.119
 microfibre instruction manual 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:06.790
 exploitation and a huge set of every kind 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.549
 adapters for euro sockets for 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.140
 sockets are asian american and so 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.000
 further in order to visually 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.619
 demonstrate what a little 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.409
 Oculus Rift virtual, we asked 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.469
 kim ok company employees to experience 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.619
 helmet on yourself and let's just see 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:35.039
 on and feeling impression and yes how is it 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:35.039
 it was but you get used quickly 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.000
 here is this cool moment 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.000
 red 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.600
 and down 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.670
 went 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.080
 awesome effect comes out for some reason 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.360
 all these people rides just 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:19.430
 set yes no chairs nothing because 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:20.000
 i still stood up to speed drops realizing 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.730
 on the roads 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.280
 move closer to the camera and back 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:30.860
 back fine you stopped again 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.870
 forward forward back on your children all 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.070
 It turned out to be simpler than a cherry hat to 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:41.860
 camera forward backward 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:44.660
 well how great immersion feels yes and 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.300
 saying it went at first but I'm burning 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.640
 attraction so what do you like what are you 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.880
 Gorka tried this attraction 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.730
 in fact it's cool in a sports car 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.350
 improved so there is still attraction 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.350
 sports car come on 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:21.219
 like feeling awesome she herself went 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:22.780
 awesome really set and then 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.819
 we asked one of the attendees 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.680
 of our shop to try on a helmet 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.260
 virtual reality itself here 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.109
 absolutely random person to whom 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.319
 plunged into the world of horror movies and left 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.319
 alone 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:45.000
 surely knives in my hand stick what 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:57.940
 the way you went with everything is cool here and 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.920
 The first time I tried what helmet 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:06.730
 virtual reality how like feeling 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:16.450
 believe in what happens like 3d multi 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:18.070
 how did you like it better you probably 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.410
 it remains to talk about technical 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.889
 the characteristics work it all with 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.590
 960 by 1080 pixel resolution 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.870
 updates 75 hertz viewing angle while 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.760
 is 100 degrees with this 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.950
 Many sensors are built in such as 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.070
 gyroscope accelerometer magnetometer 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.830
 infrared sensors and so on weighs 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.690
 the whole thing is four hundred forty grams well 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.900
 well now seeing this video you 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.630
 know that oculus rift is already in krasnodar 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.479
 in stock at company stores and himah 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.000
 so real virtual reality 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.930
 already a step away from you and tried for you 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.430
 alexander dugin
