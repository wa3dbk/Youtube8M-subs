00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello here in the summer of 2014 Moscow 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.290
 passed the international such scientific 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.900
 congress event caspar caspar this 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.390
 international coordinating organization 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.250
 no trace of outer space 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:24.449
 last time congress caspar before 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.820
 held in 1957 the mask so on 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.980
 this congress had a lot of section there 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.510
 performed 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.489
 astrophysics astronautics specialist 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.100
 there was even a section 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.960
 on which people spoke on 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.750
 migration to other planets 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.640
 a group of Indian scientists spoke with 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.800
 a report on relocation to the planets 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.200
 other star systems I unfortunately 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.030
 lecture did not listen to this speech more correctly 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.820
 so I can't say anything I heard 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.910
 another lecture there and the lecture was 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:00.050
 is dedicated to the sun and it was told 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:04.379
 there the next turns out to be very 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.020
 from observational data on the dynamics of integuments 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.920
 the sun follows one for something 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.100
 interesting conclusion 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.170
 now tell you everything from afar means 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.570
 when in the sixties seventies 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.240
 started to register not 3 but learned 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.409
 3 do not register but that whether these are 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.110
 from the sun it turned out that there is no Renault from 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.420
 the sun comes to us significantly less 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.790
 what should come we already know 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.479
 intense power which the sun says 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.490
 We know that this power is explained by what 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.070
 thermonuclear reaction inside our star 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.049
 sun star means we can count 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.119
 how many netrino should come from there a 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.430
 They come much less how 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.240
 to be flip river head breaking why 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.829
 never the other way round 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.110
 really the sun no longer shines 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:56.060
 that is, she shine you shine but already there 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.790
 don't go thermonuclear reaction just it 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.280
 shines us warms us stored heat 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.670
 the stove had burned no fuel could start 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.310
 cool down 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.079
 cooling time there 10 thousand years here 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.910
 so that's how it is like that 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.209
 such a time here during this time should 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.370
 cool down and affect the heart-rending cools here 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.560
 and here in 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.110
 arm means this is the thing but the theorists 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.269
 said year may not be 3 so far 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.209
 flying from the sun the temple does not turn out 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.810
 electronic nejtrino which having on 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.680
 registration which we cannot 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.950
 to register 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.750
 it means but it is possible only if 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.670
 her three on there is a mass of fattening and on by 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.379
 apparently moss and no every new 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.170
 the experiment just shows another 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.870
 the limit below which should be mass 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.920
 lower lower lower lower far lower 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.360
 plinth has long been water so here 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:50.239
 performed at home at this conference for 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:53.359
 Institute of the sun and told that by their 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.569
 observing the institute the sun across 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.569
 visibility 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.790
 really rebuild global 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.459
 circulation of plasma flows to the sun what 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.940
 apparently indicative of termination there 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.859
 thermonuclear heart but don't you grieve 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.200
 more often for a long time we have enough for our age with 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:14.569
 you have enough then the sun will start 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.670
 a little shrink inside will begin 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.919
 the next stage of thermonuclear reactions is she 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.579
 evolving even more than it is now 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:25.400
 swell will become a red giant up to an hour 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.200
 the temperature of the sun 65 degrees and then 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.209
 it will be three thousand degrees colder 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.500
 Now on yellow then it will be red but 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.260
 something very big 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.419
 you understand what we say hot iron 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.750
 the whole room is not heated but more or 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:41.450
 you will heat the less warm battery 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.849
 will be big but cold but very 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.290
 big so big that for orbit 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.000
 the earth will probably reach her 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.620
 surface of the earth then of course 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.010
 will cease to exist it is not in 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.739
 One day, of course, but in general, here it is 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.010
 keep in mind that we often see 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.019
 broke through attempts of course still have him 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.910
 no tridchik does not stop like anything 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.340
 something about netrino new learn 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.440
 it may not be like this 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.569
 it seems to us especially since 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.519
 study it is hard here such hope 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.040
 still remains but nonetheless 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:16.010
 apparently our sun is already 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.340
 faded out if it warms us and shines only 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.769
 stored energy is like 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.300
 a piece of metal from the fire got it still 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.970
 shining but getting cold 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.780
 but we rejoice at our sauce and so far 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.699
 the path shines 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.699
 good luck to you all the best
