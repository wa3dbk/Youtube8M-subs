00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.859
 Good day, it's Elena Terekhova today 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:12.269
 May 22 we are in the garden that was created 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:16.369
 artificially , spring is cold here 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.619
 This season is very potato 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.039
 I have planted the seedlings that had been 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.630
 done but she was too cold and not put 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.779
 such as other years but each seasonal 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.969
 and every season differently but anyway 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.420
 it is earlier than planted just right here 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.660
 here in this box I just planted 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.260
 potatoes and here she is already seedlings 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:50.010
 Still, the bed will be early 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.989
 peas too this year 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.090
 even 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.850
 the unfortunate result was just cold 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.210
 two degrees at night was covered 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.830
 agrofibre and most of the peas 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.229
 of course just rotted though it was planted 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.200
 dry seeds do not always dry plants 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.100
 us that we have rains and then just loaded 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.080
 the cold was agrofiber covered but it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.180
 didn't save 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.479
 part of the peas there and part had 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.360
 worry new but nothing 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.380
 can you do 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.780
 always some losses but 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.320
 small hope so here it is with us 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.369
 polycarbonate greenhouses and film edges 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.430
 as said his next greenhouse 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.240
 we redid the cucumber now for you 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.899
 show closer replaced tadoska done 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.270
 its higher is more stable than we are 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.420
 started season 1 all in a hurry 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:01.350
 run-run and there was a video where and just 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:04.729
 cucumbers planted on a pedestal and easy with a light 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:09.979
 shelter now we rebuilt such 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:14.040
 high me we boys did inside 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:20.330
 so eat strawberries show here a little 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.330
 and there still made such a greenhouse Frenchman 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.550
 here we bought reinforcement 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.980
 although here we had a night with you 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.980
 now show it in full height 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.440
 the greenhouses are so high 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:41.819
 there will be a lot of air here 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.120
 and everything and they will surely be a couple along 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.300
 her today I plant my seedlings 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.530
 seedlings certainly grew more than in 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:56.069
 last season but all due to the weather in 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.349
 cold cucumbers can not be planted otherwise they would 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.349
 just from rot but here it promises warm 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.480
 the weather will hope that everything will be 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:10.500
 okay usually so i land 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:12.900
 seedlings 21 May 22 this is another reliable 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.780
 once it gets warmer it seems about her and 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.110
 breathed faster and faster and she just 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.620
 idle 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.709
 dies from itâ€™s anger 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.250
 cups all showed you before 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.430
 how do i make her opera garden 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.840
 pretty good strong different 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.849
 varieties pre bed 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.319
 the dung of the hall is carried away as always spilled 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:43.590
 now it is good and it remains completely 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:47.390
 a little bit of everything is laid out 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:51.239
 Here are the varieties for different like me 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:56.129
 counted the amount exactly exactly I 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:58.640
 know and we plant we dig a dimple 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:02.220
 a little bit if you need to add water and 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.470
 I plant cucumbers flush with the ground 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.439
 root system is not deepening though here 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.230
 like roots but here it is not necessary 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:12.330
 do because all the same can be 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.870
 cold and from rotting and then there will be a very 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.280
 sorry 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:20.090
 so it's better to grow 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:25.400
 everything is fine i assure you 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.810
 varieties here I have it so what have u 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.440
 us and but samurai 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:34.130
 Sherpa I once tried these varieties 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.650
 I liked it and even in the summer when 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:40.130
 ate cucumbers I quickly went and and 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.340
 bought the same seeds and so it 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:48.470
 already checked here is a garland 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:54.169
 so we have Sherpa here still 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:59.800
 Mirabella beautiful-beautiful nice 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:02.870
 seedlings here are some new minister 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:08.930
 then here not from Moscow shared a little bit 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:15.169
 Vic and acorn do something else there 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:20.630
 parties well there is a repetition of a festoon well 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:25.190
 Here we will deal with landing so in this 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:28.910
 the greenhouse has also planted tomatoes all i 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:36.620
 signed book delivered 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:39.520
 bamboo sticks of prasadam too recently 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:43.700
 planted so she is still 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:47.560
 sick getting acclimatized below i'm like there 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:50.990
 showing such panels laid out yet 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:57.000
 get accustomed well that's good there 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:59.520
 going and warmer roots 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.620
 it's all not purchased then all waste 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.330
 material 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.260
 saw enough on the Internet that is agro 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:12.090
 panels but also adapted such forms 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:14.580
 here's the coffin of the panel see how 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:18.510
 condensation return moisture does not go away 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:23.430
 quickly and warmer than the roots of course when here 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:28.800
 at night two degrees dubak well so 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:32.910
 warming which is okay so 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:40.169
 here we still have a very good one 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:44.610
