00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
inch width and this thing has an intel

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.010 
inch width and this thing has an intel
dual<00:00:36.260> processor<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.469> five<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.600> I<00:00:39.600> was<00:00:39.870> hoping

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
dual processor I five and I was hoping

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.380 
dual processor I five and I was hoping
for<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.320> seven<00:00:40.890> but<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.129> guess<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.000> comes

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
for I seven but I guess I just comes

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.290 
for I seven but I guess I just comes
with<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.680> 15<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.920> 17<00:00:44.489> inch<00:00:44.700> models<00:00:45.289> then<00:00:46.289> um

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
with the 15 in 17 inch models then um

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.959 
with the 15 in 17 inch models then um
basically<00:00:48.379> this<00:00:49.379> computer<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:49.980> not<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
basically this computer is not the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.110 
basically this computer is not the
lightest<00:00:51.480> if<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.649> want<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.980> portable<00:00:53.670> computer

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
lightest if you want a portable computer

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.389 
lightest if you want a portable computer
I<00:00:54.420> would<00:00:54.809> go<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.260> macbook<00:00:55.469> air<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.219> new

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
I would go for the macbook air the new

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.049 
I would go for the macbook air the new
one<00:00:56.579> which<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.210> what<00:00:58.079> 11<00:00:58.649> or<00:00:59.039> 13<00:00:59.070> inches

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
one which is like what 11 or 13 inches

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.229 
one which is like what 11 or 13 inches
but<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.660> thing<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.109> small<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:03.000> chose

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239

to<00:01:03.449> get<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.780> one<00:01:04.080> because<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.439> has<00:01:04.589> more<00:01:04.619> gram

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
to get this one because it has more gram

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.530

stuff um i was surprised i only gave
only<00:01:19.619> two<00:01:20.720> USB<00:01:21.720> ports<00:01:21.750> which<00:01:22.530> wasn't<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.040> best

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
only two USB ports which wasn't the best

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.370 
only two USB ports which wasn't the best
because<00:01:24.030> i<00:01:24.150> plug<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.689> lot<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.020> things<00:01:25.200> in

because i plug in a lot of things in

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.890 
because i plug in a lot of things in
this<00:01:25.470> computer<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.100> two<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.490> efficient<00:01:27.000> but

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
this computer but two is efficient but

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.020 
this computer but two is efficient but
and<00:01:28.470> then<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.680> have<00:01:28.799> your<00:01:28.829> SD<00:01:29.280> slot<00:01:29.549> which<00:01:29.850> is

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
and then you have your SD slot which is

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.450 
and then you have your SD slot which is
a<00:01:30.060> bit<00:01:30.270> new<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.509> Apple<00:01:31.070> they<00:01:32.070> usually<00:01:32.369> don't

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
a bit new to Apple they usually don't

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.460 
a bit new to Apple they usually don't
have<00:01:32.700> those<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.090> their<00:01:33.240> computers<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:33.930> that's

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
have those in their computers but that's

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.039 
have those in their computers but that's
cool<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.460> want<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> plug<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.000> any<00:01:36.180> SD<00:01:36.450> cards

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.880 
cool if you want to plug in any SD cards
and<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:39.030> your<00:01:39.210> headphone<00:01:39.630> jack<00:01:39.960> you

new<00:01:43.619> thing<00:01:43.680> Apple<00:01:44.369> has<00:01:44.399> introduced<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.240> think

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
new thing Apple has introduced I think

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.170 
new thing Apple has introduced I think
it's<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.229> bit<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.649> mean<00:01:46.979> no<00:01:47.369> one<00:01:47.399> really<00:01:47.790> might

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
it's a bit I mean no one really might

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.240 
it's a bit I mean no one really might
need<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.720> now<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.320> maybe<00:01:49.500> coming<00:01:49.799> up<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
need it now but maybe coming up in the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.969 
need it now but maybe coming up in the
future<00:01:50.670> they<00:01:51.180> might<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.570> some<00:01:51.780> devices<00:01:52.140> that

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
future they might have some devices that

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.789 
future they might have some devices that
will<00:01:53.369> fit<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.909> Jack<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.869> Jack<00:01:55.200> has

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
will fit that Jack and that Jack has

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.770 
will fit that Jack and that Jack has
known<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.640> Steve<00:01:57.360> Jobs<00:01:57.450> said<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.770> um<00:01:59.159> it

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
known that Steve Jobs said that um it

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.780 
known that Steve Jobs said that um it
transfers<00:02:00.780> data<00:02:00.990> what<00:02:01.409> 10<00:02:01.649> times<00:02:01.890> faster<00:02:02.520> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
transfers data what 10 times faster and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.300 
transfers data what 10 times faster and
so<00:02:03.360> that's<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.719> cool<00:02:03.930> feature<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.100> have

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
so that's a cool feature and you have

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.589 
so that's a cool feature and you have
your<00:02:05.610> other<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.979> also<00:02:07.979> your<00:02:08.160> magsafe<00:02:08.849> right

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
your other and also your magsafe right

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.010 
your other and also your magsafe right
there<00:02:10.110> your<00:02:10.800> magsafe<00:02:11.430> power<00:02:11.459> cord<00:02:12.360> it's<00:02:12.900> a

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
there your magsafe power cord it's a

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.520 
there your magsafe power cord it's a
magnet

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
magnet

got to appear and there's seven dots on
the<00:02:31.739> thing<00:02:32.370> which<00:02:32.880> represents<00:02:33.540> each<00:02:33.690> hour<00:02:33.959> so

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
the thing which represents each hour so

it's about seven hours so six hook up

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.430 
it's about seven hours so six hook up
here<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:39.030> I'm<00:02:39.150> about<00:02:39.450> six<00:02:39.780> hours<00:02:39.959> of<00:02:40.110> battery

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
here so I'm about six hours of battery

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.770 
here so I'm about six hours of battery
life<00:02:40.560> left<00:02:40.940> so<00:02:41.940> that's<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.239> really<00:02:42.270> cool

estimate<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:44.010> how<00:02:44.069> much<00:02:44.610> battery<00:02:45.150> and

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
estimate of how much battery and

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.530 
estimate of how much battery and
speaking<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.290> battery<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:47.340> Apple<00:02:48.060> computer
