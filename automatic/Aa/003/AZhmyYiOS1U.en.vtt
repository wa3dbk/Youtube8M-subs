the<00:00:16.309> curriculum<00:00:16.760> gives<00:00:17.119> them<00:00:17.330> the

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
the curriculum gives them the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.480 
the curriculum gives them the
flexibility<00:00:17.990> of<00:00:18.140> trying<00:00:18.529> different<00:00:18.619> projects

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
flexibility of trying different projects

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.370 
flexibility of trying different projects
and<00:00:19.699> experiments<00:00:20.210> in<00:00:20.570> each<00:00:20.720> of<00:00:20.869> those<00:00:20.960> fields

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
and experiments in each of those fields

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.419 
and experiments in each of those fields
and<00:00:21.470> then<00:00:21.619> figuring<00:00:21.949> out<00:00:22.039> which<00:00:22.189> we<00:00:22.339> know

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:22.429 
and then figuring out which we know

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.550 
and then figuring out which we know
what's<00:00:22.579> the<00:00:22.699> best<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.869> small<00:00:24.079> class<00:00:24.289> sizes

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
what's the best the small class sizes

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.189 
what's the best the small class sizes
are<00:00:24.999> amazing<00:00:25.999> every<00:00:26.419> one<00:00:26.539> of<00:00:26.570> my<00:00:26.689> teachers<00:00:26.900> is

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
are amazing every one of my teachers is

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.800 
are amazing every one of my teachers is
known<00:00:27.409> my<00:00:27.650> name<00:00:27.829> first<00:00:28.339> and<00:00:28.519> last<00:00:28.609> so<00:00:29.419> it<00:00:29.630> seems

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
known my name first and last so it seems

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.569 
known my name first and last so it seems
to<00:00:29.929> get<00:00:30.019> help<00:00:30.289> I<00:00:30.560> think<00:00:30.769> the<00:00:31.069> small<00:00:31.310> class

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
to get help I think the small class

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.729 
to get help I think the small class
sizes<00:00:31.880> give<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:32.509> students<00:00:32.960> a<00:00:33.079> chance<00:00:33.290> to<00:00:33.470> kind

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
sizes give the students a chance to kind

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.620 
sizes give the students a chance to kind

than one type of engineering process or

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.520 
than one type of engineering process or
project<00:01:19.670> me<00:01:19.850> done<00:01:20.180> in<00:01:20.330> them<00:01:20.479> so<00:01:21.050> you<00:01:21.080> might<00:01:21.500> be

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
project me done in them so you might be

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.190 
project me done in them so you might be
working<00:01:21.860> with<00:01:22.040> fluids<00:01:22.729> that<00:01:23.060> can<00:01:23.300> be<00:01:23.659> used<00:01:23.870> for

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
working with fluids that can be used for

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.719 
working with fluids that can be used for

for<00:01:26.000> mechanical<00:01:26.479> engineering<00:01:26.590> so<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:27.800> just

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
for mechanical engineering so it just

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.560 
for mechanical engineering so it just
gives<00:01:28.130> them<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.370> opportunity<00:01:28.580> to<00:01:28.970> use<00:01:29.240> more

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
gives them the opportunity to use more

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.220 
gives them the opportunity to use more
than<00:01:29.720> one<00:01:29.900> type<00:01:30.110> of<00:01:30.260> engineering<00:01:30.650> field
