00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello welcome they will get out of talking about 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.720
 apples and in this video we want you 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.660
 show how you can eliminate cydia and the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.219
 jailbreak in general of your iphone or 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.290
 from your ipad 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.580
 we are going to eliminate from our 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.510
 iphone 6 plus 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.340
 the jailbreak with version 28.4 good 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.140
 The first thing we are going to do before 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.449
 connect the iphone or whatever is good 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.180
 so let's go down what is the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.250
 update file we are going to 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.309
 select here how good our 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.110
 device as you see the ipad appears 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.270
 If you have an iPad, we will go to 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.350
 iphone 6 plus which is what we 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.829
 we are using let's select myself 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.230
 that 8.4 as you see the previous ones that 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.379
 are in red no longer signed so 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.050
 so much here we have iphone 7.1 which is 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.780
 our version version 8.4 we are going to 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.510
 give the blog as you see it starts to 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.460
 download and we go here to downloads and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.649
 well we had put a file 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.539
 earlier so well then we'll have 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.100
 to wait for this train this time to 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.869
 continue with 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.780
 tutorial and meanwhile then we're going to 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.000
 go doing a few previous steps this 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.290
 let's leave here on the side what 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.350
 next thing we're going to do is connect 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.330
 the iphone to the computer as you see the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.060
 iPhone vibrates and the next thing we have 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.630
 what to do is open itunes at the moment 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.530
 that we open itunes good so we're going 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.299
 to our iphone and well then if you have 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.979
 this option is to synchronize 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.860
 automatically when connecting this iphone 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.259
 you will give it to him so he does not do it 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.780
 no copy so that he does not copy us and 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.090
 absolutely nothing so good then 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.369
 done these steps now the only thing that we 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.330
 lack is to wait for these files 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.580
 ipsw are finished downloading and now 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.869
 we can start with the process as 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.020
 whenever we're going to do it's going to be 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.549
 connect the iphone to the good computer in 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.429
 the iphone will be pending that no 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.200
 no backup do 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:04.610
 what we will have to do is press the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.200
 alt button and give search update 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.550
 then it will not search online but rather 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.740
 will ask us 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.650
 the file that we want to enter in the 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.320
 phone in this case we have to look 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.620
 it's called iphones is here is a file 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.610
 ipsw the one that we just downloaded we're going 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.530
 to give it to open 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.480
 As you see, it tells us that there are all 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.210
 will update the iphone software the 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.680
 8.4 version of them and will verify the 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.810
 update with supported for 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.880
 update now as you see in 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.700
 iTunes tells us that it is being extracted 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.850
 the good software as you see the iphone 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.520
 This progress bar appears and 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.890
 we have to wait since good in 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.130
 itunes is going to put that is verifying 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.520
 the software and that is updating the 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.890
 iphone therefore good we have to 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.540
 keep waiting for good as the process 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.160
 It seems to have ended as you see has 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.700
 restarted we are going to introduce the 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.739
 codes and we'll keep good 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.570
 check if we have finished 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.459
 introduce the infection pin before good 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.880
 we still have to polish and go 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.170
 to go into general adjustments 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.930
 software update tells us that 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.580
 we have the latest version 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.000
 and well, let's see if at the end of 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.400
 everything before we had cydia and as you can see 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.500
 there is no trace of cydia therefore 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.810
 well, all the jailbreak 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.810
 it's like you see a very simple process not 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.930
 you have to restore so the process 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.370
 has been completely satisfactory and what 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.130
 what we have taken the longest has been 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.380
 download the ipsw file but good 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.200
 it depends on the server us at the end 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.000
 we have finished it by downloading with jota 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.280
 downloaders since the rate of 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.830
 download transfer was quite more 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.360
 high that with the browser so like 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.670
