00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.980
 that the next chapter of the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.080
 Incredible mast will be called glare 5 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.470
 guardian and should be released between 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.480
 September and December 2015 is the 5th is 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.490
 get to the last direction then why 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.740
 will have a new engine in addition to 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.779
 People already know that the game will run in 60 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.059
 frames per second and will also have 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.130
 own servers more news about 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.260
 the game will be revealed at the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.059
 Microsoft on June 9th 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.890
 there in e3 he to end the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.140
 hopes that he still hoped to see the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.440
 assassin's creed unit for playstation 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.180
 3 and xbox 360 ubisoft ended with 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.280
 all hopes said that the game 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.390
 really will not be released for these 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.670
 platforms 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.770
 lais also said that they are 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.559
 working on a murder creed pro 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.140
 play station 3 and xbox 360 and which 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.250
 possibly it can still be released 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.619
 this year 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.290
 moreover it may be that the series since 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.760
 win a title every year although some 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.040
 games and find it necessary means 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.200
 releasing only one is learned every year, right? 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.060
 because it is natural, this is not the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.049
 why be soft announced that maybe 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.700
 do not be yearly 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.770
 in fact it is because they are having a 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.590
 a little trouble there to 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.780
 manage so many great titles but 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.119
 nothing definitive and the company does not think 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.369
 slow down as their intention 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.360
 is to release three to five major titles 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.860
 per annum 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.170
 published in the journal of the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.090
 We'll have the dragon ball pro 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.220
 playstation 4 looks just as marvelous 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.079
 people do not know much about the game, right? 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.909
 only that it will probably be a 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.540
 fighting game because that's what the pictures 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.610
 which have been disclosed suggest styrofoam 4 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.840
 is in development only looks at 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.810
 wonder but is still in the stages 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.610
 very early and even we had a 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.200
 and the game with the image that the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.659
 roger ferguson who is the manager of 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.900
 beskitas who reported that the quality of the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.510
 image is so bad but so 1 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.950
 It even seems like a bad joke and 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.200
 ferguson has left a comment on 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.300
 what it's like to have a brand new team at 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.070
 development of the game he said that it is 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.720
 a little bad because it worked out 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.430
 because he has to teach the galley 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.350
 to make the game despite being all 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.140
 fans never worked in development 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.420
 of war war but on the other hand is 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.970
 very good because it is much easier and 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.830
 innovate the mechanics of the game in addition 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.960
 manager was very excited by microsoft 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.330
 Now it's funding the game, right? 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.610
 with resources becomes much easier 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.680
 expand the width of the game and 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.140
 unfortunately probably the game does not 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.780
 will appear in e3 precisely because it is 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.890
 still crawling in development 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.230
 but as soon as we have more 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.200
 news we can in the dj azz 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.260
 champions a new control the name of the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.959
 control scumfuck s it features several 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.270
 functions where the most demanding games 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.610
 of the playstation 4 joystick brings a 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.860
 functionality very similar to skank 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.240
 bus that was the developed control 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.070
 for xbox one 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.320
 Look at what he brings he made triggers 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.260
 more precise analog elongations 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.180
 electromagnetic remapping parts 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.130
 rubberized and possibilities 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.019
 control customization 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.810
 in addition it has an element called 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.250
 confuses ski that is kind an accessory that 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.440
 you put on National Day of the 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.310
 control that assists in the functionality 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.070
 his 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.480
 the strong skank is to be released in June but 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.410
 we still do not have the price 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.790
 control 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.489
 who was waiting for the possibility 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.560
 xbox the year you receive support for 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.260
 data storage on hard drives 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.370
 can start to look good 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.739
 cheered up 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.480
 although it is not official, there is a 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.150
 image on a developer's reddit 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.840
 that showed whether an external drive 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.489
 connected to the console and looks only microsoft 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.940
 has not yet pronounced and said nothing 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.500
 huh 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.470
 but this image has already served to leave 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.660
 pretty hopeful people do not tell 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.269
 for you the article carlos eduardo do 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.180
 real to virtual how toys have 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.680
 survived the videogame 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.060
 This is it, I hope you all too much. 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.159

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.079
