00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
will not think of anything complicated

this<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.189> where<00:01:17.189> I'm<00:01:17.340> coming<00:01:17.790> from<00:01:17.820> so

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
this is where I'm coming from so

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.899 
this is where I'm coming from so
actually<00:01:19.049> if<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> violin<00:01:20.460> here<00:01:20.700> I

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
actually if I have the violin here I

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.330 
actually if I have the violin here I
grab<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.810> ball<00:01:21.990> like<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.650> then<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.100> put

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
grab the ball like this and then I put

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.170 
grab the ball like this and then I put
it<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.150> string<00:01:24.420> now<00:01:25.409> look<00:01:25.680> at<00:01:25.799> this

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
it on the string now look at this

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.100 
it on the string now look at this
obviously<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.330> looks<00:01:27.390> very<00:01:27.689> stupid<00:01:28.409> but<00:01:28.740> I

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
obviously this looks very stupid but I

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.310 
obviously this looks very stupid but I
think<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> very<00:01:32.070> natural<00:01:32.400> way

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
think that this is a very natural way

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.910 
think that this is a very natural way
you<00:01:34.320> see<00:01:34.650> now<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.950> height<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.759> elbow<00:01:36.920> it's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
you see now the height of the elbow it's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.510 
you see now the height of the elbow it's
not<00:01:38.070> like<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.659> the<00:01:39.659> rest<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.250> way

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
not like this the rest is just the way

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.580 
not like this the rest is just the way
that<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.850> would<00:01:42.090> grab<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.390> ball<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.380> it's

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
that you would grab the ball so it's

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.830 
that you would grab the ball so it's
very<00:01:43.770> flat<00:01:44.250> everything<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.939> very<00:01:44.970> flat<00:01:45.509> and

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
very flat everything is very flat and

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.740 
very flat everything is very flat and
now<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:47.220> take<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.700> ball<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.990> hands<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.500> I

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
now we take the ball in the hands as I

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.679 
now we take the ball in the hands as I
shot<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> other<00:01:52.229> videos<00:01:53.390> don't<00:01:54.390> change

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
shot in the other videos don't change

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.359 
shot in the other videos don't change
anything<00:01:56.329> and<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.930> for<00:01:58.680> me<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.979> perfect

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
anything and this is for me the perfect

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.830 
anything and this is for me the perfect
position<00:01:59.780> it's<00:02:00.780> very<00:02:00.899> flat<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:03.390> can<00:02:03.600> even

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
position it's very flat and you can even

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.960 
position it's very flat and you can even
virtually<00:02:04.799> remember<00:02:07.369> that<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.520> can<00:02:08.729> put<00:02:08.940> a

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
virtually remember that you can put a

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.950

this you should go to this nothing

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.080 
this you should go to this nothing
unnatural<00:02:23.350> just<00:02:24.350> very<00:02:24.620> flat<00:02:24.890> of<00:02:25.340> course<00:02:25.760> very

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
the elbow not too high and I think that

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.210 
the elbow not too high and I think that
this<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.750> this<00:02:39.320> is<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:39.530> nice<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:39.830> healthy

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.950 
this is this is a nice and healthy
position<00:02:42.610> we<00:02:43.610> keep<00:02:43.820> our<00:02:44.000> angle<00:02:44.390> as<00:02:44.510> discussed

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
position we keep our angle as discussed

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.200 
position we keep our angle as discussed
in<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.230> other<00:02:45.380> videos<00:02:45.800> we<00:02:46.070> make<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.000> ball

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
in the other videos we make the ball

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.559

change<00:02:47.540> with<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.930> penis

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.319 

the<00:02:54.170> wrist<00:02:54.379> is<00:02:54.560> very<00:02:54.769> flexible<00:02:55.069> but<00:02:55.969> it's<00:02:56.150> not

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329
