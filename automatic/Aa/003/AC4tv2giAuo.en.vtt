00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:06.249
 Well, here we have a method for 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.950
 repair the lack of water tmr when you go 

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:10.200
 to restart the operating system and not 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.490
 Starts 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:18.000
 Well, one of the solutions is 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.830
 enter the windows cd we have 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.680
 installed in this case windows 7 and 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.550
 make booting from from the CD 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.009
 rom for that we enter the bios or if you already 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.160
 we have it set up so it starts us 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.320
 from the cd-rom and to boot it to 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.930
 to continue with the td rom we have to 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.430
 press as it tells us here press 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.810
 any key to start the cd-rom 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.390
 press and start the cd-rom in this 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.870
 case does the installation as for 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.930
 make it 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.650
 the installation of windows 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:57.910
 we are going to give you a little fast progress 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.330
 so that it is not a tostÃ³n this and can 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.330
 continue 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.460
 we see what 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.680
 keep doing 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.680
 as if we will install the windows again 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.780
 and here what we have to do is catch 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.900
 good we give you Spanish 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.090
 the language or if you want it in Chinese then 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.400
 You can also choose it and here we give it 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.740
 to repair the equipment not to install now 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.380
 but repair the equipment we're going to 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.420
 repair the equipment we wait for you to look 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.500
 the operating system that we have 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.580
 installed 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.720
 the windows 7 in this case 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.720
 we give you the following 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.340
 click on the next one and let's go to 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.340
 symbol of the system 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.920
 well the symbol of the system we have to 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:55.350
 go to drive him 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.770
 of the cd-rom that in our case is and 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.150
 press point will we yield point 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.080
 We point to point in yields 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.430
 get to the unit 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:10.170
 well in this step we copy 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:13.860
 the mgr boat 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.280
 we copy it from hard drive I say 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.500
 cd-rom and we paste it in ce in my case is 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.560
 because I have an installation in d 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.310
 but you supposedly if it's the one 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.069
 you have to put on instead of and already 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.840
 says a file copied promptly 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.840
 now we give you to say to leave 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.030
 remember not from here we give to 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.890
 restart reboot 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.530
 and we have to start the system 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.860
 operative if I perfectly copy the boat 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.040
 mgr 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:54.050
 that yes it has to be the disc with which 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.050
 you have done the installation of windows 7 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.599
 here we do not press any key we leave 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.670
 to follow the process but not to start 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.950
 from the cd-rom but start from 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.370
 the hard drive and we already see that it starts 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.520
 windows perfectly 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.760
 well then nothing if you like 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.720
 little thumb up to subscribe to the 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.240
 link this that I leave here 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.490
 share it so more people can 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.490
 have access to this problem 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.519
 until the next tutorial friends 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.380
 come a greeting 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.380
