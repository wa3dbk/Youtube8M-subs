00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:14.700
 hello what to put mixed 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.699
 numbers you first need to bring it them 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.619
 fractional parts to a common denominator then 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.260
 alternately perform addition of integers 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.199
 parts and accordingly 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.449
 fractional part Well start here at 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.550
 we have a fractional fractional fraction further 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.369
 success and three fourth I just him 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:38.570
 inscribing here now it is necessary to find a common 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:41.340
 denominator for this i'm six 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.570
 present as a work of two on 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.420
 three 4 deuces for deuce to 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.719
 here the number of e number it coincided well then 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.789
 there is 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.100
 lead to features the action will 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.480
 multiply by two 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.739
 put on a multiply on the trail so 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.250
 way we get the following expression 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.860
 that is, it is natural here from above 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.729
 really up can you know the top three 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:14.570
 here it is necessary to multiply by the numerator deuce 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:21.479
 and the denominator of the same luck we get that 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:26.939
 we will be two by five let's hang in 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.520
 the denominator will be 12 warm for 3 will be 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.390
 give 9 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.390
 know any 12 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:43.869
 how is it possible to write 5 integers 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:46.270
 10 12 plus three wholes and 912 as you see 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.270
 we didn't depict it that lead a couple 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.110
 minutes now according to the rule first 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.009
 we fold 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:02:02.530
 fractional part and then we fold the whole 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:13.239
 Part 5 plus 3 will give us 8 8 5 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:19.810
 plus 3 gives us 8 separately covered here 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:20.849
 it's with plans now then 10 12 plus 9 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.180
 12 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:27.129
 gives us 1912 also here with us again 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.500
 it turned out the wrong fraction and we 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.440
 the numerator more denominator goes there 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.370
 must see a whole hour a whole hour here 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.910
 will be with us 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.910
 it is necessary from 19-12 will be one whole and 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:48.130
 712 and then the valuable part here is me 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.120
 due which here has increased the ice 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:56.859
 add the sum of these estimated 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:03:01.780
 the sensor we get something gives us 5 plus 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:05.010
 3 gives 8 + 1 gives us 9 and this 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.010
 fractional part of all 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.090
 Thank you for your attention Like 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.870
 subscribe and hour we ourselves 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.870
