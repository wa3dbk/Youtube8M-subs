 looking at such pretty faces 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.660
 hard to believe these animals can 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.970
 become homeless 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.340

 death until someone from people not 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.960
 take care of them and not bring to the shelter 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.449

 there were about 70 animals approximately 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.680
 as much as in pathos but the sum 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.720
 allotted to the state shelter 3-4 times 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.329

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.920
 abandoned animals but much better 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.170
 they can hold them all 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.100
 equally forced to enter into contracts with

 potential distributors 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.130

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.350
 have to look at their own 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.850
 animals and not throw them away 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.470
 annoying toy and living thing too 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.260
 abandoned animals come here too 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.890

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.850
 the hosts simply pushed him out of the way 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.350
 14 days will pass and if not 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.780
 there will be old masters 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.260
 or new owners of these animals 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.090
 join the ranks of candidates for euthanasia 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.580
 one could raise the problem of humane 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.330
 attitudes towards animals and write off and and on

 single shelter or state 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.030
 but essentially this problem is unclaimed 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.180
 pets of the whole society 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.620
