on<00:02:48.940> my<00:02:49.000> head<00:02:49.270> as<00:02:49.780> you<00:02:49.890> can<00:02:50.890> see<00:02:51.160> I<00:02:51.930> wouldn't

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
on my head as you can see I wouldn't

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.040 
on my head as you can see I wouldn't
agree<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.580> lace<00:02:54.850> is<00:02:55.150> undetectable

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
agree that the lace is undetectable

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.320 
agree that the lace is undetectable
because<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:56.800> can<00:02:56.980> still<00:02:57.250> see<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:57.490> lace<00:02:57.880> and

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
because I can still see the lace and

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.290 
because I can still see the lace and
definitely<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.500> cap<00:02:59.980> I<00:03:00.310> forgot<00:03:00.670> what<00:03:00.850> size<00:03:01.090> I

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
definitely the cap I forgot what size I

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.100 
definitely the cap I forgot what size I
got<00:03:01.570> but<00:03:02.290> this<00:03:02.440> cap<00:03:02.830> needs<00:03:03.630> like<00:03:04.630> more

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
got but this cap needs like more

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.080 
got but this cap needs like more
reinforcement<00:03:06.070> because<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:06.670> know<00:03:06.790> I<00:03:06.850> feel

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
reinforcement because you know I feel

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.490 
reinforcement because you know I feel
like<00:03:07.300> if<00:03:07.510> I'm<00:03:07.660> just<00:03:07.870> walking<00:03:08.050> down<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.380> street

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
like if I'm just walking down the street

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.920 
like if I'm just walking down the street
if<00:03:09.100> somebody<00:03:09.490> pulls<00:03:09.760> this<00:03:10.030> thing<00:03:10.330> like<00:03:10.600> look

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
if somebody pulls this thing like look

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.340 
if somebody pulls this thing like look
at<00:03:11.050> that<00:03:11.290> it's<00:03:11.800> not<00:03:12.010> very<00:03:12.250> secure<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:14.170> know

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
at that it's not very secure you know

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.050 
at that it's not very secure you know
it's<00:03:14.590> not<00:03:14.710> very<00:03:14.890> secure<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.460> I<00:03:15.520> probably<00:03:15.760> need

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
it's not very secure so I probably need

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.840 
it's not very secure so I probably need
to<00:03:16.090> sew<00:03:16.480> some<00:03:16.750> combs<00:03:17.080> on<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.980> sidebar<00:03:18.340> because

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
to sew some combs on the sidebar because

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.180 
to sew some combs on the sidebar because
it<00:03:19.060> does<00:03:19.270> need<00:03:19.600> a<00:03:19.870> little<00:03:20.080> bit<00:03:20.350> more<00:03:20.620> security

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
it does need a little bit more security

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.660 
it does need a little bit more security
on<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:22.330> side<00:03:22.600> but<00:03:23.350> I<00:03:23.410> think<00:03:23.770> other<00:03:24.010> than<00:03:24.130> that

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
on the side but I think other than that

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.940 
on the side but I think other than that
you<00:03:25.209> know<00:03:25.240> I<00:03:25.540> like<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.320> texture<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.770> the<00:03:26.920> hair

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
you know I like the texture of the hair

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.250 
you know I like the texture of the hair
you<00:03:27.670> know<00:03:27.850> I<00:03:27.880> like<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.209> fact<00:03:28.360> that<00:03:28.510> it<00:03:28.720> has<00:03:28.930> a

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
you know I like the fact that it has a

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.949 
you know I like the fact that it has a
little<00:03:29.620> bit<00:03:29.830> more<00:03:30.040> party<00:03:30.550> room<00:03:30.850> than<00:03:31.570> other

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
little bit more party room than other

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.820 
little bit more party room than other
and<00:03:32.470> so<00:03:33.400> this<00:03:34.240> is<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.720> party<00:03:35.110> room<00:03:35.140> that<00:03:35.500> I<00:03:35.530> get

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
and so this is the party room that I get

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.490 
and so this is the party room that I get
the<00:03:36.370> length<00:03:36.700> of<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.090> hair<00:03:37.390> it's<00:03:37.720> believable

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
the length of the hair it's believable

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.949 
the length of the hair it's believable
it<00:03:39.070> could<00:03:39.250> be<00:03:39.370> my<00:03:39.550> hair<00:03:39.850> like<00:03:40.090> it's<00:03:40.420> not<00:03:40.690> too

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
it could be my hair like it's not too

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.310 
it could be my hair like it's not too
long<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.709> it's<00:03:42.220> not<00:03:42.400> too<00:03:42.670> short<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.840> texture

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
long and it's not too short the texture

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.290 
long and it's not too short the texture
is<00:03:44.350> just<00:03:44.709> awesome<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.790> fact<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.090> you

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
is just awesome and the fact that you

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.560 
is just awesome and the fact that you
can<00:03:46.450> curl<00:03:46.780> it<00:03:46.989> is<00:03:47.170> also<00:03:47.470> good<00:03:47.650> like<00:03:48.340> it<00:03:48.700> is<00:03:49.270> it

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
can curl it is also good like it is it

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.260 
can curl it is also good like it is it
feels<00:03:49.840> so<00:03:50.230> soft<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:50.890> I<00:03:51.400> like<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.910> curl

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
feels so soft and I like the curl

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.900 
feels so soft and I like the curl
pattern<00:03:52.810> of<00:03:52.989> it<00:03:53.170> too<00:03:53.500> this<00:03:54.040> is<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.370> back<00:03:54.610> as

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
pattern of it too this is the back as

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:03.970 
pattern of it too this is the back as
well<00:04:00.000> front

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.809 

and<00:04:04.459> then<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.180> other<00:04:05.209> side<00:04:06.250> it's<00:04:07.250> like<00:04:07.400> I<00:04:07.580> said

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
and then the other side it's like I said

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.000 
and then the other side it's like I said
I<00:04:08.000> like<00:04:08.209> this<00:04:08.360> here<00:04:08.629> because<00:04:09.379> it<00:04:09.530> just<00:04:09.650> feels

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
I like this here because it just feels

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.149 
I like this here because it just feels
like<00:04:10.159> my<00:04:10.670> hair<00:04:11.030> like<00:04:11.510> I<00:04:11.690> just<00:04:11.750> love<00:04:12.140> it<00:04:12.290> it<00:04:12.950> just

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
like my hair like I just love it it just

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.440 
like my hair like I just love it it just
needs<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.430> little<00:04:13.459> bit<00:04:13.730> of<00:04:13.879> you<00:04:14.420> know

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
needs a little bit of you know

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.390 
needs a little bit of you know
reinforcement<00:04:15.409> or<00:04:15.560> I<00:04:15.590> can<00:04:15.830> just<00:04:15.860> use<00:04:16.160> bobby

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
reinforcement or I can just use bobby

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.370 
reinforcement or I can just use bobby
pins<00:04:16.549> to<00:04:16.850> hold<00:04:17.030> it<00:04:17.239> down<00:04:17.269> like<00:04:17.600> i<00:04:17.720> usually<00:04:17.930> do

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
pins to hold it down like i usually do

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.409 
pins to hold it down like i usually do
with<00:04:18.560> my<00:04:18.680> other<00:04:18.829> ways<00:04:19.100> what<00:04:19.760> if<00:04:19.880> I<00:04:19.970> hold<00:04:20.239> them

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
with my other ways what if I hold them

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.390 
with my other ways what if I hold them
down<00:04:20.479> I<00:04:20.840> think<00:04:21.079> I<00:04:21.229> am<00:04:21.530> pretty<00:04:21.799> good<00:04:22.070> to<00:04:22.220> go

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400
