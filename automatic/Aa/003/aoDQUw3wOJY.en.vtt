00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.140
Life Has Finally Shown You

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.780
It's A Mean Old World

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.980

Always Had Everything

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.720
Just Handed To You

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.660
Always Had It Your Way

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.680
I Got To Hand It To you

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.620
And Seeing You Now, All Broken Down, I Gotta Say

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.100
It's A Funny Little Tragedy

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.860
A Funny Little Tragedy

You're Standing On My Doorstep

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.680
You Say You've Got Nowhere To Go

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.400
You're All Soaking Wet

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.740
I've Never Seen You So Low

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.640
Sorry If I Don't Fall

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.080
For Your Tricks Again

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.500
But I Seem To Recall

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.200
The Way You Did Me In

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.740
And Now Your New Lover Has Left You High And Dry,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.900
I Gotta Say

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.460
It's A Funny Little Tragedy

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.420
A Funny Little Tragedy

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.380
A Funny Little Tragedy

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.480
Yeah

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.400
I Dream About This Day

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.780
Seeing You Go Down This Way

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.640
That's All I Got To Say

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.920
Maybe Some Day

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.360
If I See You Again

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.940
Things Will Be Different

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.540
And We Can Say We're Friends

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.660
But For Now I Believe

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.480
You Better Walk Away

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.460
The Little Soldier And Me

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.240
We Go Our Separate Ways

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.860
I Can Watch You Walking

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.320
Tears Running Down Your Face

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.040
It's A Funny Little Tragedy

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.060
A Funny Little Tragedy

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.220
A Funny Little Tragedy

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.960
Yeah

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.120
I Dream About This day

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.540
Seeing You Down This Way

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.280
That's All I Got To Say
