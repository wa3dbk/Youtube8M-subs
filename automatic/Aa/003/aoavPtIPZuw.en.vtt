00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
like so okay now going to scale again

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.970 
like so okay now going to scale again
and<00:03:13.370> just<00:03:13.520> push<00:03:13.850> up<00:03:15.430> all<00:03:16.430> right<00:03:16.720> like<00:03:17.720> so<00:03:18.170> don't

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
and just push up all right like so don't

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.949 
and just push up all right like so don't
quite<00:03:19.250> worry<00:03:19.459> about<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.850> let<00:03:19.970> it'll<00:03:20.330> all<00:03:20.570> make

quite worry about it let it'll all make

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.670 
quite worry about it let it'll all make
its<00:03:21.410> way<00:03:21.590> around<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.840> let's<00:03:23.840> just<00:03:24.050> extrude

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
its way around and let's just extrude

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.760 
its way around and let's just extrude
again<00:03:26.500> okay

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
again okay

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.580

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
so I move up and then I'm going to AH to

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.670 
so I move up and then I'm going to AH to
scale<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.660> just<00:03:35.660> bring<00:03:36.110> it<00:03:36.260> out<00:03:36.470> like<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:37.130> and

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
scale and just bring it out like so and

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.130 
scale and just bring it out like so and
just<00:03:39.680> go<00:03:40.340> through<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.790> processes<00:03:41.390> again<00:03:41.780> of

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
just go through the processes again of

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.190 
just go through the processes again of
extruding<00:03:43.360> something's<00:03:44.360> gone<00:03:44.510> quite<00:03:44.870> a<00:03:44.900> bit

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
extruding something's gone quite a bit

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.760 
extruding something's gone quite a bit
there<00:03:45.530> I<00:03:46.030> don't<00:03:47.030> want<00:03:47.239> it<00:03:47.360> son<00:03:47.600> that<00:03:47.810> all<00:03:48.620> right
