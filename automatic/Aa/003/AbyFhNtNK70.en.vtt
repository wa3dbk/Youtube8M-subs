00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.140

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:30.279
 At the age of eight when I discover the carnivalito, the principles of the 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.600
 carnival game details we go back 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
 at this moment it is located in the modality of floats 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.270
 The experience of this teacher allows us to identify expressions 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.920
 artistic carnival 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.760
 dependent on the work of the float that is the one that houses 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.760

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.960
 is that here they are researched and signaled 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.950
 while it falls those who investigate and put into practice but from the start 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.700
 his name is negredo 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.890
 bolaÃ±os japan 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.160
 I am licensed 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.510
 costumes 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.180
 graduated from the unam 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.620
 the children are the public gave up the investigation of diego 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.150
 if this is the first step for something called carnival school 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.440
 the research project 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.890
 which qualifies the valuation of carnival as cultural heritage 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.700
 the material of humanity 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.600
 workers of the school unah 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.180
 It is a project 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.180
 which aims to contribute to the training process 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.520
 cultural 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.380
 the project workers of the region 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.060
 to achieve 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.109
 a north awareness 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:54.529
 it truly means the way what is dance what music is 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.830
 what is the same 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.000
 in the talk they simply make different motives 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.890
 are the pretext to achieve we will apply 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.409
 let's say other pedagogies make the student lean 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.809
 within this index measures the perception 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:16.790
 that he has the will to appropriate an idea 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.790
 the power to represent in that space of land 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:24.589
 if it does not mean is that they have the different characters that we see in the 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:26.049
 carnival path 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.389
 I gave him that case they could begin to understand the three points after 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.679
 begin the project carnival school completely 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:36.859
 the teachers will undoubtedly be a source of inspiration and knowledge this is not the 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.909
 symbols and stories that are behind these multicolored parades 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.359
 in the case he wins as he says 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.189
 in this sense to the president in comparsa 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:51.239
 I participated in mundane countries like having this contact with the different 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.069
 modalities the rate of value they have and also start tasting by 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.339
 so to speak of the powers of the state of gestation we are all part 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:03.859
 of a body that is an integral living thing where we can not could not not 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.019
 there may be a dissolution of these elements 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.980
 to understand this you have to live the carnival and study it 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.399
 the teacher fredy diego knows 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:15.810
 to generate an idea and a proposal 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.939
 artistic carnival 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.509
 It is important 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:21.649
 do research 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:25.699
 it is important to know customs traditions myths legends 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:28.840
 the black and white carnival video 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.090
 kresic transforms always has something to tell the past in research 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.260
 it is a destination that can not be missed
