00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.570 

look<00:02:17.420> at<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:19.330> smooth<00:02:20.330> right<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.800> no<00:02:22.190> problems

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
look at that smooth right so no problems

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.030 
look at that smooth right so no problems
there<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.140> let's<00:02:24.140> try<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.440> open<00:02:24.740> another

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
there and let's try to open another

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.420 
there and let's try to open another
window<00:02:25.820> and<00:02:26.210> let's<00:02:26.840> open<00:02:27.110> my<00:02:27.290> website<00:02:27.710> mobi

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
window and let's open my website mobi

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.730 
window and let's open my website mobi
scrub<00:02:28.670> calm<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.330> see<00:02:29.810> how<00:02:29.959> that<00:02:30.170> works<00:02:30.350> so

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
scrub calm and see how that works so

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.710 
scrub calm and see how that works so
let's<00:02:31.670> go<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:32.709> MLB<00:02:33.709> I<00:02:33.950> as<00:02:34.580> they<00:02:35.120> evoke<00:02:35.420> movies

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
let's go to MLB I as they evoke movies

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.530 
let's go to MLB I as they evoke movies
Capcom<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:36.620> you<00:02:37.580> know<00:02:37.730> that<00:02:37.880> my<00:02:38.000> website<00:02:38.390> does

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
Capcom and you know that my website does

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.310 
Capcom and you know that my website does
have<00:02:38.780> quite<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.350> few<00:02:39.440> images<00:02:39.860> so<00:02:41.140> let's<00:02:42.140> see<00:02:42.290> how

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
have quite a few images so let's see how

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.160 
have quite a few images so let's see how
that<00:02:42.530> works<00:02:42.709> it<00:02:43.459> just<00:02:43.780> still<00:02:44.780> taking<00:02:45.080> a

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
that works it just still taking a

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.140 
that works it just still taking a
violent<00:02:45.590> this<00:02:46.010> obviously<00:02:46.400> depends<00:02:46.790> on<00:02:46.940> the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
violent this obviously depends on the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.210 
violent this obviously depends on the
internet<00:02:47.630> connection<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.140> Cure<00:02:48.350> on<00:02:48.500> this

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
internet connection the Cure on this

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.590 
internet connection the Cure on this
beat<00:02:49.430> in<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.670> bandwidth<00:02:50.090> of<00:02:50.120> your<00:02:50.450> own

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
beat in the bandwidth of your own

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.050 
beat in the bandwidth of your own
internet<00:02:50.900> connection<00:02:51.380> so<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.580> know<00:02:52.700> if<00:02:52.880> you

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
internet connection so you know if you

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.120 
internet connection so you know if you
had<00:02:53.239> something<00:02:53.720> faster<00:02:54.380> than<00:02:54.410> my<00:02:54.650> connection

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
had something faster than my connection

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.970 
had something faster than my connection
it<00:02:55.310> will<00:02:55.459> probably<00:02:55.670> be<00:02:55.820> faster<00:02:56.180> than<00:02:56.330> this<00:02:56.980> so

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
it will probably be faster than this so

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.699 
it will probably be faster than this so
there<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.220> go<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.760> websites<00:02:59.120> loaded<00:02:59.420> and

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
there you go the websites loaded and

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.920 
there you go the websites loaded and
very<00:03:00.709> good<00:03:00.890> scrolling<00:03:01.280> let's<00:03:01.580> pan<00:03:01.970> zoom<00:03:02.270> very

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
very good scrolling let's pan zoom very

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.729 
very good scrolling let's pan zoom very
smooth<00:03:03.260> flawless<00:03:04.100> actually<00:03:04.670> it's<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:06.650> know

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
smooth flawless actually it's you know

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.460 
smooth flawless actually it's you know
it<00:03:06.860> kind<00:03:07.070> of<00:03:07.160> adjusts<00:03:07.640> very<00:03:07.880> quickly<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:12.290> the

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
it kind of adjusts very quickly so the

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.290 
it kind of adjusts very quickly so the
browsing<00:03:12.680> experience<00:03:12.890> really<00:03:13.670> just<00:03:14.000> depends

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
browsing experience really just depends

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.610 
browsing experience really just depends
on<00:03:14.420> three<00:03:14.600> things<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.170> speed<00:03:15.410> with<00:03:15.590> which

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
on three things the speed with which

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.250 
on three things the speed with which
websites<00:03:16.280> are<00:03:16.489> rendered<00:03:17.150> how<00:03:17.720> smooth<00:03:18.110> the

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
websites are rendered how smooth the

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.810 
websites are rendered how smooth the
scrolling<00:03:18.650> is<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:19.010> whether<00:03:19.340> panning<00:03:19.760> and

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
scrolling is and whether panning and

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.539 
scrolling is and whether panning and
zooming<00:03:19.940> works<00:03:20.420> fine<00:03:20.680> all<00:03:21.680> in<00:03:21.890> all<00:03:22.010> the

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
zooming works fine all in all the

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.520 
zooming works fine all in all the
browser<00:03:22.790> is<00:03:23.000> good<00:03:23.209> however<00:03:24.049> there<00:03:24.290> is<00:03:24.500> a

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
browser is good however there is a

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.110 
browser is good however there is a
slight<00:03:24.830> limitation<00:03:25.549> to<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.670> number<00:03:26.000> of

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
slight limitation to the number of

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.550 
slight limitation to the number of
options<00:03:26.360> provided<00:03:27.250> in<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.400> menu<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:30.440> know

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
options provided in the menu you know

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.600 
options provided in the menu you know
you<00:03:30.620> can<00:03:30.860> really<00:03:31.040> just<00:03:31.220> switch<00:03:31.430> between

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
you can really just switch between

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.490 
you can really just switch between
different<00:03:31.790> windows<00:03:32.090> at<00:03:32.570> bookmarks<00:03:33.230> and

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
different windows at bookmarks and

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.800 
different windows at bookmarks and
that's<00:03:33.830> that's<00:03:34.220> about<00:03:34.519> it<00:03:34.549> but<00:03:35.390> again<00:03:35.510> it's

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
that's that's about it but again it's

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.600 
that's that's about it but again it's
not<00:03:35.959> a<00:03:35.989> deal<00:03:36.200> breaker<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.860> browser<00:03:37.130> is<00:03:37.400> still

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
not a deal breaker the browser is still

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.400 
not a deal breaker the browser is still
quite<00:03:37.850> nice<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.330> you<00:03:38.480> can<00:03:38.600> obviously<00:03:38.840> make<00:03:39.170> it

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
quite nice and you can obviously make it

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.990 
quite nice and you can obviously make it
better<00:03:39.560> with<00:03:39.799> third-party<00:03:40.370> browsers<00:03:40.790> such<00:03:40.970> as

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
better with third-party browsers such as

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.130 
better with third-party browsers such as
dolphin<00:03:41.989> HD<00:03:42.170> or<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:43.100> UC<00:03:43.430> browser<00:03:43.930> so<00:03:44.930> that's

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
dolphin HD or the UC browser so that's

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.569 
dolphin HD or the UC browser so that's
it<00:03:45.260> about<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.620> browser<00:03:45.829> on<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.190> samsung
