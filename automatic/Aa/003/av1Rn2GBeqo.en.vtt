00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
before us within a staffing and and I

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.630 
before us within a staffing and and I
chose<00:02:19.080> this<00:02:19.140> record<00:02:19.650> over<00:02:19.950> lot<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.490> other

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
chose this record over lot of other

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.010 
chose this record over lot of other
records<00:02:21.060> because<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.600> thought<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.870> was<00:02:21.930> the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
records because I thought it was the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.820 
records because I thought it was the
best<00:02:22.170> record<00:02:22.380> for<00:02:22.620> me<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:25.350> it<00:02:25.650> looks

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
best record for me and and it looks

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
best record for me and and it looks
quite<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.190> little<00:02:26.520> zuska<00:02:27.030> here<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.950> gilman

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
quite a little zuska here and and gilman

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.280 
quite a little zuska here and and gilman
the<00:02:29.940> other<00:02:30.060> guys<00:02:30.270> for<00:02:30.480> taking<00:02:30.600> fiber<00:02:30.900> told<00:02:31.200> me

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
the other guys for taking fiber told me

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.740 
the other guys for taking fiber told me
that<00:02:31.470> if<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.640> got<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.000> certain<00:02:33.150> ranking<00:02:33.630> I

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
that if I got to a certain ranking I

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.690 
that if I got to a certain ranking I
could<00:02:33.930> put<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> little<00:02:34.230> lower<00:02:34.709> guy<00:02:35.010> for<00:02:35.220> example

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
could put a little lower guy for example

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.670 
could put a little lower guy for example
now<00:02:36.209> so<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.450> guess<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.810> helps<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.200> your<00:02:37.440> cat
