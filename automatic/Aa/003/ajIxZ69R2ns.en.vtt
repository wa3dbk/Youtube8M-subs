melts faster when it comes into contact
with<00:01:39.240> water<00:01:39.479> eventually<00:01:40.469> the<00:01:40.829> birds<00:01:41.070> become

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
now and so it's orientated trying to

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.950 
now and so it's orientated trying to
work<00:01:55.920> out<00:01:56.130> where<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.490> are<00:01:56.600> just<00:01:57.600> cuz<00:01:57.780> all<00:01:57.930> of
