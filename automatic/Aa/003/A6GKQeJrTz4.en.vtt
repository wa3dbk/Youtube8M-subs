00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.370
 momentous change now the diets 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.470

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.300
 that we start ordering the week and 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.030
 this week have a diet prepared 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.710
 special that is effective fast and very 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.570
 economic and that many have done it 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.960
 famous people like jennifer lopez the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.119
 egg diet 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.949
 five days very easy with three meals in 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.810
 the day and some snack that 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.600
 let's go counting but if we go 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.749
 talking about how it's going to be breakfast 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.089
 our day 1 breakfast we're going to 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:41.670
 show on the screen we come to see 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:44.670
 let's see if it's going to be a natural juice 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.199
 of fresh and natural oranges 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.649
 let's drink tea or coffee with sweeteners 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:54.120
 and a hard boiled egg is well said here 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.799
 I wanted to forgive me I put melero and I 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.129
 distraction I felt that he is shaking 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:01.589
 imagine Italian running I leave you the 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.629
 egg over lion's head then 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.360
 he played no natural orange a tea or a 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.180
 coffee with sweetener and an omelet can 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.980
 be the hard game if I did not want to do it 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.240
 the eye also here I will tell you a 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.240
 secret but we do it with an egg 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.240
 egg 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:25.020
 and another piece of information that I can tell you is that 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.330
 You can also use the eggs without 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.590
 buds to also have more 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.090
 tranquility for people who 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.830
 they have cholesterol problems and always 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.930
 we recommend that please 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.740
 also ask your doctors the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.470
 people who have health problems 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.020
 but the egg all this what has been so 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.130
 slandered and badly weighted the egg today 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.110
 for today after many studies 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.270
 we know that it is a super healthy food and 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.950
 protein and that does not have those 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.110
 contraindications that were counted 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.420
 earlier today the egg is a 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.670
 very healthy and natural food that does not have 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.100
 problems with cholesterol and so 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.380
 that you can eat the omelette with clara 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.420
 of egg and those just egg whites or 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.979
 a complete egg with another web clarita 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.140
 so you get more abundant what you put 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.330
 to tuna or a mixture with two eggs 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.710
 put two eggs but one yolk understand 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.240
 the stellar idea is so that this one does not 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.610
 have problems this is going to repeat the 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.410
 breakfast that is going to be a natural juice of 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.290
 oranges a tea or a coffee when 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.670
 sweetener and our prepared omelette 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.160
 with an egg and if you want it to be more 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.720
 abundant with another egg white or if 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.580
 not the hard-boiled egg 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.110
 ok and the omelette can be put some 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.110
 vegetable and some little thing 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.780
 a droplet of pan water so that what 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.430
 make it much healthier in this flower than 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.020
 it does not stick to us and we do not have to use the 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.160
 oil though we go then with the 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.350
 snack 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.910
 for blas with our average mean will go to 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.620
 you not just a snack that the 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.620
 we can repeat if we want it to be 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.170
 a non- fat natural yogurt we are 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.820
 watching lunch on the screen but 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.190
 also lunch well in the snack 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.930
 making the snack can be several 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.980
 times a day if you need them 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.990
 really because with these three 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.480
 Lunches at three meals a day is 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.400
 enough yogurt you can repeat it in 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.440
 the day or that god that great novel 'the 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.350
 as we are seeing on screen is going to be 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.520
 a boiled egg with lettuce salad 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:14.850
 tomato and tuna and for dessert a fruit 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.040
 we can also have alternatives 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.110
 lunch that can be a pasta with 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.600
 natural tomato sauce not sauce 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.690
 packaged sauce is the pomodoro sauce 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.880
 classic one compact and your salad 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.200
 fruits and the hard egg and the egg not what 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.200
 we put with our part 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.959
 tomato sauce is like pomodoro and 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.030
 it could also become a chicken 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.910
 grilled or grilled fish with 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.340
 salad green vegetables cooked egg 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.410
 hard and your dessert that is going to be a fruit 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.780
 base then at lunch enters 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.340
 complement lunch is not the basis 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.220
 of lunch let's say 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.110
 eat chicken at home or the beach there is a 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.239
 background dish that can be tuna with 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.610
 lettuce tomato salad can be the 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.980
 grilled chicken or fish marching with 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.799
 cooked vegetables or the mayweather or the 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.299
 pasta with pomodoro everything with tomato only 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.580
 in all three change the three cases 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.170
 accompanied with the hard little egg and 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.840
 dessert a fruit that can be a 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.569
 apple always the fruit unit if 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.450
 let's eat half guides or some other 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.669
 basket that is harder to measure we go 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.160
 about four enough strawberries 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.710
 three slices of pineapple a piece of watermelon 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.510
 melon but always a small position 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.120
 no bigger than what can be a 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.970
 punto are silva requested successful graffÃ© 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.500
 that's our dessert for lunch and 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.030
 good and here we go again with the 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.320
 snack that we will repeat if 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.630
 is that we are hungry but yes 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.270
 pass by far better still so we have 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.070
 hungry we eat another me a line is 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.170
 good to set aside no 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.000
 right now do not pass by because no 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.590
 have nothing of hunger but if you have a 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.600
 little bit of hunger is the best social 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.430
 another hungry this very well wanted 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.930
 keep me to the lines and because I know that 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.850
 suddenly one would have to eat even 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.950
 without hunger to be able to get the 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.750
 Mandela metabolism and accelerate the 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.310
 metabolism because if we spend more than 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.020
 They want me to have a reed and we eat with 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.450
 least big colleagues by 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.550
 the lakes good to see if the actions or 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.960
 magnetto and we follow better that what 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.820
 we had discussed some other diet 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.800
 preparations that have not seen us what 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.520
 we repeat and go to dinner 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.700
 then ok and our dinner is our 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:22.650
 Huevito cooked nice hard with salad 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:26.280
 and of drinking arugula green tea lettuce and a 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.560
 piece of fruit that's going to be our dinner 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.900
 then our little eggs that can 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.430
 add three per day because it bothers him 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.590
 a little annoying you can prepare it 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.360
 with another clear egg but not 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.520
 add more buds or the day can not 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.249
 be more than three buds and as they also 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.499
 counted 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:42.879
 the myth that the egg has cholesterol 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:46.179
 or that have problems for pan and 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:47.829
 all that is a lie that does not exist anymore 

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:50.529
 society the egg has cholesterol but 

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:54.999
 is no longer in the minority 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:56.319
 more high-click cholesterol appears more 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:58.359
 medical care and supervision 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:00.129
 course, maybe remove some yolk 

00:05:58.359 --> 00:06:03.099
 because the yolk maybe the one that can 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:05.439
 cause it to rise but it does not make you 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:09.089
 appear that is the point there is to sink a 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:09.089
 egg the pum of an egg per day 

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:15.279
 If it is very good, it is so important 

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:17.139
 grana game cleans a great source of 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:19.329
 protein and calcium therefore for 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.129
 the biggest women we need 

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:23.259
 also our good 12 case and we will 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:26.379
 serve so with this diet for them 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:28.599
 we are going to lose five kilos to 44 kilos in 

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:30.999
 five days and there is always that good 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:32.349
 control yourself and take two liters of water 

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:34.509
 that I always advise and do 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:36.899
 of course exactly 10 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:36.899
 it happened 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.810
 the present day 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:55.140
 like a lot of eggs and has a regal look 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.140
 it's the real region 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:07.480
 it's good that he changed on Monday 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:09.160
 after the weekend it is with 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.720
 the times we talked before the 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.060
 diet on Friday so that our 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.830
 viewers friends will be prepared and the 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.200
 Monday will start but from now on 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.380
 forward the same Monday of attention 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:24.090
 because we're going to be telling you a 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:24.090
 slander of a new way of taking care
