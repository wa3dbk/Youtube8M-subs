00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.890
 Hello everyone , I recommend the body of Korean church main denominations fall period 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.750
 According to the right of the General Assembly announced the statistics gyose 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:15.929
 1 As concerns concern, the number of churches is declining, 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.980
 The number of students has been declining significantly 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.980
 It is a report of the reporter 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:29.770
 If you look at the statistics of the major churches in Korea, 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:34.210
 It has been found that the majority of the churches have declined or stagnated . 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:40.210
 Current members of the Korean Presbyterian Church General Assembly are 981 10,500 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:44.620
 As 31 people had been counted as of about 40,000, down from last year 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.790
 Since the year 2010, there has been a gradual decline in membership 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.530
 There is 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.150
 Above all, there is a marked decline in church school grades , which remains a major challenge. 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.910
 There is 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:01.920
 As the number of students in secondary school up to 9 people from over 4,173,000 infants than last year 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:06.930
 30,000 people down. 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.490
 About three-quarters of the 40,000 population decline occurred in church schools 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.950
 It is. 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:19.560
 On the other hand, the number of church and pastor elders increased slightly 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:22.860
 The number of united churches increased from 8,355 last year to 8400 17 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:27.900
 2 incandescent has increased 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:33.780
 There are 16,800 ministers in the scene and more than 600 more than last year. 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:37.920
 Elders increased by 380 to 27,931. 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:42.840
 The number of church members continues to shrink, while the number of church and pastor elders steadily 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.290
 The Korean church is expected to solve this structural imbalance in the future. 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.420
 I see 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:55.030
 Lead to the total number of members of the Presbyterian Church hapsin total is 152003 hundred 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:02:01.870
 And more than 2,400 people were identified as middle class 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:06.820
 The elderly have heard a little, but the number of church school students has decreased as a result of the lag 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:12.560
 On the other hand, the number of churches belonging to the church increased from 800 to 96, 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:17.030
 My elders were more than a hundred, with over a hundred men . 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.190
 Holiness Church for the Christian congregation also 5.15 million people in more than 20,000 people last year, 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:24.080
 Or more 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:27.440
 The Korean Christian Presbytery recorded 291,000 people, compared with 8,000 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.280
 We've seen over two hundred manifold figures. 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:36.200
 On the other hand, there was a denomination that showed a slight increase 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.920
 The joint presbytery of the Korean Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.630
 Number 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.460
 It announced that it increased by 9,990,005 thousand people compared to 6,000 people last year 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:49.550
 I noticed. 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:53.250
 Churches had only 26 places to increase over 1500 where ministers are 19600 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:58.050
 I heard 340 people in 10 people . 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.490
 The alternative is also the genesis of Baekseok General Assembly of 3300 Confucian 8700 Chengdu 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.860
 I used to belong. 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:07.110
 Done with the 900 churches in this Assembly yejang band and denominations integration 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:11.730
 I look at 4300 churches. 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.170
 The results of the professors' control of major denominations send a red signal of Korean church growth 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.190
 There is 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.520
 Especially in the church school students who will lead the future 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:24.290
 We seem to need special efforts and measures. 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.290
