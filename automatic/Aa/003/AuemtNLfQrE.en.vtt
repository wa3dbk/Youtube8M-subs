let's see the articulation the head I'm

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.640 
let's see the articulation the head I'm
very<00:03:09.100> happy<00:03:09.820> it's<00:03:09.940> not<00:03:10.120> stiff<00:03:10.570> pretty<00:03:11.530> much

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
very happy it's not stiff pretty much

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.319 
very happy it's not stiff pretty much
the<00:03:11.860> only<00:03:11.890> thing<00:03:12.340> is<00:03:12.459> actually<00:03:12.640> stiff<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.209> his

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
the only thing is actually stiff is his

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.660 
the only thing is actually stiff is his
body<00:03:13.570> you<00:03:14.410> see<00:03:14.620> how<00:03:14.709> much<00:03:15.010> pressure<00:03:15.400> I'm

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
body you see how much pressure I'm

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.130 
body you see how much pressure I'm
applying<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.299> it<00:03:16.390> it's<00:03:16.510> still<00:03:16.720> not<00:03:16.900> going<00:03:17.019> to

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
applying to it it's still not going to

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.020 
applying to it it's still not going to
move<00:03:17.320> maybe<00:03:17.920> that's<00:03:18.190> just<00:03:18.310> because<00:03:18.430> just

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
move maybe that's just because just

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.240 
move maybe that's just because just
brought<00:03:19.299> them<00:03:19.420> out<00:03:19.540> of<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.750> box<00:03:19.959> I<00:03:20.380> honestly

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
brought them out of the box I honestly

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.610 
brought them out of the box I honestly
think<00:03:21.730> that's<00:03:22.000> why<00:03:22.209> now<00:03:23.019> let's<00:03:23.200> see<00:03:23.380> if<00:03:23.440> the

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
think that's why now let's see if the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.920 
think that's why now let's see if the
belt<00:03:23.890> can<00:03:24.160> fit<00:03:24.370> around<00:03:24.459> his<00:03:24.760> waist<00:03:24.790> it<00:03:25.540> feels

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
belt can fit around his waist it feels

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.990 
belt can fit around his waist it feels

very awkward we're not putting on the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.860 
very awkward we're not putting on the
belt<00:03:28.180> I<00:03:28.360> mean<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:30.820> really<00:03:31.090> does<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.630> belt

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870
