the<00:00:39.149> weapon<00:00:39.329> scope<00:00:39.780> there<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> way<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.250> you

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
the weapon scope there is a way that you

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.369 
the weapon scope there is a way that you
can<00:00:41.489> do<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.940> but<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.239> fairly<00:00:42.420> contrived<00:00:43.079> I'll

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
can do it but it's fairly contrived I'll

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.170 
can do it but it's fairly contrived I'll
get<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.680> later<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> video<00:00:44.309> each

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
able to use a different scope with it

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.020 
able to use a different scope with it
and<00:04:25.530> actually<00:04:25.710> put<00:04:25.979> a<00:04:26.010> normal<00:04:26.190> scope<00:04:26.520> on<00:04:26.729> it

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
and actually put a normal scope on it

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.510 
and actually put a normal scope on it
a<00:04:27.060> sniper<00:04:27.450> scope<00:04:27.840> on<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.380> in<00:04:29.190> fact<00:04:29.340> you're

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
a sniper scope on it and in fact you're

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.320 
a sniper scope on it and in fact you're
being<00:04:29.700> charged<00:04:30.030> 700<00:04:30.870> station<00:04:31.260> cash<00:04:31.470> for<00:04:31.860> the

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
privilege of doing that so technically

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.040 
privilege of doing that so technically
you<00:04:35.340> can<00:04:35.580> get<00:04:35.820> a<00:04:35.850> normal<00:04:36.180> battle<00:04:36.480> rifle<00:04:36.870> with<00:04:37.020> a

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
you can get a normal battle rifle with a

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.440 
you can get a normal battle rifle with a
normal<00:04:37.410> scope<00:04:37.650> on<00:04:37.889> it<00:04:37.919> but<00:04:38.790> the<00:04:39.000> method<00:04:39.330> is

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
normal scope on it but the method is

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.970 
normal scope on it but the method is
contrived<00:04:40.020> you<00:04:40.260> have<00:04:40.440> to<00:04:40.590> essentially

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
contrived you have to essentially

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.510 
contrived you have to essentially
purchase<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.639> same<00:04:41.880> weapon<00:04:42.270> again<00:04:42.570> in<00:04:43.520> order

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
purchase the same weapon again in order

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.310 
purchase the same weapon again in order

to be allowed to use different scopes
with<00:04:46.560> it<00:04:46.710> rather<00:04:46.889> than<00:04:47.010> just<00:04:47.610> being<00:04:47.940> able<00:04:48.120> to

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
with it rather than just being able to

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.690 
with it rather than just being able to
take<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.990> sniper<00:04:49.230> rifle<00:04:49.710> scope<00:04:49.980> off<00:04:50.190> of<00:04:50.580> the
