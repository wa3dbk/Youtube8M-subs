00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hello dear friends with you again

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.260
 for inter found 2015 collector download 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.750
 sorry for my english they are not the most 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.030
 unfortunately professional money 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.699
 I only have one chest 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.189
 as if not usually the chest that is there 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.199
 given for free yet bought it and he 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.150

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.660
 available only to the owners as an enzyme 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.460
 I think those who do not have a compendium will 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.180
 interesting to see so for a start everything 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.719

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.590

 great dzhagernaut well, just some 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:51.539
 spring as for me it does not look like it 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.640
 not at all frightening for jellyfish in 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.530
 In principle, the light is normal, but I do not 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.890
 like basically with this on jellyfish and 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.930
 Jellyfish can not stand 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.449

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.280
