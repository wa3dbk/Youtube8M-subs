00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 the food of today's cinema in a drawing 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.710
 excited 1 impersonating who never wanted 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.780
 those closed steamed buns for 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.960
 this recipe is today and are 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.790
 delicious filling is made with 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.949
 pork and Chinese cabbage but you need to 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.160
 let him train a little before then 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.140
 as soon as very thin and sprinkle the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.680
 salt on top leaving to rest for 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.680
 about 10 minutes 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.510
 I have 250 grams of pork 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.920
 ground 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.950
 I chose an album for having a little bit 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.690
 of fat now I only add two 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.730
 tablespoons of water to leave the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.730
 stuffing well number inside the bank 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.020
 now add a tablespoon of 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.090
 soy sauce one of oil tea 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.410
 sesame roasted two centimeters 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.720
 grated ginger and mexico and chives 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.610
 green mixes everything and then we're in 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.880
 agreement I've trained and I'm well 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.350
 quick mix in the rest and hey ready 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.229
 reserved in the refrigerator while 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.149
 easy to make the dough very easy to make 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.040
 this requires developing a spoonful of 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:18.030
 organic yeast tea in three 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.160
 cups of warm water and 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.350
 add to a cup and a half of flour 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.550
 of wheat leaves a little 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.550
 warm water because you may need 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.010
 so everything is only going to stay 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.010
 homogeneous mass 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.210
 then in mauro and fourth in eight pieces 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.210
 making balls like that 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.040
 in a year the ball stand up to 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.040
 more or less this size 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:17.090
 Now I'm going to split the filling into eight 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.360
 parts and place a part inside each 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.360
 roll 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.920
 in the kitchen the buns and I will use only 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.750
 watching made of bamboo which is to 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.640
 cooking things in steam but who does not 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.459
 you can use a cooked factors that 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.069
 comes with some pots or even a 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:58.459
 drainer that fits in the pan 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.140
 and I put up paper concepts to bounce 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.640
 underneath each bun is that it does not 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.430
 stick at the time of cooking 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.170
 cook for about 15 minutes 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.120
 a secret to turning off the fire after 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.680
 wait five minutes before 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.489
 de sÃ£o paulo to that he is being well 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.730

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:18.850
 these countries are delicious is not all 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.850
