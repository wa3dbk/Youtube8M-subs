00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
sometimes and it really really pissed me

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.569 
sometimes and it really really pissed me
off<00:03:57.380> he<00:03:57.590> could<00:03:57.799> have<00:03:57.890> gotten<00:03:58.010> so<00:03:58.250> many<00:03:58.340> more

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579

off he could have gotten so many more
goals<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:58.940> he<00:03:59.000> did<00:03:59.209> even<00:03:59.810> though<00:03:59.870> he<00:03:59.959> got<00:04:00.049> the

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
goals and he did even though he got the

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.259 
goals and he did even though he got the
most<00:04:00.319> goals<00:04:00.620> on<00:04:00.799> the<00:04:00.890> team<00:04:01.160> already<00:04:01.459> such<00:04:02.090> as

he<00:04:11.960> wasn't<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.410> best<00:04:12.820> I've<00:04:13.820> used<00:04:14.120> so<00:04:14.390> far

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
he wasn't the best I've used so far

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.440 
he wasn't the best I've used so far
because<00:04:15.200> EA<00:04:15.650> didn't<00:04:16.040> cater<00:04:16.280> this<00:04:16.519> game<00:04:16.790> to<00:04:17.150> his

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
because EA didn't cater this game to his

finishing his movement is finishing was

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.760 
finishing his movement is finishing was
fantastic<00:04:22.280> but<00:04:23.260> dribbling<00:04:24.260> and<00:04:24.380> pace<00:04:24.560> are

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
fantastic but dribbling and pace are

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.350 
fantastic but dribbling and pace are
more<00:04:24.950> important<00:04:25.310> than<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:25.580> and<00:04:25.820> he<00:04:26.210> just

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
more important than that and he just

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.700 
more important than that and he just
didn't<00:04:26.600> have<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:26.810> so<00:04:27.110> that<00:04:27.260> was<00:04:27.380> kind<00:04:27.590> of<00:04:27.620> an
