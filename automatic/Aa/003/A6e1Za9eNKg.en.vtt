00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
balls left a little bit inside but we're

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.069 
balls left a little bit inside but we're
able<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.010> run<00:00:47.160> past<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.640> corner<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.149> and

able to run past the corner and and

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.860 
able to run past the corner and and
catch<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.500> ball<00:00:49.680> right<00:00:49.890> there<00:00:50.510> got<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> safety

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
catch the ball right there got a safety

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.959 
catch the ball right there got a safety
here<00:00:52.289> that's<00:00:52.500> rotated<00:00:53.160> over<00:00:53.489> with<00:00:53.940> that

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
here that's rotated over with that

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.990 
here that's rotated over with that
motion<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:56.100> he's<00:00:56.250> not<00:00:56.399> able<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.820> get

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
motion and so he's not able to get

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.569 
motion and so he's not able to get
involved<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> play<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.770> even<00:00:59.280> though<00:00:59.309> it's

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
involved in the play so even though it's

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.180 
involved in the play so even though it's
a<00:00:59.670> quick<00:00:59.850> passing<00:01:00.390> scheme<00:01:00.719> there<00:01:01.469> are<00:01:01.590> some

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
a quick passing scheme there are some

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.399 
a quick passing scheme there are some
play<00:01:02.430> action<00:01:02.670> involved<00:01:03.480> with<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.989> right<00:01:04.140> here

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
play action involved with it right here

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.590 
play action involved with it right here
let's<00:01:05.330> take<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> look<00:01:06.570> at<00:01:06.630> another<00:01:06.869> fade<00:01:07.229> here

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
let's take a look at another fade here

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.149 
let's take a look at another fade here
now<00:01:09.600> we've<00:01:09.750> got<00:01:09.930> more<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.380> press<00:01:10.650> coverage

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
now we've got more of a press coverage

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.950 
now we've got more of a press coverage
so<00:01:11.430> he's<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.850> try<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.119> get<00:01:12.360> right<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.810> his

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
so he's going to try to get right on his

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.289 
so he's going to try to get right on his
toes<00:01:13.260> before<00:01:13.590> he<00:01:13.920> fades<00:01:14.189> out<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.640> then<00:01:14.970> create

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
toes before he fades out and then create

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.130 
toes before he fades out and then create
that<00:01:15.479> separation<00:01:16.020> right<00:01:16.409> here<00:01:17.900> we've<00:01:18.900> gone

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
that separation right here we've gone

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.980 
that separation right here we've gone
empty<00:01:19.530> here<00:01:20.060> what<00:01:21.060> we've<00:01:21.240> done<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.570> we've<00:01:21.720> put

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
our fullback we've removed our full back

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.630 
our fullback we've removed our full back
from<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> game<00:01:28.799> we've<00:01:28.979> put<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.250> more<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.520> an

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
from the game we've put in more of an

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.460 
from the game we've put in more of an
athlete<00:01:30.030> out<00:01:30.060> here<00:01:30.600> someone<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.290> catch

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
the defense to shift over to a trip set

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.429 
the defense to shift over to a trip set
over<00:01:35.490> here<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.729> little<00:01:35.880> bit<00:01:36.060> more<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:37.290> we're

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
over here a little bit more so we're

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.160 
over here a little bit more so we're
empty<00:01:38.060> that's<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.210> stick<00:01:39.509> call<00:01:39.750> right<00:01:39.990> there

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
empty that's a stick call right there

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.929 
empty that's a stick call right there
and<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.409> can<00:01:40.560> see<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.799> our<00:01:41.130> wide<00:01:41.490> receiver

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
and you can see that our wide receiver

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.719 
and you can see that our wide receiver
pressed<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.799> it's<00:01:43.799> going<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.009> press<00:01:44.220> up<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.490> his
