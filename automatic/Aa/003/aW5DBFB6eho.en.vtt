share<00:00:12.660> with<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.679> technique<00:00:14.460> I've<00:00:14.639> been

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
share with you the technique I've been

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.840 
share with you the technique I've been
using<00:00:15.030> recently<00:00:15.420> for<00:00:16.020> grilled<00:00:16.199> chicken<00:00:16.850> I'm

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
using recently for grilled chicken I'm

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.570 
using recently for grilled chicken I'm
pretty<00:00:18.180> excited<00:00:18.840> about<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.650> way<00:00:20.189> I've<00:00:20.400> been

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
pretty excited about the way I've been

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.070 
pretty excited about the way I've been
doing<00:00:20.789> chicken<00:00:21.000> lately<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.449> think<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:21.869> pretty

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
doing chicken lately I think it's pretty

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.740 
doing chicken lately I think it's pretty
easy<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.880> you<00:00:23.880> know<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.029> always<00:00:24.240> had<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> hard

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
easy and you know I always had a hard

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.050 
easy and you know I always had a hard
time<00:00:25.050> like<00:00:25.410> cooking<00:00:26.039> chicken<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.849> right

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
time like cooking chicken to the right

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.240 
time like cooking chicken to the right
doneness<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:28.050> know<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.199> either<00:00:28.470> kill<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.010> or

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
doneness you know you either kill it or

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.089 
doneness you know you either kill it or
you<00:00:29.429> can't<00:00:29.699> get<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.349> cooked<00:00:31.349> properly<00:00:31.619> and

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
you can't get it cooked properly and

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.750 
you can't get it cooked properly and
this<00:00:32.969> method<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.930> involves<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.950> reverse<00:00:35.370> sear

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
this method that involves a reverse sear

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.720 
this method that involves a reverse sear
and<00:00:36.149> indirect<00:00:36.750> heat<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.260> start<00:00:37.469> off<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:38.700> I

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
and indirect heat to start off that I

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.729 
and indirect heat to start off that I
learned<00:00:39.000> from<00:00:39.120> meathead<00:00:39.870> at<00:00:40.079> amazing<00:00:40.350> ribs

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
learned from meathead at amazing ribs

I<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:42.120> really<00:00:42.390> works<00:00:42.540> well<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:42.750> me<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.050> I

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
I just really works well for me so I

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.510 
I just really works well for me so I
thought<00:00:43.590> it'd<00:00:43.680> be<00:00:43.770> fun<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.010> share<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:44.370> you

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
thought it'd be fun to share it with you

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.049 
thought it'd be fun to share it with you
guys<00:00:44.670> as<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.440> explained<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.620> any<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.340> sort

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
guys as I explained this any of the sort

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.119 
guys as I explained this any of the sort
of<00:00:48.180> scientific<00:00:48.750> elements<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.649> process

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
of scientific elements of the process

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.729 
of scientific elements of the process
are<00:00:50.460> completely<00:00:51.210> from<00:00:51.570> from<00:00:52.140> meat<00:00:52.289> head<00:00:52.500> and

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
are completely from from meat head and

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.979 
are completely from from meat head and
his<00:00:52.920> his<00:00:53.520> science<00:00:53.910> advisor<00:00:54.239> apparently<00:00:54.899> is

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
his his science advisor apparently is

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.310 
his his science advisor apparently is
called<00:00:55.199> dr.<00:00:55.590> Greg<00:00:56.039> blonder<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> just

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
called dr. Greg blonder and so I just

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.660 
called dr. Greg blonder and so I just
sort<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.530> take<00:00:58.739> his<00:00:58.890> word<00:00:59.070> for<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.370> because<00:00:59.520> it

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
sort of take his word for it because it

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.910 
sort of take his word for it because it
seems<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.000> work<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.359> me<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:01.289> spices<00:01:01.710> I'm

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
seems to work for me the spices I'm

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.950 
seems to work for me the spices I'm
going<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.129> use<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.730> sort<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.149> make<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:03.780> as<00:01:03.930> I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
going to use this sort of make up as I

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.429 
going to use this sort of make up as I
go<00:01:04.170> along

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
go along

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.550 
go along
but<00:01:05.159> Jennifer<00:01:05.430> seems<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.909> like<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.500> this<00:01:07.500> is

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
but Jennifer seems to like it so this is

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.649 
but Jennifer seems to like it so this is
the<00:01:07.710> pattern<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.159> we've<00:01:08.460> evolved<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.540> what

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the pattern that we've evolved so what

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.969 
the pattern that we've evolved so what
we<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:09.900> here<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> chicken<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
we have here is the chicken and the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.380 
we have here is the chicken and the
chicken<00:01:11.159> has<00:01:11.520> actually<00:01:11.939> already<00:01:12.299> been

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
chicken has actually already been

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.969 
chicken has actually already been
through<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.049> first<00:01:13.350> step<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> process

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
through the first step in the process

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.310 
through the first step in the process
which<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.790> what's<00:01:15.090> called<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.450> dry<00:01:15.689> brine<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
which is what's called the dry brine and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.859 
which is what's called the dry brine and
all<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.130> means<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.909> salt<00:01:18.630> has<00:01:18.840> been

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
all that means is that salt has been

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.359 
all that means is that salt has been
applied<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.530> chicken<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.220> been

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
applied to the chicken and it's been

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.609 
applied to the chicken and it's been
allowed<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.640> rest<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.930> think<00:01:22.170> meat<00:01:22.409> head

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
allowed to rest and I think meat head

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.130 
allowed to rest and I think meat head
says<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.159> use<00:01:23.340> about<00:01:23.549> half<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.360> teaspoon<00:01:24.540> per

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
says to use about half a teaspoon per

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.920 
says to use about half a teaspoon per
pound<00:01:25.409> which<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.909> just<00:01:27.150> sort<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.630> amount

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
pound which is just sort of the amount

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.569 
pound which is just sort of the amount
of<00:01:28.049> salt<00:01:28.290> II<00:01:28.439> would<00:01:28.650> think<00:01:28.680> sprinkling<00:01:29.460> on

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
of salt II would think sprinkling on

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.310 
of salt II would think sprinkling on
your<00:01:29.759> food<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.299> if<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.600> were<00:01:30.720> seasoning<00:01:31.200> it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
your food like if you were seasoning it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.249 
your food like if you were seasoning it
to<00:01:31.439> taste<00:01:31.759> so<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.790> never<00:01:33.060> measure<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.630> but

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
to taste so I never measure that but

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.109 
to taste so I never measure that but
this<00:01:34.470> process<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> dry<00:01:35.490> brine<00:01:35.820> I've

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
this process of the dry brine I've

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.660 
this process of the dry brine I've
started<00:01:36.390> incorporating<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.439> into<00:01:37.920> almost

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
started incorporating it into almost

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.880 
started incorporating it into almost
every<00:01:39.030> protein<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:39.930> cook<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.740> this

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
every protein that I cook it just this

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.800 
every protein that I cook it just this
is<00:01:41.159> simple<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.939> seems<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.420> really

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
is simple and it seems to have a really

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.260 
is simple and it seems to have a really
great<00:01:42.930> effect<00:01:43.380> not<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.640> flavor<00:01:44.909> but

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
great effect not just for the flavor but

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.389 
great effect not just for the flavor but
also<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.960> tenderness<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.130> juice

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
also the tenderness and the juice

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.210

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
time with the salt you can go to amazing

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.850 
time with the salt you can go to amazing
ribs<00:01:53.970> calm<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.810> real<00:01:55.020> explanation<00:01:55.350> but

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
ribs calm for the real explanation but

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.679 
ribs calm for the real explanation but
there's<00:01:56.070> something<00:01:56.640> about<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.000> ions<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
there's something about the ions in the

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.569 
there's something about the ions in the
salt<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.140> when<00:01:58.290> they<00:01:58.409> dissolve<00:01:58.860> into<00:01:59.369> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
salt that when they dissolve into the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.719 
salt that when they dissolve into the
meat<00:01:59.850> protein<00:02:00.390> they<00:02:01.170> actually<00:02:01.920> help<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
meat protein they actually help the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.109 
meat protein they actually help the
protein<00:02:03.149> fibers<00:02:03.600> unravel<00:02:04.460> in<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.670> process

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
protein fibers unravel in a process

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.779 
protein fibers unravel in a process
called<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.540> denaturing<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:08.250> makes<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
called a denaturing and that makes the

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.960 
called a denaturing and that makes the
meat<00:02:08.940> more<00:02:09.090> tender

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
meat more tender

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.380 
meat more tender
makes<00:02:10.300> it<00:02:10.479> softer<00:02:11.350> and<00:02:11.380> more<00:02:11.590> tender<00:02:11.890> and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
makes it softer and more tender and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.810 
makes it softer and more tender and
juicier<00:02:13.390> apparently<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:14.830> that's<00:02:15.340> what<00:02:15.550> we<00:02:15.640> do

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
juicier apparently so that's what we do

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.230 
juicier apparently so that's what we do
we<00:02:16.450> do<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.720> dry<00:02:16.900> brine<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:18.790> chicken<00:02:19.030> has

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
we do the dry brine and this chicken has

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.730 
we do the dry brine and this chicken has
been<00:02:19.270> in<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.630> fridge<00:02:19.780> for<00:02:19.840> about<00:02:20.080> six<00:02:20.590> hours

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
been in the fridge for about six hours

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.440 
been in the fridge for about six hours
but<00:02:21.190> even<00:02:21.460> if<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:21.640> just<00:02:21.850> do<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.120> for<00:02:22.240> one<00:02:22.300> or

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
but even if you just do it for one or

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.270 
but even if you just do it for one or
two<00:02:22.570> hours<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:23.050> think<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.560> get<00:02:23.710> some<00:02:23.890> benefit

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
two hours I think you get some benefit

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.180 
two hours I think you get some benefit
and<00:02:24.720> from<00:02:25.720> there<00:02:25.930> I'm<00:02:26.140> just<00:02:26.470> gonna<00:02:26.620> add<00:02:26.890> about

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
and from there I'm just gonna add about

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.600 
and from there I'm just gonna add about
two<00:02:27.640> tablespoons<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:28.660> peanut<00:02:29.620> oil<00:02:29.920> I<00:02:30.220> like<00:02:30.430> to

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
two tablespoons of peanut oil I like to

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.940 
two tablespoons of peanut oil I like to
use<00:02:30.760> but<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.360> use<00:02:31.990> whatever<00:02:32.230> oil<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.800> like

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
use but you use whatever oil you like

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.980 
use but you use whatever oil you like
and<00:02:34.380> just<00:02:35.380> get<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.400> little<00:02:37.090> coating<00:02:37.390> there<00:02:37.750> so

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
and just get a little coating there so

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.180 
and just get a little coating there so
the<00:02:38.110> oil<00:02:38.320> will<00:02:38.710> help<00:02:38.740> our<00:02:39.190> rub<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.270> here<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:42.040> the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
the oil will help our rub it here to the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.660 
the oil will help our rub it here to the
chicken<00:02:42.550> of<00:02:42.670> course<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:44.130> then<00:02:45.130> I've<00:02:45.430> made

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
chicken of course and then I've made

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.100 
chicken of course and then I've made
just<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:46.750> seasoning<00:02:47.940> spice<00:02:48.940> mixture<00:02:49.480> here<00:02:49.870> that

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
just a seasoning spice mixture here that

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.460 
just a seasoning spice mixture here that
we'll<00:02:50.770> put<00:02:51.760> in<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:51.970> recipe<00:02:52.420> on<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.630> write-up

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
we'll put in a recipe on the write-up

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.490 
we'll put in a recipe on the write-up
I<00:02:53.530> don't<00:02:54.160> usually<00:02:54.340> measure<00:02:55.090> very<00:02:55.540> precisely<00:02:55.690> I

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
I don't usually measure very precisely I

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.280 
I don't usually measure very precisely I
like<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.100> go<00:02:57.220> by<00:02:57.370> how<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:57.730> smells<00:02:58.140> once<00:02:59.140> you

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
like to go by how it smells once you

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.140 
like to go by how it smells once you
start<00:02:59.560> mixing<00:02:59.709> things<00:03:00.040> together<00:03:00.280> if<00:03:00.700> one<00:03:01.030> of

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
start mixing things together if one of

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.540 
start mixing things together if one of
the<00:03:01.240> elements<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:02.170> know<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.560> dominating<00:03:03.340> then

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
the elements you know is dominating then

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.540 
the elements you know is dominating then
you<00:03:03.670> know<00:03:03.820> it's<00:03:04.060> not<00:03:04.180> quite<00:03:04.390> unbalanced<00:03:05.080> but

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
you know it's not quite unbalanced but

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.340 
you know it's not quite unbalanced but
the<00:03:06.550> basic<00:03:06.910> idea<00:03:07.240> here<00:03:07.570> is<00:03:07.660> some<00:03:07.810> Italian

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
the basic idea here is some Italian

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.620 
the basic idea here is some Italian
seasoning<00:03:08.560> some<00:03:09.100> chili<00:03:09.400> powder<00:03:09.700> coriander

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
seasoning some chili powder coriander

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.860 
seasoning some chili powder coriander
and<00:03:11.110> cumin<00:03:11.500> little<00:03:11.860> garlic<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.400> pepper

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
and cumin little garlic and pepper

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.910 
and cumin little garlic and pepper
somehow<00:03:13.870> I<00:03:13.900> think<00:03:14.050> those<00:03:14.380> things<00:03:14.620> end<00:03:14.830> up

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
somehow I think those things end up

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.210 
somehow I think those things end up
working<00:03:15.250> real<00:03:15.400> well<00:03:15.430> so<00:03:16.330> just<00:03:17.110> do<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.650> dusting

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
working real well so just do a dusting

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.460 
working real well so just do a dusting
on<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.420> chicken<00:03:20.340> mix<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:21.550> up<00:03:22.230> repeat<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.410> a

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
on the chicken mix it up repeat that a

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.340 
on the chicken mix it up repeat that a
few<00:03:23.800> times<00:03:23.830> till<00:03:24.519> all<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.450> chicken<00:03:25.780> is<00:03:25.959> well

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
few times till all the chicken is well

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.460 
few times till all the chicken is well
coated<00:03:26.739> on<00:03:27.100> both<00:03:27.310> sides<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:28.000> then<00:03:28.690> what<00:03:29.350> I'll

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
coated on both sides and then what I'll

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.810 
coated on both sides and then what I'll
do<00:03:29.590> is<00:03:29.709> just<00:03:29.890> put<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.130> back<00:03:30.250> in<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.550> fridge<00:03:30.760> for

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
do is just put it back in the fridge for

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.960 
do is just put it back in the fridge for
5-10<00:03:31.600> minutes<00:03:31.930> while<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.519> grill<00:03:33.519> is<00:03:33.670> coming

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
5-10 minutes while the grill is coming

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.850 
5-10 minutes while the grill is coming
up<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.239> temperature<00:03:34.390> and<00:03:34.810> it'll<00:03:35.470> be<00:03:35.530> ready<00:03:35.650> to

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
up to temperature and it'll be ready to

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.160 
up to temperature and it'll be ready to
go<00:03:35.890> okay<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:37.239> that's<00:03:37.570> what<00:03:37.780> it<00:03:37.870> looks<00:03:38.050> like

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
go okay so that's what it looks like

go okay so that's what it looks like
when<00:03:38.410> we're<00:03:38.530> done<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:38.920> it's<00:03:39.670> time<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:39.940> eat<00:03:40.000> up

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
when we're done and it's time to eat up

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.720

the grill okay so I've got the chicken

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.330 
the grill okay so I've got the chicken
on<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.150> grill<00:03:43.180> now<00:03:43.660> and<00:03:43.959> what<00:03:44.860> I've<00:03:44.980> done<00:03:45.190> is

I've set it up for indirect cooking or
they<00:03:48.130> call<00:03:48.340> it<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.640> two<00:03:48.880> zone<00:03:49.180> setup<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:50.019> there's

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
they call it a two zone setup so there's

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.350 
they call it a two zone setup so there's
the<00:03:50.799> fire<00:03:51.040> is<00:03:51.340> only<00:03:51.489> on<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.910> left<00:03:52.150> side

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
the fire is only on the left side

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.640 
the fire is only on the left side
there's<00:03:53.170> no<00:03:53.410> heat<00:03:53.940> on<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.120> right<00:03:55.299> side<00:03:55.600> I<00:03:55.989> had

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
there's no heat on the right side I had

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.530 
there's no heat on the right side I had
all<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:57.040> burners<00:03:57.489> turned<00:03:57.850> on<00:03:58.000> just<00:03:58.030> to<00:03:58.390> get

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
all the burners turned on just to get

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.509 
all the burners turned on just to get
the<00:03:58.720> initial<00:03:59.320> temperature<00:03:59.680> up<00:04:00.070> but<00:04:00.220> now<00:04:00.370> I've

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
the initial temperature up but now I've

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.490 
the initial temperature up but now I've
turned<00:04:00.700> everything<00:04:01.030> off<00:04:01.299> except<00:04:02.049> my<00:04:02.170> front

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
turned everything off except my front

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.059 
turned everything off except my front
left

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
left

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.640 
left
and<00:04:03.640> we<00:04:04.390> happen<00:04:04.689> to<00:04:04.749> have<00:04:04.900> this<00:04:05.019> cool<00:04:05.260> grill

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
and we happen to have this cool grill

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.009 
and we happen to have this cool grill
that<00:04:06.430> allows<00:04:06.700> you<00:04:06.909> to<00:04:06.969> put<00:04:07.299> a<00:04:07.329> piece<00:04:07.659> of<00:04:07.840> wood

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
that allows you to put a piece of wood

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.800 
that allows you to put a piece of wood
or<00:04:08.560> some<00:04:08.799> or<00:04:09.010> charcoal<00:04:09.489> in<00:04:09.730> this<00:04:09.909> box<00:04:10.599> right

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
or some or charcoal in this box right

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.800 
or some or charcoal in this box right
above<00:04:11.139> the<00:04:11.319> gas<00:04:11.969> so<00:04:12.969> I've<00:04:13.090> got<00:04:13.239> a<00:04:13.269> nice<00:04:13.540> piece

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
above the gas so I've got a nice piece

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.720 
above the gas so I've got a nice piece
of<00:04:14.109> peach<00:04:14.709> wood<00:04:14.950> there<00:04:15.219> then<00:04:15.459> I'll<00:04:15.579> add<00:04:15.700> some

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
of peach wood there then I'll add some

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.810 
of peach wood there then I'll add some
smokiness<00:04:16.359> to<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:17.259> chicken<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:18.370> key<00:04:18.549> thing

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
smokiness to the chicken the key thing

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.759 
smokiness to the chicken the key thing
though<00:04:19.030> is<00:04:19.359> to<00:04:19.389> get<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.320> temperature

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
though is to get the the temperature

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.550 
though is to get the the temperature
once<00:04:21.009> I<00:04:21.190> close<00:04:21.430> this<00:04:21.729> to<00:04:22.539> be<00:04:23.259> able<00:04:23.349> to

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
once I close this to be able to

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
once I close this to be able to
stabilize<00:04:23.770> around<00:04:24.460> 225<00:04:25.090> to<00:04:25.509> 250<00:04:26.110> degrees<00:04:26.620> even

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
stabilize around 225 to 250 degrees even

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.379 
stabilize around 225 to 250 degrees even
anywhere<00:04:28.090> 225<00:04:28.750> to<00:04:28.930> 275<00:04:29.620> is<00:04:29.889> fine<00:04:30.099> but<00:04:30.880> the<00:04:31.030> idea

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
anywhere 225 to 275 is fine but the idea

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.300 
anywhere 225 to 275 is fine but the idea
is<00:04:31.449> that<00:04:31.870> when<00:04:32.169> we<00:04:32.320> start<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.830> chicken<00:04:33.160> low

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
is that when we start the chicken low

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.870 
is that when we start the chicken low
and<00:04:33.490> slow<00:04:35.039> we're<00:04:36.039> going<00:04:36.220> to<00:04:36.310> be<00:04:36.370> able<00:04:36.490> to<00:04:36.610> catch

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
and slow we're going to be able to catch

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.879 
and slow we're going to be able to catch
it<00:04:36.910> when<00:04:37.300> it<00:04:37.449> gets<00:04:37.570> right<00:04:37.870> up<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:38.259> the

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
it when it gets right up to the

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.650 
it when it gets right up to the
appropriate<00:04:39.130> doneness<00:04:39.639> to<00:04:39.940> then<00:04:40.090> finish<00:04:40.479> with

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
appropriate doneness to then finish with

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.589 
appropriate doneness to then finish with
a<00:04:40.690> quick<00:04:40.960> sear<00:04:41.729> it's<00:04:42.729> you<00:04:43.090> sort<00:04:43.330> of<00:04:43.389> have<00:04:43.570> a

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
a quick sear it's you sort of have a

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.689 
a quick sear it's you sort of have a
larger<00:04:44.110> window<00:04:44.289> because<00:04:45.070> it's<00:04:45.250> cooking<00:04:45.580> more

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
larger window because it's cooking more

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.850 
larger window because it's cooking more
slowly<00:04:45.940> and<00:04:46.930> then<00:04:47.139> you<00:04:47.259> just<00:04:47.440> finish<00:04:47.650> it<00:04:47.680> off

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
slowly and then you just finish it off

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.469 
slowly and then you just finish it off
so<00:04:49.199> like<00:04:50.199> I<00:04:50.320> said<00:04:50.380> that<00:04:50.970> chicken<00:04:51.970> is<00:04:52.060> arranged

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
so like I said that chicken is arranged

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.339 
so like I said that chicken is arranged
not<00:04:53.259> over<00:04:53.740> any<00:04:54.099> heat<00:04:54.460> and<00:04:55.110> everyone's<00:04:56.110> grill

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
not over any heat and everyone's grill

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.140 
not over any heat and everyone's grill
is<00:04:56.560> going<00:04:56.740> to<00:04:56.830> be<00:04:56.919> different<00:04:57.370> but<00:04:57.639> the<00:04:57.970> way

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
is going to be different but the way

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.620 
is going to be different but the way
mine<00:04:58.720> works<00:04:59.080> out<00:04:59.349> if<00:05:00.280> I<00:05:00.460> put<00:05:00.699> the<00:05:00.880> breasts<00:05:01.419> with

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
mine works out if I put the breasts with

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.710 
mine works out if I put the breasts with
the<00:05:01.780> fat<00:05:02.020> end<00:05:02.289> closest<00:05:03.009> to<00:05:03.160> the<00:05:03.580> heat<00:05:03.880> and<00:05:04.150> then

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
the fat end closest to the heat and then

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.110 
the fat end closest to the heat and then
the<00:05:04.930> wings<00:05:05.169> furthest<00:05:05.740> away<00:05:06.009> like<00:05:06.280> this<00:05:06.550> they

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
the wings furthest away like this they

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.180 
the wings furthest away like this they
actually<00:05:07.630> end<00:05:07.780> up<00:05:07.900> cooking<00:05:08.169> pretty<00:05:08.889> darn

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
actually end up cooking pretty darn

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.490 
actually end up cooking pretty darn
evenly<00:05:09.840> your<00:05:10.840> mileage<00:05:11.289> may<00:05:11.320> vary<00:05:11.550> but<00:05:12.550> I

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
evenly your mileage may vary but I

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.870 
evenly your mileage may vary but I
highly<00:05:14.500> recommend<00:05:14.590> in<00:05:15.070> general<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:15.550> use<00:05:15.699> of

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
highly recommend in general the use of

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.760 
highly recommend in general the use of
digital<00:05:16.300> thermometers<00:05:16.930> to<00:05:16.960> measure<00:05:17.199> your

notoriously awful I happen to know that
if<00:05:25.479> I<00:05:25.570> have<00:05:25.720> one<00:05:25.990> burner<00:05:26.229> on<00:05:26.470> full<00:05:26.800> with<00:05:27.009> one

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:36.009 
about 40 to 45 minutes of indirect

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:37.620 
about 40 to 45 minutes of indirect
cooking<00:05:36.220> before<00:05:36.759> we<00:05:36.880> get<00:05:37.000> that<00:05:37.180> chicken<00:05:37.389> to

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
cooking before we get that chicken to

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.260 
cooking before we get that chicken to
like<00:05:38.080> the<00:05:38.199> 150<00:05:38.800> degree<00:05:39.070> internal<00:05:39.610> zone<00:05:39.820> which

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
like the 150 degree internal zone which

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.430 
like the 150 degree internal zone which
I<00:05:40.419> will<00:05:40.570> check<00:05:40.780> with<00:05:40.960> the<00:05:41.080> digital

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
I will check with the digital

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.899 
I will check with the digital
thermometer<00:05:41.919> to<00:05:42.070> make<00:05:42.190> sure<00:05:42.490> that<00:05:42.639> were<00:05:42.759> there

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:42.909 
thermometer to make sure that were there

to be a little lower than that so I'm
about<00:06:00.699> to<00:06:00.969> serum<00:06:01.449> over<00:06:02.199> the<00:06:02.320> direct<00:06:02.590> heat<00:06:02.770> and

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
about to serum over the direct heat and

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.459 
about to serum over the direct heat and
finish<00:06:04.030> it<00:06:04.150> off<00:06:04.270> they're<00:06:05.020> not<00:06:05.139> going<00:06:05.320> to<00:06:05.380> go

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:05.469 
finish it off they're not going to go

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:07.290 
finish it off they're not going to go
too<00:06:05.680> much<00:06:05.710> internally<00:06:06.460> because<00:06:06.909> it's<00:06:07.120> not

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
too much internally because it's not

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.909 
too much internally because it's not
closed<00:06:07.690> and<00:06:08.050> all<00:06:08.169> the<00:06:08.320> heat<00:06:08.469> is<00:06:08.590> on<00:06:08.710> the

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
closed and all the heat is on the

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.380 
closed and all the heat is on the
exterior<00:06:09.430> but

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.390 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:38.200 

a<00:06:12.450> little<00:06:13.490> gray<00:06:14.490> down

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.960 

so<00:06:38.750> obviously<00:06:39.160> the<00:06:40.160> goal<00:06:40.340> here<00:06:40.610> is<00:06:40.670> just<00:06:40.700> to

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
so obviously the goal here is just to

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.690 
so obviously the goal here is just to
get<00:06:41.150> the<00:06:41.330> skin<00:06:41.630> nice<00:06:41.810> and<00:06:41.870> crispy<00:06:42.520> it's<00:06:43.520> not

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
get the skin nice and crispy it's not

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.320 
get the skin nice and crispy it's not

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
gonna take too long so just about 30-40
