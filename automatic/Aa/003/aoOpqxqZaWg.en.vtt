00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.160 
remaining pretty consistent in a
straight<00:02:25.549> rhythm<00:02:25.849> pattern<00:02:26.150> like<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:26.989> just

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
straight rhythm pattern like you just

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.640 
straight rhythm pattern like you just
heard<00:02:27.489> so<00:02:28.489> for<00:02:28.819> instance<00:02:29.120> if<00:02:30.049> I<00:02:30.200> play<00:02:30.379> that<00:02:30.500> one

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
heard so for instance if I play that one

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.170 
heard so for instance if I play that one
more<00:02:30.799> time

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.759 

you've<00:02:35.629> got<00:02:35.780> four<00:02:36.019> beats<00:02:36.230> in<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:36.590> measure

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
you've got four beats in that measure

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.350 
you've got four beats in that measure
but<00:02:37.370> you're<00:02:37.489> playing<00:02:37.610> three<00:02:38.060> sets<00:02:38.269> of

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
but you're playing three sets of

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.649 
but you're playing three sets of
triplets<00:02:38.680> one<00:02:39.680> triplet<00:02:40.040> two<00:02:40.250> triplet<00:02:40.659> three

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
triplets one triplet two triplet three

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.030 
triplets one triplet two triplet three
triplet

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
triplet

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.130 
triplet
and<00:02:43.159> then<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.180> second<00:02:44.510> measure<00:02:44.659> is<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.870> same

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
and then the second measure is the same

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.839 
and then the second measure is the same
way<00:02:45.349> except<00:02:45.830> it<00:02:45.920> starts<00:02:46.129> on<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.310> open<00:02:46.580> string

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
way except it starts on the open string

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:52.460 
way except it starts on the open string
the<00:02:47.180> fifth<00:02:47.329> string

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.230

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
and during that course of those notes

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.460 
and during that course of those notes
you're<00:02:54.480> hitting<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.780> fifth<00:02:55.020> string<00:02:55.230> on<00:02:55.380> the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
you're hitting the fifth string on the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.770 
you're hitting the fifth string on the
third<00:02:55.650> fret<00:02:55.680> twice
