00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
case itself is very very strong I can

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.640 
case itself is very very strong I can
ply<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.030> lot<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.630> pressure<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.110> this<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.530> it

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
ply a lot of pressure to this and it

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.360

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
does not snap as you see here so it's a

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.640 
does not snap as you see here so it's a
strong<00:03:02.700> case<00:03:02.940> it's<00:03:03.300> very<00:03:03.390> very<00:03:03.990> incredibly
