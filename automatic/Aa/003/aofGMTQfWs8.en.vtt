00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.700 

so<00:04:29.480> bungee<00:04:30.480> and<00:04:30.630> pull<00:04:31.140> things<00:04:31.350> from<00:04:31.530> the

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
so bungee and pull things from the

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.860 
so bungee and pull things from the
inside<00:04:32.660> okay

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
inside okay

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.200 
inside okay
so<00:04:34.080> that<00:04:34.230> goes<00:04:34.350> inside<00:04:34.790> let's<00:04:35.790> sit<00:04:35.940> on<00:04:35.970> your

usually you bungee everything before you

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:20.610
