these<00:03:57.760> up<00:03:57.940> over<00:03:58.180> time<00:03:58.360> and<00:03:58.600> so<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:58.840> knows<00:03:59.080> to

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
these up over time and so it knows to

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.920 
these up over time and so it knows to
smartly<00:03:59.650> handle<00:04:00.070> those<00:04:00.220> okay<00:04:01.030> so<00:04:01.420> that<00:04:01.630> so

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
smartly handle those okay so that so

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.210 
smartly handle those okay so that so

that cash after a certain number of
rules<00:04:03.430> then<00:04:03.970> it'll<00:04:04.270> literally<00:04:04.750> just<00:04:05.020> kind<00:04:05.230> of

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
rules then it'll literally just kind of

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.690 
rules then it'll literally just kind of
time<00:04:06.070> out<00:04:06.280> and<00:04:06.580> then<00:04:07.380> how<00:04:08.380> does<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:08.620> it<00:04:08.980> will

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
time out and then how does that it will

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.830 
time out and then how does that it will
actually<00:04:09.850> hold<00:04:10.090> onto<00:04:10.300> it<00:04:10.480> because<00:04:10.570> it

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
actually hold onto it because it

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.330 
actually hold onto it because it
recognizes<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:11.530> does<00:04:11.650> it<00:04:11.769> by<00:04:11.860> a<00:04:11.890> thing<00:04:12.190> we<00:04:12.310> call

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
recognizes it does it by a thing we call

conversation ID which is you can think

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.110

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
of it like subject but it's actually

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.520 
of it like subject but it's actually
