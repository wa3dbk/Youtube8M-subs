00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.390
 I wanted to be a super pretty woman super 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.220
 beautiful to wake you up at times the 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.170
 physical is not the most important thing I know that 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.210
 it's not the most important thing in fact I 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.850
 I say this can come whatever I am 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.309
 I put in ways the problem areas is 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:19.740
 important is that she is a woman who is 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.740
 understandably affectionate i like it a lot 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.160
 and the rest 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.529
 and start asking about twitter 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.539
 how do you know the mayagoitia engineer 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.320
 able that we both behave the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.320
 mister moscos 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.160
 with the day and we met friend 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.880
 Gilberto, you make me walk 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.220
 confusing I do not remember seeing 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.660
 I confused the contest of Mr. Ember 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.660
 the first was true 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.200
 when that video 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.630
 this doll what do you think you think tell me 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.370
 for not 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.290
 because I can tell you, I'm left without 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.770
 Words obviously is a beautiful woman 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.770
 but but I know that she is already busy 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.860
 very well 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.320
 If I have to think about the engineer 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.320
 mayagoitÃ­a is that he 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.650
 Y 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.650
 good title had it 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:33.670
 model therefore is equivalent to being 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:35.580
 the winner of our beauty but you're 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.580
 the most handsome gentleman of all 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.580
 Congratulations 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.360
 there's a picture where I go, we're going to 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.030
 teach the positions that hill and I 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.240
 we have practiced this time I remember you 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.080
 first and put them 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.080
 so fine now 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.140
 we went from Robert with your head towards 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.140
 back your heel 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.940
 That's what the engineer was saying 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.090
 afternoons 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.709
 and I was surprised by nothing else 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:49.520
 part of the production is quite a 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.290
 champion champions like my aboytia 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.330
 they have that ability to know more and 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.630
 there 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.310
 but again half and half then 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.630
 I guess it's normal that he lives and visits 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.900
 to all the contestants in your home and 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.900
 all 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.430
 this way a few days is not true 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.300
 but we do not know 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.340
 the time stops we wanted 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.340
 I need an ambulance for my environment 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.870
 pretty 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.630
 question with the engineer forward is going to 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:38.250
 be the first question and it's how many 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:40.610
 hours you take a day at the gym 12 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.610
 hours 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.239
 the engineer, well, not always 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.709
 time when you can then good 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.390
 taken advantage of there one hour hour and 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.569
 mean it depends we make up with the 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.980
 times of work and so this one does not 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.599
 hour and a half hour 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.040
 four times a week when you can 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.060
 sometimes less sometimes more I say it depends 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.620
 a lot of the time 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.359
 Guayaquil is leaving me something in the 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.260
 fronts you do not know what this is like in 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.260
 four meters in the Chinese 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.520
 as we already look 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.500
 friends , tell him 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.140
 and that that should learn from the engineer 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.350
 I got the delegation 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.450
 the worst part of the case is that he said they 're going 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.430
 four times a week only one hour 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.800
 serve like five hours every week 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.320
 and new results good 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.640
 engineer please what do you think of the 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.030
 diamond goal that is there with us to 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.030
 his side 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:44.100
 but it is also very cool right now is 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.110
 beautiful and I love her very much and she is a 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.980
 Beautiful princess is a princess like 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.690
 just said exactly that is my king 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.790
 look for the ladies who want 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.770
 conquer your heart and well then 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.660
 I'm mainly looking for a person that 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.950
 want a person because obviously that 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.950
 be humble that is sincere 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.980
 and then now I say something that 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.570
 have said I'm not so interested in the 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.050
 physical that I want to clarify enough 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:14.720
 for me for me they really tell him everything 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.449
 and the truth in the capsule said I'm not going to 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.630
 lie 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.910
 I like it clear 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.830
 enrique do not always like a person 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.450
 only by the physicist that's why 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.670
 know the woman because when there 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.560
 chemistry the physicist not important a 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.630
 advice do not say that you care about the 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.630
 physical so said melanie tocayo casandra 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.120
 we already know who is going to be the good one and with 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.980
 Who am I going to understand who is going to 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.780
 get out that good spark and what are they going to 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.000
 expect them from you and we do what 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.980
 you are looking for them but they are going to receive them 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.370
 once I conquered all my love 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.290
 sincere 100% me as I am and so good 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.849
 that's what appointments are for us 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.440
 know so that we know each other 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:01.670
 Oh so cute 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.670
 but she tells herself
