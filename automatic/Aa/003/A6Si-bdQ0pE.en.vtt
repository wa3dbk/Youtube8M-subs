it and like if I'm right here in front

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.280 
it and like if I'm right here in front
of<00:03:36.769> your<00:03:36.860> mouth<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.400> it's<00:03:37.489> quite<00:03:38.290> hypnotic

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
of your mouth and it's quite hypnotic

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.990 
of your mouth and it's quite hypnotic
actually<00:03:39.709> to<00:03:39.830> be<00:03:39.980> in<00:03:40.100> that<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:40.760> if<00:03:40.820> you<00:03:40.910> know

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
actually to be in that and if you know

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.910 
actually to be in that and if you know
carefully<00:03:41.450> wind<00:03:41.630> up<00:03:41.810> sounding<00:03:42.350> agnostic<00:03:42.799> so<00:03:42.860> I

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
carefully wind up sounding agnostic so I

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.830 
carefully wind up sounding agnostic so I
guess<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:43.250> only<00:03:43.340> hard<00:03:43.640> thing<00:03:43.730> is<00:03:43.880> you've<00:03:44.660> got

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
guess the only hard thing is you've got

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.080 
guess the only hard thing is you've got
the<00:03:44.930> director<00:03:45.350> there<00:03:45.560> going<00:03:46.160> you're<00:03:46.880> putting

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
the director there going you're putting

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.449 
the director there going you're putting
the<00:03:47.299> asleep<00:03:47.630> wake<00:03:47.959> me<00:03:48.140> up<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:49.070> you<00:03:49.190> have<00:03:49.340> to

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
the asleep wake me up and you have to

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.030

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
act it so that part of it I think is to

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.740 
act it so that part of it I think is to
read<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.610> act<00:03:53.000> your<00:03:53.180> book<00:03:53.480> at<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.690> same
