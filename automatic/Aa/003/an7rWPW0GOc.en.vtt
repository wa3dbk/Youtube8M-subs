00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.730 

I<00:00:00.089> guess<00:00:00.719> like<00:00:00.989> the<00:00:01.170> first<00:00:01.380> thing<00:00:01.560> I<00:00:01.680> would

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
I guess like the first thing I would

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.610 
I guess like the first thing I would
always<00:00:01.979> say<00:00:02.310> is<00:00:02.370> is<00:00:03.149> whatever<00:00:03.570> you<00:00:03.899> do<00:00:04.080> you<00:00:04.500> got

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
always say is is whatever you do you got

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.530 
always say is is whatever you do you got
to<00:00:04.710> have<00:00:04.859> that<00:00:05.220> passion<00:00:05.790> and<00:00:05.940> drive<00:00:06.150> you<00:00:06.420> got

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
to have that passion and drive you got

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.390 
to have that passion and drive you got
to<00:00:06.629> love<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:07.589> do<00:00:07.770> something

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
to love to do something

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.879 
to love to do something
I<00:00:10.580> think<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.940> height<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.330> my<00:00:12.480> training<00:00:12.889> was

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
I think the height of my training was

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.090 
I think the height of my training was
probably<00:00:14.250> looking<00:00:14.460> at<00:00:14.790> around<00:00:14.910> five<00:00:15.920> to<00:00:16.920> eight

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
probably looking at around five to eight

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.500 
probably looking at around five to eight
hours<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.940> day<00:00:18.890> straight<00:00:19.890> for<00:00:20.430> about<00:00:20.699> two<00:00:21.270> to

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
hours a day straight for about two to

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.599 
hours a day straight for about two to
two<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.840> half<00:00:21.930> years<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.470> even<00:00:23.250> trained<00:00:23.490> on

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
two and a half years I even trained on

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.529 
two and a half years I even trained on
my<00:00:23.699> birthday<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.890> Christmas<00:00:25.970> Easter<00:00:26.970> holidays

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539

forgetting that my mom still made me do

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.380 
forgetting that my mom still made me do
all<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.669> homework

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
all the homework

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
oh love to mom cheese we didn't have

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.139 
oh love to mom cheese we didn't have
YouTube<00:00:43.170> back<00:00:43.620> then<00:00:43.860> all<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.610> had<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.850> rely<00:00:45.120> on

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
YouTube back then all we had to rely on

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.200 
YouTube back then all we had to rely on
was<00:00:45.329> one<00:00:46.289> football<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:47.489> maybe<00:00:47.670> five<00:00:47.969> or<00:00:48.000> six

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
was one football that maybe five or six

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.770 
was one football that maybe five or six
guys<00:00:48.600> chipped<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.800> share<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.539> we<00:00:51.539> did<00:00:51.690> it

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
guys chipped in to share and we did it

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.299 
guys chipped in to share and we did it
because<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:52.079> loved<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.800> we<00:00:53.070> did<00:00:53.219> it

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
because we loved it and we did it

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.540 
because we loved it and we did it
because<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:55.260> know<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.620> had<00:00:55.829> dreams<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.399> be

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
because you know we had dreams to be

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.200 
because you know we had dreams to be
special<00:00:57.360> players<00:00:57.570> one<00:00:57.809> day<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:01.320> way<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.500> see<00:01:01.920> it

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
special players one day the way I see it

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.899 
special players one day the way I see it
mentally<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:04.019> virtual<00:01:04.619> library<00:01:04.909> that

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
mentally is like a virtual library that

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:15.520 
mentally is like a virtual library that
I<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.210> pick<00:01:06.450> sections<00:01:07.130> from<00:01:08.130> different<00:01:08.460> areas

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.250 

so<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.710> move<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.670> been<00:01:18.570> brought<00:01:18.720> about<00:01:18.990> by<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
so this move is been brought about by a

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.500 
so this move is been brought about by a
combination<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.280> two<00:01:20.490> moves<00:01:20.729> as<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.270> ball

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
combination of two moves as the ball

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.719 
combination of two moves as the ball
goes<00:01:21.659> up<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:23.040> let<00:01:23.190> it<00:01:23.280> bounce<00:01:23.400> off<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
goes up I just let it bounce off the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.570 
goes up I just let it bounce off the
knee<00:01:23.880> but<00:01:24.869> once<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.710> bounces<00:01:26.130> off<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.430> knee

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
knee but once it bounces off the knee

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.910 
knee but once it bounces off the knee
the<00:01:27.479> next<00:01:27.750> phase<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.200> being<00:01:28.229> able<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.680> wrap

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the next phase is being able to wrap

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.180 
the next phase is being able to wrap
your<00:01:29.070> leg<00:01:29.310> around<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:30.360> ball<00:01:30.420> which<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.229> purely

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
your leg around the ball which is purely

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.030 
your leg around the ball which is purely
but<00:01:32.340> getting<00:01:32.700> from<00:01:32.850> low<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:34.170> high<00:01:34.200> it's

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
but getting from low to high it's

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.070 
but getting from low to high it's
important<00:01:35.550> that<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:36.360> be<00:01:36.390> able<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.690> keep<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
important that you be able to keep the

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.539 
important that you be able to keep the
ball<00:01:37.229> up<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.470> as<00:01:37.590> long<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:37.830> you<00:01:37.920> possibly<00:01:38.310> can

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
ball up for as long as you possibly can

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.980 
ball up for as long as you possibly can
and<00:01:38.700> you're<00:01:38.880> confident<00:01:39.299> not<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
and you're confident not just with the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.660 
and you're confident not just with the
feet<00:01:40.790> but<00:01:41.790> with<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.030> knees<00:01:43.430> then<00:01:44.430> with<00:01:44.580> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
feet but with the knees then with the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
feet but with the knees then with the
shoulders<00:01:45.560> then<00:01:46.560> would<00:01:46.710> head<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.509> in<00:01:48.509> once

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
shoulders then would head it and in once

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.290 
shoulders then would head it and in once
you've<00:01:48.840> got<00:01:49.020> all<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.320> those<00:01:49.710> pieces<00:01:50.300> you've

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
you've got all of those pieces you've

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.060 
you've got all of those pieces you've
then<00:01:51.450> got<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.690> building<00:01:51.960> blocks<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.409> go<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.890> to

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
then got the building blocks to go on to

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.700 
then got the building blocks to go on to
the<00:01:53.220> next<00:01:53.429> phase<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.720> next<00:01:54.960> step<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
the next phase and the next step and the

the next phase and the next step and the
next<00:01:55.979> trick<00:02:01.159> okay<00:02:04.880> all<00:02:05.880> right<00:02:06.000> I'm<00:02:06.149> moving<00:02:06.179> I'm

very few know how to pull it off
precisely<00:02:12.920> what<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.040> need<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.280> do<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.550> the

precisely what you need to do is the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.220 
precisely what you need to do is the
ball<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.150> still<00:02:15.269> got<00:02:15.480> roughly<00:02:15.780> around<00:02:15.900> head

ball you still got roughly around head
higher<00:02:16.470> imagine<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.250> ball<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.550> in<00:02:17.580> egg<00:02:17.790> and
