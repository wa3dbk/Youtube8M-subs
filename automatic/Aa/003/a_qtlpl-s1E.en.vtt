00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 Good day to the people with you 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.269
 hall and today I want to show you how 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.969
 steal a military fighter on a secret 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.130
 military base but for this we need 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.070
 first make yourself a car 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.980
 and we do armored car 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.800
 lest we be killed because it goes there 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.390
 tank drives military vehicles and all sorts 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.029
 the soldiers run and strive 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.800
 shoot at you well and to heighten the effect 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.830
 we probably for 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.840
 toned window because it will be 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.670
 much more epic shoot yes we'll stop all 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.469
 dark such all heaped up 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.140
 one hundred percent armored and all 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.930
 so it will be cool well and now us 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.300
 waiting a long way for a start I want 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.610
 drink a little soda to 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.770
 restore your health since there 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.170
 will not be sweet I tried there many times 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.840
 get on the usual cars happened that 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.199
 I stopped by right in a taxi and in me 1 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.190
 the tank is just a rocket and I exploded 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.930
 elementary did not even have time to 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.180
 territory to call in so it's better 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.840
 be warned and if you really want 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.000
 get yourself this plane then probably 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.240
 it will even be good to buy and 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.979
 the armor that is the bulletproof vest will be much 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.040
 safer but for now enjoy 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.090
 the road the road was the road was long 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.860
 rainy but but it was fun for that 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.939
 to steal such a plane can and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.939
 ride longer 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.170
 Sparrow Aquarium Charging 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.020
 but 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.200
 do 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.200
 as 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.430
 at night guys last preparations i 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.620
 showing you where this is 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.020
 secret military base here it is here 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.250
 and and and not even noted 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.590
 but this does not prevent us from breaking into it under 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.990
 hard probably punk rock yes under punk 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.680
 rock let's try me sometimes just 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.780
 blew up 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.810
 To be honest, I cut out all sorts of poor 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.420
 footage miserable moments from this video but 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.670
 but still not so good and passed 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.860
 as we would like and so you drive this 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.170
 direction you drive in as desirable 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.330
 can be closer to the plane in the hangar here 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.760
 but to the most important ostade so that not 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.070
 interfere with the takeoff because it will stop by now 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.410
 here a bunch of military cars and will already be 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.870
 it's hard to take off and so on while alarm 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.420
 climb this time this time this 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.970
 time and here everything is very serious here 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.050
 fly warplanes that are hrenach 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.360
 from you missiles tanks not all crap 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.510
 so so quiet come on dude turn around 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.640
 let's go have a look there is this 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.150
 time I flew the last time I crashed into 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.190
 the pole fell off my wing and I on 1 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.350
 the wings on the plane were leaving the tank 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.660
 but not everything is as good as you can see 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.730
 there is a little smoke and thatâ€™s the back 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.620
 turbine and this damn it sucks 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.350
 at first thought it was all good I 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.850
 I'm not taking a plane to me now 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.800
 there to the airport but it was not there 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.760
 it turns out that he started slowly 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.950
 deaf but I think that is something to lose 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.650
 let's make a war once i have 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.290
 rockets and here there are rockets on this thing 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.110
 there are rockets and there is a machine gun let's 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.040
 make a war I think 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.230
 yes, cops, but I sort of started coming off 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.600
 become i had a parachute but what what 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.670
 then yes something went wrong and did not help me 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.340
 but wait i won't run ahead all 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:27.390
 see ahead yourself and now i'm flying and 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.370
 Blaine County seems to fire warms my soul 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.490
 and it seems that everything worked out 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.550
 that yes I stole this bird and most likely 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.890
 one is mine now 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:41.040
 it would be nice because yes because 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:43.230
 what is the cool thing on it is convenient to fly 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.140
 it takes off pretty quickly 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.150
 you can bomb from the air easy to plant in 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.550
 principle and very very maneuverable then 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.860
 there can do such maneuvers that 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.340
 you never dreamed of ordinary before the war 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.500
 of these and all prototype prototypes 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.080
 Boeing in this game and other until 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.970
 there are no passenger planes at all 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.930
 another thing is very very maneuverable 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.150
 thing but here look at the light in 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.790
 turbine but now begin to stall and 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.669
 see it stalled and the hell am I'm flying 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.010
 Duma let's dude plant shake r2r 2 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.040
 let's start and all I realized that I already 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.660
 did not survive jump and did not have time 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.640
 open parachute 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.140
 here is such a secret plane 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.150
 fighter if you want something 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.680
 use my guide and find it 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.370
 and try hijack can you 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.370
 get better
