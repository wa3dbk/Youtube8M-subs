map is it is a an extraction map it's
not<00:00:17.940> an<00:00:18.180> extraction<00:00:18.600> map<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.990> know<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.289> can

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
not an extraction map you know you can

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.170 
not an extraction map you know you can
play<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.560> on<00:00:19.650> other<00:00:19.859> game<00:00:20.070> pets<00:00:20.279> but<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.880> plays

play it on other game pets but it plays
particularly<00:00:21.990> well<00:00:22.170> on<00:00:22.380> extraction<00:00:22.890> as<00:00:23.189> well

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
particularly well on extraction as well

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.740

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
now since this is a big team map

now since this is a big team map
personally<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.000> prefer<00:00:27.090> on<00:00:27.539> Big<00:00:27.689> D<00:00:27.840> maps

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
personally I prefer on Big D maps

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.900 
personally I prefer on Big D maps
playing<00:00:28.710> objective<00:00:29.189> rather<00:00:29.400> than<00:00:29.519> just<00:00:29.730> kill

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
playing objective rather than just kill

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.630 
playing objective rather than just kill
count<00:00:30.119> or<00:00:30.359> Slayer<00:00:30.929> rather<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.890> really<00:00:32.399> do<00:00:32.520> like

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
count or Slayer rather I really do like

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.920 
count or Slayer rather I really do like
to<00:00:32.730> play<00:00:32.790> objective<00:00:33.239> based<00:00:33.390> stuff<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.840> this

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
to play objective based stuff and this

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.600 
to play objective based stuff and this
is<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> very<00:00:34.380> very<00:00:34.680> nice<00:00:34.829> objective<00:00:35.309> map<00:00:35.460> you

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
is a very very nice objective map you

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.680 
is a very very nice objective map you
can<00:00:35.700> probably<00:00:35.969> play<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.300> capture<00:00:36.600> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
can probably play it with capture the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.790 
can probably play it with capture the
flag<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.140> will<00:00:37.260> probably<00:00:37.500> play<00:00:37.590> well

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
flag that will probably play well

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.799 
flag that will probably play well
extraction<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.850> said<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.329> number<00:00:39.629> one

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
extraction like I said is the number one

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.330 
extraction like I said is the number one
best<00:00:40.200> game<00:00:40.410> type<00:00:40.620> for<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:40.860> map<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.190> if<00:00:41.280> you

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
sneaky thing now one little complaint i

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.870 
sneaky thing now one little complaint i
did<00:01:16.560> have<00:01:16.740> right<00:01:16.950> here<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.340> this

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
did have right here is that this

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.280 
did have right here is that this
platform<00:01:18.150> should<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.540> been<00:01:18.630> lowered<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
platform should have been lowered just a

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.570 
platform should have been lowered just a
bit<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:19.590> i<00:01:19.619> didn't<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.979> crouch<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.490> go

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
competitive map at least in my opinion

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.130 
competitive map at least in my opinion
or<00:01:32.520> from<00:01:32.670> my<00:01:32.729> experience<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.780> always<00:01:33.990> nice

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
refreshing to play extraction I mean

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
this is a great extraction route to play

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.440 
this is a great extraction route to play
on<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.399> you're<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.700> fun<00:02:05.880> playing<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.240> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
so if you haven't played extracting it

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.690 
so if you haven't played extracting it
to<00:02:08.789> use<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:09.000> kind<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.270> little

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
the same feeling of this map because I

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.080 
the same feeling of this map because I
don't<00:02:17.980> play<00:02:18.099> extracting<00:02:18.519> too<00:02:18.610> often<00:02:18.819> so<00:02:18.970> it's

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
don't play extracting too often so it's

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.000 
don't play extracting too often so it's
very<00:02:19.150> refreshing<00:02:19.390> as<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:19.810> said<00:02:19.959> earlier

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
very refreshing as I said earlier

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
map is that there's a lot of verticality

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.259 
map is that there's a lot of verticality
to<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.069> so<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:24.340> can<00:02:24.459> jump<00:02:24.640> on<00:02:24.730> buildings<00:02:25.120> like

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
to it so you can jump on buildings like

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.430

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
that warthog not all buildings are

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.910 
that warthog not all buildings are
completely<00:02:28.900> accessible<00:02:29.140> at<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.590> can't<00:02:29.769> go<00:02:29.890> on
