Skywalker<00:01:49.700> we<00:01:50.240> see<00:01:50.479> how<00:01:50.600> they<00:01:50.840> get<00:01:50.960> influenced

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
Skywalker we see how they get influenced

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.350 
Skywalker we see how they get influenced
during<00:01:51.800> adolescence<00:01:51.979> by<00:01:52.460> their<00:01:52.610> mentors<00:01:53.000> or

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
during adolescence by their mentors or

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.210 
during adolescence by their mentors or
their<00:01:53.510> groups<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:54.140> their<00:01:54.200> friends<00:01:54.620> and<00:01:54.740> then

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
their groups and their friends and then

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.160 
their groups and their friends and then
eventually<00:01:55.430> we<00:01:55.850> get<00:01:56.000> into<00:01:56.270> their<00:01:56.750> adult<00:01:57.080> life

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
eventually we get into their adult life

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.719 
eventually we get into their adult life
and<00:01:57.470> basically<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.070> choices<00:01:58.280> they<00:01:58.550> make

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
and basically the choices they make

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.610 
and basically the choices they make
which<00:01:58.940> we<00:01:59.120> know<00:01:59.240> are<00:01:59.270> quite<00:01:59.810> different<00:01:59.990> in<00:02:00.380> the

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
which we know are quite different in the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.130 
which we know are quite different in the
case<00:02:00.800> of<00:02:00.860> father<00:02:01.340> son<00:02:01.700> George<00:02:02.300> is<00:02:02.600> a<00:02:02.810> great

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
case of father son George is a great

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.960 
case of father son George is a great
storyteller<00:02:03.500> for<00:02:03.950> one<00:02:04.100> thing<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.520> he<00:02:04.640> really

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
storyteller for one thing and he really

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.910 
storyteller for one thing and he really
harkens<00:02:05.390> back<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.630> these<00:02:05.960> kind<00:02:06.619> of<00:02:06.710> base

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
harkens back to these kind of base

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.280 
harkens back to these kind of base
mythologies<00:02:07.400> and<00:02:07.760> archetypal<00:02:08.720> characters

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
mythologies and archetypal characters

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.870 
mythologies and archetypal characters
that<00:02:09.500> all<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:09.739> us<00:02:09.800> identify<00:02:10.010> with<00:02:10.700> it

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
that all of us identify with it

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.790 
that all of us identify with it
resonates<00:02:11.360> in<00:02:11.540> all<00:02:11.630> these<00:02:11.780> levels<00:02:12.020> we<00:02:12.260> we<00:02:12.620> see

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
resonates in all these levels we we see

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.680 
resonates in all these levels we we see
ourselves<00:02:12.890> in<00:02:13.340> these<00:02:13.459> characters<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.540> it's

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
ourselves in these characters so it's

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.449 
ourselves in these characters so it's
really<00:02:14.870> easy<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.410> both<00:02:15.830> see<00:02:16.160> how<00:02:16.280> spectacular

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
really easy to both see how spectacular

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.640 
really easy to both see how spectacular
they<00:02:17.030> are<00:02:17.150> but<00:02:17.570> also<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.900> see<00:02:18.080> ourselves<00:02:18.200> in

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
they are but also to see ourselves in

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.860 
they are but also to see ourselves in
them<00:02:18.830> George<00:02:19.280> Lucas<00:02:19.610> knows<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.480> importance

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
them George Lucas knows the importance

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.590 
them George Lucas knows the importance
of<00:02:20.989> education<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:21.769> is<00:02:22.130> basically<00:02:22.790> letting<00:02:23.300> us

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
of education and is basically letting us

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.840 
of education and is basically letting us
use<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:24.170> franchise<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.890> educate<00:02:25.280> people<00:02:25.459> and

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
use the franchise to educate people and

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.270 
use the franchise to educate people and
this<00:02:26.570> is<00:02:26.750> about<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.110> sciences<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.650> identity

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
this is about the sciences of identity

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.940 
this is about the sciences of identity
what<00:02:28.519> forces<00:02:29.300> shape<00:02:29.630> us<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.080> what<00:02:30.290> makes<00:02:30.500> who

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
what forces shape us and what makes who

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.710 
what forces shape us and what makes who
you<00:02:31.070> are<00:02:31.250> you<00:02:31.610> we're<00:02:32.120> standing<00:02:32.450> here<00:02:32.480> in<00:02:32.690> front

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
you are you we're standing here in front

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.750 
you are you we're standing here in front
of<00:02:33.140> had<00:02:33.410> maze<00:02:33.620> different<00:02:34.190> outfits<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.670> this

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
of had maze different outfits and this

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.910 
of had maze different outfits and this
is<00:02:34.910> related<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.480> occupation<00:02:36.170> right<00:02:36.350> exactly

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
is related to occupation right exactly

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.199 
is related to occupation right exactly
it's<00:02:37.130> not<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.310> term<00:02:37.519> that<00:02:37.550> we<00:02:37.760> use<00:02:37.790> in<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.030> Star

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
it's not a term that we use in the Star

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.790 
it's not a term that we use in the Star
Wars<00:02:38.330> movies<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.780> mean<00:02:39.050> they<00:02:39.170> just<00:02:39.200> their<00:02:39.590> job

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
Wars movies I mean they just their job

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.979 
Wars movies I mean they just their job
but<00:02:40.700> yes<00:02:40.910> one<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.269> our<00:02:41.360> components<00:02:41.630> of

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
but yes one of our components of

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.420 
but yes one of our components of
identity<00:02:42.470> is<00:02:42.560> basically<00:02:42.950> what<00:02:43.100> we<00:02:43.190> choose<00:02:43.370> to

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
identity is basically what we choose to

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.070 
identity is basically what we choose to
be<00:02:43.700> in<00:02:43.940> life<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.480> does<00:02:44.600> have<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.780> big<00:02:44.959> impact

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
be in life and it does have a big impact

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.900 
be in life and it does have a big impact
on<00:02:45.410> who<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:45.830> are<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.100> how<00:02:46.190> we<00:02:46.340> are<00:02:46.489> perceived

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
on who you are and how we are perceived

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.900 
on who you are and how we are perceived
especially<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:48.050> in<00:02:48.170> this<00:02:48.230> case<00:02:48.440> we<00:02:48.709> have

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
especially and so in this case we have

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.370 
especially and so in this case we have
three<00:02:49.910> of<00:02:50.000> padme's<00:02:50.360> costumes<00:02:50.780> so<00:02:50.930> we<00:02:51.050> show<00:02:51.200> her

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
three of padme's costumes so we show her

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.650 
three of padme's costumes so we show her
senator<00:02:51.920> costume<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.489> her<00:02:52.580> Queen<00:02:52.790> costume<00:02:52.970> to

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
occupied in her professional life if I

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.759

can<00:02:56.900> say<00:02:58.690> there<00:02:59.690> are<00:02:59.810> so<00:02:59.959> many<00:03:00.050> roles<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.590> pick

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
can say there are so many roles to pick

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.440
