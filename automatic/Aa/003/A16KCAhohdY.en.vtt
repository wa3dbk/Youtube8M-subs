00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
willing to let go I think in a lot of

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.590 
willing to let go I think in a lot of
ways<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:33.780> about<00:00:34.280> Norman<00:00:35.280> trying<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:36.120> kind<00:00:36.510> of

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
ways it's about Norman trying to kind of

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.420 
ways it's about Norman trying to kind of
hang<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.260> things<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.680> he<00:00:37.860> loves<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.309> his

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
hang on to things that he loves in his

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.340 
hang on to things that he loves in his
life<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.969> don't<00:00:39.149> think<00:00:39.210> Norman<00:00:39.719> even<00:00:40.140> knows

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
life I don't think Norman even knows

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.350 
life I don't think Norman even knows
what<00:00:40.620> draws<00:00:40.890> him<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.280> taxidermy<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.239> it's

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
what draws him to taxidermy I think it's

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.049 
what draws him to taxidermy I think it's
very<00:00:42.540> very<00:00:43.230> deep<00:00:43.680> impulse<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.610> he<00:00:44.730> doesn't

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
very very deep impulse that he doesn't
