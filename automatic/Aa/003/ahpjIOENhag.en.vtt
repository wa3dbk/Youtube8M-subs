Galaxy<00:02:42.460> Note<00:02:42.670> galaxian<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.720> keep<00:02:44.680> in<00:02:44.800> mind

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
Galaxy Note galaxian to keep in mind

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.500 
Galaxy Note galaxian to keep in mind
that<00:02:45.100> this<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:45.400> only<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.940> twelve<00:02:46.150> thousand

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
that this is only a twelve thousand

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.150 
that this is only a twelve thousand
rupees<00:02:46.810> device<00:02:47.140> so<00:02:47.470> this<00:02:47.680> is<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:47.830> very<00:02:48.010> good

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
rupees device so this is a very good

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.780 
rupees device so this is a very good
benchmark<00:02:48.670> risk<00:02:49.090> or<00:02:49.300> for<00:02:49.570> a<00:02:49.810> device<00:02:50.740> with<00:02:51.580> this

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
benchmark risk or for a device with this

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:59.160 
benchmark risk or for a device with this
price<00:02:52.030> range<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:54.550> with<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.030> 720p<00:02:55.930> HD<00:02:56.410> screen<00:02:58.170> so

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
price range and with a 720p HD screen so

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.190 
price range and with a 720p HD screen so
let's<00:02:59.920> on<00:03:00.160> another<00:03:00.490> benchmark<00:03:00.880> so<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.720> second

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
let's on another benchmark so the second

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.720 
let's on another benchmark so the second
benchmark<00:03:02.650> which<00:03:02.830> we<00:03:03.010> are<00:03:03.130> going<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.459> run<00:03:03.580> is

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
benchmark which we are going to run is

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:28.830 
benchmark which we are going to run is
the<00:03:03.760> quadrant

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.140 

so<00:03:29.110> this<00:03:29.560> is<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.739> quadrant<00:03:30.280> benchmark<00:03:30.760> score

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
so this is the quadrant benchmark score

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.330 
so this is the quadrant benchmark score
of<00:03:31.269> our<00:03:31.480> device<00:03:31.870> this<00:03:32.230> is<00:03:32.410> code<00:03:32.709> just<00:03:32.920> below

so<00:05:42.060> that's<00:05:42.990> it<00:05:43.350> for<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:43.980> benchmark

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
so that's it for the benchmark

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.790 
so that's it for the benchmark
performance<00:05:45.360> of<00:05:45.990> Z<00:05:46.830> ultra<00:05:47.220> 1701<00:05:47.970> HT<00:05:48.420> guys<00:05:48.800> hope

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
performance of Z ultra 1701 HT guys hope

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.560
