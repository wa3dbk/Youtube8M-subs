that<00:00:20.140> goes<00:00:20.320> in<00:00:20.500> the<00:00:20.590> back<00:00:20.770> I'm<00:00:21.040> not<00:00:21.280> sure<00:00:21.340> yet

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
that goes in the back I'm not sure yet

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.080 
that goes in the back I'm not sure yet
I<00:00:22.830> just<00:00:23.830> don't<00:00:24.100> new<00:00:24.520> but<00:00:26.700> you<00:00:27.700> know<00:00:27.789> the<00:00:27.910> roofs

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
I just don't new but you know the roofs

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.990 
I just don't new but you know the roofs
got<00:00:28.240> to<00:00:28.360> be<00:00:28.450> painted<00:00:28.810> and<00:00:28.930> stuff<00:00:29.170> but<00:00:29.470> uh<00:00:29.530> I

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
got to be painted and stuff but uh I

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.529 
got to be painted and stuff but uh I
think<00:00:31.000> it<00:00:31.090> looks<00:00:31.240> pretty<00:00:31.450> neat<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.730> I<00:00:33.969> guess

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:34.539 
think it looks pretty neat and I guess

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:37.500 
think it looks pretty neat and I guess
it<00:00:34.749> was<00:00:34.870> worth<00:00:35.019> the<00:00:35.079> headache<00:00:35.999> but<00:00:36.999> they

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
it was worth the headache but they

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.290 
it was worth the headache but they
definitely<00:00:37.749> need<00:00:38.379> to<00:00:39.030> rethink<00:00:40.030> their

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
definitely need to rethink their

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.069 
definitely need to rethink their
instructions<00:00:41.019> on<00:00:41.260> their<00:00:41.499> instruction<00:00:42.219> sheet

shops<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:54.040> it's<00:02:54.160> about<00:02:54.489> one<00:02:54.880> of<00:02:54.910> those<00:02:55.150> are

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
shops and it's about one of those are

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.380 
shops and it's about one of those are
about<00:02:55.690> this<00:02:56.110> big<00:02:56.170> by<00:02:57.100> itself<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:58.060> I'm<00:02:58.180> going

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
about this big by itself and I'm going

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.970 
about this big by itself and I'm going
to<00:02:58.420> have<00:02:58.569> two<00:02:58.810> of<00:02:59.049> them<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.380> they'll<00:02:59.590> be<00:02:59.709> side

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
to have two of them and they'll be side

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.280 
to have two of them and they'll be side
by<00:03:00.010> side<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:00.850> it's<00:03:01.000> another<00:03:01.390> three<00:03:01.660> base<00:03:01.959> or

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
by side and it's another three base or

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.320 
by side and it's another three base or
to<00:03:02.319> have<00:03:02.500> six<00:03:02.830> Bay's<00:03:03.239> on<00:03:04.239> it<00:03:04.540> once<00:03:04.780> it's<00:03:04.989> done

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
to have six Bay's on it once it's done

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.990 
to have six Bay's on it once it's done
hope<00:03:07.330> that<00:03:07.660> is<00:03:07.720> not<00:03:07.990> gonna<00:03:08.170> have<00:03:08.550> two<00:03:09.550> separate

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
hope that is not gonna have two separate

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.550 
hope that is not gonna have two separate
basis<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:10.600> glue<00:03:10.750> together<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:11.200> should<00:03:11.380> all<00:03:11.530> be

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
basis to glue together it should all be

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.309 
basis to glue together it should all be
one<00:03:12.010> base<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:12.580> think<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.330> feel<00:03:13.630> certain<00:03:14.110> that<00:03:14.200> it

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
one base I think I feel certain that it

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.640 
one base I think I feel certain that it
will<00:03:14.550> but<00:03:15.550> uh<00:03:15.750> that<00:03:16.750> would<00:03:16.900> be<00:03:16.930> what's<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:17.440> will

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
will but uh that would be what's it will

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.780 
will but uh that would be what's it will
be<00:03:17.800> unwrapped<00:03:18.250> next

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
be unwrapped next

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.949 
be unwrapped next
so<00:03:19.140> our<00:03:20.140> bucks<00:03:21.030> unboxed<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.240> opened<00:03:22.750> and

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
so our bucks unboxed and opened and

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.860 
so our bucks unboxed and opened and
taking<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.590> peek<00:03:23.739> inside<00:03:23.920> at<00:03:24.280> next<00:03:24.640> so<00:03:24.870> but

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
taking a peek inside at next so but

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.000 
taking a peek inside at next so but
anyway<00:03:26.110> but<00:03:26.470> uh<00:03:26.500> that<00:03:27.040> that<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:27.700> will<00:03:27.910> be<00:03:29.010> base

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
anyway but uh that that I will be base

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.030 
anyway but uh that that I will be base
coding<00:03:30.569> because<00:03:31.569> I<00:03:31.959> wanted<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.350> certain<00:03:32.560> gray

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
color that I've bought so I will be base

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.620 
color that I've bought so I will be base
coating<00:03:40.060> that<00:03:40.239> before<00:03:40.780> I<00:03:41.019> do<00:03:41.290> any<00:03:42.090> assembly<00:03:43.090> or

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
coating that before I do any assembly or

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.320 
coating that before I do any assembly or
anything<00:03:43.840> like<00:03:44.110> that<00:03:44.170> so<00:03:44.830> but<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:45.880> unboxing

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
anything like that so but the unboxing
