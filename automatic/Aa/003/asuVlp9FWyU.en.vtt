frame<00:03:08.360> rate<00:03:08.600> I<00:03:08.900> know<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.470> seems<00:03:09.680> fine<00:03:10.010> on<00:03:10.250> the

think<00:03:12.950> they<00:03:13.040> really<00:03:13.310> need<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.489> try<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.120> speed

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
think they really need to try and speed

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.360 
think they really need to try and speed
it<00:03:15.080> up<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.350> bit<00:03:15.380> I<00:03:15.590> think<00:03:15.709> when<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.040> see<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.250> in

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
it up a bit I think when you see it in

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.610 
it up a bit I think when you see it in
person<00:03:16.580> you<00:03:17.000> see<00:03:17.180> that<00:03:17.330> actually<00:03:17.690> it's<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.959> is

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
30 frames but it's what I call the wrong

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
end of 30 frames it just needs to be a

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.949 
end of 30 frames it just needs to be a
bit<00:03:22.340> smoother<00:03:22.790> getting<00:03:23.360> there<00:03:23.450> not<00:03:23.600> much<00:03:23.690> grip

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959

through that section and that that's

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.190 
through that section and that that's
good<00:03:26.000> that<00:03:26.209> just<00:03:26.420> shows<00:03:26.540> how<00:03:26.570> easy<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.080> is<00:03:27.140> to

good that just shows how easy it is to

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.930 
good that just shows how easy it is to
spin<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.709> car<00:03:27.890> out<00:03:27.950> if<00:03:28.250> you<00:03:28.370> begin<00:03:28.519> to<00:03:28.670> lose

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.449 
spin the car out if you begin to lose
control<00:03:29.420> that's<00:03:30.049> fine<00:03:30.380> I<00:03:30.590> know<00:03:30.769> that<00:03:31.040> now<00:03:31.190> next

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
control that's fine I know that now next

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.190 
control that's fine I know that now next
time<00:03:31.610> I<00:03:31.670> come<00:03:31.910> round<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.810> two<00:03:32.959> slow

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
time I come round so the two slow

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.350 
time I come round so the two slow
sections<00:03:33.739> other<00:03:34.400> sections<00:03:34.850> where<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.150> car

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
sections other sections where the car

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.570 
sections other sections where the car
seems<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:36.080> have<00:03:36.200> least<00:03:36.440> grip<00:03:36.709> also<00:03:37.430> it's<00:03:37.549> very

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
seems to have least grip also it's very

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.070 
seems to have least grip also it's very
easy<00:03:37.850> to<00:03:37.970> drift<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:38.510> car<00:03:38.720> it's<00:03:38.930> very

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
easy to drift the car it's very

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.990 
easy to drift the car it's very
intuitive<00:03:39.380> in<00:03:39.830> terms<00:03:40.010> of<00:03:40.130> drifting<00:03:42.489> so<00:03:43.489> even

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
intuitive in terms of drifting so even

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.030 
intuitive in terms of drifting so even
for<00:03:44.209> novices<00:03:44.959> I<00:03:45.019> think<00:03:45.380> it's<00:03:45.530> going<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:45.799> be

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
for novices I think it's going to be

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.729 
for novices I think it's going to be
interesting<00:03:46.850> for<00:03:47.180> them<00:03:47.390> to<00:03:47.570> get<00:03:47.810> involved<00:03:48.140> so

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
interesting for them to get involved so

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.890 
interesting for them to get involved so
what<00:03:48.830> they<00:03:48.890> think<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.420> now<00:03:50.420> we<00:03:50.480> get<00:03:50.690> on<00:03:50.810> with

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
what they think and now we get on with

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.539 
what they think and now we get on with
this<00:03:50.989> second<00:03:51.410> lap<00:03:51.530> so<00:03:51.739> we've<00:03:51.890> we've<00:03:52.340> learned

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
this second lap so we've we've learned

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:53.860 
this second lap so we've we've learned
about<00:03:52.670> from<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.880> first<00:03:53.150> lap<00:03:53.390> that<00:03:53.510> we<00:03:53.630> need<00:03:53.750> to

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
about from the first lap that we need to

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.509 
about from the first lap that we need to
slow<00:03:54.110> through<00:03:54.380> this<00:03:54.470> first<00:03:54.680> section<00:03:54.950> keep<00:03:55.370> it

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
slow through this first section keep it

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.150 
slow through this first section keep it
tight<00:03:55.760> that's<00:03:56.000> better<00:03:56.920> maintaining<00:03:57.920> a<00:03:57.980> bit

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
tight that's better maintaining a bit

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.310 
tight that's better maintaining a bit
more<00:03:58.310> speed<00:03:58.610> there<00:03:58.940> you<00:03:59.660> see<00:03:59.810> I'm<00:03:59.900> slower<00:04:00.140> than

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
more speed there you see I'm slower than

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.050 
more speed there you see I'm slower than
that<00:04:00.440> ghost<00:04:00.709> in<00:04:00.950> front<00:04:01.190> but<00:04:01.340> that's<00:04:01.519> fine<00:04:01.820> on

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
that ghost in front but that's fine on

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.770 
that ghost in front but that's fine on
I'm

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
I'm

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.699 
I'm
learning<00:04:04.780> my<00:04:04.900> way<00:04:04.930> around<00:04:05.019> drifting<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:05.680> little

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
learning my way around drifting a little

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.949 
learning my way around drifting a little
bit<00:04:06.040> here<00:04:06.280> so<00:04:06.459> we<00:04:07.239> know<00:04:07.360> we<00:04:07.480> can<00:04:07.599> drift<00:04:07.780> that

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
bit here so we know we can drift that

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.270 
bit here so we know we can drift that
corner<00:04:08.349> a<00:04:08.379> bit<00:04:08.620> that's<00:04:08.799> fine<00:04:10.830> you<00:04:11.830> can<00:04:11.860> drift<00:04:12.129> a

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
corner a bit that's fine you can drift a

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.649 
corner a bit that's fine you can drift a
lot<00:04:12.430> more<00:04:12.580> than<00:04:12.640> that<00:04:12.790> you<00:04:12.970> can<00:04:13.150> carry<00:04:13.420> a<00:04:13.480> lot

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
lot more than that you can carry a lot

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:14.699 
lot more than that you can carry a lot
more<00:04:13.690> speed<00:04:13.989> through<00:04:14.230> there<00:04:14.440> than<00:04:14.590> I'm

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
more speed through there than I'm

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.409 
more speed through there than I'm
carrying<00:04:15.159> at<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.340> moment<00:04:15.700> I<00:04:15.790> do<00:04:15.849> want<00:04:16.180> to<00:04:16.269> keep

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
carrying at the moment I do want to keep

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.860 
carrying at the moment I do want to keep
it<00:04:16.600> a<00:04:16.769> clean<00:04:17.769> lap<00:04:18.070> all<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.459> same<00:04:18.720> through<00:04:19.720> this

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
it a clean lap all the same through this

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.510 
it a clean lap all the same through this
slow<00:04:20.169> section<00:04:21.750> and<00:04:22.750> on<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.380> power<00:04:23.560> nicely<00:04:24.160> so

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
slow section and on the power nicely so

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.960 
slow section and on the power nicely so
that's<00:04:25.330> fine<00:04:25.570> through<00:04:25.810> there<00:04:26.550> you<00:04:27.550> can<00:04:27.729> go<00:04:27.850> in

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
that's fine through there you can go in

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.360 
that's fine through there you can go in
slow<00:04:28.210> I<00:04:28.449> win<00:04:28.600> a<00:04:28.630> bit<00:04:29.229> too<00:04:29.380> fast<00:04:29.680> in<00:04:29.949> there<00:04:30.160> but

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
slow I win a bit too fast in there but

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.100 
slow I win a bit too fast in there but
you<00:04:30.460> can<00:04:30.580> grab<00:04:30.729> it<00:04:30.760> slow<00:04:31.090> in<00:04:31.240> fast<00:04:31.540> out<00:04:31.840> you'll

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
you can grab it slow in fast out you'll

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.689 
you can grab it slow in fast out you'll
probably<00:04:32.320> gain<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.620> lot<00:04:32.830> through<00:04:33.040> this<00:04:33.160> section

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.850 

so<00:04:36.699> getting<00:04:36.880> lots<00:04:37.060> of<00:04:37.150> detail<00:04:37.570> see<00:04:38.560> there<00:04:38.770> in

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
so getting lots of detail see there in

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.090 
so getting lots of detail see there in
the<00:04:38.949> foliage<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:39.520> everything<00:04:39.820> else<00:04:41.100> be

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
the foliage and everything else be

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.500 
the foliage and everything else be
interesting<00:04:42.520> to<00:04:42.610> see<00:04:42.789> how<00:04:42.970> big<00:04:43.180> the<00:04:43.330> game

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
interesting to see how big the game

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.760 
interesting to see how big the game
world<00:04:43.780> is<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:44.139> you<00:04:44.229> can<00:04:44.350> actually<00:04:44.440> drive

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
world is that you can actually drive

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.439 
world is that you can actually drive
around<00:04:45.130> how<00:04:45.430> many<00:04:45.580> tracks<00:04:45.850> there<00:04:46.120> are<00:04:46.240> how

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
around how many tracks there are how

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.750 
around how many tracks there are how
many<00:04:46.479> races<00:04:47.110> I<00:04:47.320> did<00:04:47.949> find<00:04:48.160> this<00:04:48.220> a<00:04:48.310> lot<00:04:48.490> of<00:04:48.580> fun

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
many races I did find this a lot of fun

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.460 
many races I did find this a lot of fun
I<00:04:48.789> found<00:04:49.120> it<00:04:49.210> quite<00:04:49.240> intuitive<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:50.020> play<00:04:50.229> I

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
I found it quite intuitive to play I

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.469 
I found it quite intuitive to play I
find<00:04:51.280> it<00:04:51.400> a<00:04:51.430> lot<00:04:51.490> of<00:04:51.610> fun<00:04:51.760> to<00:04:51.910> play<00:04:52.060> off<00:04:52.180> that<00:04:52.210> I

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
find it a lot of fun to play off that I

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:53.700 
find it a lot of fun to play off that I
felt<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:52.780> only<00:04:52.990> thing<00:04:53.169> holding<00:04:53.289> it<00:04:53.530> back

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
felt the only thing holding it back

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.020 
felt the only thing holding it back
really<00:04:53.949> at<00:04:54.100> this<00:04:54.220> stage<00:04:54.430> was<00:04:54.669> for<00:04:54.880> me<00:04:55.000> the

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
really at this stage was for me the

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.469 
really at this stage was for me the
frame<00:04:55.360> rate<00:04:55.680> it's<00:04:56.680> not<00:04:56.919> there<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:58.360> I<00:04:58.449> just

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
frame rate it's not there and I just

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.300 
frame rate it's not there and I just
feel<00:04:58.780> they<00:04:58.900> need<00:04:59.080> to<00:04:59.229> just<00:04:59.650> move<00:04:59.710> that<00:04:59.889> off<00:05:00.160> to

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
feel they need to just move that off to

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.010 
feel they need to just move that off to
give<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:00.580> game<00:05:00.760> massey's<00:05:01.300> more<00:05:01.510> polish<00:05:01.870> it

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
give the game massey's more polish it

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.279 
give the game massey's more polish it
would<00:05:02.139> look<00:05:02.260> so<00:05:02.500> much<00:05:02.530> better<00:05:02.889> so<00:05:04.110> we<00:05:05.110> come

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
would look so much better so we come

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.620 
would look so much better so we come
across<00:05:05.410> and<00:05:05.889> that's<00:05:06.130> it<00:05:06.520> for<00:05:07.030> my<00:05:07.180> drive<00:05:07.360> club

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
across and that's it for my drive club

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.270
