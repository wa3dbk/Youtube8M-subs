00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
this I have all these points that I

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.250 
this I have all these points that I
could<00:00:33.000> use<00:00:33.149> skill<00:00:33.510> upgrades<00:00:33.870> obviously<00:00:34.200> is

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
could use skill upgrades obviously is

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.930 
could use skill upgrades obviously is
gonna<00:00:34.320> be<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> huge<00:00:34.710> match<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.340> might<00:00:35.489> be<00:00:35.670> even

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
gonna be a huge match it might be even

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.150 
gonna be a huge match it might be even
an<00:00:36.360> easy<00:00:36.510> matchup<00:00:36.870> because<00:00:37.110> Oregon<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
an easy matchup because Oregon is a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160 
an easy matchup because Oregon is a
seven<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.640> five<00:00:38.790> team<00:00:39.120> obviously<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.840> had<00:00:39.989> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
seven and five team obviously we had a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.110 
seven and five team obviously we had a
pretty<00:00:40.379> big<00:00:40.469> year<00:00:40.829> with<00:00:41.070> only<00:00:41.250> three<00:00:41.640> losses<00:00:41.879> I

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
pretty big year with only three losses I

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.779 
pretty big year with only three losses I
believe<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.719> we're<00:00:43.350> not<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.890> far<00:00:44.219> off<00:00:44.280> from

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
believe so we're not that far off from

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.060 
believe so we're not that far off from
our<00:00:45.059> other<00:00:45.210> competitions<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.079> my<00:00:46.260> eyes<00:00:46.469> we

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
our other competitions of my eyes we

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.610 
our other competitions of my eyes we
just<00:00:47.250> have<00:00:47.460> those<00:00:47.730> crucial<00:00:48.539> games<00:00:48.840> where<00:00:49.230> our

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
just have those crucial games where our

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.549 
just have those crucial games where our
defense<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:50.489> can't<00:00:51.149> even<00:00:51.480> buy<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> stop<00:00:52.230> and

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
defense just can't even buy a stop and

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.560 
defense just can't even buy a stop and
we<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.980> lose<00:00:53.160> while<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.670> couple<00:00:54.090> points<00:00:54.449> I

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
we just lose while a couple points I

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.600 
we just lose while a couple points I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
don't think I've had a game where I've

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.430 
don't think I've had a game where I've

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
gets the ball back and they forces one

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.210 
gets the ball back and they forces one
to<00:04:09.669> overtime<00:04:10.299> but<00:04:10.540> in<00:04:10.659> overtime<00:04:11.139> it<00:04:11.470> was<00:04:11.919> all

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
to overtime but in overtime it was all

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.460 
to overtime but in overtime it was all
us<00:04:12.669> you<00:04:13.150> see<00:04:13.329> I<00:04:13.359> go<00:04:13.629> in<00:04:13.780> for<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:13.959> touchdown

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
us you see I go in for the touchdown

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.520 
us you see I go in for the touchdown
and<00:04:14.709> order<00:04:15.699> again<00:04:16.000> can<00:04:16.449> they<00:04:16.870> couldn't<00:04:17.470> even

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
and order again can they couldn't even

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.649 
and order again can they couldn't even
do<00:04:17.769> anything<00:04:18.039> we<00:04:18.370> some<00:04:18.609> lay<00:04:18.760> here<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:19.209> they

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:19.659 
do anything we some lay here and they

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:21.479 
do anything we some lay here and they
get<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:19.870> touchdown<00:04:20.260> but<00:04:20.859> I<00:04:20.919> guess<00:04:21.250> they're

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
get a touchdown but I guess they're

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.060 
get a touchdown but I guess they're
missed<00:04:21.820> there<00:04:22.120> extra<00:04:22.750> point<00:04:23.050> so<00:04:23.650> just<00:04:23.680> like

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
missed there extra point so just like

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.219 
missed there extra point so just like

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
that we go into this game in a some ball
