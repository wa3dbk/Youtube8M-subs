adapter<00:00:58.620> setting<00:00:59.120> so<00:01:00.120> here<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.930> list<00:01:01.109> of

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
adapter setting so here is the list of

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.609 
adapter setting so here is the list of
all<00:01:01.620> your<00:01:01.649> network<00:01:02.219> adapter<00:01:02.809> for<00:01:03.809> example<00:01:04.439> if

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
all your network adapter for example if

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.080 
all your network adapter for example if
you're<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.549> wireless<00:01:05.909> network

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
you're to have a wireless network

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.330 
you're to have a wireless network
connection<00:01:06.710> one<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.830> these<00:01:07.979> could<00:01:08.159> represent

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
connection one of these could represent

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.510 
connection one of these could represent
it<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.840> you're<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.770> integrated

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
it and if you're to have a integrated

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.000 
it and if you're to have a integrated
network<00:01:11.939> adapter<00:01:12.630> one<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.290> these<00:01:13.439> could

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
network adapter one of these could

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.940 
network adapter one of these could
representative<00:01:15.049> so<00:01:16.049> let's<00:01:16.350> say<00:01:16.409> i'm<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.860> to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
representative so let's say i'm going to

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.859 
representative so let's say i'm going to
be<00:01:17.070> using<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.670> connection<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.390> connect<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
be using this connection to connect to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.929 
be using this connection to connect to
my<00:01:19.020> printer<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.710> basically<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.430> both<00:01:20.670> had<00:01:20.909> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
my printer so basically they both had to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.880 
my printer so basically they both had to
be<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.479> same<00:01:21.720> network<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.560> I'm<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:22.740> going

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
be in the same network so I'm just going

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.710 
be in the same network so I'm just going
to<00:01:22.950> right<00:01:23.189> click<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.140> property<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:26.720> then

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
to right click it and property and then

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.880 
to right click it and property and then
scroll<00:01:28.530> down<00:01:28.820> until<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.540> see<00:01:30.890> internet

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
scroll down until I see internet

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
for the default gateway and for for the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.959 
for the default gateway and for for the
server<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.189> these<00:01:59.189> are<00:01:59.310> october<00:02:01.340> 1234<00:02:02.340> and

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
server and these are october 1234 and

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.200 
server and these are october 1234 and
we're<00:02:03.180> seeing<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.659> where<00:02:04.399> one<00:02:05.399> two<00:02:05.759> three

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
we're seeing is this where one two three

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.619 
we're seeing is this where one two three
four<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.840> one<00:02:06.930> two<00:02:07.619> three<00:02:08.160> four<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.270> basically

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
four and one two three four so basically

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.750 
four and one two three four so basically
what<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.050> want<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.229> do<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.530> make<00:02:10.770> sure<00:02:11.099> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
what you want to do is make sure the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.620 
what you want to do is make sure the
first<00:02:12.090> three<00:02:12.270> octave<00:02:12.720> right<00:02:12.870> here

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
first three octave right here

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.610 
first three octave right here
is<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.870> same<00:02:14.200> as<00:02:14.410> your<00:02:14.740> printer<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:17.320> next

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
is the same as your printer and the next

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.690 
is the same as your printer and the next
four<00:02:18.220> right<00:02:18.430> here<00:02:18.460> is<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:19.780> sense<00:02:20.020> your<00:02:20.080> printer

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
four right here is to sense your printer

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.740 
four right here is to sense your printer
along<00:02:21.700> with<00:02:21.730> these<00:02:21.970> four<00:02:22.210> right<00:02:22.390> here<00:02:22.420> and

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
along with these four right here and

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.470 
along with these four right here and
these<00:02:23.590> four<00:02:23.890> right<00:02:24.040> here<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.460> make<00:02:25.240> sure<00:02:25.270> the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
these four right here and make sure the

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.840 
these four right here and make sure the
last<00:02:25.780> one<00:02:26.350> right<00:02:26.830> here<00:02:26.860> for<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.220> IP<00:02:27.400> address

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
last one right here for the IP address

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.910 
last one right here for the IP address
is<00:02:28.090> actually<00:02:28.780> different<00:02:29.260> for<00:02:29.650> your<00:02:29.740> printer

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
is actually different for your printer

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.880 
is actually different for your printer
because<00:02:30.490> this<00:02:31.240> last<00:02:31.510> one<00:02:31.720> is<00:02:31.780> actually<00:02:32.140> for

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
because this last one is actually for

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.660 
because this last one is actually for
host<00:02:33.220> not<00:02:33.790> for<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.270> network<00:02:34.770> now<00:02:35.770> i<00:02:36.070> will<00:02:36.490> type

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
host not for the network now i will type

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.330 
host not for the network now i will type
in<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.090> network<00:02:37.900> information<00:02:38.380> which<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.160> got

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
in the network information which I got

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.190

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
printer is already nine already so i'm

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.790 
printer is already nine already so i'm
going<00:03:16.240> to<00:03:16.390> be<00:03:16.510> using<00:03:16.540> any<00:03:17.170> other<00:03:17.440> number

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
going to be using any other number

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.420 
going to be using any other number
beside<00:03:18.190> nine<00:03:18.490> so<00:03:18.730> i'm<00:03:18.880> just<00:03:18.910> going<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.450> use<00:03:20.430> 106

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
in the same network and then when

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.320 
in the same network and then when
they're<00:03:36.070> in<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.310> same<00:03:36.460> network<00:03:36.760> always<00:03:37.120> left

they're in the same network always left

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.060 
they're in the same network always left
is<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.660> connect<00:03:37.990> both<00:03:38.170> them<00:03:38.440> together<00:03:39.600> ok<00:03:40.600> and

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
is to connect both them together ok and

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.090 
is to connect both them together ok and
then<00:03:42.070> close<00:03:42.430> that<00:03:42.870> all<00:03:43.870> right<00:03:44.350> all<00:03:44.590> that<00:03:45.070> is

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
then close that all right all that is

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.550 
then close that all right all that is
left<00:03:45.370> is<00:03:45.790> default<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.420> previous<00:03:46.959> video<00:03:47.260> which
