00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.069
 and there personal or person 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.750
 access here with samsung galaxy at 5 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.010
 the tabs 10.5 and oh oh oh oh three night 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.420
 3 thousand nights 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.639
 only I will actually be 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.859
 using the stylus to SBEM're 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.760
 showing you both these two 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.590
 devices 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:28.199
 the sp sp and staff she comes nuno 3 honey 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:31.170
 or not 3 or lot 1 2 3 4 and this one is 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.020
 a variation of the note that is do not 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.420
 343 thousand which is a leaner version I 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.210
 I have his videos on the channel but the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.110
 big question is this pen that she 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.110
 it suits 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:47.340
 Let's get the pen out of that pen. 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.600
 serves both for the tabs and pro pro 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.289
 at 5 o'clock 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.199
 Let's test the people you can see. 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:57.329
 does not fit the right pen does not fit 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.989
 now we get this one you 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.170
 I'm already using aquino in the channel 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.770
 to play Sin City you can see 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.390
 Then there was a person who made me a 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.170
 very interesting question if he 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:18.270
 buy a tablet here buy a 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.430
 tablet the abs and more the sp 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.640
 it will have the same features as 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:29.909
 for example 11,383 honey or even 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.950
 tab 10 1 2014 said chan that I 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.229
 I also have here that it is precisely the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.750
 tablet on my daughter no you will not 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.110
 why why this pen here? 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.140
 she has, for example, the one here 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.560
 and the button you click it fires the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.329
 Hidden menu that has no mobile on here 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.710
 it will not work 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.890
 sure and either you will only have 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.729
 example this pen here that I use the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.579
 heaven she serves what it 's like a 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:07.340
 with a finger even passing right here 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:10.500
 but with a soft tip to the right 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.610
 so this personal pen does not fit 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.440
 for devices that do not 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.830
 that did not come from the factory and were 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.580
 designed for him or her only serves 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.890
 even here for example pro grows 3 thousand 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.610
 that will let you unlock here 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.460
 will see 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.880
 Oh I'm going to push the button here you go. 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.810
 to see that she does it, she has the 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.860
 cursor 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.440
 you will see the cursor running then 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.190
 What happens to this pen that it is? 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.310
 designed for this device and produces 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.670
 devices that already have the o 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.100
 The judge took advantage of it and 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.709
 already designed for this unique pen 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:03:00.320
 for pens being that your strip here 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:02.060
 It connects the right knot you have to 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.320
 functionality and this one is not just here 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.780
 It's like a finger here for example. 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.820
 block it unblocking also right 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.970
 so what happens is not just the pen 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.250
 that it ends up working like a finger 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.730
 for any standalone device 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.769
 whether it has the native pen or not 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.299
 now the native pen is the one here 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.320
 that you have for some devices 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.540
 samsung 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.260
 independent of the format of the 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.330
 pen 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.739
 devices which 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.760
 pen will work in any 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:42.080
 device 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:43.910
 for example we have the 181 is a galaxy 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.549
 note UOL 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:52.010
 I think the m5 10 he had pen worked 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.299
 on any device with pen was 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.780
 designed with pen 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.799
 I had for example the note oo the tab 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.810
 not right 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.540
 was the first with pen too 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.239
 It worked or has a lot of 2014 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.720
 also works for all of these is inter 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:11.510
 not everybody owns it works but 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.060
 for normal line does not work or have 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.370
 functionality because it is a way to 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.549
 part that has in the touchwiz that recognizes 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.700
 the pen recognizes here points out how much 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.490
 next to the screen it forms a circle 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.919
 that she 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.590
 Do you know the pen, good staff? 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.970
 you can take a print screen from the screen with 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.400
 a pen 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.009
 you have several resources there that you have 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.680
 with the pen but specific for the 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:41.849
 device for those here are normal 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:45.090
 who does not have this is this pen here 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:47.669
 sure the accuracy I do not know if it's the same 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.590
 certainly not even here is how 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.560
 talk to you is as if it were the 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.660
 our finger and to this device here 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.409
 by personal example is we can 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:01.080
 to configure when the athlete is with 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:03.419
 pen here and lean over here for example 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.180
 hand on the screen where you ask for it 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.639
 ignore the touch on the hand only to accept the 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.490
 pen touch or you can 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:14.639
 touch the screen and draw here 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.310
 So understood the service will pick up the 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.050
 writing where you are touching the pen 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:24.590
 This is a very interesting business. 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.590
 when the interface is done right pro 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.889
 device 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.849
 so I hope I have clarified the doubt there 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:34.650
 that the pen for these devices 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:38.190
 It must be a look like this one. 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:41.219
 This one at the time I paid $ 2 today 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:44.310
 They are worth 20 reais in the at the supermarket 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:46.740
 mobile phone accessory store is 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.699
 and this pen that is usually in 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.860
 around 60 to 80 reais only the pen 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.050
 Okay, people, so much care. 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.750
 Experience pens will pay dearly and 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.419
 I do not advise buying generic fulfill 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.900
 samsung original even right then it is 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.099
 that 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.020
 I hope you have enjoyed yourself 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:05.130
