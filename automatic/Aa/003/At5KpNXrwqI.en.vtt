00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.870 
attack in just because the fact that he
did<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.650> decent<00:03:41.040> shoe<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:41.549> know<00:03:41.700> and

did of the decent shoe and you know and

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.280 
did of the decent shoe and you know and
I<00:03:42.030> didn't<00:03:42.299> really<00:03:42.329> want<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.810> use<00:03:42.930> him<00:03:42.959> left

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
back because I dodged a fancy using his

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.860

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
shoe in here and it played off my

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.870 
shoe in here and it played off my
