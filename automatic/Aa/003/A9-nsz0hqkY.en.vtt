to check out Nova Rossi's new my toe for
and<00:00:05.069> my<00:00:05.400> toe<00:00:05.460> 7<00:00:06.150> nitro<00:00:07.020> engines

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.770 

all<00:00:11.750> right<00:00:11.960> so<00:00:12.590> let's<00:00:12.860> open<00:00:13.070> these<00:00:13.400> boxes

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
all right so let's open these boxes

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.560 
all right so let's open these boxes
let's<00:00:14.780> check<00:00:14.990> them<00:00:15.140> out<00:00:15.290> see<00:00:16.120> what<00:00:17.120> we've<00:00:17.300> got

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
let's check them out see what we've got

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.800 
let's check them out see what we've got
going<00:00:17.780> on<00:00:18.080> these<00:00:18.650> engines<00:00:19.190> are<00:00:19.279> new<00:00:19.760> for<00:00:20.029> 2015

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
going on these engines are new for 2015

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.570 
going on these engines are new for 2015
Ford<00:00:21.320> /<00:00:21.529> aussi<00:00:23.470> and<00:00:24.470> they<00:00:24.619> are<00:00:24.770> highly<00:00:25.130> based

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
Ford / aussi and they are highly based

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.279 
Ford / aussi and they are highly based
off<00:00:25.850> of<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.680> virtus<00:00:27.680> engine<00:00:28.630> no<00:00:29.630> varasi<00:00:29.990> at

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
off of the virtus engine no varasi at

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.229 
off of the virtus engine no varasi at
the<00:00:30.410> moment<00:00:30.830> has<00:00:31.670> way<00:00:32.000> too<00:00:32.029> many<00:00:32.390> engines<00:00:32.900> man

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
the moment has way too many engines man

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:42.160 
the moment has way too many engines man
so<00:00:37.360> probably<00:00:38.360> not<00:00:38.510> to<00:00:38.660> expect<00:00:40.780> cars<00:00:41.780> right<00:00:42.050> on

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
so probably not to expect cars right on

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.530 
so probably not to expect cars right on
top<00:00:42.379> it's<00:00:42.650> kind<00:00:42.860> of<00:00:42.920> lengthy<00:00:43.220> so<00:00:44.090> it's<00:00:44.360> this

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
top it's kind of lengthy so it's this

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.750 
top it's kind of lengthy so it's this

it's got a particular odor if you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.380 
it's got a particular odor if you
watched<00:00:52.160> my<00:00:52.370> 21<00:00:53.329> for<00:00:54.489> unboxing<00:00:55.489> it<00:00:55.730> smelt<00:00:56.210> the

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
watched my 21 for unboxing it smelt the

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.020 
watched my 21 for unboxing it smelt the
same<00:00:56.630> as<00:00:56.809> this<00:00:56.930> one<00:00:57.170> does<00:00:57.380> it<00:00:58.309> kind<00:00:58.550> of<00:00:58.700> smells

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030

same as this one does it kind of smells
like<00:00:59.210> pulse<00:00:59.870> power<00:01:02.200> got<00:01:03.200> a<00:01:03.230> glow<00:01:03.440> plug<00:01:03.710> inside

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
like pulse power got a glow plug inside

half six seven six six and a half and
seven<00:02:58.209> so<00:02:59.140> let's<00:02:59.709> check<00:02:59.980> out<00:03:00.190> this<00:03:00.900> in-car

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
seven so let's check out this in-car

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.530 
seven so let's check out this in-car
venturi<00:03:02.440> really<00:03:02.829> quick<00:03:05.489> five<00:03:06.489> point<00:03:07.060> four

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540

venturi really quick five point four
eight<00:03:08.069> that's<00:03:09.069> crazy

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
eight that's crazy

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.610 
eight that's crazy
that<00:03:10.959> is<00:03:11.319> freaking<00:03:12.190> tiny<00:03:12.519> man<00:03:13.079> alright<00:03:14.079> so

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
that is freaking tiny man alright so

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.650 
that is freaking tiny man alright so
let's<00:03:14.799> talk<00:03:14.980> about<00:03:15.160> these<00:03:15.489> engines<00:03:15.910> so<00:03:16.480> the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
let's talk about these engines so the

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.990 
let's talk about these engines so the

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
the number of ports so both engines

have different graphics on them so what

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.480 
have different graphics on them so what
these<00:04:51.660> two<00:04:51.900> engines<00:04:52.080> boil<00:04:52.440> down<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.830> is<00:04:53.160> that
