little<00:00:19.590> tiny<00:00:19.920> capillaries<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.760> are<00:00:21.029> often

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
little tiny capillaries that are often

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.380 
little tiny capillaries that are often
found<00:00:21.750> across<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.859> nose<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.910> cheek<00:00:24.150> area

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
sometimes on the chin can be caused by

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.900 
sometimes on the chin can be caused by
excessive<00:00:28.460> exposure<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.789> things<00:00:30.330> like<00:00:30.539> UV

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
excessive exposure to things like UV

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.120 
excessive exposure to things like UV
extremes<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.090> heat<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.780> if<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.290> having<00:00:34.860> too

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
extremes of heat so if you having too

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.060 
extremes of heat so if you having too
many<00:00:35.219> saunas<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:35.910> steams<00:00:36.800> drinking<00:00:37.800> too<00:00:37.950> much

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
many saunas and steams drinking too much

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.540 
many saunas and steams drinking too much
alcohol<00:00:38.540> spicy<00:00:39.540> foods<00:00:39.809> lots<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.500> caffeine<00:00:41.010> all

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
alcohol spicy foods lots of caffeine all

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.549 
alcohol spicy foods lots of caffeine all
of<00:00:41.969> these<00:00:42.120> things<00:00:42.480> will<00:00:42.690> cause<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.350> blood

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
of these things will cause the blood

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.889 
of these things will cause the blood
vessels<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.219> dilate<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.789> constrict<00:00:45.360> really

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
vessels to dilate to constrict really

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.979 
vessels to dilate to constrict really
really<00:00:46.230> rapidly<00:00:47.030> another<00:00:48.030> big<00:00:48.329> cause<00:00:48.660> is

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
really rapidly another big cause is

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.220 
really rapidly another big cause is
smoking<00:00:49.530> as<00:00:49.710> well<00:00:50.000> smoking<00:00:51.000> actually

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
smoking as well smoking actually

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.139 
smoking as well smoking actually
increases<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.410> amount<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.800> blood<00:00:53.610> vessels<00:00:54.000> it

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
increases the amount of blood vessels it

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.660 
increases the amount of blood vessels it
makes<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.660> produce<00:00:54.870> more<00:00:55.350> blood<00:00:55.590> vessels<00:00:56.039> so

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
makes you produce more blood vessels so

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.950 
makes you produce more blood vessels so
then<00:00:56.850> there's<00:00:57.090> more<00:00:57.239> risk<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.930> getting

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
then there's more risk of you getting

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.040 
then there's more risk of you getting
capillary<00:00:58.920> damage<00:00:59.309> it<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.180> also<00:01:00.359> be<00:01:00.719> due<00:01:01.020> to

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
capillary damage it can also be due to

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.410 
capillary damage it can also be due to
trauma<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.250> area<00:01:02.550> as<00:01:02.670> well<00:01:02.879> if<00:01:03.180> you've

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
trauma in the area as well if you've

blood vessels to burst and to dilate so

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.890 
blood vessels to burst and to dilate so
there<00:01:17.400> are<00:01:17.520> some<00:01:17.640> sort<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.909> underlying<00:01:18.330> causes

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
there are some sort of underlying causes

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.560 
there are some sort of underlying causes
us<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.259> as<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.920> why<00:01:20.100> they're<00:01:20.430> caused<00:01:20.700> and

a<00:01:45.390> completely<00:01:46.079> sterile<00:01:46.619> probe<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.850> just

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
a completely sterile probe and I just

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.899 
a completely sterile probe and I just
tap<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.810> heated<00:01:49.259> probe<00:01:49.590> along<00:01:50.549> actually

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
tap the heated probe along actually

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.330 
tap the heated probe along actually
entering<00:01:51.840> into<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.290> capillary<00:01:52.799> which

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
entering into the capillary which

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.850 
entering into the capillary which
cauterizes<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> blood<00:01:54.360> supply<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.470> that's<00:01:55.710> a

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
cauterizes the blood supply so that's a
