I'm<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:12.040> hell<00:02:13.040> of<00:02:13.069> a<00:02:13.250> difference<00:02:13.610> when<00:02:13.819> I<00:02:19.000> it's<00:02:20.000> a

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
I'm a hell of a difference when I it's a

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.400 
I'm a hell of a difference when I it's a
bit<00:02:20.150> hard<00:02:20.390> because<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.690> sun's<00:02:20.930> really<00:02:21.260> low

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
bit hard because the sun's really low

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.180 
bit hard because the sun's really low
today<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:22.040> it's<00:02:22.160> reflecting<00:02:22.670> on<00:02:22.760> everything

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.180 

we<00:02:27.190> were<00:02:27.340> supported<00:02:27.790> then<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.180> cook<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:32.190> so

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
we were supported then you cook that so

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.100 
we were supported then you cook that so
yeah<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:34.300> probably<00:02:34.450> won't<00:02:34.690> be<00:02:34.870> as<00:02:34.959> much

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
yeah that probably won't be as much

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.320 
yeah that probably won't be as much

guys<00:04:04.220> it<00:04:04.670> just<00:04:04.909> takes<00:04:05.720> over<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:06.170> its<00:04:06.319> lowest

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
guys it just takes over to its lowest

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.199 
guys it just takes over to its lowest
revs<00:04:06.950> which<00:04:07.129> is<00:04:07.280> much<00:04:07.459> higher<00:04:07.670> than<00:04:07.849> before

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
revs which is much higher than before

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.220 
revs which is much higher than before
it's<00:04:08.360> more<00:04:08.540> like<00:04:08.720> 700<00:04:10.599> rpm<00:04:11.599> then<00:04:11.959> 500<00:04:12.920> and

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
it's more like 700 rpm then 500 and

I've had like the jewelry the cutting

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.409 
I've had like the jewelry the cutting
out<00:04:26.120> etc<00:04:26.620> and<00:04:27.620> they're<00:04:27.830> not<00:04:27.949> starting<00:04:28.340> get<00:04:29.180> the

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
out etc and they're not starting get the

out etc and they're not starting get the
laund<00:04:29.570> lambda<00:04:30.229> sensor<00:04:30.440> and<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:31.070> crankshaft

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
laund lambda sensor and the crankshaft

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.700 
laund lambda sensor and the crankshaft
sensor<00:04:31.669> side<00:04:32.090> as<00:04:32.690> well<00:04:32.990> as<00:04:33.199> the<00:04:33.289> throttle<00:04:33.620> body

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710

and<00:04:34.100> even<00:04:34.580> if<00:04:34.750> you<00:04:35.750> think<00:04:35.960> it<00:04:36.110> might<00:04:36.229> not<00:04:36.410> do<00:04:36.560> it

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
and even if you think it might not do it

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.680 
and even if you think it might not do it
it<00:04:36.919> will<00:04:37.430> make<00:04:37.669> a<00:04:37.699> hell<00:04:37.940> of<00:04:37.970> a<00:04:38.120> difference<00:04:38.270> in

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
it will make a hell of a difference in

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.990 
it will make a hell of a difference in
the<00:04:38.780> way<00:04:38.900> it<00:04:39.080> accelerates<00:04:39.979> the<00:04:40.340> weight<00:04:40.490> starts

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
the way it accelerates the weight starts

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.659 
the way it accelerates the weight starts
etc<00:04:41.750> since<00:04:42.320> I've<00:04:42.500> had<00:04:42.620> these<00:04:42.800> parts<00:04:43.190> done<00:04:43.400> I've

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
etc since I've had these parts done I've

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.060 
etc since I've had these parts done I've
had<00:04:43.820> no<00:04:44.090> problems<00:04:44.120> with<00:04:44.539> it<00:04:44.630> starting<00:04:45.110> nope<00:04:45.350> no

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
had no problems with it starting nope no

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.490 
had no problems with it starting nope no
problems<00:04:46.850> at<00:04:46.940> all<00:04:46.970> with<00:04:47.090> it<00:04:47.360> cling<00:04:48.169> out<00:04:48.320> or

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
problems at all with it cling out or

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.760 
problems at all with it cling out or
spluttering<00:04:48.919> so<00:04:49.840> it's<00:04:50.840> definitely<00:04:51.590> the

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
spluttering so it's definitely the

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.070 
spluttering so it's definitely the
choice<00:04:51.979> you<00:04:52.970> have<00:04:53.120> to<00:04:53.180> make<00:04:53.270> and<00:04:53.630> it's<00:04:53.720> not

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
choice you have to make and it's not

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.469 
choice you have to make and it's not
that<00:04:54.289> expensive<00:04:54.620> surprisingly<00:04:55.370> I<00:04:55.700> think<00:04:56.360> the

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
that expensive surprisingly I think the

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.560 
that expensive surprisingly I think the
lambda<00:04:56.750> sense<00:04:56.960> is<00:04:57.139> the<00:04:57.349> only<00:04:57.500> one<00:04:57.710> that's<00:04:58.570> like

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
lambda sense is the only one that's like

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.589 
lambda sense is the only one that's like
the<00:04:59.840> most<00:04:59.960> pricey<00:05:00.380> it's<00:05:00.830> like<00:05:01.070> 50<00:05:01.430> pound<00:05:01.669> the

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
the most pricey it's like 50 pound the

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.560 
the most pricey it's like 50 pound the
crankshaft<00:05:02.900> was<00:05:03.260> 20<00:05:03.970> and<00:05:04.970> obviously<00:05:05.360> you're

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
crankshaft was 20 and obviously you're

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.360 
crankshaft was 20 and obviously you're
only<00:05:05.690> paying<00:05:05.870> for<00:05:06.139> labor<00:05:06.260> so<00:05:06.710> we<00:05:06.889> all<00:05:07.010> local

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
only paying for labor so we all local

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.640 
only paying for labor so we all local
mechanic<00:05:07.760> or<00:05:08.000> even<00:05:08.240> if<00:05:08.330> you're<00:05:08.510> able<00:05:09.410> to<00:05:09.440> do<00:05:09.560> it

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
mechanic or even if you're able to do it

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.440 
mechanic or even if you're able to do it
yourself<00:05:09.979> that's<00:05:10.160> even<00:05:10.400> better<00:05:10.580> but<00:05:10.789> it<00:05:11.330> was

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
yourself that's even better but it was

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.360 
yourself that's even better but it was
40<00:05:11.840> pound<00:05:12.020> an<00:05:12.139> hour<00:05:12.289> for<00:05:12.620> the<00:05:12.740> throttle<00:05:13.250> body

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
40 pound an hour for the throttle body

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.890 
40 pound an hour for the throttle body
to<00:05:13.490> be<00:05:13.669> clean<00:05:13.910> that's<00:05:14.150> a<00:05:14.240> lot<00:05:14.360> of<00:05:14.389> parts<00:05:14.720> so

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
to be clean that's a lot of parts so

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.089 
to be clean that's a lot of parts so
that's<00:05:15.080> just<00:05:15.260> you<00:05:15.470> just<00:05:15.590> paying<00:05:15.860> for<00:05:16.010> the

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
that's just you just paying for the

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.170 
that's just you just paying for the
hours<00:05:16.340> labor<00:05:16.990> so<00:05:17.990> over<00:05:18.199> the<00:05:18.320> whole<00:05:18.530> you<00:05:18.919> could

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
hours labor so over the whole you could

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.409 
hours labor so over the whole you could
200-pound

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
200-pound

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.920 
200-pound
roughly<00:05:21.169> fending<00:05:22.099> away<00:05:22.280> from<00:05:22.639> will<00:05:22.910> get<00:05:23.780> your

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
roughly fending away from will get your

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.450 
roughly fending away from will get your
creel<00:05:24.199> back<00:05:24.410> up<00:05:24.590> and<00:05:24.770> running<00:05:25.010> if<00:05:25.130> it's<00:05:25.310> got

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
creel back up and running if it's got

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.700 
creel back up and running if it's got
this<00:05:25.610> problem<00:05:25.960> there<00:05:26.960> we<00:05:27.050> go<00:05:27.169> see
