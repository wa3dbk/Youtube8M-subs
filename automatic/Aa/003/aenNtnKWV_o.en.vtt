 Hello dear friends, this is gameplay 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.150
 My name is Yuri Aksenov This is a review 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.400
 cargo winx club torso is a new game from 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.500
 the famous Vietnamese who is half a year 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.290
 back gave us a flappy bird 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.570
 and so let's see what he tells us 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.940
 offers to play and how much 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.720
 this game is hardcore heavy and 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.210
 just impossible so we proceed 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.869
 Of course I already played a little but the record 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.670
 mine is still 0 so let's start and what 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.969
 here you need to do this time this 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.910
 time you will fly up and the trick is 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.739
 the fact that your character flies up but when 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.050
 this left right and you can it 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.120
 turn at first sight it 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.910
 it seems very simple but really 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.420
 it's just impossible to try 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.110
 fly at least one single frame and 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.579
 then talk about the fact that the game is easy 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.620
 no you on tell the game just not 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.660
 really hard well you know 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.430
 try fast-quick tap 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.989
 be got fly off vertical up 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.659
 to hell this is only the second set of course 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.880
 before that played about five minutes but this is me 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.580
 no reassure let's at least 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.890
 let's try yes one let's get 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.650
 bitch so let's get ready two 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.659
 hands we tap we tap we tap and I have to 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.340
 it should do come on come on come on 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:27.689

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.689
 let's come on bird yes damn almost yet 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.229
 I think a couple of times I get at least 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:36.900
 one fly 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:39.360
 come on come on come on come on there are 11 you 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.150
 understand that this is the n-power gameplay 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.250
 call it now so when rushing me 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.700
 when I do it means that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.920
 this is gameplay power gameplay and gameplay 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.439
 power difficult abbreviation better 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.350
 call it ji pi pi ji pi pi 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:02:01.560
 Give me the strength to let let let voobscheto 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.759
 so once again the number 1 we have overcome 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.939
 get 2 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.250
 come on come on come on let's fucking fucking 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.470
 the game already pisses me off 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.530
 this game is as legendary cool as 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.420
 flappy birds seems to me no because 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.980
 in the flappy bird part is somehow possible 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.600
 it was possible to play somehow 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.000
 set records this game 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.540
 just playing is not possible you may need 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.049
 spend the whole day all 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:31.549
 month all all what else can all 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:34.099
 spend and at the same time here probably everything 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.739
 will depend only on luck lucky 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.829
 you and you will pass one two frames not 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.859
 if you are lucky you will not pass it and write to 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.030

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.370

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.400
 terrible video 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.129
 playing this game is simply impossible i don't 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.409
 I know what to do with the Vietnamese 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:06.109
 I think sooner or later he either himself 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:08.620
 can handle windows or it will make it 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.620
 to make
