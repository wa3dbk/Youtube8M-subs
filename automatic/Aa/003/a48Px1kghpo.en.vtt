paintball gun the range is terrible but
in<00:03:23.910> all<00:03:24.150> honesty<00:03:24.540> it's<00:03:24.660> not<00:03:24.810> too<00:03:25.019> bad<00:03:25.170> it's<00:03:25.829> not

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
in all honesty it's not too bad it's not

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.500 
in all honesty it's not too bad it's not
going<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.130> be<00:03:26.190> shooting<00:03:26.370> from<00:03:27.019> long<00:03:28.019> distances

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
going to be shooting from long distances

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.910 
going to be shooting from long distances
it's<00:03:30.510> not<00:03:30.660> too<00:03:30.870> bad<00:03:30.900> it's<00:03:31.200> it's<00:03:31.470> not<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.799> best

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
it's not too bad it's it's not the best

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.960 
it's not too bad it's it's not the best
weapon<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:32.370> mean<00:03:32.549> they<00:03:32.639> could<00:03:32.670> have<00:03:32.849> added

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
weapon I mean they could have added

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.370 
weapon I mean they could have added
something<00:03:33.269> more<00:03:33.510> useful<00:03:33.660> but<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.049> guess<00:03:34.230> it's

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
something more useful but I guess it's

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.080 
something more useful but I guess it's
