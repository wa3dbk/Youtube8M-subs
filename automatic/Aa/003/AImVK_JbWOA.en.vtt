shutting down the clothes were still
damp<00:00:30.439> there<00:00:31.439> was<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.590> little<00:00:31.710> bit<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.040> noise

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
damp there was a little bit of a noise

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.720 
damp there was a little bit of a noise
when<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.880> unit's<00:00:33.300> running<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.680> first<00:00:35.489> thing

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
when the unit's running so first thing

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.060 
when the unit's running so first thing
that<00:00:36.390> we're<00:00:36.570> gonna<00:00:36.690> do<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.260> just<00:00:37.290> go<00:00:37.800> ahead<00:00:37.860> and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
that we're gonna do is just go ahead and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.880 
that we're gonna do is just go ahead and
start<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.430> up<00:00:41.120> you<00:00:42.120> can<00:00:42.270> hear<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.719> little<00:00:43.620> bit<00:00:43.770> of

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
start it up you can hear a little bit of

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:53.200 
start it up you can hear a little bit of
a<00:00:43.950> chatter<00:00:44.250> from<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.300> motor<00:00:45.539> itself

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.490 

basically<00:00:54.210> anytime<00:00:54.510> you're<00:00:54.960> dealing<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.350> a

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
basically anytime you're dealing with a

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.790 
basically anytime you're dealing with a
long<00:00:56.160> dry<00:00:56.520> time<00:00:56.880> or<00:00:57.270> clothes<00:00:57.960> coming<00:00:58.350> out<00:00:58.470> damp

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
long dry time or clothes coming out damp

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.740 
long dry time or clothes coming out damp
first<00:00:59.640> thing<00:00:59.790> you<00:00:59.880> always<00:01:00.030> want<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.330> check<00:01:00.510> is

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
first thing you always want to check is

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.420 
first thing you always want to check is
the<00:01:00.960> venting<00:01:01.500> make<00:01:01.920> sure<00:01:02.070> they<00:01:02.190> have<00:01:02.280> proper

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the venting make sure they have proper

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.570 
the venting make sure they have proper
air<00:01:02.820> flow<00:01:03.530> actually<00:01:04.530> what<00:01:04.680> we<00:01:04.860> did<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.280> went

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
air flow actually what we did is we went

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.760 
air flow actually what we did is we went
outside<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.230> checked<00:01:07.230> and<00:01:07.470> they<00:01:07.620> had<00:01:07.740> just

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
outside and checked and they had just

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.940 
outside and checked and they had just
recently<00:01:08.340> put<00:01:08.550> down<00:01:08.730> some<00:01:09.000> mulch<00:01:09.270> mulch<00:01:09.950> was

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
recently put down some mulch mulch was

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.970 
recently put down some mulch mulch was
covering<00:01:11.550> the<00:01:11.910> air<00:01:12.690> passage<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.410> the<00:01:13.530> outside

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
covering the air passage to the outside

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.170 
covering the air passage to the outside
so<00:01:14.760> we<00:01:14.880> cleared<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.210> away<00:01:15.600> um<00:01:16.970> she<00:01:17.970> said

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
so we cleared that away um she said

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.560 
so we cleared that away um she said
sometimes<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.780> unit<00:01:19.080> will<00:01:19.350> shut<00:01:19.980> down

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
sometimes the unit will shut down

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.360 
sometimes the unit will shut down
prematurely<00:01:21.570> it'll<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.620> 30<00:01:22.860> minutes<00:01:23.160> left

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
prematurely it'll have 30 minutes left

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.820 
prematurely it'll have 30 minutes left
on<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.850> timer<00:01:24.060> dial<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.470> unit<00:01:25.650> will<00:01:25.800> be

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
on the timer dial and the unit will be

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.120 
on the timer dial and the unit will be
sitting<00:01:26.250> totally<00:01:26.820> dead<00:01:27.680> basically<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.040> only

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
sitting totally dead basically the only

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.830 
sitting totally dead basically the only
thing<00:01:29.370> that's<00:01:29.520> going<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.700> cause<00:01:29.910> an<00:01:30.450> issue

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
thing that's going to cause an issue

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.219 
thing that's going to cause an issue
like<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.400> would<00:01:32.400> be<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:32.820> bad<00:01:33.420> contacts<00:01:34.080> in

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
like that would be one bad contacts in

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.560 
like that would be one bad contacts in
the<00:01:34.320> timer<00:01:34.590> which<00:01:34.979> are<00:01:35.940> pretty<00:01:36.180> unlikely

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the timer which are pretty unlikely

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.230 
the timer which are pretty unlikely
because<00:01:37.200> we<00:01:37.560> rotated<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.369> timer<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.940> we<00:01:39.060> can

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
because we rotated the timer and we can

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.400 
because we rotated the timer and we can
go<00:01:39.650> through<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.860> 30<00:01:41.100> minute<00:01:41.490> point<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.540> there

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
go through the 30 minute point and there

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.410 
go through the 30 minute point and there
was<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> bad<00:01:43.800> contact<00:01:44.400> or<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> bad<00:01:44.850> point<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.330> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
was a bad contact or a bad point on the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.120 
was a bad contact or a bad point on the
timer

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
timer

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.410 
timer
typically<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.310> dryer<00:01:47.550> would<00:01:47.820> shut<00:01:48.030> off<00:01:48.210> when

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
typically the dryer would shut off when

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.570 
typically the dryer would shut off when
you<00:01:48.510> hit<00:01:48.660> that<00:01:48.840> same<00:01:49.170> point<00:01:49.470> every<00:01:50.130> time<00:01:50.160> on

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
you hit that same point every time on

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.210 
you hit that same point every time on
that<00:01:50.760> on<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.300> dryer<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.950> know<00:01:53.040> it's

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
that on the dryer but you know it's

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.980 
that on the dryer but you know it's
shutting<00:01:53.550> off<00:01:53.700> at<00:01:53.880> different<00:01:54.060> points<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
shutting off at different points on the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.160 
shutting off at different points on the
timer<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.520> more<00:01:57.450> than<00:01:57.570> likely<00:01:57.630> what's

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
timer so more than likely what's

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.950 
timer so more than likely what's
happening<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.729> motor<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.240> overheating

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
happening is the motor is overheating

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.279 
happening is the motor is overheating
and<00:02:01.520> shutting<00:02:02.520> off<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:02.850> its<00:02:03.000> overload<00:02:03.450> which

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
and shutting off on its overload which

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.919 
and shutting off on its overload which
is<00:02:04.440> just<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.710> safety<00:02:04.920> mechanism<00:02:05.720> just<00:02:06.720> a

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
is just a safety mechanism just a

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.669 
is just a safety mechanism just a
contact<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.860> warps<00:02:08.700> with<00:02:08.940> heat<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.360> as<00:02:10.080> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
contact that warps with heat and as the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.500 
contact that warps with heat and as the
motor<00:02:10.860> cools<00:02:11.220> back<00:02:11.460> down<00:02:11.520> usually<00:02:12.300> takes

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
motor cools back down usually takes

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.930 
motor cools back down usually takes
about<00:02:12.690> twenty<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.350> thirty<00:02:13.590> minutes<00:02:13.940> usually

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
about twenty to thirty minutes usually

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.000 
about twenty to thirty minutes usually
you<00:02:15.300> can<00:02:15.450> restart<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.110> motor<00:02:16.320> again<00:02:16.710> and<00:02:16.920> it

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
you can restart the motor again and it

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
you can restart the motor again and it
will<00:02:17.100> run<00:02:17.280> for<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.610> little<00:02:17.730> while<00:02:19.400> so<00:02:20.400> that

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
will run for a little while so that

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.340 
will run for a little while so that
would<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.330> what<00:02:21.480> would<00:02:21.600> have<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.930> be<00:02:22.050> replaced

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
would be what would have to be replaced
