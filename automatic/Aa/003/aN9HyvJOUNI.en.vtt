00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.259 
first layer of tulips are in at six
inches<00:01:00.829> then<00:01:01.829> we've<00:01:02.010> got<00:01:02.190> another<00:01:02.340> layer<00:01:02.910> at

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
inches then we've got another layer at

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.570 
inches then we've got another layer at
four<00:01:03.929> inches<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.530> second<00:01:04.920> collection<00:01:05.190> and

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
is ideal where and we've actually used

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.889 
is ideal where and we've actually used
the<00:02:08.009> depth<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.610> pot<00:02:08.879> more<00:02:09.360> than<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.660> girth

if<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.289> sort<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.590> mean<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.489> I've<00:02:11.760> put<00:02:12.120> five

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
if you sort of mean and so I've put five

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.550 
if you sort of mean and so I've put five
tulips<00:02:13.379> at<00:02:13.650> about<00:02:14.220> eight<00:02:14.760> inches<00:02:15.239> deep<00:02:15.560> five

two or three inches above that and your

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.740 
two or three inches above that and your
them<00:02:22.980> still<00:02:23.430> just<00:02:23.849> about<00:02:24.090> below<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.599> soil

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
them still just about below the soil

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.300 
them still just about below the soil
surface<00:02:24.900> you're<00:02:25.379> just<00:02:25.530> about<00:02:25.680> meeting<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
surface you're just about meeting the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.220 
surface you're just about meeting the
soil<00:02:26.519> surface<00:02:26.730> if<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.090> say<00:02:27.299> to<00:02:27.359> me<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.750> that's

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
soil surface if you say to me and that's

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.250 
soil surface if you say to me and that's
what<00:02:28.530> we've<00:02:28.799> got<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.280> we<00:02:29.400> got<00:02:29.549> burgundy<00:02:30.260> ultra

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
what we've got so we got burgundy ultra

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.349 
what we've got so we got burgundy ultra
set<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.769> here<00:02:32.040> we've<00:02:32.190> got<00:02:32.310> tumble<00:02:32.760> mate<00:02:33.000> just

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
set and here we've got tumble mate just

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.259 
set and here we've got tumble mate just
coming<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.890> on<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.519> whole<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.910> want<00:02:36.120> to

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
coming and so on the whole you want to

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.789 
coming and so on the whole you want to
put<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.690> earliest<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:39.109> well<00:02:40.109> tends<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.680> give

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
put the earliest and well tends to give

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:41.990 
put the earliest and well tends to give
the<00:02:40.829> smallest<00:02:41.099> but<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.430> earliest<00:02:41.730> goes

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
the smallest but the earliest goes

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.809 
the smallest but the earliest goes
deepest<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.170> we<00:02:43.650> put<00:02:43.799> at<00:02:43.980> recep<00:02:44.370> deepest

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
deepest and so we put at recep deepest

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.660 
deepest and so we put at recep deepest
then<00:02:45.090> burgundy<00:02:45.630> next<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:46.260> then<00:02:47.010> on<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.489> top

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
then burgundy next and then on the top

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.030 
then burgundy next and then on the top
which<00:02:47.910> is<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.450> latest<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:49.109> tambour<00:02:49.530> mate<00:02:49.739> and

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
which is the latest the tambour mate and

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.879 
which is the latest the tambour mate and
so<00:02:50.639> you<00:02:50.700> actually<00:02:51.000> can<00:02:51.480> get<00:02:51.660> 15<00:02:52.169> bulbs<00:02:52.349> easily

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
so you actually can get 15 bulbs easily

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.339 
so you actually can get 15 bulbs easily
in<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:53.010> pot<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.310> size<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.840> once<00:02:55.139> you've

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
in a pot that size and once you've

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.550 
in a pot that size and once you've
planted<00:02:55.590> just<00:02:55.980> water<00:02:56.579> well<00:02:57.329> whenever<00:02:58.319> you

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
planted just water well whenever you

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.740 
planted just water well whenever you
planted<00:02:58.950> anything<00:02:59.160> water<00:02:59.579> it<00:02:59.790> in<00:02:59.910> well<00:02:59.940> but

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
planted anything water it in well but

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.300 
planted anything water it in well but
then<00:03:00.989> because<00:03:01.650> you're<00:03:01.859> not<00:03:02.010> going<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.220> be

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
then because you're not going to be

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.159 
then because you're not going to be
planting<00:03:02.730> till<00:03:02.849> October<00:03:03.299> or<00:03:03.450> November<00:03:03.510> you're

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:04.169 
planting till October or November you're

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:05.780 
planting till October or November you're
not<00:03:04.319> going<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.560> need<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.829> water<00:03:05.010> again<00:03:05.280> because

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
not going to need to water again because

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:06.860 
not going to need to water again because
it's<00:03:05.940> bound<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.209> rain<00:03:06.450> if<00:03:06.599> it's<00:03:06.750> sitting

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
it's bound to rain if it's sitting

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.620 
it's bound to rain if it's sitting
outside<00:03:07.109> and<00:03:07.560> then<00:03:08.220> they'll<00:03:08.760> just<00:03:08.790> grow<00:03:09.599> up

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
outside and then they'll just grow up

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.390 
outside and then they'll just grow up
really<00:03:10.109> well<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.290> they'll<00:03:10.680> start<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.130> sprout

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
really well and they'll start to sprout

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.190 
really well and they'll start to sprout
in<00:03:11.639> sort<00:03:11.849> of<00:03:11.880> March<00:03:12.150> by<00:03:12.419> that<00:03:12.630> time<00:03:12.930> if<00:03:13.079> it

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
in sort of March by that time if it

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.170 
in sort of March by that time if it
doesn't<00:03:13.230> rain<00:03:13.709> we've<00:03:13.919> had<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.069> very<00:03:14.340> dry<00:03:14.700> spring

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
doesn't rain we've had a very dry spring

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.030 
doesn't rain we've had a very dry spring
this<00:03:15.359> spring<00:03:15.690> if<00:03:16.049> it<00:03:16.260> doesn't<00:03:16.530> rain<00:03:16.650> we<00:03:16.829> water

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
this spring if it doesn't rain we water

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.099 
this spring if it doesn't rain we water
twice<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.459> week<00:03:17.700> but<00:03:17.910> otherwise<00:03:18.150> just<00:03:18.840> let<00:03:18.959> them

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
twice a week but otherwise just let them

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.560 
twice a week but otherwise just let them
get<00:03:19.230> on<00:03:19.290> with<00:03:19.349> it
