00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
local Google Play Store last time I

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.240 
local Google Play Store last time I
checked<00:05:24.099> it<00:05:24.340> was<00:05:24.400> still<00:05:24.940> in<00:05:25.240> there<00:05:25.539> of<00:05:26.020> course

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
checked it was still in there of course

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.700 
checked it was still in there of course
the<00:05:27.250> game<00:05:27.490> is<00:05:27.729> slightly<00:05:28.030> different<00:05:28.509> from<00:05:28.900> when

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
the game is slightly different from when

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.230 
the game is slightly different from when
you<00:05:29.830> follow<00:05:30.330> along<00:05:31.330> in<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:32.289> first<00:05:32.590> video

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
you follow along in the first video

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.399 
you follow along in the first video
because<00:05:34.240> they<00:05:34.539> added<00:05:34.750> all<00:05:35.110> these

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409 
because they added all these

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:37.469 
because they added all these
requirements<00:05:36.009> and<00:05:36.520> they<00:05:36.729> never<00:05:36.940> had<00:05:37.240> these

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
requirements and they never had these

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.230 
requirements and they never had these
requirements<00:05:38.080> so<00:05:39.009> if<00:05:39.370> the<00:05:39.580> gameplay<00:05:39.820> is

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
requirements so if the gameplay is

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.920 
requirements so if the gameplay is
slightly<00:05:40.539> different<00:05:41.139> it'll<00:05:41.380> take<00:05:41.740> you

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
slightly different it'll take you

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.200 
slightly different it'll take you
slightly<00:05:43.930> longer<00:05:44.490> I'm<00:05:45.490> not<00:05:45.639> even<00:05:45.909> sure<00:05:46.120> if

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
slightly longer I'm not even sure if

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.300 
slightly longer I'm not even sure if
it's<00:05:46.360> slightly<00:05:46.599> maybe<00:05:47.020> it'll<00:05:47.860> take<00:05:48.070> you

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
it's slightly maybe it'll take you

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.390 
it's slightly maybe it'll take you
longer<00:05:48.580> to<00:05:48.849> play<00:05:49.750> because<00:05:50.020> before<00:05:50.860> you<00:05:51.159> can

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
longer to play because before you can

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.219 
longer to play because before you can
just<00:05:51.580> level<00:05:51.880> up<00:05:52.030> and<00:05:52.300> there's<00:05:52.960> no

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
just level up and there's no

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.320 
just level up and there's no
requirements<00:05:54.039> to<00:05:54.130> get<00:05:54.310> these<00:05:54.430> dragons<00:05:55.090> to

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
requirements to get these dragons to

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.490 
requirements to get these dragons to
these<00:05:55.479> levels<00:05:55.780> but<00:05:56.770> now<00:05:56.949> they<00:05:57.159> have<00:05:57.370> it<00:05:57.580> and<00:05:58.500> it

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
these levels but now they have it and it

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.350 
these levels but now they have it and it
will<00:05:59.680> take<00:05:59.860> you<00:06:00.070> definitely<00:06:00.729> take<00:06:00.940> you<00:06:01.060> longer

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
will take you definitely take you longer

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.740 
will take you definitely take you longer
