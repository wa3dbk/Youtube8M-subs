really well firstly they have a color
temperature<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.110> hue<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
temperature that is the hue of the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.679 
temperature that is the hue of the
actual<00:01:29.070> light<00:01:29.250> itself<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.759> closer<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.479> normal

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
actual light itself is closer to normal

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.630 
actual light itself is closer to normal
daylight<00:01:31.259> than<00:01:31.409> incandescent<00:01:31.860> or<00:01:32.070> halogen<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
daylight than incandescent or halogen it

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.190 
daylight than incandescent or halogen it
doesn't<00:01:32.850> have<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:32.970> yellow<00:01:33.299> cast<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.960> seems

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
doesn't have that yellow cast that seems

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.350 
doesn't have that yellow cast that seems
to<00:01:34.350> come<00:01:34.500> with<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> halogen<00:01:35.040> lamp<00:01:35.189> they're<00:01:36.180> also

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
to come with a halogen lamp they're also

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.980 
to come with a halogen lamp they're also
really

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
really

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.080 
really
Aimable<00:01:37.380> because<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.950> light<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.460> focused<00:01:38.759> in

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
Aimable because the light is focused in

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.880 
Aimable because the light is focused in
such<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> way<00:01:39.540> that's<00:01:39.750> very<00:01:39.900> specific<00:01:40.530> there's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
such a way that's very specific there's

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.980 
such a way that's very specific there's
a<00:01:40.950> very<00:01:41.130> sharply<00:01:41.490> defined<00:01:41.700> cutoff<00:01:42.329> at<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.780> top

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
a very sharply defined cutoff at the top

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.109 
a very sharply defined cutoff at the top
of<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.259> lamp<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.979> sharply<00:01:44.369> defined<00:01:44.579> cutoff

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
of the lamp that sharply defined cutoff

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.910 
of the lamp that sharply defined cutoff
means<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.720> aim<00:01:45.960> your<00:01:46.140> lamps<00:01:46.409> perfectly

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
means you can aim your lamps perfectly

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.440 
means you can aim your lamps perfectly
one<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.520> challenges<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.000> face<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.360> I'm

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
one of the challenges I face it I'm

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.359 
one of the challenges I face it I'm
upgrading<00:01:48.869> lighting<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> vehicle<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.799> sort

upgrading lighting on a vehicle is sort

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.789 
upgrading lighting on a vehicle is sort

who's coming at you can't see you so the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.160 
who's coming at you can't see you so the
really<00:01:59.670> cool<00:01:59.969> part<00:02:00.030> about<00:02:00.329> LEDs<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.869> me<00:02:01.020> though

really cool part about LEDs to me though

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.679 
really cool part about LEDs to me though
is<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.680> upgraded<00:02:02.460> output<00:02:03.210> these<00:02:03.390> things

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
is the upgraded output these things

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.480 
is the upgraded output these things
throw<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.290> much<00:02:04.469> more<00:02:04.740> light<00:02:04.979> than<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.189> halogen

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
throw so much more light than a halogen

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.190 
throw so much more light than a halogen
it's<00:02:05.820> not<00:02:06.090> even<00:02:06.420> funny<00:02:06.689> if<00:02:06.899> you've<00:02:07.020> never

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
it's not even funny if you've never

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.900 
it's not even funny if you've never
ridden<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.649> bike<00:02:07.799> with<00:02:08.009> them<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.550> hard<00:02:08.819> to

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
ridden a bike with them it's hard to

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.270 
ridden a bike with them it's hard to
describe<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:09.629> it's<00:02:10.080> literally<00:02:10.800> like<00:02:11.250> a

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
describe it it's it's literally like a

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.010 
describe it it's it's literally like a
night<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.819> day<00:02:11.879> difference

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
night and day difference

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.840 
night and day difference
the<00:02:13.530> other<00:02:13.710> benefit<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.490> get<00:02:14.670> with

the other benefit that you get with

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.160 
the other benefit that you get with
these<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.150> not<00:02:15.300> only<00:02:15.390> do<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.570> get<00:02:15.630> increased

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
these is not only do you get increased

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.080 
these is not only do you get increased
output<00:02:16.410> but<00:02:17.040> sort<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.370> counter-intuitively

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
output but sort of counter-intuitively

output but sort of counter-intuitively
these<00:02:18.540> have<00:02:18.750> reduced<00:02:19.290> consumption<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.310> will

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
these have reduced consumption you will

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.520 
these have reduced consumption you will
actually<00:02:20.670> lower<00:02:21.030> your<00:02:21.180> electrical<00:02:21.810> draw<00:02:22.020> what

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
actually lower your electrical draw what

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.600 
actually lower your electrical draw what
does<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.650> mean<00:02:22.950> for<00:02:23.190> those<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:23.520> on

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
does that mean for those of you on

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.980 
does that mean for those of you on
touring<00:02:23.940> bikes<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.240> do<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.420> means<00:02:24.540> longer

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
touring bikes you do the means longer

charging system life or alternately it

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.410 
charging system life or alternately it
means<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.530> have<00:02:28.650> another<00:02:29.010> slot<00:02:29.820> open<00:02:30.330> you

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
means you have another slot open you

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.760 
means you have another slot open you
have<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.600> some<00:02:30.720> more<00:02:30.840> power<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.440> can<00:02:31.560> use

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
have it some more power that you can use

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.380 
have it some more power that you can use
from<00:02:31.890> your<00:02:31.950> charging<00:02:32.370> system<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.970> run<00:02:33.120> more

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
CB you can now throw some more

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.210 
CB you can now throw some more
electrical<00:02:43.440> stuff<00:02:43.650> on<00:02:43.770> there<00:02:43.890> because<00:02:44.010> you've

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
electrical stuff on there because you've

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.040 
electrical stuff on there because you've
just<00:02:44.430> reduced<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:45.030> total<00:02:45.390> consumption<00:02:45.780> of

just reduced the total consumption of

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.470 
just reduced the total consumption of
your<00:02:46.080> system<00:02:46.650> headlights<00:02:47.250> are<00:02:47.430> always<00:02:47.790> on<00:02:48.060> so

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
your system headlights are always on so

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.480 
your system headlights are always on so
really<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:49.020> a<00:02:49.050> constant<00:02:49.800> lowering<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.430> the

really is a constant lowering of the

really is a constant lowering of the
electrical<00:02:51.270> draw<00:02:51.660> now<00:02:52.380> as<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.590> said<00:02:52.650> these

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
electrical draw now as I said these

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.890 
electrical draw now as I said these
things<00:02:53.130> are<00:02:53.250> crazy<00:02:53.520> bright<00:02:53.880> here<00:02:54.180> we<00:02:54.600> have<00:02:54.750> our

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.320 
Street Glide actually hooked up over
here<00:02:56.400> it's<00:02:56.520> going<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.670> provide<00:02:56.970> us<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.210> little

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
here it's going to provide us a little

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.360 
here it's going to provide us a little
bit<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.570> power<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:57.990> can<00:02:58.050> see<00:02:58.320> exactly<00:02:59.040> how

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
bit of power so you can see exactly how

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.730 
bit of power so you can see exactly how
bright<00:02:59.670> these<00:02:59.850> babies<00:03:00.210> are<00:03:00.390> they're<00:03:00.660> just

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
bright these babies are they're just

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.950 
bright these babies are they're just
blinding<00:03:01.740> but<00:03:02.280> like<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:02.790> said<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.450> top<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.840> the

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
blinding but like I said the top of the

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.440 
blinding but like I said the top of the
beam<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.350> actually<00:03:04.470> very<00:03:04.920> sharply<00:03:05.580> cut<00:03:06.000> off<00:03:06.210> so

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
beam is actually very sharply cut off so

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.570 
beam is actually very sharply cut off so
it's<00:03:06.570> very<00:03:06.780> very<00:03:07.320> easy<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.770> aim<00:03:07.920> these<00:03:08.130> there's

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
it's very very easy to aim these there's

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.240 
it's very very easy to aim these there's
a<00:03:08.670> very<00:03:09.380> pronounced<00:03:10.380> difference<00:03:10.800> between<00:03:11.100> the

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
a very pronounced difference between the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.590 
a very pronounced difference between the
area<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.670> road<00:03:11.820> that's<00:03:12.000> being<00:03:12.180> lit<00:03:12.420> and

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
area of the road that's being lit and

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.480 
area of the road that's being lit and
then<00:03:12.690> up<00:03:12.840> above<00:03:12.960> where<00:03:13.290> it's<00:03:13.440> not<00:03:13.680> it's<00:03:14.190> really

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
then up above where it's not it's really

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.430 
then up above where it's not it's really
cool<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:14.850> dig<00:03:15.120> them<00:03:15.270> now

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
motorcycle specifically I know I ride a

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.180 
motorcycle specifically I know I ride a
lot<00:04:06.630> of<00:04:06.780> back<00:04:06.990> roads<00:04:07.290> at<00:04:07.470> night<00:04:07.500> what<00:04:08.100> I've

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
lot of back roads at night what I've

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.650 
lot of back roads at night what I've
actually<00:04:08.400> done<00:04:08.580> with<00:04:08.820> my<00:04:09.000> bike<00:04:09.180> because<00:04:09.570> I

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
actually done with my bike because I

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.600 
actually done with my bike because I
have<00:04:09.900> one<00:04:10.110> of<00:04:10.200> these<00:04:10.260> on<00:04:10.440> there<00:04:10.800> is<00:04:10.950> I<00:04:11.250> have<00:04:11.400> my

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
have one of these on there is I have my

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.280 
have one of these on there is I have my
passing<00:04:12.000> lamps<00:04:12.240> angled<00:04:12.630> outwards<00:04:13.080> they're

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
passing lamps angled outwards they're

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.690 
passing lamps angled outwards they're
actually<00:04:13.560> going<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.770> the<00:04:13.950> sides<00:04:14.220> of<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.460> road

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
actually going to the sides of the road

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.520 
actually going to the sides of the road
so<00:04:15.090> I<00:04:15.120> can<00:04:15.330> run<00:04:15.480> my<00:04:15.600> high<00:04:15.780> beam<00:04:15.990> to<00:04:16.200> light<00:04:16.380> up

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
so I can run my high beam to light up

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.320 
so I can run my high beam to light up
the<00:04:16.650> road<00:04:16.799> but<00:04:17.220> now<00:04:17.310> I<00:04:17.340> have<00:04:17.580> my<00:04:17.700> passing<00:04:18.090> lamps

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
the road but now I have my passing lamps

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.970 
the road but now I have my passing lamps
to<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.540> sides<00:04:18.780> of<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:18.989> road<00:04:19.109> really<00:04:19.739> helps

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
to the sides of the road really helps
