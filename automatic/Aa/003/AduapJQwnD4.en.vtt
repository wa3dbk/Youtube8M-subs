00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.519
 what is going on it was said at the start for you 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.949
 welcome to another 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.840
 call of duty world at multiplayer 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.509
 Gameplay today speak a bit 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.399
 over the exo skeletal movement and though 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.589
 I have a few things for you there 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.850
 Are there any different types of me? 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:38.559
 I'll give you the movements now 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.780
 enumerate and there are there as 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.829
 first of all the book including the 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.739
 boost the push the penalty sorry and too good 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.170
 last in the book slam everyone of course 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.609
 This book is something else and therefore 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.129
 Let's take a look 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.719
 throw what those things can do with 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.730
 In the letter you can do a double job 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.440
 run and thus longer in the air 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.480
 stay and higher up obstacles 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.429
 as well as further away platform 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.330
 I really like it 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.280
 very good 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.500
 Next we would have the boost 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.050
 there, on the other hand, gives you one 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.000
 lateral to what he use very well 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.100
 if you can just for example 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.869
 someone is targeting you or someone is 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.640
 shoot at you and for example then 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.039
 right container then sets you 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.840
 just a side bous one and 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.700
 since first in cover and then you can 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.979
 her foot as a surprise moment 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.500
 reactivate with shoot 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.990
 a new penalty and the enemy is 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.850
 first time really flat so rather he will 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.530
 then you are surprised and you can 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.329
 first off it well so there are 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.159
 a lot of possibilities like that 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.409
 and we can start right away 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.299
 times with the next one with the book of 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.110
 you can almost exactly like with the booster 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.659
 act 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.789
 except that you eg with the buschehr am 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.490
 jump as fast time step or 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.039
 to use a push and you cool 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.780
 maneuvers such as the high jumps and 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.670
 to jump sideways through a window 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.799
 So there are so many 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.560
 possibilities what to do with each 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.450
 can develop strategies and strategies 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.100
 so on, so I guess there will be 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.470
 come up with a lot and if you 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.119
 for example , you 're really good at hiking 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.709
 and found the right bus for you 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.820
 then you are getting better and better 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.859
 Of course I will do that too 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.600
 more videos to come for now 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:19.299
 We only times is the Buss tired of 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.190
 really great for use comes to eg 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.350
 cut through under a bridge 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.000
 where you, of course, in a standing condition 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.949
 not so easy to come by and 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.660
 usually slowly crawling through 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:31.730
 would have to suffer without this but so soon 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.560
 put our own hands to the game 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.810
 Of course we can become different 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.670
 can try styles and of course 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.160
 also the best styles for us 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.470
 tailored so the best penance to 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.390
 can we fit naturally determine the 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.490
 bu slim is the last and is also one 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.930
 really cool renew yours with you 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.550
 a quick kiss when you go to 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.490
 example in the air be back on the 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.710
 ground conveyed and if you eg on the 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.960
 opponents end up with this book worth 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.940
 rather leached everything in all one 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.680
 funny new opportunity opponents too 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.520
 eliminate and that will be so much 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.620
 wait for us 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.270
 and of course I hope this video has 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.980
 you like for more reading on each 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.600
 case easier I would be happy 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.920
 Of course you can also watch the video 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.480
 share and your friends 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.190
 recommend if you for example 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.680
 do not know what to do with everything 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.390
 can make the ex movement and 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.520
 Of course, then on the third if you do not 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.710
 how stupid in front of the console in front of the pc 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.240
 squat and do not know the game yet 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.580
 So what you can do everything so 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.200
 pays the video leave ladder and us 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.690
 See you next time when it will be back 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.220
 It says at the start for you it's good 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.220
 the ears stiff until then
