00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880

other<00:05:24.039> thing<00:05:24.310> I<00:05:24.430> do<00:05:24.490> enjoy<00:05:24.819> about<00:05:25.300> color<00:05:25.659> is

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
other thing I do enjoy about color is

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.830 
other thing I do enjoy about color is
repetition<00:05:26.770> because<00:05:27.159> to<00:05:27.880> lead<00:05:28.090> the<00:05:28.389> eye<00:05:28.419> on

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
repetition because to lead the eye on

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.409 
repetition because to lead the eye on
because<00:05:29.440> the<00:05:29.590> garden<00:05:29.979> is<00:05:30.220> large<00:05:30.639> not<00:05:31.120> small

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
because the garden is large not small

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.339 
because the garden is large not small
you<00:05:32.110> need<00:05:32.770> to<00:05:32.949> leave<00:05:33.430> the<00:05:33.729> eye<00:05:33.759> on<00:05:34.479> in<00:05:35.020> to

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
you need to leave the eye on in to

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.730 
you need to leave the eye on in to
encourage<00:05:35.979> you<00:05:36.759> to<00:05:36.789> move<00:05:37.180> forward<00:05:37.659> so<00:05:38.500> there's
