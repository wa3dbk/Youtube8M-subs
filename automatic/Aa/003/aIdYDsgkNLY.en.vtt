got<00:04:08.910> Android<00:04:09.599> 5.0<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:11.010> I'm<00:04:11.400> don't<00:04:11.760> worry<00:04:12.209> if

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
got Android 5.0 and I'm don't worry if

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.979 
got Android 5.0 and I'm don't worry if
you<00:04:12.870> if<00:04:13.590> your<00:04:13.859> system<00:04:14.430> boots<00:04:14.700> really<00:04:15.299> really

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
you if your system boots really really

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.330 
you if your system boots really really
slow<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:17.329> it'll<00:04:18.329> boot<00:04:18.599> for<00:04:18.840> example<00:04:19.410> at<00:04:19.859> 10

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
slow and it'll boot for example at 10

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.540 
slow and it'll boot for example at 10
minutes<00:04:20.789> or<00:04:21.090> less<00:04:21.630> I<00:04:21.959> don't<00:04:22.019> know<00:04:22.229> exactly<00:04:22.800> but

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
minutes or less I don't know exactly but

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.170 
minutes or less I don't know exactly but
it<00:04:23.940> will<00:04:24.210> boots<00:04:24.630> slowly<00:04:25.289> and

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
it will boots slowly and

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.200 
it will boots slowly and
because<00:04:26.539> you<00:04:26.930> are<00:04:27.110> running<00:04:27.380> a<00:04:28.250> new<00:04:28.910> West

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
because you are running a new West

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.730 
because you are running a new West
version<00:04:29.720> of<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:30.020> Android<00:04:30.380> and
