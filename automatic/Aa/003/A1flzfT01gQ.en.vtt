let's build redstone clocks this is an

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.410 
let's build redstone clocks this is an
early<00:00:18.240> video<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:18.810> did<00:00:18.949> back<00:00:19.949> when<00:00:19.980> my

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
early video that I did back when my

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.640 
early video that I did back when my
knowledge<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.630> Minecraft<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
knowledge of Minecraft and the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.349 
knowledge of Minecraft and the
mechanisms<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.460> way<00:00:23.550> things<00:00:23.609> work<00:00:24.060> was<00:00:24.330> a

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
mechanisms and the way things work was a

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.390 
mechanisms and the way things work was a
little<00:00:25.289> more<00:00:26.779> basic<00:00:27.779> than<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.619> now<00:00:28.830> but

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
little more basic than it is now but

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.020 
little more basic than it is now but

robloxian says when I see other people
doing<00:00:36.660> redstone<00:00:37.290> clocks<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.920> looks<00:00:38.280> way

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
doing redstone clocks it looks way

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.260 
doing redstone clocks it looks way
faster<00:00:39.390> don't<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.989> know<00:00:40.170> any<00:00:40.469> more<00:00:40.739> ways<00:00:41.270> well

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
faster don't you know any more ways well

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.479 
faster don't you know any more ways well
yes<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.629> do<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.110> today<00:00:43.920> I'm<00:00:44.040> going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> quickly

yes I do and today I'm going to quickly
show<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.940> how<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> make<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.350> very<00:00:46.800> very<00:00:47.129> simple

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
show you how to make a very very simple

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.470 
show you how to make a very very simple
redstone<00:00:48.570> clock<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:50.160> let's<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.460> started<00:00:50.579> so

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
redstone clock so let's get started so

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.729 
redstone clock so let's get started so
guys<00:00:51.690> as<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.170> see<00:00:52.350> with<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> original

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
guys as you can see with the original

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.830 
guys as you can see with the original
design<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.789> pretty<00:00:54.090> much<00:00:54.210> just<00:00:54.270> redstone

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
design it's pretty much just redstone

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.720 
design it's pretty much just redstone
torches<00:00:55.170> feeding<00:00:55.620> into<00:00:55.860> each<00:00:55.980> other<00:00:56.190> going

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
torches feeding into each other going

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.060 
torches feeding into each other going
around<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.239> constant<00:00:57.750> redstone<00:00:58.230> surge<00:00:58.710> of

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
around in a constant redstone surge of

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.180 
around in a constant redstone surge of
power<00:00:59.670> around<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> circle<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.350> as<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.949> feeds

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
power around the circle and as it feeds

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.920 
power around the circle and as it feeds
through<00:01:02.399> here<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.789> also<00:01:03.059> goes<00:01:03.270> off<00:01:03.449> into<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
through here it also goes off into the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.410 
through here it also goes off into the
dispenser<00:01:04.500> which<00:01:05.129> effectively<00:01:05.640> shoots<00:01:06.150> out

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
dispenser which effectively shoots out

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.780 
dispenser which effectively shoots out
the<00:01:06.750> arrows<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.680> fireballs<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.460> whatnot

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the arrows and fireballs and whatnot

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.179 
the arrows and fireballs and whatnot
alright<00:01:09.450> guys<00:01:09.689> now<00:01:09.720> for<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.110> new<00:01:10.229> one<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.950> is

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
alright guys now for the new one this is

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.399 
alright guys now for the new one this is
pretty<00:01:11.610> much<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:13.430> same<00:01:14.430> clock<00:01:14.960> okay<00:01:15.960> it's

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
pretty much the same clock okay it's

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.160 
pretty much the same clock okay it's
just<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.740> different<00:01:16.950> design<00:01:17.479> but<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.600> has<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
just a different design but it has the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.260 
just a different design but it has the
same<00:01:19.409> function<00:01:19.979> as<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.759> can<00:01:20.880> see<00:01:21.060> when<00:01:21.180> we

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
same function as you can see when we

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.070 
same function as you can see when we
turn<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:22.670> it<00:01:23.670> still<00:01:24.030> fires<00:01:24.299> out<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.750> arrows

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
turn it on it still fires out the arrows

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.730 
turn it on it still fires out the arrows
I<00:01:26.720> haven't<00:01:27.720> putting<00:01:27.960> your<00:01:28.049> fireballs<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.590> this

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
I haven't putting your fireballs in this

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.920 
I haven't putting your fireballs in this
one<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.250> here<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.180> go<00:01:32.090> fire<00:01:33.090> charges<00:01:33.750> and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
one but here we go fire charges and

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.080 
one but here we go fire charges and
arrows<00:01:34.259> alright<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.340> quickly<00:01:35.670> show<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.880> guys

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
arrows alright so quickly show you guys

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.840 
arrows alright so quickly show you guys
how<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.479> one<00:01:36.630> works<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.140> basically<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
how this one works and basically the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.109 
how this one works and basically the
torch<00:01:39.150> powers<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> repeater<00:01:40.470> which

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
torch powers the repeater which

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.480 
torch powers the repeater which
circulates<00:01:42.119> through<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> Redstone<00:01:43.530> into<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
circulates through the Redstone into the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.730 
circulates through the Redstone into the
dispenser<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.479> also<00:01:45.630> into<00:01:46.020> another<00:01:46.320> repeater

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
dispenser but also into another repeater

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.830 
dispenser but also into another repeater
which<00:01:46.799> feeds<00:01:47.220> directly<00:01:47.399> into<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.000> block<00:01:48.240> thus

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
which feeds directly into the block thus

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.639 
which feeds directly into the block thus
powering<00:01:49.350> off<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:50.430> torch<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.500> switching<00:01:52.500> off

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
powering off the torch and switching off

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.460 
powering off the torch and switching off
the<00:01:52.770> circuit<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.399> back<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.210> again<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.320> on

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
the circuit and back on again and so on

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.639 
the circuit and back on again and so on
and<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.680> forth<00:01:57.049> when<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.140> put<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.320> switch<00:01:58.500> on

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
and so forth when you put a switch on

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.350 
and so forth when you put a switch on
the<00:01:58.710> side<00:01:58.920> here<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.790> turns<00:02:00.060> off<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
the side here it just turns off the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.649 
the side here it just turns off the
torch<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.490> device<00:02:03.090> stops<00:02:03.420> working

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
torch so that the device stops working

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.560 
torch so that the device stops working
see<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.590> turn<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.920> back<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:06.240> feeding

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
see I turn it back on and it's feeding

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.779 
see I turn it back on and it's feeding
through<00:02:06.869> itself<00:02:07.229> again<00:02:07.500> now<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.280> can<00:02:08.399> reset

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
through itself again now you can reset

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.820 
through itself again now you can reset
the<00:02:08.819> timer<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.239> have<00:02:09.509> little<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:10.020> no<00:02:10.050> delay<00:02:10.530> if

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
the timer to have little to no delay if

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.850 
the timer to have little to no delay if
you<00:02:11.069> like

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
you like

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.950 
you like
see<00:02:12.730> here<00:02:13.000> this<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:13.240> no<00:02:13.660> delay<00:02:13.840> at<00:02:14.020> all<00:02:15.960> if

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
see here this is no delay at all if

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.070 
see here this is no delay at all if
you're<00:02:17.170> on<00:02:17.260> 360<00:02:18.040> or<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.720> PlayStation<00:02:19.720> trim<00:02:19.930> or

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
you're on 360 or the PlayStation trim or

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.980 
you're on 360 or the PlayStation trim or
sure<00:02:20.260> if<00:02:20.350> playstation<00:02:20.890> 3<00:02:21.070> has<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.990> you're

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
sure if playstation 3 has it you're

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.480 
sure if playstation 3 has it you're
going<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.200> have<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.470> maybe<00:02:23.620> set<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.070> back<00:02:24.280> at

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
going to have to maybe set it back at

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.460 
going to have to maybe set it back at
least<00:02:24.700> one<00:02:24.940> or<00:02:25.060> two<00:02:25.090> tix<00:02:25.510> which<00:02:26.140> is<00:02:26.290> still

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
least one or two tix which is still

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.000 
least one or two tix which is still
pretty<00:02:26.620> good<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:28.720> know<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:29.380> receive<00:02:29.980> a

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
pretty good you know you receive a

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.410 
pretty good you know you receive a
pretty<00:02:30.280> good<00:02:30.490> signal<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.090> you're<00:02:31.210> still

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
pretty good signal and you're still

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.700 
pretty good signal and you're still
firing<00:02:32.200> out<00:02:32.500> constantly<00:02:33.010> in<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:33.910> way<00:02:34.260> but<00:02:35.260> you

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
firing out constantly in a way but you

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.140 
firing out constantly in a way but you
just<00:02:35.950> got<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.130> go<00:02:36.310> bit<00:02:36.520> slow<00:02:36.730> because<00:02:36.940> the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
just got to go bit slow because the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.290 
just got to go bit slow because the
processing<00:02:37.630> power<00:02:37.780> is<00:02:37.900> not<00:02:38.020> as<00:02:38.170> powerful<00:02:38.830> as

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
processing power is not as powerful as

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.020 
processing power is not as powerful as
the<00:02:40.680> greater<00:02:41.680> consoles<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.430> if<00:02:42.760> you're<00:02:42.880> on<00:02:43.000> a

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
the greater consoles and if you're on a

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.280 
the greater consoles and if you're on a
computer<00:02:43.209> guys<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:43.750> don't<00:02:43.870> have<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.110> worry

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
computer guys you don't have to worry

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.110 
computer guys you don't have to worry
about<00:02:44.440> any<00:02:44.830> delays<00:02:45.160> or<00:02:45.190> ticks<00:02:45.700> or<00:02:45.850> anything

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
about any delays or ticks or anything

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.060 
about any delays or ticks or anything
like<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:46.300> because<00:02:46.650> computers<00:02:47.650> are

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
like that because computers are

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.820 
like that because computers are
absolutely<00:02:48.880> awesome<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:50.290> let's<00:02:50.470> build<00:02:50.680> this

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
absolutely awesome so let's build this

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.080 
absolutely awesome so let's build this
thing<00:02:50.890> all<00:02:51.400> you're<00:02:51.580> going<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.730> need<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:52.060> a

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
thing all you're going to need is a

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.330 
thing all you're going to need is a
block<00:02:52.300> of<00:02:52.450> your<00:02:52.570> choice<00:02:52.950> but<00:02:53.950> just<00:02:54.160> make<00:02:54.310> sure

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
block of your choice but just make sure

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.520 
block of your choice but just make sure
that<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:55.060> is<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.209> solid<00:02:55.600> block<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:56.020> can<00:02:56.170> carry<00:02:56.380> a

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
that it is a solid block and can carry a

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.590 
that it is a solid block and can carry a
charge<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:57.790> I'm<00:02:57.880> going<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.090> use<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.239> block<00:02:58.450> of

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
charge so I'm going to use a block of

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.699 
charge so I'm going to use a block of
iron<00:02:58.780> i'm<00:02:59.590> going<00:02:59.739> to<00:02:59.800> use<00:02:59.920> 11<00:03:00.570> redstone

redstone<00:03:14.350> torch<00:03:14.620> turn<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:15.040> off<00:03:15.130> and<00:03:15.430> then

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
redstone torch turn it off and then

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.340 
redstone torch turn it off and then
after<00:03:17.860> you've<00:03:17.980> got<00:03:18.190> your<00:03:18.340> torch<00:03:18.610> here<00:03:19.260> let<00:03:20.260> me

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
after you've got your torch here let me

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.580 
after you've got your torch here let me
just<00:03:20.530> see<00:03:20.769> yes<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.930> want<00:03:23.049> to<00:03:23.140> put<00:03:23.290> a<00:03:23.320> repeater

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
just see yes you want to put a repeater

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.590 
just see yes you want to put a repeater
right<00:03:23.920> there<00:03:24.160> off<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.570> torch<00:03:27.150> put<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.180> string

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
right there off the torch put a string

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.870 
right there off the torch put a string
of<00:03:28.810> redstone<00:03:29.470> here<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.100> then<00:03:30.190> here<00:03:30.549> feeding

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
of redstone here and then here feeding

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.240 
of redstone here and then here feeding
out<00:03:31.090> so<00:03:31.360> you<00:03:31.420> can<00:03:31.600> put<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:32.019> dispenser<00:03:32.680> right

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
out so you can put a dispenser right

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.070 
out so you can put a dispenser right
then<00:03:34.290> fill<00:03:35.290> it<00:03:35.410> with<00:03:35.530> whatever<00:03:35.680> you<00:03:36.070> want<00:03:37.080> but

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
then fill it with whatever you want but

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.890 
then fill it with whatever you want but
not<00:03:38.230> dispensers<00:03:38.799> and<00:03:39.670> then<00:03:40.570> you're<00:03:40.750> going<00:03:40.840> to

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
not dispensers and then you're going to

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.720 
not dispensers and then you're going to
want<00:03:41.049> to<00:03:41.170> put<00:03:41.320> another<00:03:41.530> repeater<00:03:41.920> feeding<00:03:42.610> it

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
want to put another repeater feeding it

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.600 
want to put another repeater feeding it
back<00:03:42.959> directly<00:03:44.220> into<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.730> block<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:47.920> this

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
back directly into the block and this

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.430 
back directly into the block and this
one<00:03:48.790> shouldn't<00:03:49.030> need<00:03:49.180> any<00:03:49.239> delays<00:03:49.720> but<00:03:50.170> here

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
one shouldn't need any delays but here

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.370 
one shouldn't need any delays but here
we<00:03:50.530> go<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:54.370> is<00:03:54.640> how<00:03:55.360> you<00:03:55.390> make<00:03:55.750> a<00:03:55.959> more

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
we go and that is how you make a more

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.640 
we go and that is how you make a more
simplified<00:03:57.250> and<00:03:57.790> effective<00:03:58.600> redstone<00:03:59.440> clock

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
simplified and effective redstone clock

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.030 
simplified and effective redstone clock
