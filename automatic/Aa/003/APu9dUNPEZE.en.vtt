gonna be showing you a great place to
farm<00:00:07.319> metal<00:00:07.910> the<00:00:08.910> location<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.570> just

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
farm metal the location is just

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.499 
farm metal the location is just
northwest<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.830> blue<00:00:11.099> obelisk<00:00:11.700> it's<00:00:12.330> one

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
northwest of the blue obelisk it's one

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.600 
northwest of the blue obelisk it's one
of<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.780> smaller<00:00:13.170> mountains<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:14.040> it's<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.280> bit

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
of the smaller mountains so it's a bit

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.810 
of the smaller mountains so it's a bit
hard<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.880> see<00:00:15.179> until<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.780> get<00:00:15.929> closer<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.529> it

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
hard to see until you get closer to it

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.859 
hard to see until you get closer to it
it's<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:19.010> southeastern<00:00:20.010> quadrant<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:21.150> the

map yeah as you can see there it's

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.560 
map yeah as you can see there it's
northwest<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.789> blue<00:00:27.090> obelisk<00:00:29.240> on<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
northwest of the blue obelisk on the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.040 
northwest of the blue obelisk on the
mountain<00:00:30.869> you'll<00:00:31.019> find<00:00:31.790> several<00:00:33.050> regular

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
mountain you'll find several regular

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.970 
mountain you'll find several regular
metal<00:00:34.829> nodes<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.960> one<00:00:36.960> or<00:00:37.110> two<00:00:37.290> rich<00:00:37.620> metal

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
metal nodes and one or two rich metal

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.830 
metal nodes and one or two rich metal
notes<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:39.149> video<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.540> looks<00:00:39.690> like

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
notes in this video it looks like

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.180 
notes in this video it looks like
someone's<00:00:40.230> been<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> spot<00:00:41.010> already

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
someone's been to the spot already

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.799 
someone's been to the spot already
usually<00:00:41.790> there's<00:00:41.940> more<00:00:42.030> metal<00:00:42.329> nodes<00:00:42.629> at

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
usually there's more metal nodes at

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.200 
usually there's more metal nodes at
spawn<00:00:43.110> here<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.559> managed<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.370> find<00:00:44.700> one<00:00:44.850> that

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
spawn here I managed to find one that

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.250 
spawn here I managed to find one that
hasn't<00:00:45.420> been<00:00:45.629> touched<00:00:46.289> yet<00:00:47.840> in<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.020> video

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
hasn't been touched yet in this video

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.439 
hasn't been touched yet in this video
I'm<00:00:49.410> using<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.920> apprentice<00:00:50.760> metal<00:00:51.030> pick<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.420> I

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
I'm using a apprentice metal pick so I

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.369 
I'm using a apprentice metal pick so I
get<00:00:51.690> more<00:00:51.960> metal<00:00:52.320> per<00:00:53.390> per<00:00:54.390> hit<00:00:54.600> per<00:00:55.110> note<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> I

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
get more metal per per hit per note so I

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.630 
get more metal per per hit per note so I
get<00:00:58.530> 14<00:00:59.010> metal<00:00:59.309> there<00:00:59.520> from<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.910> node

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
get 14 metal there from that node

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.380 
get 14 metal there from that node
usually<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:02.930> between<00:01:03.979> 6<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.250> 10<00:01:05.460> with<00:01:06.360> a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
usually it's between 6 and 10 with a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.050 
usually it's between 6 and 10 with a
regular<00:01:06.900> metal<00:01:07.080> pick<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.560> far<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.979> know<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.369> go

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
regular metal pick as far as I know I go

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.350 
regular metal pick as far as I know I go
fly<00:01:09.390> up<00:01:09.570> here<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.909> some<00:01:11.909> more<00:01:12.060> metal

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
fly up here to the some more metal

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.090 
fly up here to the some more metal
there's<00:01:12.570> usually<00:01:12.810> crystal<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.500> spawn<00:01:13.830> on

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
there's usually crystal that spawn on

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.700 
there's usually crystal that spawn on
this<00:01:14.280> little<00:01:14.430> plateau<00:01:14.869> but<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.619> see

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
this little plateau but as you can see

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.460 
this little plateau but as you can see
there's<00:01:16.979> none<00:01:17.189> there<00:01:17.400> right<00:01:17.640> now

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:31.510 

so<00:01:24.470> get<00:01:24.620> 12<00:01:24.890> metal<00:01:25.190> from<00:01:25.370> that<00:01:25.550> node<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:30.520> 17

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
so get 12 metal from that node and 17

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.110 
so get 12 metal from that node and 17
from<00:01:31.760> that<00:01:31.970> node<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:32.390> yeah<00:01:33.370> if<00:01:34.370> you<00:01:34.580> look

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
from that node so yeah if you look

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.120 
from that node so yeah if you look
around<00:01:35.450> for<00:01:35.750> an<00:01:36.020> apprentice<00:01:36.650> metal<00:01:36.950> picks

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
around for an apprentice metal picks

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.450 
around for an apprentice metal picks
they<00:01:37.310> spawn<00:01:37.610> in<00:01:37.640> blue<00:01:37.910> drops<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.540> caves<00:01:38.870> and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
they spawn in blue drops and caves and

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.320 
they spawn in blue drops and caves and
supply<00:01:40.460> drops<00:01:40.790> on<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.210> overworld<00:01:41.750> map<00:01:43.330> next

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
supply drops on the overworld map next

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.050 
supply drops on the overworld map next
up<00:01:44.600> there's<00:01:44.870> I'll<00:01:45.170> show<00:01:45.320> you<00:01:45.410> the<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:46.850> rich

up there's I'll show you the the rich

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.020 
up there's I'll show you the the rich
middle<00:01:47.390> node<00:01:47.570> that<00:01:47.720> spawns<00:01:48.050> it<00:01:48.260> spawns<00:01:48.530> on<00:01:48.740> the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
middle node that spawns it spawns on the

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.190 
middle node that spawns it spawns on the
eastern<00:01:50.030> side<00:01:50.300> of<00:01:50.360> this<00:01:50.660> little<00:01:50.960> mountain

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
eastern side of this little mountain

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.700 
eastern side of this little mountain
here<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:53.600> it's<00:01:53.900> right<00:01:54.320> there<00:01:55.030> yeah<00:01:56.590> as<00:01:57.590> you

can see it has a lot of more gold gold
markings<00:02:01.760> on<00:02:01.940> it<00:02:02.119> I<00:02:02.300> go<00:02:03.050> ahead<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.410> get<00:02:03.530> the

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
markings on it I go ahead and get the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:19.449 
markings on it I go ahead and get the
smaller<00:02:04.460> metal<00:02:04.700> node<00:02:04.970> first

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.270 

see<00:02:20.030> I<00:02:20.060> get<00:02:20.420> about<00:02:21.730> 3035<00:02:23.500> metal<00:02:24.500> from<00:02:24.739> that<00:02:24.920> one

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
see I get about 3035 metal from that one

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.009 
see I get about 3035 metal from that one
rich<00:02:25.579> node<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.730> if<00:02:29.299> you<00:02:29.510> haven't<00:02:29.659> found<00:02:29.870> a

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
rich node so if you haven't found a

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.319 
rich node so if you haven't found a
metal<00:02:30.170> pick<00:02:30.469> look<00:02:30.859> for<00:02:31.129> one<00:02:31.280> or<00:02:31.489> sorry<00:02:31.819> a<00:02:32.030> blue

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
metal pick and apprentice metal pick you

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.429 
metal pick and apprentice metal pick you
really<00:02:35.090> need<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.359> get<00:02:35.480> one<00:02:35.689> to<00:02:35.870> make<00:02:36.019> farming

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
really need to get one to make farming

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.319 
really need to get one to make farming
metal<00:02:36.829> a<00:02:36.859> lot<00:02:37.040> more<00:02:37.280> efficient<00:02:37.700> in<00:02:37.909> total<00:02:38.269> I

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
metal a lot more efficient in total I

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.890 
metal a lot more efficient in total I
think<00:02:38.510> we<00:02:38.599> got<00:02:38.750> 92<00:02:39.590> or<00:02:40.159> from<00:02:40.519> that<00:02:40.670> trip<00:02:40.939> and<00:02:41.209> a

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
think we got 92 or from that trip and a
