engine compartment what I've done is
I've<00:03:21.040> gone<00:03:21.189> ahead<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.430> routed<00:03:21.760> area<00:03:22.000> just<00:03:22.449> a

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
I've gone ahead and routed area just a

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.390 
I've gone ahead and routed area just a
piece<00:03:22.659> of<00:03:22.810> like<00:03:23.049> each<00:03:23.230> wire<00:03:23.500> from<00:03:24.099> the<00:03:24.219> engine

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.009 
piece of like each wire from the engine
compartment<00:03:24.430> down<00:03:24.909> so<00:03:25.389> that<00:03:25.540> I<00:03:25.569> can<00:03:25.689> just<00:03:25.840> tie

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
compartment down so that I can just tie

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.949 
compartment down so that I can just tie
my<00:03:26.709> lead<00:03:27.010> of<00:03:27.159> wire<00:03:27.370> here<00:03:27.639> to<00:03:27.849> it<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:28.150> pull<00:03:28.870> it

my lead of wire here to it and pull it
up<00:03:29.049> and<00:03:29.139> to<00:03:29.260> make<00:03:29.379> it<00:03:29.439> much<00:03:29.590> easier<00:03:29.769> to<00:03:29.919> do<00:03:30.069> that

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
up and to make it much easier to do that

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.309 
up and to make it much easier to do that
we're<00:03:31.569> up<00:03:31.629> under<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:31.930> engine<00:03:32.139> compartment

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
we're up under the engine compartment

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.990 
we're up under the engine compartment
now<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:32.949> you<00:03:33.250> see<00:03:33.459> I've<00:03:33.609> gone<00:03:33.760> ahead<00:03:33.879> and

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
want to do is cut this wire in half the

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.830 
want to do is cut this wire in half the
one<00:03:51.489> end<00:03:51.639> will<00:03:51.790> go<00:03:51.939> to<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.239> black<00:03:52.419> wire<00:03:52.659> that

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
one end will go to the black wire that

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.210 
one end will go to the black wire that
we<00:03:52.930> routed<00:03:53.199> from<00:03:53.500> underneath<00:03:53.829> the<00:03:54.040> vehicle

to<00:04:08.829> to<00:04:09.459> figure<00:04:09.609> out<00:04:09.729> how<00:04:09.819> much<00:04:09.909> of<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.180> black

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
to to figure out how much of the black

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:18.420 
to to figure out how much of the black
wire<00:04:10.959> we're<00:04:11.139> actually<00:04:11.229> going<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.530> need<00:04:11.739> here

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.470 

and<00:04:19.430> then<00:04:19.549> we<00:04:19.609> just<00:04:19.730> want<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:19.940> go<00:04:20.000> and<00:04:20.180> tape<00:04:20.299> up

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
and then we just want to go and tape up

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.890 
and then we just want to go and tape up
that<00:04:20.660> connection<00:04:22.000> and<00:04:23.000> then<00:04:23.540> we<00:04:23.630> want<00:04:23.780> to<00:04:23.810> go

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
that connection and then we want to go

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.120 
that connection and then we want to go
ahead<00:04:23.960> and<00:04:24.110> add<00:04:24.169> our<00:04:24.200> fuse<00:04:24.620> to<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:24.919> fuse

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
ahead and add our fuse to the fuse

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.700
