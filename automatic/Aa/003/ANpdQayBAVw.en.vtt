00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.569 
smoothness of my skin's texture not the
appearance<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.560> large<00:01:49.740> pores<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.399> things

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
appearance of large pores and things

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.609 
appearance of large pores and things
like<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.450> Revlon<00:01:51.869> Photoready<00:01:52.229> gave

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
like that and so Revlon Photoready gave

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.490 
like that and so Revlon Photoready gave
me<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.799> really<00:01:53.250> radiant<00:01:53.460> look<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.350> was

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
me a really radiant look and I was

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.810 
me a really radiant look and I was
really<00:01:55.710> happy<00:01:56.100> with<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.490> you've<00:01:56.610> got

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
really happy with that if you've got

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.370 
really happy with that if you've got
normal<00:01:57.240> smooth<00:01:57.570> skin<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:57.930> think<00:01:58.049> that

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
normal smooth skin I think that

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.740 
normal smooth skin I think that
foundation<00:01:58.950> works<00:01:59.130> really<00:01:59.399> well<00:01:59.640> but<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.540> does

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
foundation works really well but it does

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.550 
foundation works really well but it does
have<00:02:00.990> some<00:02:01.290> noticeable<00:02:02.869> sparkle<00:02:03.869> shimmer<00:02:04.200> to

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
have some noticeable sparkle shimmer to

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.980 
have some noticeable sparkle shimmer to
it<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.860> guess<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:06.000> definitely<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.659> there<00:02:06.869> you

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
it I guess it's definitely in there you

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.869 
it I guess it's definitely in there you
can<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.890> look<00:02:08.129> at

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
can see it if you look at

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.039 
can see it if you look at
the<00:02:09.119> bottle<00:02:09.509> really<00:02:10.499> closely<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.840> can<00:02:12.840> see

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
the bottle really closely you can see

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.539 
the bottle really closely you can see
that<00:02:13.079> that<00:02:13.319> is<00:02:13.499> in<00:02:13.680> there<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.129> that's<00:02:14.249> not

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
that that is in there and that's not

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.610 
that that is in there and that's not
always<00:02:14.819> something<00:02:15.239> you're<00:02:15.569> gonna<00:02:15.689> want<00:02:15.959> then

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:37.719 
has gotten drastically healthier as I

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:40.140 
has gotten drastically healthier as I
use<00:06:37.900> this<00:06:38.080> over<00:06:38.409> time<00:06:38.680> I<00:06:38.979> still<00:06:39.550> use<00:06:39.789> my<00:06:40.000> other

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:42.189 
ones I still like them as well and I

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:43.920 
ones I still like them as well and I
think<00:06:42.219> I<00:06:42.460> have<00:06:42.610> different<00:06:42.879> kind<00:06:43.300> of<00:06:43.389> purposes

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
think I have different kind of purposes

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.679 
think I have different kind of purposes
for<00:06:44.139> everything<00:06:44.710> this<00:06:45.189> has<00:06:45.370> a<00:06:45.430> higher<00:06:45.759> SPF<00:06:46.090> in

00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:46.689 
for everything this has a higher SPF in

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:49.350 
for everything this has a higher SPF in
it<00:06:46.719> than<00:06:46.990> many<00:06:47.259> of<00:06:47.409> my<00:06:47.530> other<00:06:48.090> foundations<00:06:49.090> do

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
it than many of my other foundations do

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.089 
it than many of my other foundations do
so<00:06:49.629> that's<00:06:49.810> something<00:06:50.259> I<00:06:50.349> maybe<00:06:50.500> keep<00:06:50.770> in<00:06:50.919> mind

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:51.099 
so that's something I maybe keep in mind

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:52.770 
so that's something I maybe keep in mind
if<00:06:51.280> I'm<00:06:51.370> getting<00:06:51.580> outdoors<00:06:51.909> and<00:06:52.210> active<00:06:52.599> and

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310 
there are benefits to this time if

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.459 
there are benefits to this time if
you're<00:06:54.460> -<00:06:54.610> not<00:06:54.789> wearing<00:06:55.180> a<00:06:55.419> super<00:06:55.900> thick
