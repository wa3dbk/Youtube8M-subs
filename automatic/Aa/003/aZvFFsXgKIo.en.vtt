00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.100
 the sequence analysis of the dna is a 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.220
 Method for determining the individual 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.080
 nucleotide sequences here is the dna 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.870
 decodes the order of the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.280
 This pair can be found in the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.179
 Development of new therapies 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.949
 be helpful 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.359
 You can break the process in several steps 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.090
 divide the duplication of the DNA 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:25.590
 denaturation at 94 degrees celsius 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.260
 labeled by radiolabelled 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.699
 Primary distribution on 4 test tubes 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.960
 and application of the chain crash 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.210
 process and gel electrophoresis it 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.520
 begins with the duplication of the DNA 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.309
 because often there is little earth material 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.629
 for analysis 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.760
 Therefore, at the beginning of the sequence 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.730
 analyze a correspondingly large amount 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.410
 dna are produced 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.739
 at first the dna becomes artificial 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.750
 replicated that is copied like this one 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.300
 but exactly what happens is a whole 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.129
 other story 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.559
 but since one with a huge pile one 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.750
 dna can not really work 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.159
 you first put the dna in the two 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.650
 single strict columns 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.799
 This happens in the natural process 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.619
 the denaturation one uses to the 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.259
 natural decay of the dna at 94 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.659
 Grad Celsius occurs at this 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.530
 temperature dissolve the 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.439
 Hydrogen bridges between the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.640
 base pairs and the dna strand splits 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.650
 get into the two single strict ones 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.960
 now there are individual strands present 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.960
 is it possible to make further arrangements for 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.150
 to take a sequence analysis of the dna and 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.009
 although some are now radioactive 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.689
 labeled primer molecules on the 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.040
 photogenic strand bound 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.380
 the single strand will hybridize there 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.630
 the dna is now so beautifully marked 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.729
 you can release them for dismemberment 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.340
 the sample will be in four 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.259
 test tubes distributed in each 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.329
 a kind of demolition nucleotides 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.280
 will be added 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:02.520
 in the first are then only modified 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.829
 adenine nucleotides in the next appointment 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.680
 nucleotides to see the third rtl 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.709
 nucleotides and the last only guanine 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.480
 nucleotides special about these 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.519
 Termination nucleotides is 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.540
 that at the end of the 3 stroke no oha 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.879
 own group 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.620
 so there is no more phosphate 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.360
 link 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.040
 The nucleotides can not be mentioned below 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.620
 more about the phosphorus the first 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.819
 connection are held together so 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.480
 breaks the synthesis of the endogenous 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.170
 stranges from it arises so one 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.900
 shorter dna piece of this procedure 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.849
 Calling chains demolition procedure there 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.829
 this chain demolition procedure in the 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.079
 individual test tubes as often as desired 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:46.200
 can be repeated soon 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:48.840
 different long dna sections lie 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.390
 This one always knows the last one 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.000
 nucleotides is a demolition nucleotide 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:59.160
 So either a modified adenine 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.410
 thymine cytosine or guanine here are 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.660
 the shortened dna pieces from the first 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.849
 Test tube to see each with 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.160
 an atelier demolition now nucleotide 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.290
 gel electrophoresis is used 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.959
 the gel is two electrodes 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.790
 which connected within the gel 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.370
 generate an electrical voltage 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.190
 the gel that for example from the 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.410
 Mehrzucker ag rose behaves 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.290
 feels like a sieve and settles with the 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.459
 explain molecular motion 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.859
 Here you can see ours before 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.680
 broken dna pieces with the 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.419
 radioactively labeled primer these 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.019
 are given into the gel to see 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:41.790
 How far do you migrate molecules from big ones 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.940
 length move in comparison to 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.500
 short chain molecules slow them down 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.440
 So you can move on the basis of theirs 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.299
 speed can be distinguished 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.829
 if you now the dna chains in the money 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.530
 Depending on the length, they will be available 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.209
 different from those of animals 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.239
 short chains continue here as 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.220
 long at the end of the chain is located 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.849
 In any case, the base in the 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.440
 test tube was artificially broken off 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.810
 For example, if you have a chain from the 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.060
 test tube with the adeline nucleotides 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.400
 considered then one can assume 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.840
 that at the end of the considered dna 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.090
 section of an adenin abort note 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.159
 You can estimate how many times and in 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.340
 which distances are based in the 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:27.180
 examined strand are located 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.639
 from the comparison of the four 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.490
 performed gel electrophoresis pro 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.500
 demolition nucleotides rains one can 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.750
 then close the base sequence 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.729
 the actual analysis from the gel 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.150
 lumps through computer technology 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.800
 a special software performed 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.930
 that is the complete sequence of the sequence 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.190
 Analysis of the DNA 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.220
 It does not seem very accurate 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.000
 but is different for the comparison 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.000
 DNA samples sufficient
