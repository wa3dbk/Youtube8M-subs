00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:01.389 
the most intelligent thing I mean if you

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:03.770 
the most intelligent thing I mean if you
used<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:01.719> HTML<00:02:02.380> coding<00:02:02.679> or<00:02:03.009> really

professional<00:02:04.780> programming<00:02:05.649> scripts<00:02:06.429> are

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
professional programming scripts are

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.130 
professional programming scripts are
going<00:02:06.639> to<00:02:06.700> be<00:02:06.789> very<00:02:06.909> simplistic<00:02:07.600> because<00:02:07.959> they

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
going to be very simplistic because they

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.490 
going to be very simplistic because they
only<00:02:08.380> have<00:02:08.740> a<00:02:08.770> TV<00:02:09.130> for<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:09.640> brain<00:02:09.940> so<00:02:10.840> the

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
only have a TV for a brain so the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.660 
only have a TV for a brain so the
scripts<00:02:11.920> that<00:02:12.040> we're<00:02:12.250> going<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.400> create

scripts that we're going to create

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.309 
scripts that we're going to create
generally<00:02:13.390> are<00:02:13.480> like<00:02:13.630> 34

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
generally are like 34

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.110

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.660

and<00:02:16.390> they're<00:02:17.260> step-by-step<00:02:18.099> based<00:02:18.400> which

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
and they're step-by-step based which

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.429
