00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
especially face options instead of just

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.679 
especially face options instead of just

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.300 
create a model for every Pokemon that
could<00:03:05.959> follow<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.829> that<00:03:06.980> would<00:03:07.130> take

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
could follow you and that would take

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.160 
could follow you and that would take
forever<00:03:07.579> for<00:03:07.910> them<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.360> do<00:03:08.510> so<00:03:08.930> I'm<00:03:09.049> not

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
forever for them to do so I'm not

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.780 
forever for them to do so I'm not
expecting<00:03:09.799> this<00:03:09.920> one<00:03:10.070> to<00:03:10.130> actually<00:03:10.549> happen

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
expecting this one to actually happen

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.460 
expecting this one to actually happen
but<00:03:11.180> you<00:03:11.269> never<00:03:11.420> know<00:03:11.720> they<00:03:12.019> did<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:12.200> in<00:03:12.380> the

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
but you never know they did it in the

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.440 
but you never know they did it in the
last<00:03:12.680> remake<00:03:13.160> so<00:03:13.430> maybe<00:03:13.670> they'll<00:03:13.910> follow<00:03:14.120> that

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
last remake so maybe they'll follow that

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.830 
last remake so maybe they'll follow that
pattern

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.690 

of<00:03:17.349> course<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.980> number<00:03:18.220> one<00:03:18.340> thing<00:03:18.580> I'm

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
of course the number one thing I'm

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.130 
of course the number one thing I'm
looking<00:03:18.819> forward<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.300> see<00:03:19.510> is<00:03:19.630> more<00:03:19.840> mega

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
looking forward to see is more mega

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.020 
looking forward to see is more mega
evolutions<00:03:20.890> we<00:03:21.370> already<00:03:21.610> know<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:21.760> we'll

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
evolutions we already know that we'll

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.000 
evolutions we already know that we'll
probably<00:03:22.270> be<00:03:22.690> getting<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:23.020> mega<00:03:23.230> Latios<00:03:23.800> and

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
probably be getting a mega Latios and

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.400 
probably be getting a mega Latios and
latias<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:25.000> possibly<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.599> mega<00:03:25.840> Groudon<00:03:26.380> and

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
latias and possibly a mega Groudon and

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.240 
latias and possibly a mega Groudon and
Kyogre

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
Kyogre

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.100 
Kyogre
but<00:03:27.370> what<00:03:27.550> nine<00:03:27.730> legendary<00:03:28.300> Pokemon<00:03:28.840> could<00:03:29.020> be

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
but what nine legendary Pokemon could be

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.510 
but what nine legendary Pokemon could be
getting<00:03:29.319> a<00:03:29.440> mega<00:03:29.650> evolution

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
getting a mega evolution

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.979 
getting a mega evolution
maybe<00:03:30.760> we'll<00:03:30.970> see<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.330> other<00:03:31.450> two<00:03:31.720> mega

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
maybe we'll see the other two mega

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.920 
maybe we'll see the other two mega
starters<00:03:32.680> maybe<00:03:33.220> America's<00:03:33.730> slacking<00:03:34.360> flag

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
starters maybe America's slacking flag

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.320 
starters maybe America's slacking flag
on<00:03:35.200> Metagross<00:03:36.090> salamence

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330

melodic and maybe even a mega Mudkip
there's<00:03:40.599> so<00:03:40.870> many<00:03:41.110> cool<00:03:41.470> possibilities<00:03:41.769> I

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
there's so many cool possibilities I

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.490 
there's so many cool possibilities I
just<00:03:43.030> hope<00:03:43.209> that<00:03:43.239> they<00:03:43.480> make<00:03:43.660> more<00:03:43.870> Megas<00:03:44.319> than

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
just hope that they make more Megas than

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.540 
just hope that they make more Megas than
they<00:03:44.620> did<00:03:44.680> in<00:03:44.830> X&amp;Y

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
they did in X&amp;Y

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.699 
they did in X&amp;Y
what<00:03:46.000> mega<00:03:46.239> evolutions<00:03:46.870> or<00:03:47.019> features<00:03:47.380> are<00:03:47.560> you

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
what mega evolutions or features are you

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.229 
what mega evolutions or features are you
hoping<00:03:48.069> to<00:03:48.130> see<00:03:48.430> let<00:03:48.819> me<00:03:48.970> know<00:03:49.090> in<00:03:49.209> the
