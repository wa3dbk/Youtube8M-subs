misery<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:41.010> know<00:00:41.129> what<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.250> mean<00:00:41.430> because

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
misery you know what I mean because

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.459 
misery you know what I mean because
they're<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.540> these<00:00:42.690> labs<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.379> they're

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
they're in these labs and they're

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.290 
they're in these labs and they're
probably<00:00:43.649> being<00:00:43.920> frickin<00:00:44.430> subjected<00:00:45.149> that

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
probably being frickin subjected that

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.819 
probably being frickin subjected that
like<00:00:45.450> till<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> six<00:00:45.989> gas<00:00:46.200> or<00:00:46.440> something<00:00:46.770> you

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
like till the six gas or something you

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.369 
like till the six gas or something you
know<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:48.440> I<00:00:49.820> guess<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.300> most<00:00:51.449> humane<00:00:51.870> thing<00:00:51.930> is

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
know so I guess the most humane thing is

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.910 
know so I guess the most humane thing is
just<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.710> take<00:00:52.860> them<00:00:53.010> out<00:00:53.270> right<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:55.530> that's<00:00:55.710> I

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
just to take them out right so that's I

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.290 
just to take them out right so that's I
guess<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> whole<00:00:56.460> point<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> trophy

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
guess it's the whole point of the trophy

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.799 
guess it's the whole point of the trophy
just<00:00:58.260> hold<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.770> shit<00:00:59.100> out<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.280> my<00:00:59.460> ass<00:00:59.670> I<00:01:00.059> have
