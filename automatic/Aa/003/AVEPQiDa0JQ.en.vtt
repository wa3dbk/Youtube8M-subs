needle<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.740> put<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.369> jewelry<00:01:50.759> or<00:01:50.939> stud<00:01:51.390> or

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
earring or not earring but whatever you

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.920

decide<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.530> get<00:01:56.119> they<00:01:57.119> go<00:01:57.329> ahead<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.630> they

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
decide to get they go ahead and they

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.340 
decide to get they go ahead and they
stick<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:59.149> no<00:02:00.149> matter<00:02:00.420> how<00:02:00.780> hard<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.229> try

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
stick that in no matter how hard you try

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.920 
stick that in no matter how hard you try
you<00:02:01.680> will<00:02:01.920> tear<00:02:02.430> up<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.880> guess<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.509> just<00:02:03.540> kind<00:02:03.869> of

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
you will tear up I guess it just kind of

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.010 
you will tear up I guess it just kind of
pinches<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> nerve<00:02:04.710> there<00:02:05.240> so<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.299> will<00:02:06.719> tear

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
pinches a nerve there so you will tear

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.479 
pinches a nerve there so you will tear
up<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.380> have<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.590> little<00:02:07.860> tear<00:02:08.039> running<00:02:08.369> down

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
up and have a little tear running down

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.339 
up and have a little tear running down
the<00:02:08.759> side<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.149> you're<00:02:09.330> getting<00:02:09.450> pierced<00:02:10.050> but

question that I get asked is well how
long<00:02:29.380> did<00:02:29.560> it<00:02:29.650> take<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:30.010> hill<00:02:30.280> did<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.790> get

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
long did it take the hill did it get

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.310 
long did it take the hill did it get
infected<00:02:31.030> was<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.930> sore<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:34.390> was<00:02:34.990> really

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
infected was it sore and it was really

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.920 
infected was it sore and it was really
sore<00:02:35.590> for<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.950> while<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.880> did<00:02:37.330> get<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.540> little<00:02:37.600> bit

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
sore for a while it did get a little bit

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.460 
sore for a while it did get a little bit
infected<00:02:38.380> in<00:02:38.500> fact<00:02:38.860> even<00:02:40.050> about<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.110> year

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
infected in fact even about a year

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.120 
infected in fact even about a year
afterwards<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.370> still<00:02:43.410> would<00:02:44.410> bleed<00:02:44.740> every

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
afterwards it still would bleed every

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.949 
afterwards it still would bleed every
now<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.430> then<00:02:45.580> but<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.970> think<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:46.600> was<00:02:46.720> because

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
now and then but I think it was because

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.229 
now and then but I think it was because
the<00:02:47.500> type<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:47.739> stud<00:02:48.190> that<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.430> was<00:02:48.640> wearing<00:02:48.940> is

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
the type of stud that I was wearing is

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.120 
the type of stud that I was wearing is
the<00:02:49.840> kind<00:02:50.140> that<00:02:50.260> just<00:02:50.350> goes<00:02:50.680> straight<00:02:50.890> through

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
the kind that just goes straight through

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.979 
the kind that just goes straight through
with<00:02:51.580> a<00:02:51.610> little<00:02:51.880> knot<00:02:52.090> at<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.270> end<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:52.690> every

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
with a little knot at the end so every

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.750 
with a little knot at the end so every
time<00:02:53.020> I<00:02:53.200> would<00:02:53.440> pull<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:54.040> get<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.250> nagged<00:02:54.520> out

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
time I would pull and get it nagged out

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.580 
time I would pull and get it nagged out
it<00:02:55.270> would<00:02:55.420> make<00:02:55.630> my<00:02:55.780> nose<00:02:55.840> sore<00:02:56.320> all<00:02:56.560> over

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
it would make my nose sore all over

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.780 
it would make my nose sore all over
again<00:02:57.220> so<00:02:58.000> I<00:02:58.360> recommend<00:02:59.040> not<00:03:00.040> using<00:03:00.100> the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
again so I recommend not using the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.910 
again so I recommend not using the
straight<00:03:01.180> studs<00:03:01.600> until<00:03:02.200> you've<00:03:02.440> had<00:03:02.680> your

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
straight studs until you've had your

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.290 
straight studs until you've had your
nose<00:03:03.040> pierced<00:03:03.310> for<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.580> really<00:03:03.760> long<00:03:03.790> time<00:03:03.940> like

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
nose pierced for a really long time like

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.960 
nose pierced for a really long time like
the<00:03:04.420> one<00:03:04.600> I'm<00:03:04.810> wearing<00:03:05.020> now<00:03:05.230> is<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.709> stud<00:03:06.640> that

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
the one I'm wearing now is a stud that

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.400 
the one I'm wearing now is a stud that
goes<00:03:07.150> straight<00:03:07.360> through<00:03:07.570> with<00:03:07.959> a<00:03:07.989> little<00:03:08.230> knot

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
goes straight through with a little knot

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.620 
goes straight through with a little knot
at<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.620> end<00:03:08.709> because<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.489> wore<00:03:10.030> hoop<00:03:10.330> for<00:03:10.570> a

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
at the end because I wore hoop for a

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.910 
at the end because I wore hoop for a
really<00:03:10.840> long<00:03:10.870> time<00:03:11.050> because<00:03:11.410> when<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:11.709> wear<00:03:11.890> a

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
really long time because when you wear a

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.220 
really long time because when you wear a
hoop<00:03:12.160> there's<00:03:12.760> really<00:03:12.970> no<00:03:13.360> way<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:14.050> can

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
hoop there's really no way that you can

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.229 
hoop there's really no way that you can
pull<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.709> tug<00:03:14.890> on<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.190> hoop<00:03:15.370> so<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.090> actually

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
pull and tug on the hoop so it actually

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.740 
pull and tug on the hoop so it actually
helps<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.930> nose<00:03:17.140> piercing<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.739> heal<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:17.980> lot<00:03:18.280> so

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
helps the nose piercing to heal a lot so

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.699 
helps the nose piercing to heal a lot so
that's<00:03:19.750> my<00:03:19.989> recommendation<00:03:20.160> I<00:03:21.720> mean<00:03:22.720> my<00:03:23.500> belly

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
that's my recommendation I mean my belly

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.699 
that's my recommendation I mean my belly
button<00:03:24.070> piercing<00:03:24.489> got<00:03:24.730> infected<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:26.019> lot<00:03:26.350> more

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
button piercing got infected a lot more

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.100 
button piercing got infected a lot more
than<00:03:27.010> my<00:03:27.130> nose<00:03:27.190> piercing<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.180> if<00:03:28.480> it<00:03:28.630> does<00:03:28.870> get

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
than my nose piercing and if it does get

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.250 
than my nose piercing and if it does get
infected<00:03:29.590> don't<00:03:30.340> be<00:03:30.730> scared<00:03:31.269> don't<00:03:31.420> freak<00:03:32.049> out

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
infected don't be scared don't freak out

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.500 
infected don't be scared don't freak out
and<00:03:32.620> be<00:03:33.010> like<00:03:33.160> oh<00:03:33.400> my<00:03:33.549> god<00:03:33.760> my<00:03:34.000> nose<00:03:34.150> is<00:03:34.360> gonna
