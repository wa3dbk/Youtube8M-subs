00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
what you see we've launched the app CNN

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.499 
what you see we've launched the app CNN
app<00:01:24.180> which<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.509> being<00:01:24.840> monitored<00:01:25.320> twice<00:01:26.509> so

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
app which is being monitored twice so

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.480 
app which is being monitored twice so
now<00:01:27.689> if<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:27.930> go<00:01:28.170> back<00:01:28.439> into<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.890> app<00:01:29.189> and

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
now if we go back into the app and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.390 
now if we go back into the app and
settings<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:31.110> see<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.740> two<00:01:32.040> videos

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
settings you see that we have two videos

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.810 
settings you see that we have two videos
recorded<00:01:33.350> one<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.950> first<00:01:35.189> time<00:01:35.490> when<00:01:35.670> we

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
recorded one is the first time when we

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:44.210 
recorded one is the first time when we
launch<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.299> app<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:42.180> second<00:01:42.810> one<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
launch the app and the second one is the
