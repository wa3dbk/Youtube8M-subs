with that you can embroider on top of a

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.000 
with that you can embroider on top of a
piece<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:25.780> fabric<00:02:26.079> and<00:02:26.379> turn<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.739> into<00:02:26.890> a

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
piece of fabric and turn it into a

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.440 
piece of fabric and turn it into a
square<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.519> doesn't<00:02:27.790> always<00:02:28.000> have<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.209> go

so<00:03:13.420> this<00:03:13.599> brings<00:03:13.750> up<00:03:13.989> files<00:03:14.319> by<00:03:15.099> hoops<00:03:15.579> I<00:03:15.849> yes

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
so this brings up files by hoops I yes

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.490 
so this brings up files by hoops I yes
yeah<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:16.599> can<00:03:16.780> see<00:03:16.930> at<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.109> top<00:03:17.139> of<00:03:17.290> the

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
screen is telling you that's there it is

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.500 
screen is telling you that's there it is
there<00:03:19.120> look<00:03:19.359> at<00:03:19.449> that<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:21.730> easy<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.120> see<00:03:22.299> on<00:03:22.419> the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
there look at that so easy to see on the

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.470 
there look at that so easy to see on the
nice<00:03:22.660> screen<00:03:23.019> a<00:03:23.169> it's<00:03:23.919> got<00:03:24.160> over<00:03:24.480> 65,000

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
nice screen a it's got over 65,000

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.780 
nice screen a it's got over 65,000
colors<00:03:25.780> in<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.079> screen<00:03:26.440> so<00:03:27.129> that<00:03:27.160> just<00:03:27.609> means

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
colors in the screen so that just means

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.180 
colors in the screen so that just means
it's<00:03:28.120> visually<00:03:28.690> easier<00:03:29.199> to<00:03:29.319> look<00:03:29.530> at<00:03:29.799> it's

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
it's visually easier to look at it's

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.099 
it's visually easier to look at it's
more<00:03:30.459> realistic<00:03:30.910> it's<00:03:31.329> not<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:31.629> that's<00:03:31.900> when

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
more realistic it's not that that's when

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.020 
more realistic it's not that that's when
we<00:03:32.199> threads<00:03:32.500> there<00:03:32.709> are<00:03:32.829> in<00:03:33.010> there<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.609> design

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
we threads there are in there the design

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.900 
we threads there are in there the design
is<00:03:34.419> the<00:03:35.079> amount<00:03:35.290> of<00:03:35.470> colors<00:03:35.859> that<00:03:36.069> the<00:03:36.310> that

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
is the amount of colors that the that

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.280 
is the amount of colors that the that
the<00:03:36.940> screen<00:03:37.299> has<00:03:37.359> so<00:03:37.720> that's<00:03:37.900> equal<00:03:38.049> to

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
the screen has so that's equal to

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.069 
the screen has so that's equal to
top-of-the-line<00:03:39.220> laptop<00:03:39.819> computer<00:03:40.359> mm-hmm

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
top-of-the-line laptop computer mm-hmm

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.979 
top-of-the-line laptop computer mm-hmm
so<00:03:41.379> that's<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:42.099> I<00:03:42.910> can<00:03:43.120> make<00:03:43.269> designs<00:03:43.660> come

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
so that's and I can make designs come

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.720 
so that's and I can make designs come
out<00:03:44.079> in<00:03:44.199> any<00:03:44.290> color<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:44.680> want<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.160> I<00:03:45.190> can<00:03:45.340> change

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730

the machine so i can get you to do that
from<00:04:56.750> that<00:04:56.810> side<00:04:57.220> ok<00:04:59.229> and<00:05:00.229> it<00:05:00.349> locks<00:05:00.590> into

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
from that side ok and it locks into
