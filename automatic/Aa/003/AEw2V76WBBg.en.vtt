on to a braid so I'm just going to shake

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.139 
on to a braid so I'm just going to shake
that<00:00:53.460> out<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.629> ready<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.020> begin<00:00:59.149> so

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.880 
that out and we are ready to begin so
for<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.539> first<00:01:00.780> look<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.230> want<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.469> grab<00:01:01.680> a

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
for this first look you want to grab a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.560 
for this first look you want to grab a
small<00:01:02.250> section<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.730> hair<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:03.120> front<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
small section of hair in front of the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.630 
small section of hair in front of the
ear<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.049> divide<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.769> into<00:01:05.010> three<00:01:05.309> sections

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
ear and divide that into three sections

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.780 
ear and divide that into three sections
and<00:01:06.350> now<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.409> are<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.920> create<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.520> Dutch

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
and now we are going to create a Dutch

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.660 
and now we are going to create a Dutch
braid<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:10.229> Dutch<00:01:10.470> braid<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.490> like<00:01:11.640> a

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
braid and a Dutch braid is just like a

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.550 
braid and a Dutch braid is just like a
French<00:01:12.060> braid<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> only<00:01:13.020> difference<00:01:13.409> is

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
French braid but the only difference is

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.649 
French braid but the only difference is
the<00:01:13.920> middle<00:01:14.220> strand<00:01:14.520> goes<00:01:14.820> over<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.450> side

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the middle strand goes over the side

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.109 
the middle strand goes over the side
strand<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.670> don't<00:01:17.820> know<00:01:17.939> how<00:01:18.060> to

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
strand so and if you don't know how to

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.820 
strand so and if you don't know how to
French<00:01:18.450> braid<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.869> will<00:01:19.049> be<00:01:19.170> sure<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.470> leave<00:01:19.619> a
