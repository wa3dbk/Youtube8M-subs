local<00:02:25.690> files<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:27.220> now<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:27.910> have<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.300> find

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
local files and now I have to find

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.690 
local files and now I have to find
binary<00:02:28.990> of<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.380> game<00:02:29.590> which<00:02:29.920> usually<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.670> on

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
binary of the game which usually is on

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.280 
binary of the game which usually is on
binary<00:02:31.380> win32<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.680> it's<00:02:33.580> here<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.180> I<00:02:35.050> just

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
binary win32 and it's here and I just

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.260 
binary win32 and it's here and I just
paste<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.890> stuff<00:02:36.760> here

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
paste the stuff here

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.910 
paste the stuff here
it's<00:02:37.450> our<00:02:37.630> there's<00:02:37.900> another<00:02:38.140> version<00:02:38.500> of<00:02:38.740> it

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
it's our there's another version of it

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.610 
it's our there's another version of it
that<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.790> already<00:02:40.180> added<00:02:40.570> and<00:02:40.990> now<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.230> just<00:02:41.350> have

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
that I already added and now I just have

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.050 
that I already added and now I just have
to<00:02:41.830> start<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:42.190> game<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:45.070> might<00:02:45.370> say<00:02:45.640> something

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
to start the game it might say something

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.040 
to start the game it might say something
about<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.540> x<00:02:46.660> axis<00:02:46.750> 360<00:02:47.560> C<00:02:48.180> because<00:02:49.180> these<00:02:49.780> X

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
about the x axis 360 C because these X

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.630 
about the x axis 360 C because these X
input<00:02:50.230> wrapper<00:02:50.650> that<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:50.980> did<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.490> actually

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
input wrapper that I did is actually

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.990 
input wrapper that I did is actually
based<00:02:52.150> on<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.660> source<00:02:52.930> for<00:02:53.200> X<00:02:53.320> tricks<00:02:53.820> x360<00:02:54.820> C

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
based on the source for X tricks x360 C

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.750 
based on the source for X tricks x360 C
because<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.420> have<00:02:55.630> like<00:02:55.930> no<00:02:56.410> experience<00:02:57.010> with

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
because I have like no experience with

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.960 
because I have like no experience with
C++<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:58.750> could<00:02:59.050> not<00:02:59.590> do<00:02:59.860> that<00:03:00.070> on<00:03:00.280> my<00:03:00.460> own

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
C++ and it could not do that on my own

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:09.270 
C++ and it could not do that on my own
on

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.270 

when<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.360> gale<00:03:10.570> when<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.500> game<00:03:11.650> opens<00:03:12.130> the

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
when the gale when the game opens the

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.560 
when the gale when the game opens the
controller<00:03:12.640> will<00:03:12.910> light<00:03:13.090> up<00:03:13.270> and<00:03:15.300> it<00:03:16.300> will

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
controller will light up and it will

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.600 
controller will light up and it will
work<00:03:16.750> perfectly<00:03:17.500> with<00:03:17.860> our<00:03:17.920> abrasion<00:03:18.460> and

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
work perfectly with our abrasion and

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:44.520 
work perfectly with our abrasion and
everything

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.449 

vibration<00:03:45.490> works<00:03:45.670> perfectly<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:47.310> this<00:03:48.310> is

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
vibration works perfectly and this is

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.540 
vibration works perfectly and this is
the<00:03:48.580> beta<00:03:48.910> driver<00:03:49.420> as<00:03:49.780> I<00:03:50.230> didn't<00:03:50.920> quite<00:03:51.190> test

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
the beta driver as I didn't quite test

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.840 
the beta driver as I didn't quite test
it<00:03:51.819> I<00:03:52.350> didn't<00:03:53.350> have<00:03:53.560> another<00:03:53.980> gamepad<00:03:54.459> so<00:03:54.700> I'm

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
it I didn't have another gamepad so I'm

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.300 
it I didn't have another gamepad so I'm
not<00:03:55.060> pretty<00:03:55.540> sure<00:03:55.990> if<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.590> second<00:03:56.980> gamepad

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
not pretty sure if the second gamepad

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.070 
not pretty sure if the second gamepad
and<00:03:57.700> third<00:03:58.510> and<00:03:58.690> fourth<00:03:58.930> will<00:03:59.230> work<00:03:59.790> but<00:04:01.080> as

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
and third and fourth will work but as

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.960 
and third and fourth will work but as
I'm<00:04:02.319> very<00:04:02.590> confident<00:04:03.040> with<00:04:03.160> my<00:04:03.370> source<00:04:03.670> code<00:04:03.790> I

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
I'm very confident with my source code I

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.530 
I'm very confident with my source code I
think<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.540> will<00:04:04.870> work<00:04:05.819> but<00:04:06.819> I<00:04:07.090> couldn't<00:04:07.390> test

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
think it will work but I couldn't test

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.180 
think it will work but I couldn't test
it<00:04:07.690> so<00:04:07.840> if<00:04:07.989> it<00:04:08.110> doesn't<00:04:08.350> work<00:04:08.470> just<00:04:08.739> warn<00:04:08.980> me

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
it so if it doesn't work just warn me

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.080 
it so if it doesn't work just warn me
I'm<00:04:09.520> going<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:09.880> try<00:04:10.000> and<00:04:10.120> fix<00:04:10.360> it<00:04:10.569> and<00:04:10.690> get<00:04:10.900> it
