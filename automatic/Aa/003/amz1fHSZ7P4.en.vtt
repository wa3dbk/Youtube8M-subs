hey<00:00:02.340> what's<00:00:02.520> up<00:00:02.669> I've<00:00:03.149> unlocked<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.629> couple

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
hey what's up I've unlocked a couple

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.720 
hey what's up I've unlocked a couple
godspeed<00:00:04.350> type<00:00:04.589> characters<00:00:05.100> so<00:00:05.339> I<00:00:05.370> figured

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
godspeed type characters so I figured

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.509 
godspeed type characters so I figured
now<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:06.120> good<00:00:06.299> time<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:07.099> explain<00:00:08.099> or<00:00:08.280> do<00:00:08.400> an

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
now is a good time to explain or do an

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.480 
now is a good time to explain or do an
overview<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.300> new<00:00:09.420> godspeed<00:00:09.990> mechanics

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
overview of the new godspeed mechanics

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.700 
overview of the new godspeed mechanics
as<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.639> can<00:00:11.759> see<00:00:11.910> here<00:00:12.210> on<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.690> top<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.259> your

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
as you can see here on the top is your

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.470 
as you can see here on the top is your
normal<00:00:14.040> movesets<00:00:14.490> your<00:00:14.940> normal<00:00:15.240> charge

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
normal movesets your normal charge

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.050 
normal movesets your normal charge
attacks<00:00:15.859> if<00:00:16.859> you're<00:00:17.010> playing<00:00:17.279> an<00:00:17.460> existing<00:00:17.910> or

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
attacks if you're playing an existing or

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.150 
attacks if you're playing an existing or
returning<00:00:18.390> character<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:19.740> will<00:00:19.859> be<00:00:19.980> pretty

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
returning character that will be pretty

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.980 
returning character that will be pretty
much<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.400> same<00:00:20.730> as<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.060> always<00:00:21.150> was<00:00:21.359> except

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
much the same as it always was except

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.540 
much the same as it always was except
for<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> couple<00:00:22.260> characters<00:00:22.980> like<00:00:23.279> pizza

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
for a couple characters like pizza

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.640 
for a couple characters like pizza
heated<00:00:23.699> got<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.060> revamp<00:00:24.470> you'll<00:00:25.470> notice

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
heated got a revamp you'll notice

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.070 
heated got a revamp you'll notice
another<00:00:25.980> move<00:00:26.250> set<00:00:26.490> down<00:00:26.699> at<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.910> bottom<00:00:27.119> that

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
another move set down at the bottom that

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.570 
another move set down at the bottom that
starts<00:00:28.380> with<00:00:28.470> triangle<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.250> your<00:00:29.400> god

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
starts with triangle that is your god

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.450 
starts with triangle that is your god
speed<00:00:29.939> string<00:00:30.769> basically<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:32.009> get<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> really

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
speed string basically you get a really

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.520 
speed string basically you get a really
long<00:00:32.669> triangle<00:00:33.570> string<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.050> game<00:00:34.260> there

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
long triangle string in this game there

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.490 
long triangle string in this game there
are<00:00:34.649> no<00:00:34.800> more<00:00:35.010> sea<00:00:35.370> ones<00:00:35.780> which<00:00:36.780> honestly<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.469> a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
are no more sea ones which honestly is a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.930 
are no more sea ones which honestly is a
welcome<00:00:37.860> change<00:00:37.890> because<00:00:38.460> most<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.820> those

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
welcome change because most of those

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.590 
welcome change because most of those
were<00:00:39.000> hot<00:00:39.329> garbage<00:00:40.370> but<00:00:41.370> at<00:00:41.460> any<00:00:41.610> time<00:00:41.940> during

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
were hot garbage but at any time during

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.240 
were hot garbage but at any time during
that<00:00:42.840> triangle<00:00:43.200> string<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.620> can<00:00:43.680> cancel<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.219> a

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
that triangle string you can cancel to a

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.940 
that triangle string you can cancel to a
square<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.960> most<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.170> them<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.620> unique

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
square and most of them have a unique

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.660 
square and most of them have a unique
action<00:00:47.579> or<00:00:48.210> attack<00:00:48.649> so<00:00:49.649> learning<00:00:50.340> how<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.579> use

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
action or attack so learning how to use

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.060 
action or attack so learning how to use
those<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.899> takes<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.199> little<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.800> learning

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
those is it takes a little like learning

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.619 
those is it takes a little like learning
curve<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:54.059> actually<00:00:54.360> pretty<00:00:54.510> useful

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
curve but it's actually pretty useful

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.110 
curve but it's actually pretty useful
for<00:00:55.110> clearing<00:00:55.379> crowds<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.640> one<00:00:56.789> stipulation

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
for clearing crowds the one stipulation

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.740 
for clearing crowds the one stipulation
is<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.960> does<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:58.289> work<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.710> officers<00:00:59.539> if<00:01:00.539> you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
is it does not work on officers if you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.599 
is it does not work on officers if you
don't<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.109> an<00:01:01.230> item<00:01:01.500> equipped<00:01:01.800> basically

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
don't have an item equipped basically

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.780 
don't have an item equipped basically
they<00:01:02.760> get<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.329> they<00:01:03.600> block<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.899> or<00:01:04.229> Perry<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
they get like they block it or Perry it

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.950 
they get like they block it or Perry it
once<00:01:05.790> they're<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.150> air<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.540> can<00:01:06.689> hit<00:01:06.840> them

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
once they're in the air you can hit them

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.230 
once they're in the air you can hit them
with<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.530> as<00:01:08.250> far<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.580> I've<00:01:08.760> seen<00:01:08.790> you

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
with it but as far as I've seen you

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.539 
with it but as far as I've seen you
can't<00:01:09.510> really<00:01:09.659> juggle<00:01:10.140> them<00:01:10.290> they<00:01:10.920> seem<00:01:11.369> to

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
can't really juggle them they seem to

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.039 
can't really juggle them they seem to
just<00:01:11.729> kind<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.270> hyper<00:01:12.450> armor<00:01:12.810> state

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
just kind of be in hyper armor state

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.370 
just kind of be in hyper armor state
when<00:01:13.260> she<00:01:13.350> use<00:01:13.530> god<00:01:14.250> speed<00:01:14.540> but<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.659> case<00:01:15.930> i'll

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
when she use god speed but in case i'll

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.050 
when she use god speed but in case i'll
go<00:01:16.530> ahead<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.770> show<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.100> off<00:01:17.220> right<00:01:17.430> now<00:01:23.060> so

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
go ahead and show it off right now so

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.920 
go ahead and show it off right now so
there's<00:01:24.240> her<00:01:24.390> basic<00:01:25.040> godspeed<00:01:26.040> stream<00:01:26.930> any

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
there's her basic godspeed stream any

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.789 
there's her basic godspeed stream any
point<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.619> can<00:01:29.210> cancel<00:01:30.210> into<00:01:30.570> square<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.259> do

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
point you can cancel into square and do

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.200 
point you can cancel into square and do
a<00:01:31.829> different<00:01:32.070> attack<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.790> if<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.030> do

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
a different attack like if you do

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.719 
a different attack like if you do
triangle<00:01:34.200> triangle<00:01:34.409> square<00:01:34.740> she<00:01:35.159> does<00:01:35.340> that

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.760 

there's<00:01:39.229> triangle<00:01:40.229> triangle<00:01:40.409> triangle

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
there's triangle triangle triangle

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.550 
there's triangle triangle triangle
square<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.460> guess<00:01:42.030> you'd<00:01:42.180> call<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.450> like<00:01:42.689> g4<00:01:43.530> or

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
square I guess you'd call it like g4 or

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.600 
square I guess you'd call it like g4 or
something<00:01:44.130> instead<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.430> c4<00:01:45.829> go<00:01:46.829> ahead<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.220> do

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
something instead of c4 go ahead and do

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.690 
something instead of c4 go ahead and do
it<00:01:47.700> nobuyuki<00:01:48.509> here<00:01:48.799> for<00:01:49.799> example<00:01:49.920> here<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.490> his

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
it nobuyuki here for example here is his

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.030 
it nobuyuki here for example here is his
godspeed<00:01:51.689> 7<00:01:52.110> as<00:01:52.290> I'd<00:01:52.920> like<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.159> call<00:01:53.310> it

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.090 

it<00:01:59.040> also<00:01:59.189> has<00:01:59.460> an<00:01:59.610> AE<00:01:59.790> cancel<00:02:00.360> point<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.080> if<00:02:02.009> you

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
it also has an AE cancel point so if you

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.830 
it also has an AE cancel point so if you
want<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.310> clear<00:02:02.520> crowds<00:02:02.850> efficiently<00:02:03.540> I

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
want a clear crowds efficiently I

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.770 
want a clear crowds efficiently I
recommend<00:02:04.439> doing<00:02:04.590> Godspeed<00:02:05.220> and<00:02:05.659> then<00:02:06.659> you

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
recommend doing Godspeed and then you
