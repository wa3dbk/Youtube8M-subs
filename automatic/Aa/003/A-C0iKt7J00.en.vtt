dungeon was no more yeah so basically

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.810 
dungeon was no more yeah so basically
what<00:02:31.260> I'm<00:02:31.320> doing<00:02:31.380> now<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.710> just<00:02:31.920> smoothing<00:02:32.640> it

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820

out<00:02:32.940> smoothing<00:02:33.420> out<00:02:33.540> smoothing<00:02:33.960> out<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.610> might

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
out smoothing out smoothing out I might

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.520 
out smoothing out smoothing out I might
cover<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.120> back<00:02:36.270> over<00:02:36.480> with<00:02:36.750> dirt<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.230> stone

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530

cover it back over with dirt and stone

sink right I've been having issues with
my<00:03:14.090> with<00:03:15.090> my<00:03:15.300> video<00:03:15.630> I<00:03:16.020> think<00:03:16.860> it's<00:03:16.980> my<00:03:17.070> video

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
my with my video I think it's my video

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.520 
my with my video I think it's my video
card<00:03:17.550> I'm<00:03:17.730> not<00:03:17.910> sure<00:03:18.230> basically<00:03:19.230> just<00:03:20.060> the

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
card I'm not sure basically just the

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.410 
card I'm not sure basically just the
rendering<00:03:22.530> in<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.730> process<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.180> rendering

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
rendering in the process of rendering

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
rendering in the process of rendering
the<00:03:24.750> video<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:25.610> like<00:03:26.610> messes<00:03:27.330> up<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.720> st.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
the video it like messes up the st.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.949 
the video it like messes up the st.
between<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:28.830> video<00:03:29.040> in<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.190> audio<00:03:29.430> whatever

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
between the video in the audio whatever

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.090 
between the video in the audio whatever
shouldn't<00:03:30.959> make<00:03:31.050> too<00:03:31.080> much<00:03:31.410> of<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.709> difference

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
shouldn't make too much of a difference

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.190 
shouldn't make too much of a difference
um<00:03:33.410> so<00:03:34.410> right<00:03:35.100> here<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.340> see<00:03:35.790> this<00:03:36.420> big<00:03:36.810> area

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
um so right here you see this big area

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.150 
um so right here you see this big area
it<00:03:37.530> was<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:39.030> much<00:03:39.300> worse<00:03:39.600> when<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:39.900> got<00:03:40.170> there<00:03:40.350> or

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
it was so much worse when I got there or

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.710 
it was so much worse when I got there or
when<00:03:41.489> I<00:03:41.520> first<00:03:41.760> blew<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.090> up<00:03:42.180> i<00:03:42.360> should<00:03:42.510> say

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
when I first blew it up i should say

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.810 
when I first blew it up i should say
I've<00:03:43.530> managed<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.040> smooth<00:03:44.340> out<00:03:44.400> all<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.610> walls

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
I've managed to smooth out all the walls

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.120 
I've managed to smooth out all the walls
most<00:03:45.270> the<00:03:45.390> walls<00:03:45.600> still<00:03:46.170> not<00:03:46.350> done<00:03:46.530> it's<00:03:46.980> not

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
most the walls still not done it's not

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.010 
most the walls still not done it's not
even<00:03:47.280> close<00:03:47.550> to<00:03:47.610> being<00:03:47.760> done<00:03:47.910> but<00:03:48.600> as<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:48.900> can

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
even close to being done but as you can

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.390 
even close to being done but as you can
see<00:03:49.370> it's<00:03:50.370> still<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:51.300> crater<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:52.080> the

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
see it's still the crater that the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.010 
see it's still the crater that the
dynamite<00:03:53.400> left<00:03:53.640> was<00:03:53.880> pretty<00:03:54.239> massive<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:54.840> this

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
dynamite left was pretty massive so this

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.270 
dynamite left was pretty massive so this
is<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.320> remnants<00:03:55.800> of<00:03:55.920> that<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.730> whole<00:03:58.280> the

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
is the remnants of that the whole the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.949 
is the remnants of that the whole the
whole<00:03:59.310> dungeon<00:03:59.700> I<00:04:00.120> guess<00:04:01.310> so<00:04:02.330> actually<00:04:03.330> as<00:04:03.600> you

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
whole dungeon I guess so actually as you

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.229 
whole dungeon I guess so actually as you
can<00:04:04.110> see<00:04:04.290> up<00:04:04.380> above<00:04:04.530> I<00:04:04.830> remove<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.280> water<00:04:05.520> sort

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
can see up above I remove the water sort

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.310 
can see up above I remove the water sort
of<00:04:06.330> put<00:04:07.320> in<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:08.360> don't<00:04:09.360> know<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.540> damn<00:04:09.900> it's<00:04:10.200> not

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
of put in a I don't know a damn it's not

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.400 
of put in a I don't know a damn it's not
only<00:04:10.410> a<00:04:10.500> damn<00:04:10.769> i<00:04:11.070> just<00:04:11.519> made<00:04:12.209> it<00:04:12.360> so<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:13.170> water

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
only a damn i just made it so the water

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.650 
only a damn i just made it so the water
was<00:04:13.590> pouring<00:04:13.890> into<00:04:14.130> a<00:04:14.280> glass<00:04:14.640> box<00:04:15.060> instead<00:04:15.510> of

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
was pouring into a glass box instead of

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.020 
was pouring into a glass box instead of
pouring<00:04:15.870> down<00:04:16.230> and<00:04:16.590> whatever<00:04:17.549> i<00:04:17.640> just<00:04:17.820> makes

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
pouring down and whatever i just makes

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.360 
pouring down and whatever i just makes
it<00:04:18.150> i<00:04:18.330> might<00:04:18.570> unblock<00:04:19.260> it<00:04:19.290> later<00:04:19.709> but<00:04:20.010> it<00:04:20.190> just

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
it i might unblock it later but it just

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.779 
it i might unblock it later but it just
makes<00:04:20.580> it<00:04:20.700> easier<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.330> build<00:04:21.600> and<00:04:21.900> whatnot

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
makes it easier to build and whatnot

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.190 
makes it easier to build and whatnot
yeah<00:04:23.789> so<00:04:24.180> that's<00:04:24.690> why<00:04:24.840> I'm<00:04:24.900> doing<00:04:25.050> in

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
yeah so that's why I'm doing in

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.700 
yeah so that's why I'm doing in
Minecraft

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.200
