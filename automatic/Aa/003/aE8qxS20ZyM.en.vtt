whether horse necessarily doesn't mean

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.620 
whether horse necessarily doesn't mean
that<00:00:19.109> he's<00:00:19.320> real<00:00:19.770> thick<00:00:20.160> back<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.789> means<00:00:21.359> that

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
that he's real thick back it means that

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.769

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
first half of him the muscle that's

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.529 
first half of him the muscle that's
around<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.630> backbone<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.500> also<00:00:29.099> fact<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:30.330> many

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
around the backbone is also fact so many

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.749 
around the backbone is also fact so many
people<00:00:30.960> think<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.380> their<00:00:32.009> horses<00:00:32.340> real

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
people think that their horses real

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.270 
people think that their horses real
thick<00:00:33.480> back<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.110> mutton<00:00:34.350> withered<00:00:34.800> because

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
he's big chested big body and that's the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.590 
he's big chested big body and that's the
biggest<00:00:39.600> misconception<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:40.950> see<00:00:41.190> in

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
biggest misconception that we see in

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.510 
biggest misconception that we see in
saddles<00:00:42.600> today<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.620> there's<00:00:43.920> not<00:00:44.190> as<00:00:44.370> many

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
people think and so that's reason most

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.520 
people think and so that's reason most
people<00:00:50.579> want<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.210> go<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> wide<00:00:51.870> gullet<00:00:52.379> is

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
because their horse is big stout and he

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.290 
because their horse is big stout and he
thinks<00:00:55.800> they<00:00:55.980> think<00:00:56.280> they<00:00:56.430> have<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.640> round<00:00:57.000> back

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
smallest pad on him as possible because

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.830 
smallest pad on him as possible because
God<00:01:07.590> only<00:01:07.619> gave<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.340> mutton<00:01:08.580> whether<00:01:08.820> horse<00:01:09.150> so

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
much to hold on to with the saddle and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.929 
much to hold on to with the saddle and
so<00:01:13.020> if<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.320> horse<00:01:13.560> has<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> round<00:01:14.130> back<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.760> you

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
so if a horse has a round back and you

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.170 
so if a horse has a round back and you
put<00:01:15.210> two<00:01:15.600> inches<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.110> pad<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.590> him<00:01:16.799> then<00:01:17.580> you're

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
put two inches of pad on him then you're

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.390 
put two inches of pad on him then you're
actually<00:01:18.299> making<00:01:18.780> him<00:01:19.049> more<00:01:19.409> round<00:01:19.740> back<00:01:20.040> than

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
actually making him more round back than

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.240 
actually making him more round back than
he<00:01:20.430> already<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.960> so<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.170> thinner<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> pad<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
he already is so the thinner the pad the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.060 
he already is so the thinner the pad the
better<00:01:23.460> because<00:01:23.850> your<00:01:24.210> pad<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.630> not<00:01:25.070> absorbing

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
better because your pad is not absorbing

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.480 
better because your pad is not absorbing
any<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.270> cushion<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:27.930> far<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:29.159> shock

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
any of the cushion as far as the shock

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.440 
any of the cushion as far as the shock
from<00:01:30.259> from<00:01:31.259> dalian<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.670> hitting<00:01:33.360> your

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
from from dalian and and hitting your

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.200 
from from dalian and and hitting your
horses<00:01:33.869> back<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.100> almost<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.909> tighter

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
horses back the the almost the tighter

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.810 
horses back the the almost the tighter
the<00:01:36.540> fit<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.960> more<00:01:37.140> pad<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.820> it

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the fit the more pad you have it

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.670 
the fit the more pad you have it
compresses<00:01:39.420> when<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.869> hit<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.380> got<00:01:40.650> more

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
compresses when you hit so it's got more

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.760 
compresses when you hit so it's got more
room<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.700> push<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.110> got<00:01:43.229> more<00:01:43.470> room

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
room to push and so it's got more room

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.490 
room to push and so it's got more room
for<00:01:44.040> speed<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.970> velocity<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.600> it's<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.110> harder

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
for speed and velocity so it's a harder

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.219 
for speed and velocity so it's a harder
hitting<00:01:46.939> on<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.210> withers<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.750> shoulders

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
hitting on the withers and the shoulders

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.770 
hitting on the withers and the shoulders
and<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.310> with<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.000> mutton<00:01:51.299> whether<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.630> go

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
and so with the mutton whether it go

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.319 
and so with the mutton whether it go
with<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.049> smaller<00:01:52.380> pad<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.040> then<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.729> your<00:01:53.939> more

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
with a smaller pad and then on your more

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.810 
with a smaller pad and then on your more
thoroughbred<00:01:54.930> 'back<00:01:55.259> horses<00:01:55.799> then<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.640> can

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
thoroughbred 'back horses then you can

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.730 
thoroughbred 'back horses then you can
go<00:01:56.939> ahead<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.180> use<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> thicker<00:01:57.750> pad<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.710> that

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
go ahead and use a thicker pad so that

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.709 
go ahead and use a thicker pad so that
you<00:01:59.070> can<00:01:59.310> build<00:01:59.520> them<00:01:59.759> up<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.090> little<00:02:00.299> bit<00:02:00.509> more
