00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.210
 one 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.010
 you have a flat to rent and you do not know exactly how to do it for 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.199
 can do it in advantageous conditions 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.180
 and avoiding the inconveniences 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.530
 you have to know your rights but also your obligations in this regard 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.110
 do not stop looking at our program today 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.640
 welcome one more day 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.620
 to the administrator at home our spaces pifiado 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.100
 by the general council of colleges of administrators of estates of Spain 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.760
 intended to talk about this topic related to the world of beauty 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.480
 what type of rental agreement is the most usual currently knows 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.139
 the contrast the definitively years 

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:00.830
 I have defined 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.220
 well, I do not know about another one, I can say 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.220
 e four years 10 years two years according to 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.520
 the five years 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.870
 the concept should shift the receipt of achilles 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.350
 Mexico DF 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.500
 the truth that we are all 12 from madrid - I have no idea 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.060
 well I think that receiving the rent should not be very expensive 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.320
 that is the only way that people notice this stretch will session with buy 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.400
 floors no 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.810
 and well I think that an expert in Spain 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.100
 is that the rental flats are all privately owned then to the 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.860
 time to throw people away 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.700
 by normal 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.579
 asks for a good return when for example in france or germany oosthuizen 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.460
 special agent or worse the floors 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.330
 they are a kind of state cooperatives that I was renting at very 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.030
 reasonable thing that in Spain is a thing that is needed 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.850
 and we are still by these measures 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.820
 the sections only if it is rented for the couple the couple alone the price 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.290
 of income the high cost 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.970
 is the abc itself already several years old 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.520
 I suppose the leader has for him 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.929
 it has the deposit deposited by the tenant 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.539
 after these hundred episodes and if there is any damage already highlighted discount 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:17.289
 it feels to be the party 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:20.039
 well I guess it was bail 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.489
 it is something that must exist because if not a person 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:27.439
 poses clearly understands with rents a flat no 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.679
 it may have been only three months or four 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:33.679
 Of course it will not be easy and he has advocated dedicating 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:38.099
 the head of state the dollar has a basis to be able 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.459
 not even what has left another in poor condition of the solar 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.760
 Well, you see that as in all aspects of life 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.360
 also the situation that we propose when creating a flat also presents 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.029
 Doubts 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.909
 so we recommend you to be attentive to our report you want 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.909
 have things somewhat clearer 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.689
 If you own an empty house and you plan to rent it in the 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:02.790
 next months 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.599
 It is convenient that you keep in mind some extremes 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.889
 the demand for rental apartments increased 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.919
 on the one hand because young people without stable work have difficulties 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.539
 to access a mortgage loan that allows them to buy a flat at 30 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:16.389
 years old 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.929
 on the other, the demand arising from the immigrant population that has arrived 

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:23.899
 last years permanent contracts have disappeared in the housing of 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:28.139
 The most usual leases currently are contracts for five years and 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.069
 renewable although both parties can agree on a journalist that york or higher 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.009
 to this in case the tenant opted to leave the house before the 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.219
 time established by the contract shall indemnify the owner 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:44.249
 normally at a rate of one month per year pending the receipt you must identify 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:47.339
 broken down the various concepts of income 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:51.569
 the rent itself the imputation for the works of the ibi the 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.019
 goalkeeping service 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.019
 On the other hand, the deposit of one month deposited at the time of signing the 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.069
 lease is not a guarantee against the lack of payment but 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.860
 which is intended to cover the damages that few minds have been able to produce 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.609
 in the apartment during the rental period 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.059
 The owner of the home must declare the income of the 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:13.390
 income statement 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.060
 You can deduct maintenance and maintenance costs 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.639
 Community fees and interest on mortgage loans 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.680
 on the other hand everything that supposes improvements like changing the parquet 11 weird 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.930
 a terrace can not be deducted at one time but through amortization 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.139
 of the damages that correspond by law 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.860
 Well we already know something more about the particularities of renting flats 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.120
 Even so, we recommend that you have any questions 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.490
 apodaca an administrator of collegiate farms will attend you with pleasure 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.490
 and clarify their debts 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.470
 for our part, we are going to shed some light on some issues that 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.990
 you propose us next 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.990
 one 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.949
 yeah well I would like to know if to undertake a minor work and my 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.370
 address I have to leave some kind of permission to the administration 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.330
 It is a very common repair over time 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.099
 Order the reform that you trust and make sure you have asked 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:13.110
 the permission of minor works 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.199
 without these papers you can not start the works 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.029
 If you are a landlord you must notify the community and if you are a tenant you must 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:22.110
 communicate it to its owner 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.130
 Once they have carried out the relevant works, they must leave the property in 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:29.960
 As regards common services and elements, it is referred to in perfect conditions of 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.199
 cleaning 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.499
 could use a parking lot as there used to be a store 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.819
 It will be necessary to see how this place is registered since if it is 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:42.160
 that its use is commercial to use it as a store for example 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.640
 You can not make a park freely without previously requesting a change of use 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.999
 to the town hall and the community 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:52.349
 they have also given that it is assumed that you will need a ford to enter and exit 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:55.429
 the reconversion will be detected very quickly 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:59.699
 one 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.590

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.099
