00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.060
 I greet you dear viewers with 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.619
 cool london jan but 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.550
 distinguished by the best performance 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:29.279
 for three years but what's the reason for this topic i 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.169
 I communicate with Chris Bush my for one wants 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.519
 see a drop in gold prices on 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.739
 renewing the quantitative program 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:35.399
 mitigation is a monetary tool 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.559
 politicians 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.289
 cb decision to apply this tool 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.719
 after long months of reflection gave 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.250
 a boost in gold prices also 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.519
 actions of the central bank led to an increase 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.890
 stock market and month for gold 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.079
 turned out to be very good investors bought up 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.449
 this metal as profitability 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:03.120
 Eurozone government bonds filed gold 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:04.860
 gaining popularity trails stated that 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.439
 will do anything to ensure 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.280
 economic growth of the euro zone is not too 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.170
 is it risky in some way this 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.270
 says that things in the eurozone are not 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.549
 very good about what we did not know yet 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.680
 a few months ago in the market as a whole 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.600
 seen that and never a consensus on 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.780
 measures tightening just fell apart 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.860
 parts of these policies were not 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.689
 Satisfied France and Spain Italy Greece 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.000
 if I must come to the rescue and ski 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.649
 for the eurozone more time so you can 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.509
 make sure the region gets its 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.820
 financial support in the form of foreclosure 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.780
 60 billion government bonds 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.119
 Euro every month when the Fed will raise 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.549
 interest rates in June or later in 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.829
 this year it can certainly be said 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:55.560
 will kill the gold trade if justified 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.850
 expectations and distribute at a valuable rate 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.240
 long-term gold outlook 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.159
 becomes not very attractive but 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.020
 let's not forget others about 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.179
 mmm such as lasting conflict in 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.399
 Ukraine, Russia still thinks that 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.720
 absolutely right absolutely not stable 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.000
 now and middle east 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.340
 even the pacific region exist 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.260
 their problems so investors are still 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.760
 consider gold as safe 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.430
 investment of their portfolios 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.160
 as edge against uncertainty for 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.069
 total 2014 year the conversations were about 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.459
 investment volatility and so gold 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.530
 hardens how about silver silver 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.810
 slightly strengthened but only slightly 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.910
 reinforcement occurred mainly in 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.430
 industrial production account where 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.920
 silver is used more than gold 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.720
 we are still slowing down demand in china and even 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.209
 In the US, therefore, production is reduced 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.810
 so silver only grew slightly 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.040
 price 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:56.069
 not in general, ascending gold carved 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.359
 fell a little more from 1,300 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.470
 therefore must grow to this 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.629
 indicator on the right 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.540
 when the stage about the program to i'm gold 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:06.510
 will rise to the mark of 1 340 but then 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:15.870
 again probably falling to level 1 250 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:23.880
 mind the strengthening of the dollar is still the oil market 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:25.739
 on 2050 we do not have time until it is unstable 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.750
 we realized that the thread can both grow and 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.669
 fall in price recently brand in regard 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.530
 during the day but in general the oil market is all 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:34.200
 more medvezhek so it will not 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.160
 exceeded mark 60 dance prevail 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.160
 there will be short positions 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.750
 we are grateful to Chris for conversations dear
