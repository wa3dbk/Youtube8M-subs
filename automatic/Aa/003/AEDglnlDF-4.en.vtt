00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.840
 on the left we see sander de wijn international and defender of 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.790
 has a hamstring injury and on the right with his broken hand 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.200
 striker in shape this season constantlyijn junk and seeing there in the dark 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.799
 tasks make tasks 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.289
 He still has a significant contribution to the operation and 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.630
 He rode the Amsterdam race 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.859
 but she is already training with his team 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.360
 in the opening phase, kemperman intercepts attacker he shoots 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.949
 just in front 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:30.789
 but by 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.870
 This was a psychopath together chance for chance in the first half of it 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.870
 Amsterdam is much better hyves you have those suits 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.950
 oil demand it's a spanish international from Amsterdam and there 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.400
 is scored after twenty minutes 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.310
 from the team 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.220
 at that time well deserved lead 4 when azarenka hit the ball in 8 he 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.590
 ended goalkeeper heart seen ireland 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.170
 in the first half from amsterdam no less than four penalty corners and because the 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.530
 placenta is not the first results of a daughter 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.900
 This is a very complicated one that is eventually over processed by it 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.730
 grabbing the audience 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.880
 and in addition our director Johan Wakkie are in power litjens fight 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.330
 penalty corner cannon van der leer 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
 but especially a moment still a big camp for hard 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.170
 only turning around the set a kampong ball becomes stronger in the second half and that 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.930
 scores a full year 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.040
 for us 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.540
 it is 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.490
 Just like his opponent today for the shoelaces, phones are back 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.869
 of a 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.210
 world trip 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.650
 immediately speaks of this and an assistant qantas press and the hit 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.650
 of the peacock a bull again an attack of camps 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.930
 But Amsterdam takes over and switches to the lightning fast comes out via Billy 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.190
 baker only goes for goalkeeper heart 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.930
 what can the reveille west africa and new 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.910
 a wonderful rescue because the left-wing defender tom de meyer 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.030
 it picks up the ball above its strongest head you would say in earlier times 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.330
 times what this definitely yielded a penalty but nowadays you can 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.040
 make sticks like the defender in the goal mouth 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.669
 kemperman 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.209
 plastic place 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.369
 giant 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:13.320
 will you stop just for the goalkeeper 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.439
 he pushes the ball forward 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:19.840
 kampong recovers in the second half of a knee the moderate first 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.569
 then it's finally such a one 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.090
 oh well minutes before time, the first penalty corner 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.199
 for tom show off 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.609
 according to top man anp are beaten by robbert kemperman 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:34.589
 but the referee comes from bunnik wells hit not good because that is not 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:37.930
 Kemperman would have been beaten within the circle and disagreed 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.149
 on the other side in the subsequent attack, the close man made one 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:44.649
 violation on tackle in scoring position 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:46.349
 and it gives the other referee 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.180
 power to a penalty jaspers is angry very kampong is angry and not for nothing 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.589
 because the ball has just arrived 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:55.079
 beating here too 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.689
 by kemperman a crucial foul from the referee of buyten want camp 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.199
 is still upset if a sweet way makes this mistake 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:07.149
 Warsaw on the line 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:10.939
 ferkear from the preses usually about forty made no mistakes tb 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:12.839
 Amsterdam 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:16.319
 stronger he is back at a parked car on inter stand 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:20.859
 seven minutes ahead of time still talking about a new contract 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.959
 offered 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.329
 japan and previously the tenth time scored for Amsterdam five minutes before 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.429
 time 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:30.499
 a place stopped by bakery 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.399
 he strangled playing around 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:34.949
 another choice there is nothing 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:36.359
 lifetime 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:37.250
 it's an advantage 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.250
 and like to wear it 

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:47.119
 nac internet goalkeeper made inside ticked 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.269
 the final phase on this course maes was bullied in, it seems 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.319
 Amsterdam is very easy to play with nuclear disasters 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.599
 Do you want another intentional break out Floris Evers? 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.659
 there is sent with a yellow card it came after the observation of the errors 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.079
 referee is no longer good with kampong 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.779
 the rate until I did not know that increase 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:12.219
 on the plank the circle my experience still has to look back but they just kept on 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:13.079
 on the ordinary 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.159
 they come from fetching penalty and then actually making a fake later 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.279
 nonsense 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.340
 and then you get another yellow card 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.349
 performance 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.969
 that just a little bit and 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:26.529
