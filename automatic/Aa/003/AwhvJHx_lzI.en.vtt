that<00:03:49.590> would<00:03:49.709> say<00:03:50.100> that<00:03:50.610> would<00:03:50.760> steer<00:03:51.720> you<00:03:51.810> off

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
that would say that would steer you off

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.720 
that would say that would steer you off
your<00:03:52.140> path<00:03:52.380> from<00:03:52.650> this<00:03:52.799> right<00:03:53.010> away<00:03:53.130> is<00:03:53.459> I

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
your path from this right away is I

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.479 
your path from this right away is I
would<00:03:54.150> probably<00:03:54.360> suggest<00:03:54.750> get<00:03:55.560> your<00:03:55.860> degree

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
would probably suggest get your degree

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.250 
would probably suggest get your degree
and<00:03:56.760> something<00:03:57.090> I<00:03:57.180> did<00:03:57.360> so<00:03:57.810> I<00:03:57.870> think<00:03:57.989> you<00:03:58.110> said

are that will open door after door after
door<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.130> will<00:04:08.579> be<00:04:08.790> we<00:04:09.329> remain<00:04:10.079> difficult<00:04:10.650> or

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
door you will be we remain difficult or

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.890 
door you will be we remain difficult or
very<00:04:11.430> hard<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.730> open<00:04:11.850> if<00:04:12.299> you<00:04:12.480> don't<00:04:12.630> have<00:04:12.780> that

very hard to open if you don't have that

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.590 
very hard to open if you don't have that
degree<00:04:13.230> it's<00:04:13.440> just<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.739> way<00:04:13.860> things<00:04:14.160> are<00:04:14.340> here

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
degree it's just the way things are here

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.640 
degree it's just the way things are here
doesn't<00:04:15.600> mean<00:04:15.690> it's<00:04:15.810> impossible<00:04:15.870> which<00:04:16.380> means

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
doesn't mean it's impossible which means

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.530 
doesn't mean it's impossible which means
it<00:04:16.769> makes<00:04:16.950> a<00:04:17.100> lot<00:04:17.340> harder<00:04:17.579> in<00:04:17.970> Japan<00:04:18.419> I'll

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
it makes a lot harder in Japan I'll

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.630 
it makes a lot harder in Japan I'll
still<00:04:18.750> be<00:04:18.870> here<00:04:19.079> if<00:04:19.950> it<00:04:20.040> takes<00:04:20.220> you<00:04:20.310> four<00:04:20.489> more

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
still be here if it takes you four more

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.949 
still be here if it takes you four more
years<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:21.030> get<00:04:21.120> your<00:04:21.299> degree<00:04:21.510> but<00:04:21.539> so<00:04:21.810> look
