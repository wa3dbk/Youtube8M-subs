 a file that wins us and 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:30.099
 so then let's go to what it is 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:34.450
 burn it without buying a 4.7 lives DVD 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:39.290
 and then you must have a burner 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.540
 that is black or the sham and we will know and 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.470
 all we are going to do is open 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.850
 our tray 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.130
 here absorbing and 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:54.160
 look for a dvd 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.160
 then we put our finger on the tray 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:01.600
 and we put it 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:05.890
 that we are going to go to what it is to create and 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:09.460

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.510

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:09.810
 I will use the video while 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.620
