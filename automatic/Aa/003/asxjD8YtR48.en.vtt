00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
think it's music it might be I I think

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.719 
think it's music it might be I I think
it<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.170> comes<00:01:28.530> from<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.220> I'm<00:01:29.430> feeling

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
it just comes from what I'm feeling

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.450 
it just comes from what I'm feeling
inside<00:01:30.590> like<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.770> lot<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.310> my<00:01:32.520> art<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.060> about

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
inside like a lot of my art is about

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.090 
inside like a lot of my art is about
freedom<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.880> feeling<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.720> isn't<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.440> much<00:01:37.470> I

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
freedom a feeling it isn't so much I

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.580 
freedom a feeling it isn't so much I
look<00:01:38.850> at<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.060> beautiful<00:01:39.240> sunset<00:01:39.810> want<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.409> paint
