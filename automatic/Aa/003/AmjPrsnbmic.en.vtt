practice on because it's easy and you
can<00:00:12.120> tie<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.360> as<00:00:12.690> many<00:00:13.110> times<00:00:13.410> as<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.679> want

without worrying about messing up so I'm
just<00:00:17.130> rolling<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.640> up<00:00:17.760> into<00:00:19.189> kind<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.580> shape

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
just rolling it up into kind of a shape

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.320 
just rolling it up into kind of a shape
next<00:00:24.330> thing<00:00:24.449> I've<00:00:24.570> got<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:25.849> big<00:00:26.849> spool<00:00:27.150> of

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
next thing I've got the big spool of

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.450 
next thing I've got the big spool of
kitchen<00:00:27.689> twine<00:00:29.150> and<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.330> peeled<00:00:30.630> off<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:31.460> little

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
kitchen twine and I peeled off a little

kitchen twine and I peeled off a little
bit

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
bit

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.709 
bit
but<00:00:33.180> I'm<00:00:33.270> not<00:00:33.420> cutting<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:33.960> yet<00:00:35.570> I'm<00:00:36.570> gonna

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
but I'm not cutting it yet I'm gonna

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.690 
but I'm not cutting it yet I'm gonna
leave<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.469> spool<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.800> kind<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.460> feed

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
leave it on the spool and kind of feed

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.170 
leave it on the spool and kind of feed
it<00:00:38.820> off<00:00:38.969> as<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.300> go<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:43.040> step<00:00:44.040> one<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.520> gonna<00:00:44.640> be

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
tuck that string underneath there I've

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.520 
tuck that string underneath there I've
got<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.180> short<00:00:51.480> hand<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.960> my<00:00:52.079> right<00:00:52.320> hand

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
got the short hand in my right hand

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.029 
got the short hand in my right hand
shirt<00:00:52.980> end<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.370> my<00:00:53.520> right<00:00:53.730> hand<00:00:54.440> long<00:00:55.440> end<00:00:55.710> in

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
shirt end in my right hand long end in

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.970 
shirt end in my right hand long end in
my<00:00:56.190> left<00:00:56.430> hand<00:01:00.379> and<00:01:01.379> there's<00:01:01.559> kind<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.890> a

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
my left hand and there's kind of a

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.650 
my left hand and there's kind of a
sequence<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.910> if<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.210> remember

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
sequence here and if you can remember

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.590 
sequence here and if you can remember
the<00:01:04.199> sequence<00:01:05.090> you'll<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:06.210> pretty<00:01:06.479> good<00:01:08.600> so

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the sequence you'll be pretty good so

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.950 
the sequence you'll be pretty good so
first<00:01:10.350> one<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.549> go<00:01:11.670> over<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.770> long<00:01:13.770> end

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
first one is to go over the long end

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.270 
first one is to go over the long end
then<00:01:15.960> I'm<00:01:16.110> going<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.320> go<00:01:16.409> under<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.580> long<00:01:17.820> end

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
then I'm going to go under the long end

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:30.700 
then I'm going to go under the long end
around<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:22.170> short<00:01:22.530> end<00:01:24.229> under<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:28.080> long<00:01:28.320> end

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.460 

and<00:01:31.130> now<00:01:31.850> I've<00:01:32.000> got<00:01:32.030> a<00:01:32.210> little<00:01:32.390> loop<00:01:32.720> here<00:01:32.750> so

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
and now I've got a little loop here so

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.950 
and now I've got a little loop here so
I'm<00:01:33.560> gonna<00:01:33.680> go<00:01:33.860> back<00:01:33.890> over<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:34.940> through<00:01:35.930> the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
I'm gonna go back over and through the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.790 
I'm gonna go back over and through the
loop<00:01:36.670> so<00:01:37.670> effectively<00:01:38.420> we've<00:01:38.960> created<00:01:39.320> a

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
loop so effectively we've created a

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.280 
loop so effectively we've created a
square<00:01:40.220> knot<00:01:40.660> now<00:01:41.660> we're<00:01:41.780> not<00:01:41.870> going<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.110> pull

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
square knot now we're not going to pull

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.560 
square knot now we're not going to pull
this<00:01:42.470> real<00:01:42.800> tight<00:01:43.130> because<00:01:43.490> we<00:01:44.000> want<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:44.270> cinch

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
this real tight because we want to cinch

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.450 
this real tight because we want to cinch
it<00:01:44.720> down<00:01:45.220> by<00:01:46.220> pulling<00:01:46.700> up<00:01:46.940> on<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.890> long<00:01:49.070> end

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
it down by pulling up on the long end

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:58.960 
it down by pulling up on the long end
and<00:01:50.619> just<00:01:51.619> bring<00:01:51.830> it<00:01:51.860> down<00:01:53.260> snug<00:01:57.850> onto<00:01:58.850> your

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
and just bring it down snug onto your

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.140 
and just bring it down snug onto your
roast<00:01:59.890> now<00:02:00.890> I'm<00:02:01.010> going<00:02:01.190> to<00:02:01.250> continue<00:02:01.790> on<00:02:01.940> and

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
roast now I'm going to continue on and

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.410 
roast now I'm going to continue on and
do<00:02:02.300> what's<00:02:02.540> called<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:03.200> running<00:02:03.680> truss<00:02:04.420> which

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
do what's called a running truss which

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.290 
do what's called a running truss which
is<00:02:05.570> kind<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:05.869> using<00:02:06.410> the<00:02:07.190> entire<00:02:07.550> string<00:02:08.090> as

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
is kind of using the entire string as

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.720 
is kind of using the entire string as
you<00:02:08.330> go<00:02:08.600> along<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.290> I'm<00:02:09.709> creating<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.250> loop

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.730 

feeding<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:16.820> around

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.120 

and<00:02:20.830> pulling<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.880> up<00:02:22.620> we're<00:02:23.620> going<00:02:23.740> to<00:02:23.800> space

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
and pulling it up we're going to space

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.320 
and pulling it up we're going to space
these<00:02:24.510> at<00:02:25.510> about<00:02:25.600> an<00:02:26.200> inch<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.970> as<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.090> pull

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
these at about an inch and as you pull

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.270 
these at about an inch and as you pull
it<00:02:28.450> up<00:02:28.600> you<00:02:28.900> can<00:02:29.080> kind<00:02:29.320> of<00:02:29.380> get<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.740> so<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.130> the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
it up you can kind of get it so that the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.110 
it up you can kind of get it so that the
string<00:02:30.720> stays<00:02:31.720> centered<00:02:32.790> along<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.940> whole

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
string stays centered along the whole

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.350 
string stays centered along the whole
thing<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:35.650> don't<00:02:36.460> worry<00:02:36.730> about<00:02:36.880> it<00:02:37.120> being<00:02:37.270> too

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
thing and don't worry about it being too

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.400 
thing and don't worry about it being too
slack<00:02:37.840> right<00:02:38.140> now<00:02:38.350> just<00:02:38.770> pull<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.100> up<00:02:39.220> kind<00:02:39.520> of

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
slack right now just pull it up kind of

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.190 
slack right now just pull it up kind of
relatively<00:02:41.410> taut<00:02:42.450> another<00:02:43.450> loop<00:02:45.330> grab<00:02:46.330> pull

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
relatively taut another loop grab pull

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.480 
relatively taut another loop grab pull
around

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:02.170 

and<00:02:54.970> cinch<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.690> up

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:22.630 

we'll<00:03:02.659> do<00:03:02.840> another<00:03:03.140> one

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:37.699 

got<00:03:23.180> another<00:03:23.450> one

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:47.930 

and<00:03:38.390> another<00:03:39.390> one

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.120 

now<00:03:48.540> at<00:03:48.660> this<00:03:48.810> point<00:03:49.080> I've<00:03:49.290> got<00:03:49.320> things<00:03:49.620> pretty

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
now at this point I've got things pretty

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.200 
now at this point I've got things pretty
well<00:03:51.590> tied<00:03:52.590> up<00:03:54.050> but<00:03:55.050> I'm<00:03:55.170> going<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.620> continue

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
well tied up but I'm going to continue

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.290 
well tied up but I'm going to continue
trusting<00:03:57.210> this<00:03:57.390> on<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:58.200> backside<00:03:58.800> to<00:03:59.300> bring

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
trusting this on the backside to bring

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.830 
trusting this on the backside to bring
these<00:04:00.480> knots<00:04:00.810> in<00:04:01.050> the<00:04:01.170> line<00:04:01.520> and<00:04:02.630> now<00:04:03.630> I'm

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
these knots in the line and now I'm

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.660 
these knots in the line and now I'm
gonna<00:04:03.960> have<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.470> cut<00:04:04.620> my<00:04:04.770> string<00:04:05.130> but<00:04:05.580> I'm

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
gonna have to cut my string but I'm

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.390 
gonna have to cut my string but I'm
going<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:05.880> cut<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.150> a<00:04:06.210> little<00:04:06.420> bit<00:04:06.570> long<00:04:06.810> so<00:04:07.400> I'm

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
going to cut it a little bit long so I'm

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.180 
going to cut it a little bit long so I'm
just<00:04:08.550> measuring<00:04:09.060> down<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.930> length<00:04:10.170> of<00:04:10.650> the

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
just measuring down the length of the

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:20.410 
just measuring down the length of the
entire<00:04:11.460> thing<00:04:12.230> plus<00:04:13.820> about<00:04:14.820> that<00:04:15.060> much<00:04:15.240> more

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.650 

and<00:04:21.680> what<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:22.710> do<00:04:22.830> now<00:04:23.250> is<00:04:23.730> I<00:04:24.630> feed<00:04:24.930> it<00:04:24.960> over<00:04:25.230> and

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
and what I do now is I feed it over and

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:42.990 
and what I do now is I feed it over and
under<00:04:27.660> over<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:32.600> under<00:04:35.360> over<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:37.730> under

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.430 

over<00:04:44.220> and<00:04:45.220> under<00:04:46.060> over<00:04:48.060> and<00:04:49.060> under<00:04:50.910> over<00:04:51.910> and

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
over and under over and under over and

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.390 
over and under over and under over and
under<00:04:54.210> and<00:04:55.210> now<00:04:55.810> I'm<00:04:56.620> gonna<00:04:56.770> flip<00:04:57.070> it<00:04:57.100> back

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
under and now I'm gonna flip it back

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.930 
under and now I'm gonna flip it back
over<00:04:57.430> and<00:04:58.150> use<00:04:58.660> this<00:04:58.930> end<00:04:59.260> and<00:04:59.550> finish<00:05:00.550> it<00:05:00.820> off

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
over and use this end and finish it off

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.530 
over and use this end and finish it off
with<00:05:01.000> what's<00:05:01.960> called<00:05:02.200> a<00:05:02.380> surgeon's<00:05:02.950> knot

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
with what's called a surgeon's knot

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.530 
with what's called a surgeon's knot
which<00:05:04.540> is<00:05:04.570> basically<00:05:05.350> a<00:05:06.000> simple<00:05:07.000> square<00:05:07.390> knot

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
which is basically a simple square knot

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.150 
which is basically a simple square knot
where<00:05:08.020> you<00:05:08.230> would<00:05:08.500> fold<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:09.040> over<00:05:09.370> and<00:05:09.820> under

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
where you would fold it over and under

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.460 
where you would fold it over and under
except<00:05:12.160> this<00:05:12.340> time<00:05:12.640> we're<00:05:13.210> going<00:05:13.390> over<00:05:13.750> and

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
except this time we're going over and

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.310 
except this time we're going over and
under<00:05:15.090> one<00:05:16.090> additional<00:05:16.630> time<00:05:16.840> so<00:05:17.110> we<00:05:17.200> have

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
under one additional time so we have

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.610 
under one additional time so we have
three<00:05:17.710> twists<00:05:18.810> which<00:05:19.810> gives<00:05:20.080> it<00:05:20.230> a<00:05:20.290> little<00:05:20.410> bit

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
three twists which gives it a little bit

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.460 
three twists which gives it a little bit
more<00:05:20.770> friction<00:05:21.130> and<00:05:21.580> holds<00:05:22.060> better<00:05:22.300> and<00:05:24.150> now

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
more friction and holds better and now

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.830 
more friction and holds better and now
we're<00:05:26.470> going<00:05:26.560> to<00:05:26.620> come<00:05:26.860> back<00:05:27.130> over<00:05:27.460> and<00:05:28.060> under

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
we're going to come back over and under

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.250 
we're going to come back over and under
and<00:05:29.340> pull<00:05:30.340> it<00:05:30.430> tight<00:05:30.640> and<00:05:32.280> then<00:05:33.280> you<00:05:33.580> have<00:05:34.260> at

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
and pull it tight and then you have at

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.860 
and pull it tight and then you have at
rest<00:05:35.590> rows
