00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
recommend going as size up to what you

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.580 
recommend going as size up to what you
would<00:04:13.450> normally<00:04:13.900> buy<00:04:14.200> so<00:04:14.770> i<00:04:14.800> got<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.010> 10

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
would normally buy so i got a 10

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.939 
would normally buy so i got a 10
because<00:04:15.769> they<00:04:16.540> give<00:04:17.540> you<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.690> wedgie<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:18.230> bomb

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
cheeks isn't a nice look I don't think

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.310 
cheeks isn't a nice look I don't think
then<00:04:22.699> the<00:04:22.790> other<00:04:22.910> thing<00:04:23.000> i<00:04:23.210> got<00:04:23.360> is<00:04:23.419> kind<00:04:24.169> of

then the other thing i got is kind of

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.600 
then the other thing i got is kind of
going<00:04:24.410> to<00:04:24.530> be<00:04:24.620> a<00:04:24.650> bit<00:04:24.860> difficult<00:04:25.010> to<00:04:25.280> show<00:04:25.550> you

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
both so nice i don't really know how to

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.640 
both so nice i don't really know how to
show<00:04:28.820> you<00:04:28.880> this<00:04:29.030> without<00:04:29.270> putting<00:04:29.479> it<00:04:29.690> on<00:04:29.870> but

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
show you this without putting it on but

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.060 
show you this without putting it on but

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
it's just a cage crop top and i was

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.170 
it's just a cage crop top and i was
looking<00:04:34.280> for<00:04:34.460> something<00:04:34.580> like<00:04:34.760> this<00:04:34.820> for<00:04:34.970> ages

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
looking for something like this for ages

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.110 
looking for something like this for ages
and<00:04:35.449> i<00:04:35.690> found<00:04:35.900> it<00:04:36.139> so<00:04:36.440> I<00:04:36.830> just<00:04:37.400> jumped<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:38.000> got

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
and i found it so I just jumped and got

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.200 
and i found it so I just jumped and got
it<00:04:38.240> it<00:04:38.690> was<00:04:38.900> 14<00:04:39.410> 99<00:04:40.100> but<00:04:40.639> I<00:04:40.669> also<00:04:40.850> recommend

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
it it was 14 99 but I also recommend

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.340 
it it was 14 99 but I also recommend
getting<00:04:41.389> a<00:04:41.540> size<00:04:41.750> up<00:04:41.900> in<00:04:42.050> this<00:04:42.139> as<00:04:42.320> well

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
getting a size up in this as well

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.320 
getting a size up in this as well
because<00:04:42.860> then<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.550> material<00:04:44.000> of<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.150> crop

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
because then the material of the crop

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.300 
because then the material of the crop
top<00:04:44.510> itself<00:04:44.780> is<00:04:44.990> really<00:04:45.410> thick<00:04:45.860> you<00:04:46.070> don't

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
top itself is really thick you don't

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.700 
top itself is really thick you don't
need<00:04:46.430> to<00:04:46.490> wear<00:04:46.610> a<00:04:46.669> bra<00:04:46.850> with<00:04:46.880> it<00:04:47.060> at<00:04:47.210> all<00:04:47.389> and<00:04:47.710> so

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
need to wear a bra with it at all and so

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.680 
need to wear a bra with it at all and so
get<00:04:48.979> size<00:04:49.220> up<00:04:49.430> otherwise<00:04:49.760> you're<00:04:50.389> just<00:04:50.419> gonna

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
get size up otherwise you're just gonna

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.440 
get size up otherwise you're just gonna
be<00:04:50.840> like<00:04:50.960> this<00:04:51.040> not<00:04:52.040> being<00:04:52.190> able<00:04:52.310> to<00:04:52.460> move<00:04:52.729> and

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
be like this not being able to move and

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.659 
be like this not being able to move and

just<00:07:15.020> so<00:07:15.140> that<00:07:15.350> you'll<00:07:15.920> be<00:07:15.980> able<00:07:16.100> to<00:07:16.310> wear<00:07:16.550> a

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.580 
just so that you'll be able to wear a

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.250 
just so that you'll be able to wear a
jump<00:07:16.910> or<00:07:17.090> something<00:07:17.300> under<00:07:17.630> in<00:07:17.870> the<00:07:17.960> winter

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:18.260 
jump or something under in the winter

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.280 
jump or something under in the winter
when<00:07:18.440> it's<00:07:19.220> really<00:07:19.430> cold<00:07:19.550> but<00:07:20.090> it's<00:07:20.600> so<00:07:20.960> nice

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:21.290 
when it's really cold but it's so nice

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.140 
when it's really cold but it's so nice
and<00:07:21.350> warm<00:07:21.860> this<00:07:22.220> is<00:07:22.340> quite<00:07:22.520> difficult<00:07:22.700> to<00:07:22.940> show

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.150 
and warm this is quite difficult to show

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.520 
and warm this is quite difficult to show
you<00:07:23.240> just<00:07:23.570> holding<00:07:23.900> it<00:07:23.990> and<00:07:24.140> kind<00:07:24.320> of<00:07:24.410> moving

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:24.530 
you just holding it and kind of moving

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.260 
you just holding it and kind of moving
it<00:07:24.650> around<00:07:24.740> so<00:07:25.010> for<00:07:25.220> I<00:07:25.310> just<00:07:25.550> might<00:07:26.060> as<00:07:26.150> well

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.270 
it around so for I just might as well

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.300 
it around so for I just might as well
put<00:07:26.420> it<00:07:26.450> on<00:07:26.660> so<00:07:27.020> thought<00:07:27.770> the<00:07:27.800> fur<00:07:28.010> collar

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.310 
put it on so thought the fur collar

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.400 
put it on so thought the fur collar
doesn't<00:07:28.550> right<00:07:28.910> to<00:07:29.180> the<00:07:29.300> top<00:07:29.510> so<00:07:29.810> you'll<00:07:29.990> smog

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:30.410 
doesn't right to the top so you'll smog

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.610 
doesn't right to the top so you'll smog
and<00:07:30.590> then<00:07:31.450> this<00:07:32.450> is<00:07:32.630> just<00:07:32.870> what<00:07:33.230> the<00:07:33.350> sleeves

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620 
and then this is just what the sleeves

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.560 
and then this is just what the sleeves
look<00:07:33.740> like<00:07:33.950> at<00:07:34.130> first<00:07:34.340> I<00:07:34.580> wasn't<00:07:35.120> sure<00:07:35.270> about

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:35.570

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.090 
look like at first I wasn't sure about
the<00:07:35.840> sleeves<00:07:36.110> i<00:07:36.320> thought<00:07:36.530> the<00:07:36.620> kinda<00:07:36.980> aiming
