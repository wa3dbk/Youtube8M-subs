tripod look you down here it's from the
specs<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.110> thing<00:01:34.259> what<00:01:34.380> jumped<00:01:34.530> out<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.740> me

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
specs the thing what jumped out to me

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.469 
specs the thing what jumped out to me
the<00:01:34.860> most<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.400> can<00:01:35.490> take<00:01:35.610> up<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.790> one<00:01:36.090> kilo

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the most is it can take up to one kilo

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.120 
the most is it can take up to one kilo
in<00:01:36.600> weight<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.140> for<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> mini<00:01:37.560> tripod<00:01:37.770> that's

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
in weight so for a mini tripod that's

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.819 
in weight so for a mini tripod that's
really<00:01:38.400> good<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.909> can<00:01:39.119> take<00:01:39.590> decent<00:01:40.590> amount

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
really good it can take decent amount

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.649 
really good it can take decent amount
away<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.640> definitely<00:01:41.909> take

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
away and it's going to definitely take

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.340 
away and it's going to definitely take
DSLR<00:01:43.200> cameras<00:01:43.649> also<00:01:44.720> 250<00:01:45.720> gram<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.140> weighs

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
DSLR cameras also 250 gram it weighs

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.710 
DSLR cameras also 250 gram it weighs
itself<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.009> it's<00:01:47.159> not<00:01:47.310> too<00:01:47.460> heavy<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.540> I'm<00:01:48.600> not

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
itself so it's not too heavy so I'm not

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.749 
itself so it's not too heavy so I'm not
sure<00:01:48.780> if<00:01:49.049> I've<00:01:49.140> lost<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.470> manual<00:01:49.860> but<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.460> don't

sure if I've lost the manual but I don't

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.830 
sure if I've lost the manual but I don't
feel<00:01:50.909> really<00:01:51.000> matters<00:01:51.329> I'm<00:01:51.450> sure<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.689> don't

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
feel really matters I'm sure you don't

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.749 
feel really matters I'm sure you don't
really<00:01:51.990> want<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.229> see<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.460> as<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.670> can

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
see here it comes in two pieces we've

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.520 
see here it comes in two pieces we've
got<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.009> tripod<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.880> I'll<00:01:57.390> saw<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.659> head<00:01:57.960> so

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
got the tripod and I'll saw the head so

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.749 
got the tripod and I'll saw the head so
if<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.710> want<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.159> just<00:01:59.369> mount<00:01:59.579> your

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
if you want you can just mount your

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.819 
if you want you can just mount your
camera<00:01:59.790> to<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.420> tripod<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.320> choose<00:02:01.530> to

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
camera to the tripod if you choose to

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.920 
camera to the tripod if you choose to
but<00:02:02.549> I'm<00:02:02.670> sure<00:02:02.820> most<00:02:03.030> people<00:02:03.390> will<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:03.570> using

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
but I'm sure most people will be using

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.630 
but I'm sure most people will be using
it<00:02:04.049> with<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.320> head<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:05.130> let's<00:02:05.250> just<00:02:05.430> attach

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
it with the head so let's just attach

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.119 
it with the head so let's just attach
the<00:02:05.820> head<00:02:05.969> it's<00:02:06.119> pretty<00:02:06.360> simple<00:02:06.799> so<00:02:07.799> I'm<00:02:08.009> not

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
the head it's pretty simple so I'm not

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.559 
the head it's pretty simple so I'm not
hundred<00:02:08.399> percent<00:02:08.610> sure<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.030> do<00:02:09.119> think<00:02:09.450> you

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
hundred percent sure but I do think you

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.330 
hundred percent sure but I do think you
can<00:02:09.720> buy<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.899> head<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.410> its<00:02:10.560> own<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.950> possibly

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
can buy the head on its own and possibly

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.830 
can buy the head on its own and possibly
the<00:02:11.580> tripod<00:02:12.209> on<00:02:12.330> its<00:02:12.450> own

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
the tripod on its own

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.610 
the tripod on its own
sure

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
sure

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.000 
sure
saw<00:02:13.769> that<00:02:13.950> on<00:02:14.010> Amazon<00:02:14.250> Whaleback<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:16.500> really

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
saw that on Amazon Whaleback I really

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.380 
saw that on Amazon Whaleback I really
think<00:02:17.190> if<00:02:17.400> you're<00:02:17.550> going<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.760> buy<00:02:17.879> these<00:02:17.940> you'd

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
think if you're going to buy these you'd

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.910 
think if you're going to buy these you'd
buy<00:02:18.540> them<00:02:18.690> both<00:02:18.870> together<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.379> may<00:02:19.530> as<00:02:19.650> well<00:02:19.680> I

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
buy them both together you may as well I

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.040 
buy them both together you may as well I
think<00:02:20.099> so<00:02:21.030> as<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.239> can<00:02:21.300> see<00:02:21.360> here<00:02:21.720> it's<00:02:21.840> pretty

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
think so as you can see here it's pretty

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.110 
think so as you can see here it's pretty
stable<00:02:22.349> is<00:02:22.769> made<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.129> magnesium<00:02:23.700> it's<00:02:23.849> really

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
stable is made of magnesium it's really

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.250 
stable is made of magnesium it's really
lightweight<00:02:24.300> in<00:02:24.569> fact<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.019> does<00:02:25.110> feel

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
lightweight in fact but it does feel

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.530 
lightweight in fact but it does feel
really<00:02:25.470> strong<00:02:25.950> it's<00:02:26.550> got<00:02:26.700> rubber<00:02:27.090> feet<00:02:27.360> on

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
really strong it's got rubber feet on

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.330 
really strong it's got rubber feet on
the<00:02:27.629> bottom<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.379> legs<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:28.980> does<00:02:29.160> offer

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
the bottom of the legs so it does offer

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.910 
the bottom of the legs so it does offer
good<00:02:29.730> grip<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.209> also<00:02:31.080> it's<00:02:31.620> not<00:02:31.709> going<00:02:31.860> to

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
good grip and also it's not going to

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.350 
good grip and also it's not going to
scratch<00:02:32.190> any<00:02:32.430> services<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:32.940> may<00:02:33.060> put<00:02:33.330> the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
scratch any services you may put the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.600 
scratch any services you may put the
tripod<00:02:33.629> on<00:02:33.959> as<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:34.890> can<00:02:34.950> see<00:02:35.220> here<00:02:35.459> if<00:02:35.549> we

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
tripod on as you can see here if we

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.550 
tripod on as you can see here if we
screw<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.120> we<00:02:36.330> can<00:02:36.480> now<00:02:36.599> adjust<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.260> head

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
screw this we can now adjust the head

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.770 
screw this we can now adjust the head
it'll<00:02:38.250> spin<00:02:38.519> round<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.000> allow<00:02:39.480> us<00:02:39.599> to<00:02:39.629> adjust

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
it'll spin round and allow us to adjust

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.400 
it'll spin round and allow us to adjust
the<00:02:40.349> angle<00:02:41.099> which<00:02:41.519> is<00:02:41.610> nice<00:02:41.930> which<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:43.080> really

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
the angle which is nice which is really

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.740 
the angle which is nice which is really
cool<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:43.799> fact<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.129> you<00:02:44.280> can<00:02:44.459> put<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.000> head

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
cool in fact is you can put the head

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.380 
cool in fact is you can put the head
into<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.260> portrait<00:02:47.010> mode<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:47.849> can<00:02:48.090> shoot

hot<00:02:58.349> shoe<00:02:58.530> mount<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:59.010> should<00:02:59.340> have<00:02:59.430> said<00:02:59.549> cold

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
light into this are microphones things

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.619 
light into this are microphones things
like<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.400> can<00:03:05.519> attach<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.150> which

like that you can attach to this which

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:07.910 
like that you can attach to this which
is<00:03:06.660> really<00:03:06.959> nice<00:03:07.110> it's<00:03:07.410> just<00:03:07.620> kind<00:03:07.829> of<00:03:07.860> a

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
is really nice it's just kind of a

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.089 
is really nice it's just kind of a
standard<00:03:08.129> cold<00:03:08.610> shoe<00:03:08.819> mount<00:03:09.410> I'm<00:03:10.410> also<00:03:10.799> use<00:03:10.950> it

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
standard cold shoe mount I'm also use it

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.100 
standard cold shoe mount I'm also use it
with<00:03:11.250> my<00:03:11.489> camera<00:03:11.819> but<00:03:12.209> occasionally<00:03:12.930> I've

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
with my camera but occasionally I've

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.809 
with my camera but occasionally I've
used<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.530> with<00:03:13.680> microphones<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:14.670> now<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:14.790> just

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
used it with microphones so now I just

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.580 
used it with microphones so now I just
have<00:03:14.940> that<00:03:15.150> versatility<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:16.019> also<00:03:16.290> saves

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
have that versatility and also saves

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.569 
have that versatility and also saves
your<00:03:16.769> going<00:03:16.890> out<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.129> buying<00:03:17.280> different

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
your going out and buying different

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.660 
your going out and buying different
attachments<00:03:18.420> for<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.630> head<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.680> let's<00:03:20.400> detach

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
attachments for the head so let's detach

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.370 
attachments for the head so let's detach
a<00:03:20.819> camera<00:03:21.150> we'll<00:03:21.359> may<00:03:21.480> as<00:03:21.540> well<00:03:21.720> go<00:03:22.170> for<00:03:22.200> the

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
a camera we'll may as well go for the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.170 
a camera we'll may as well go for the
DSLR<00:03:22.920> camera<00:03:23.310> because<00:03:23.639> this<00:03:23.730> will<00:03:23.910> really

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
DSLR camera because this will really

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.420 
DSLR camera because this will really
test<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.540> out<00:03:24.680> so<00:03:25.680> it's<00:03:25.859> pretty<00:03:26.010> easy<00:03:26.130> to

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
test it out so it's pretty easy to

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.490 
test it out so it's pretty easy to
attach<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.269> camera<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:27.989> with<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.350> being<00:03:28.380> a

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
attach to the camera and with it being a

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.170 
attach to the camera and with it being a
small<00:03:28.739> tripod<00:03:28.980> it's<00:03:29.639> actually<00:03:29.910> really<00:03:30.060> easy

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
small tripod it's actually really easy

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.960 
small tripod it's actually really easy
and<00:03:30.450> quick<00:03:30.599> which<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.380> nice<00:03:31.590> as<00:03:32.549> you<00:03:32.639> can<00:03:32.670> see

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
and quick which is nice as you can see

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.650 
and quick which is nice as you can see
that<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:35.340> cameras<00:03:35.670> are<00:03:35.760> now<00:03:35.910> ready<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.450> start

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
that the cameras are now ready to start

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.849 
that the cameras are now ready to start
recording<00:03:37.290> video<00:03:37.560> or<00:03:37.859> taking<00:03:38.250> photos<00:03:38.639> so<00:03:39.859> and

make sure you always have the head

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.330 
make sure you always have the head
tightened<00:03:42.690> up<00:03:42.810> so<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:43.230> camera<00:03:43.680> can't<00:03:43.859> move<00:03:44.040> so

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
tightened up so it camera can't move so

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.920 
tightened up so it camera can't move so
one<00:03:44.940> thing<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.150> do<00:03:45.239> like<00:03:45.359> about<00:03:45.419> this<00:03:45.690> mini

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
one thing I do like about this mini

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.780 
one thing I do like about this mini
tripod<00:03:46.139> is<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:46.769> can<00:03:46.919> put<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.250> camera<00:03:47.549> into

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
tripod is you can put the camera into

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.180 
tripod is you can put the camera into
portrait<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:49.139> as<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:49.769> can<00:03:49.859> see<00:03:50.010> if<00:03:50.099> you're

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
portrait so as you can see if you're

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.920 
portrait so as you can see if you're
going<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.370> shoot<00:03:50.519> some<00:03:50.730> portrait<00:03:51.150> photos<00:03:51.690> you

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
going to shoot some portrait photos you

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.449 
going to shoot some portrait photos you
can<00:03:52.139> do<00:03:52.290> with<00:03:52.500> this<00:03:52.560> tripod<00:03:52.980> which<00:03:53.130> is<00:03:53.280> nice

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
can do with this tripod which is nice

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.550 
can do with this tripod which is nice
and<00:03:54.120> but<00:03:54.329> like<00:03:54.419> many<00:03:54.569> tripods<00:03:55.109> do<00:03:55.319> have<00:03:55.470> this

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
and but like many tripods do have this

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.069 
and but like many tripods do have this
kind<00:03:55.919> of<00:03:55.980> feature<00:03:56.190> but<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.180> think<00:03:57.569> most<00:03:57.780> remote

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
kind of feature but I think most remote

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.020 
kind of feature but I think most remote
way<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.290> take<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.799> weight<00:03:58.980> of<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.250> DSLR<00:03:59.639> camera

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
way to take the weight of a DSLR camera

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.460 
way to take the weight of a DSLR camera
because<00:04:00.239> it<00:04:00.359> does<00:04:00.510> kind<00:04:01.049> of<00:04:01.109> pulling<00:04:01.380> the

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
because it does kind of pulling the

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.199 
because it does kind of pulling the
tripod<00:04:01.889> at<00:04:02.099> one<00:04:02.280> side<00:04:02.549> meaning<00:04:02.849> it's<00:04:03.060> more

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
tripod at one side meaning it's more

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.220 
tripod at one side meaning it's more
like<00:04:03.419> licking<00:04:03.630> a<00:04:03.720> tip<00:04:03.959> and<00:04:04.650> but<00:04:04.829> with<00:04:04.950> this

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
like licking a tip and but with this

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.190 
like licking a tip and but with this
tripod<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.440> can<00:04:07.590> manage<00:04:07.799> that<00:04:07.950> quite<00:04:08.280> well<00:04:08.310> I

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
tripod it can manage that quite well I

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.270 
tripod it can manage that quite well I
think<00:04:10.200> reason<00:04:10.590> it<00:04:10.680> can<00:04:10.769> manage<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.069> pretty

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
think reason it can manage that pretty

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.550 
think reason it can manage that pretty
well<00:04:11.459> is<00:04:11.669> it's<00:04:11.849> quite<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.090> low<00:04:12.450> down<00:04:12.660> tripod<00:04:13.290> and

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
well is it's quite a low down tripod and

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.039 
well is it's quite a low down tripod and
also<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.250> legs<00:04:14.459> spread<00:04:15.000> out<00:04:15.120> pretty<00:04:15.150> fast<00:04:15.690> so

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
also the legs spread out pretty fast so

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.409 
also the legs spread out pretty fast so
you<00:04:16.139> can<00:04:16.410> do<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.709> which<00:04:17.190> is<00:04:17.340> good<00:04:17.549> so<00:04:18.180> here<00:04:18.329> we

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
you can do that which is good so here we

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.649 
you can do that which is good so here we
have<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.630> fujifilm<00:04:19.169> x100t

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
have the fujifilm x100t

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.480 
have the fujifilm x100t
mini<00:04:22.109> tripod<00:04:22.530> if<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:22.770> could<00:04:22.890> give<00:04:22.979> you<00:04:23.070> a<00:04:23.130> candle

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
mini tripod if I could give you a candle

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.279 
mini tripod if I could give you a candle
look<00:04:23.580> how<00:04:23.760> it<00:04:23.880> looks<00:04:23.909> with<00:04:24.599> a<00:04:24.630> different<00:04:24.990> style

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
look how it looks with a different style

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.410 
look how it looks with a different style
of<00:04:25.440> camera<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:26.159> this<00:04:26.430> is<00:04:26.550> very<00:04:26.700> similar<00:04:27.030> size

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
of camera and this is very similar size

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.390 
of camera and this is very similar size
to<00:04:27.510> a<00:04:27.540> compact<00:04:27.960> system<00:04:28.200> camera<00:04:28.740> a<00:04:28.890> little<00:04:29.280> bit

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
to a compact system camera a little bit

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.040 
to a compact system camera a little bit
bigger<00:04:29.580> than<00:04:29.730> a<00:04:29.790> compact<00:04:30.180> camera<00:04:30.330> and<00:04:30.960> it

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
bigger than a compact camera and it

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.620 
bigger than a compact camera and it
works<00:04:31.260> pretty<00:04:31.470> well<00:04:31.670> as<00:04:32.670> you<00:04:32.940> can<00:04:33.090> see<00:04:33.300> in<00:04:33.480> fact

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
works pretty well as you can see in fact
