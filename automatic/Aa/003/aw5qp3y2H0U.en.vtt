00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.280
 Yes! It seems to me that. I dunno. It seems to me that since 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.920
 I still feel a nice energy here there is a good heat 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.440
 But it's quiet, there's not just music here We want to hear you 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.920
 More than that! 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.120
 It's starting to look like that 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.080
 It is still today that I want to decontaminate, the exploited of the Quarter 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.960
 Ready to take shots and try to fantasize the girl who 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.640
 locked his door Respect mine who think about us 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.400
 And she who is still at the rendezvous 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.680
 I redid it twice this text My life I feel much more complex 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.400
 Always the same old reflexes, the same desires and less and less ... 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.000
 You understand me if you follow me from the beginning I disregard you if you mass my back 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.200
 If you ever erase my number 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.120
 There will always be a chance to enter incognito And then, who knows where the elevation can lead? 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.800
 Just ask the next room 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.520
 She is still excited. Finally, here is a small summary. No panic! 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.840
 We will never become thirsty for frics And will always criticize polluters of music waves 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.080
 With words instead of a rhythmic marketing 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.520
 Nothing has changed when will we finally evolve? You're still complaining, you're protecting your comfort, 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.480
 you agree, you do not have to make any effort Nothing has changed when will we finally rise? 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.720
 You still complain, you protect your comfort, you agree, you do not have to make any effort 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.920
 Inertia receives praise without interruption No one is able to give congratulations 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.320
 Not having an opinion is the real evolution We agree with you 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.560
 The world rolls on corruption Yet you only speak when your friends 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.460
 have the back turned But luckily, we can appreciate that nothing has changed 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.920
 You like every minute to protest 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.960
 Against the same gestures that every day you are asked 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.920
 In meeting you are concerned about pollution After you go back quickly with your SUV at home 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.160
 Proud thirty-something representative of your time 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.560
 The successes of your career are the only stories you conjure up 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.040
 You're majestic in your new ventriloquist role 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.640
 You speak with hidden words but we do not care 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.000
 A conscience as deep as a mountain Your mind wanders but all your thoughts stagnate 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.480
 Nothing has changed when will we finally evolve? You're still complaining, you're protecting your comfort, 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:40.440
 you agree, you do not have to make any effort Nothing has changed when will we finally rise? 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.680
 You still complain, you protect your comfort, you agree, you do not have to make any effort 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.920
 You act as if you owe everything, as if you always knew 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.000
 The consequences of your actions laid bare In the end you are not even disappointed, confess! 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.400
 Your intentions even for you seem blurred 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.960
 Despite the adversity if you are the example I just mentioned 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.840
 I'm saying nothing has changed here over there and in our city 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.320
 Not far from being misquoted or blind 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.200
 We live in a society unconscious assisted Do not ask too many questions (no) 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.960
 As for the elections do you trust others to make an opinion 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.360
 For you the world seems to turn around your navel 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.760
 Under your tie and your coat there you feel safe 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.200
 Always the same barriers, and even more than yesterday 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.520
 Need to brew ideas and not throw the first stone 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.800
 The egoism of some may leave traces 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.000
 Behind the masks they wear is a two-faced face 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.640
 Nothing has changed when will we finally evolve? You're still complaining, you're protecting your comfort, 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:40.320
 you agree, you do not have to make any effort Nothing has changed when will we finally rise? 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.640
 You still complain, you protect your comfort, you agree, you do not have to make any effort 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:52.560
 Nothing has changed when will we finally evolve? You're still complaining, you're protecting your comfort, 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:00.400
 you agree, you do not have to make any effort Nothing has changed when will we finally rise? 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.120
 You still complain, you protect your comfort, you agree, you do not have to make any effort 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:21.840
 Rise Nothing has changed
