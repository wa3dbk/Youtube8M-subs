00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:48.230
 I will hide what we see in this parcel 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.230
 we see just such a box 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:09.150
 cork 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:13.630
 which is written to see here that we 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:18.630

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.630
 . here you go 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:33.319

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:44.119
 consider 114 4 inside with us like this 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:50.409
 here is packed toilet paper here 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:54.130
 such a handsome one 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.130
 such a handsome man 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:12.850
 such 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:15.850
 here is a knife here it is written bait a knight 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.850
 start 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:26.750
 65 x 13 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:29.590
 but what do I want to say hand knife so not 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.590
 sits badly 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.290
 let's see how much it weighs 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:52.420
 honestly played it all weighs 180 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:03:00.980
 gram length 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:06.920
 length with night length with night 9 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:19.569
 centimeters cutting edge length as well 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:19.569
 almost 98 and 3 blade thickness 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:31.129
 blade thickness 3 mm well if so 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:35.299
 view to supply overnight 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:42.069
 but generally not centered not at all 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:42.069
 center now here a second 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:04:06.620
 But at night, it's not centered at all, but how 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:09.970
 I don't know, but not the lock either 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:16.820
 locks up here we see that lock 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:19.519
 just doesn't close well I don't know 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.790
 even strong gone to and well just this 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.790
 liner 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.460
 I don't know the liner 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.460
 I will try to highlight the flashlight 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:41.050
 then the blade itself he can see where 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:48.639
 the liner comes above the blade 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:48.639
 but it is certainly very, very unpleasant 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:05:00.979
 then nothing to do with them only 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:05.990
 disassemble and but I do not know something 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:09.260
 coming up now I will bring the sharpness you 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.840
 see just you see see that 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:16.310
 liner 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:20.950
 just well, somewhere in millimeter 3 comes out 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:30.169
 for the end of plenochka the end of this heel 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:32.210
 it's certainly frustrating that unpleasant 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:38.570
 it can be said here apparently visibly yet 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:40.460
 such here is the distance between the dies then 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.639
 there is a knife in itself he of course 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.630
 Looks like that and cho beautiful let's 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.630
 check sharpening 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:53.690
 more or less. more or less but of course 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:59.180
 of course this thing is that he is not 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:04.970
 it closes well, it's just really and 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:09.050
 very very very not happy but so in 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:16.240
 basically basically everything is done more 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:16.240
 less face rigidly dies mikarta 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.040
 done pretty well 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:37.660
 the only thing that of course is this 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:40.750
 here's the thing but I don't know what to say 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:45.920
 I'll try to fix it. I will of course contact me. 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:53.960
 the seller here is something like this 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:59.480
 here is such a knife for now everyone 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:04.360
