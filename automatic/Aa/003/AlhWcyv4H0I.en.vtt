00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
pulling the bead back slightly dribbling

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.800 
pulling the bead back slightly dribbling
it<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.440> all<00:03:02.430> long<00:03:02.820> bead<00:03:03.120> all<00:03:03.390> around<00:03:03.690> the

outside like this stuff doesn't take a

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:15.650 
outside like this stuff doesn't take a
lot<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.520> seal<00:03:09.510> anything<00:03:13.910> yep<00:03:14.940> all<00:03:15.299> wrong<00:03:15.540> the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
lot to seal anything yep all wrong the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.250 
lot to seal anything yep all wrong the
outside<00:03:15.930> you're<00:03:16.260> done<00:03:17.090> before<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.269> dries<00:03:18.540> see

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
outside you're done before it dries see

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.539 
outside you're done before it dries see
if<00:03:19.350> I<00:03:19.440> can<00:03:19.530> get<00:03:19.620> my<00:03:19.769> rock<00:03:21.049> yeah<00:03:22.080> just<00:03:22.470> wipe<00:03:23.400> the

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
if I can get my rock yeah just wipe the

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.330 
if I can get my rock yeah just wipe the
excess<00:03:23.670> off<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.180> rim<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.690> tire<00:03:24.750> just<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.340> make

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
excess off the rim and tire just to make

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.940 
excess off the rim and tire just to make
it<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.519> little<00:03:26.610> look<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.239> little<00:03:27.420> nicer<00:03:27.600> now

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
it a little look a little nicer now

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.910 
it a little look a little nicer now
let's<00:03:28.950> see<00:03:29.489> more<00:03:29.910> knots<00:03:30.350> yeah<00:03:31.350> maybe<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.799> little

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
let's see more knots yeah maybe a little

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.280 
let's see more knots yeah maybe a little
bit<00:03:32.190> there<00:03:32.580> we<00:03:32.640> go<00:03:34.430> nice<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.489> shiny<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.290> I

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
bit there we go nice and shiny and I

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.080 
bit there we go nice and shiny and I
guess<00:03:38.100> it's<00:03:38.280> pretty<00:03:38.430> much<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.730> same<00:03:38.850> on<00:03:38.910> the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
guess it's pretty much the same on the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.350 
guess it's pretty much the same on the
other<00:03:39.150> side

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:59.660 

all<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.780> way<00:03:45.930> around

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.430 

there<00:04:00.240> we<00:04:00.390> go<00:04:01.610> and<00:04:02.610> again<00:04:03.180> before<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.810> dries<00:04:04.020> oh

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
there we go and again before it dries oh

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.170 
there we go and again before it dries oh
it<00:04:05.069> doesn't<00:04:05.310> take<00:04:05.580> very<00:04:05.850> long<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.569> dry<00:04:07.080> at<00:04:07.290> all

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
it doesn't take very long to dry at all

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.000 
it doesn't take very long to dry at all
this<00:04:09.180> stuff

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
this stuff

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.490 
this stuff
get<00:04:11.010> me<00:04:11.160> excess<00:04:11.520> off<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.730> ramen<00:04:12.240> make<00:04:13.110> it<00:04:13.230> look<00:04:13.380> a

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
get me excess off a ramen make it look a

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.500 
get me excess off a ramen make it look a
little<00:04:13.620> nicer<00:04:15.380> no<00:04:16.380> no<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:16.829> I<00:04:17.090> guess<00:04:18.090> that's<00:04:18.269> my

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
little nicer no no and I guess that's my

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.600 
little nicer no no and I guess that's my
I<00:04:20.120> know<00:04:21.120> simplified<00:04:21.660> cheaper<00:04:22.350> add-on<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:22.800> way

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
I know simplified cheaper add-on a way

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.930 
I know simplified cheaper add-on a way
of<00:04:23.790> trying<00:04:24.390> to<00:04:24.480> make<00:04:24.600> air<00:04:24.780> filled<00:04:25.020> tires<00:04:25.940> yeah

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
of trying to make air filled tires yeah

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:36.290 
of trying to make air filled tires yeah
like<00:04:27.300> this<00:04:27.480> is<00:04:27.540> what<00:04:27.840> I<00:04:27.870> did<00:04:32.270> yeah<00:04:34.070> so<00:04:35.070> I<00:04:35.340> don't

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
like this is what I did yeah so I don't

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.900 
like this is what I did yeah so I don't
know<00:04:36.419> how<00:04:36.630> he's<00:04:37.050> gonna<00:04:37.260> perform<00:04:37.470> I<00:04:37.950> know<00:04:38.640> I<00:04:38.669> saw

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
know how he's gonna perform I know I saw

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:39.500 
know how he's gonna perform I know I saw
her

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
her

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.740 
her
medics<00:04:39.990> video<00:04:40.320> of<00:04:40.740> his<00:04:41.130> or<00:04:41.820> his<00:04:42.030> two<00:04:42.210> videos<00:04:42.540> of

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
medics video of his or his two videos of

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.460 
medics video of his or his two videos of
his<00:04:42.900> Cherokee<00:04:43.860> beasts<00:04:44.220> and<00:04:45.050> they<00:04:46.050> look<00:04:46.260> cool

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
his Cherokee beasts and they look cool

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.210 
his Cherokee beasts and they look cool
anyway<00:04:46.890> when<00:04:47.070> it<00:04:47.190> was<00:04:47.280> crawling<00:04:47.610> over<00:04:47.700> rocks

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
anyway when it was crawling over rocks

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.960 
anyway when it was crawling over rocks
so<00:04:50.220> I<00:04:50.630> know<00:04:51.630> I<00:04:52.080> guess<00:04:52.440> we'll<00:04:52.640> see<00:04:53.640> how<00:04:53.700> it<00:04:53.760> works

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
so I know I guess we'll see how it works

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.480 
so I know I guess we'll see how it works
one<00:04:54.780> thing<00:04:54.990> I<00:04:55.110> think<00:04:55.560> I'm<00:04:55.740> gonna<00:04:55.890> do<00:04:56.130> is<00:04:56.280> if

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
one thing I think I'm gonna do is if

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.980 
one thing I think I'm gonna do is if
they<00:04:56.640> feel<00:04:56.850> too<00:04:57.090> low<00:04:57.330> pressure

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
they feel too low pressure

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.800 
they feel too low pressure
I<00:04:58.160> have<00:04:59.160> hypothermic<00:04:59.669> needles<00:05:00.150> and<00:05:00.540> what<00:05:00.690> I'll

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
I have hypothermic needles and what I'll

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.530 
I have hypothermic needles and what I'll
do<00:05:00.990> is<00:05:01.140> I'll<00:05:01.290> just<00:05:01.470> inject<00:05:01.890> ya<00:05:02.760> with<00:05:03.060> more<00:05:03.360> time

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
do is I'll just inject ya with more time

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.360 
do is I'll just inject ya with more time
like<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.110> would<00:05:04.229> inflate<00:05:04.740> your<00:05:04.860> ties<00:05:05.040> a<00:05:05.070> home

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
like you would inflate your ties a home

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.140 
like you would inflate your ties a home
on<00:05:05.580> your<00:05:05.729> vehicle<00:05:06.860> so<00:05:07.860> I<00:05:08.100> guess<00:05:08.700> we'll<00:05:08.880> see

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
on your vehicle so I guess we'll see

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.570 
on your vehicle so I guess we'll see
some<00:05:09.300> experimenting<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.340> lighting<00:05:11.340> on<00:05:11.460> my

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
some experimenting and lighting on my

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.790 
some experimenting and lighting on my
results<00:05:12.000> thanks<00:05:12.840> guys<00:05:13.020> for<00:05:13.050> watching<00:05:13.290> hope

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
results thanks guys for watching hope

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.880 
results thanks guys for watching hope
you<00:05:14.220> have<00:05:14.400> a<00:05:14.460> good<00:05:14.640> night
