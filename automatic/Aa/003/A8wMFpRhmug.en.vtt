 more we are here in gta 5 online friends 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.529
 if we meet here in what comes 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.020
 being a piece of click to be able to 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.730
 drive inside the garages ok good 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.160
 simply what we need is a 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.260
 garage 1 bicycle and we will do the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.699
 trick in the garage 2 ok 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.199
 Well, here I am with my partner 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.790
 nexgen and miguel 120 good and this trick 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.519
 it was difficult for us to decipher what 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.680
 we decipher with the merits are of a 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.629
 youtuber but we have deciphered it with my 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.730
 mate as black ok ok well 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.620
 we just take a bike out of the garage 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.199
 1 and we have to address what is coming 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.539
 being to the garage 2 ok the garage 2 has 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.660
 to be full I recommend it 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.289
 have a lg or a street vehicle 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.719
 ok since the bike will stay on us 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.579
 in the vehicle position that we call 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.309
 then ok well then simply 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.440
 we have to catch and go with the bike 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.929
 we go with the bike to the garage and this 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.850
 it only serves more in Orient not what 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:13.430

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.110

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.100

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.410

 Garage does not leave the alert and our friend 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.820

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.899
 your partner that they killed good 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.880
 that the one that has killed them that drives us away 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.890
 from the area where we move away from the garage 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.450
 well said ok ok well simply a 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.400
 once we have moved away to be able 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.330
 call the mechanic let's call the 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.100
 mechanic 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.920
 and we are going to request a vehicle from where 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.480
 we tried to enter with the bike ok 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.730

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.640
 vehicle here comes the eye trick here 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.140
 you have to call an LG or a vehicle 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.270
 the street or that I recommend you 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.820
 according to a law or a street vehicle 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.820
 ok good since I have done it with this 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.380
 vehicle because this vehicle I already 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.210
 I have a duplicate and this vehicle does not 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.010
 I could sell it type just for

 to get rid of him I've done it with this 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.490
 with this vehicle ok but I would 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.580
 I recommend that it be a vehicle of the 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.590
 street or a lg since they are free because 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.450

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.209
