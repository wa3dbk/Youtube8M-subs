00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.550 

very<00:03:58.549> the<00:03:59.549> it's<00:04:00.420> got<00:04:00.569> that<00:04:00.689> rosewood<00:04:01.200> back<00:04:01.319> on

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.350 
very the it's got that rosewood back on
it<00:04:01.680> so<00:04:01.769> it's<00:04:01.890> this<00:04:02.129> spectrum<00:04:02.579> is<00:04:02.670> quite<00:04:02.970> large

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
it so it's this spectrum is quite large

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.809 
it so it's this spectrum is quite large
but<00:04:04.170> that<00:04:04.349> three-piece<00:04:04.920> back<00:04:05.220> what<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:05.610> does

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
but that three-piece back what it does

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.759 
but that three-piece back what it does
is<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.299> allows<00:04:06.480> gives<00:04:06.870> a<00:04:06.959> slightly<00:04:07.260> for<00:04:07.590> down

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
is it allows gives a slightly for down

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.770 
is it allows gives a slightly for down
feel<00:04:08.640> to<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.390> sound<00:04:09.659> and<00:04:09.930> balancing<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.739> that

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
feel to the sound and balancing of that

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.759 
feel to the sound and balancing of that
rather<00:04:12.780> than<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:13.049> one-piece<00:04:13.409> or<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.620> two-piece

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
rather than a one-piece or a two-piece

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.509 
rather than a one-piece or a two-piece
back
