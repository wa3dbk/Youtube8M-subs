00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.910 
it came with these uh brownish places
that<00:01:54.659> matched<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.140> soft<00:01:55.380> liner<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
that matched the soft liner and the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.490 
that matched the soft liner and the
outsole<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.719> I'm<00:01:57.719> not<00:01:57.869> sure<00:01:58.049> how<00:01:58.200> I'm<00:01:58.290> going<00:01:58.409> to

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
outsole so I'm not sure how I'm going to

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.090 
outsole so I'm not sure how I'm going to
where<00:01:58.680> they<00:01:58.829> shoot<00:01:59.420> what<00:02:00.420> laces<00:02:00.840> might<00:02:01.710> go<00:02:01.890> d

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
where they shoot what laces might go d

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.280 
where they shoot what laces might go d
green<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.579> i<00:02:02.610> think<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.840> coppers

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
green but i think the just coppers

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.350 
green but i think the just coppers
whatever<00:02:04.770> color<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.189> breaks<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.210> up<00:02:06.270> a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
whatever color that is breaks it up a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.609 
whatever color that is breaks it up a
little<00:02:06.450> bit<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.719> know<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.190> it's<00:02:08.190> not<00:02:08.310> so

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
little bit you know so it's not so

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.070 
little bit you know so it's not so
screen<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.060> being<00:02:10.060> tomorrow<00:02:10.420> is<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.899> same

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
screen and being tomorrow is the same

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.509 
screen and being tomorrow is the same
flesh<00:02:11.290> they<00:02:11.530> pray<00:02:11.739> in<00:02:11.860> Dallas<00:02:12.190> I'll<00:02:12.340> probably

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
flesh they pray in Dallas I'll probably

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.250 
flesh they pray in Dallas I'll probably
wear<00:02:12.819> with<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.239> green<00:02:13.450> but<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:13.989> know<00:02:14.110> we'll

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
wear with the green but you know we'll

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.770 
wear with the green but you know we'll
see<00:02:14.409> how<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.650> goes<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:16.180> then<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.480> reason<00:02:16.720> I

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
see how that goes and then the reason I

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.350 
see how that goes and then the reason I
picked<00:02:16.959> up<00:02:17.110> two<00:02:17.319> pair<00:02:17.590> is<00:02:17.860> because<00:02:18.370> on<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:19.209> sea

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
picked up two pair is because on the sea

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.990 
picked up two pair is because on the sea
grass<00:02:19.540> green<00:02:19.840> color<00:02:20.080> way<00:02:20.819> eventually<00:02:21.819> it'll

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
grass green color way eventually it'll

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.979 
grass green color way eventually it'll
rub<00:02:22.330> off<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.870> it'll<00:02:23.319> be<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.680> copper<00:02:24.989> underneath

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
rub off and it'll be a copper underneath

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.539 
rub off and it'll be a copper underneath
so<00:02:26.200> I'm<00:02:26.319> actually<00:02:26.470> going<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.829> scuff<00:02:27.069> it<00:02:27.190> up<00:02:27.310> and

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549
