00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:13.599
 and I have today 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.800
 electronic music that you've been 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.550
 we will show how those who use technology to animate the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.550
 weekend parties 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.800
 stay with us and Friday, November 27th 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.849
 leme sp 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.849
 it is in the air 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.280
 soon to the sports information also has music the mission 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.560
 of the range 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.970
 that's right you know we understand that entered the field in the next block 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.219
 has the details of this musical style 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.219
 and gains more and more space as the state parliament 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.340
 the mst wants to carry 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.340
 - it's a partnership partnership devastating in the city a good ten meters 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.450
 however the head of the rapaziada 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.700
 a song created through the use of electronic instruments equipment 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.680
 Let's hear the heart live. 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.690
 But before something happens, something is wrong. 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.270
 but I will not ask you a question from the lawyer on the afternoon of Monday 03 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.580
 technical expertise and tactically abav assessor for those 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.910
 people worked on radio mech to make an apartation enjoyment there 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.490
 Now I have to say that you work with 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.850
 clips on intel 11 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.799
 Who are you going to explain very well to us here? 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.640
 I'm coming here at the residence. 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.380
 which made it difficult to have the charge for having done something that depends on it 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.030
 a little 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.600
 we said that electronic music produced 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.100
 by means of instruments electronic equipment 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.670
 but keita mention these our our asking gift 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.430
 so today the staff 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.550
 produces music primarily on the computer 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.700
 using 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.240
 merz midi controllers very bad 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.450
 So people say she 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.210
 the local team that produces electronic music is not aware 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.070
 it is true most of the shots moss that produces electronic music formed 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.000
 in music 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.200
 so are rich in a very great notion twenty years of electronic music 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.330
 it's not something that came up 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.220
 yesterday né 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.500
 akihito used the same the primordial ne 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.440
 are techniques 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.480
 if touched says that the committee that sheds control controls 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.290
 a sound card that acts as a transmitter between a turntable 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.970
 and to the music that is on the computer then any music that I put 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.099
 my computer and the control 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.070
 at this stage 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.070
 so the girl because the staff has a house 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:54.079
 very nice explained that we are seeing here 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.159
 the next one appears in the images in the external screen by the mec 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.689
 in electronic music is essential also follows 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.870
 video clips, actually two years ago, practically 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:07.939
 it's impossible for you to make a good sesc sentence to see a good music party 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:08.840
 electronic cent 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.829
 is a very visual audio was very formed and accompanying the music 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.919
 so the new technology board I've been doing this for a year ah 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.819
 working with video cd with audio at the same time if can be people 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:28.009
 people for then it's time is something that adds more to the party that makes 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:32.089
 that the public participates because in addition to public traveler where he does not see the 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:35.479
 So what are you doing with the possibility of the video? 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:39.049
 arriving more getting closer to the didi sound booth 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.900
 this year's critical expenditure is a sixth person who does what 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.289
 would you like 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:48.289
 for 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.889
 all 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:14.089
 after andré 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:15.970
 We'll talk a little bit later 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.920
 sometimes we have to make it prevail 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.920
 we went back to the studio 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.160
 would now return to the pivot compared to April 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.779
 I want to predict that being here and electronic music program 

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:32.309
 it's true a good picture fight the two have conquered more and more space 

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:35.080
 to electronic music more and more here in the state 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.580
 will start here with the engadget site 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.039
 Miguel who also plays in Corumbá 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.969
 andré counts for us got another style are various styles of music 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:44.789
 electronics in which with his style 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.520
 the former pilot athletes also here the current senator to the cinema behind 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.529
 no duck cavalera people end up changing everything right 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:55.050
 this style is that nothing practitioner of the games how it works for 

00:04:55.049 --> 00:04:56.570
 see that this is not selective 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.729
 and chelsea 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.469
 even injured he became by castro electronic decapitate marcela 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.860
 electronics that gets a little more aggressive 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.759
 it is as if they are not properly 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:07.860
 plural 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.860
 to the sea 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.199
 it's not uncommon 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.099
 O 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:20.729
 when I want with god 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.729
 own prosecutor Pedro Barbosa 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:28.379
 So far we'll have time to get organized said colleagues psd but 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:29.760
 there is certainly much discussion 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.920
 we extend chalk in the heads of the people nor have as a piece together but at the 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.530
 otherwise it ends up uniting a lot of people who gather full parties in the 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.770
 I think I agree with you because I think I showed it to him. 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:41.650
 dancing 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.620
 the chance hypothesis that make that in that area meters away 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.180
 sticking to the party of electronic pet music since the experience 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.150
 import meat music and each time is more updated previous note the port 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.539
 had said that his friend 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.099
 I speak here to understand electronic music that understands music in 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:00.639
 difficult time 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.440
 what kucharek was you 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.730
 the capex that only plays of soca that is why he understands that research is a 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.110
 clear picture the tiles that will now pass through the terminal 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:14.069
 to play what you learned on the dance floor is the fake hot talk that we go along with 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.460
 the pope 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.180
 the cup 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:38.389
 4 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:41.119
 when she hinted that the great news 

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:44.210
 if music makes you friends rejection friends 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.029
 so I thought I'll tell the newspaper that I'm going to call him 

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.900
 wheat 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.680
 What a Friend 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.909
 companion that of andré's profession 

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:53.459
 To attack a little bit, the two of us are going to play together. 

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:56.459
 show so much action ten people also go there 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:01.789
 ae 

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:26.460
 It was in this party mood 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.729
 psd is getting 

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:31.729
 despite growing last weekend 

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:12.309
 muriaé miner in the southern thicket of the river - I imagine
