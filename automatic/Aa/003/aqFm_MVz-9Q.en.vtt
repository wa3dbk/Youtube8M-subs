what's<00:00:00.630> up<00:00:00.719> Godsey<00:00:00.989> they're<00:00:01.110> going<00:00:01.290> to<00:00:01.350> be

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
what's up Godsey they're going to be

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.350 
what's up Godsey they're going to be
rounding<00:00:01.770> up<00:00:01.890> some<00:00:02.070> of<00:00:02.190> the<00:00:02.280> top<00:00:02.550> five<00:00:02.790> coolest

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
rounding up some of the top five coolest

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.510 
rounding up some of the top five coolest
tech<00:00:03.600> going<00:00:03.959> on<00:00:04.080> so<00:00:04.950> let's<00:00:05.130> go<00:00:05.190> ahead<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.339> get

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
tech going on so let's go ahead and get

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.150 
tech going on so let's go ahead and get
started<00:00:05.609> so<00:00:06.540> one<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.319> first<00:00:07.350> things<00:00:07.770> is

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
started so one of the first things is

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.700 
started so one of the first things is
like<00:00:08.220> six<00:00:08.730> in<00:00:08.880> their<00:00:09.420> hover<00:00:09.660> board<00:00:10.019> prototype

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
like six in their hover board prototype

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.539 
like six in their hover board prototype
yes<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.340> said<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:12.110> functional<00:00:13.219> hoverboard<00:00:14.219> so

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
yes I said a functional hoverboard so

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.700 
yes I said a functional hoverboard so
they<00:00:15.210> only<00:00:15.360> showed<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> little<00:00:15.929> teaser<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.470> it

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
they only showed a little teaser of it

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.620 
they only showed a little teaser of it
but<00:00:16.920> pretty<00:00:17.340> much<00:00:17.609> how<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:17.910> thing<00:00:18.119> works<00:00:18.150> is

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
but pretty much how this thing works is

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.779 
but pretty much how this thing works is
the<00:00:18.750> board<00:00:18.960> uses<00:00:19.350> liquid<00:00:19.920> nitrogen<00:00:20.400> cooled

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
the board uses liquid nitrogen cooled

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.150 
the board uses liquid nitrogen cooled
semiconductors<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.720> magnets<00:00:22.410> according<00:00:23.070> to

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
semiconductors and magnets according to

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.009 
semiconductors and magnets according to
the<00:00:23.310> Alexis<00:00:23.699> website<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.630> apparently

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
the Alexis website so it's apparently

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.170 
the Alexis website so it's apparently
inspired<00:00:25.320> by<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.800> Back<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.400> Future<00:00:26.490> movie

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
inspired by the Back to the Future movie

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.710 
inspired by the Back to the Future movie
about<00:00:27.630> 30<00:00:27.960> years<00:00:28.289> ago<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:29.490> know<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.849> I'm

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
about 30 years ago so you know I I'm

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.290 
about 30 years ago so you know I I'm
excited<00:00:31.199> about<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.439> but<00:00:31.859> they<00:00:32.610> don't<00:00:32.880> tease<00:00:33.120> it

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
excited about a but they don't tease it

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.700 
excited about a but they don't tease it
you<00:00:33.510> don't<00:00:33.660> get<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.899> see<00:00:34.050> somebody<00:00:34.410> actually

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
you don't get to see somebody actually

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.229 
you don't get to see somebody actually
writing<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.309> until<00:00:35.640> i<00:00:35.670> see<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.880> somebody

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
writing is so until i see you somebody

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.420 
writing is so until i see you somebody
writing<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.690> I'm<00:00:37.050> not<00:00:37.410> too<00:00:37.800> excited<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.280> I

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
writing this I'm not too excited but I

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.190 
writing this I'm not too excited but I
am<00:00:38.640> pretty<00:00:38.910> excited<00:00:39.090> we're<00:00:39.719> opposed<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.079> be

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
am pretty excited we're opposed to be

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.930 
am pretty excited we're opposed to be
getting<00:00:40.410> more<00:00:40.590> information<00:00:40.710> down<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.790> road

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
getting more information down the road

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.500 
getting more information down the road
around<00:00:42.290> October<00:00:43.290> 21st<00:00:43.829> 2015<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.030> really

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
around October 21st 2015 so really

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.389 
around October 21st 2015 so really
excited<00:00:45.870> for<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.770> coming<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.219> at<00:00:47.280> number

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
excited for that so coming in at number

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.130 
excited for that so coming in at number
four<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.879> they<00:00:48.030> got<00:00:48.239> smartphones<00:00:48.899> in

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
four is they got smartphones in

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.900 
four is they got smartphones in
development<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.829> 10,000<00:00:50.489> milliamp<00:00:50.879> battery

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
development with 10,000 milliamp battery

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.720 
development with 10,000 milliamp battery
so<00:00:51.510> these<00:00:52.289> damn<00:00:52.590> smart<00:00:52.980> phones<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:53.550> been

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
so these damn smart phones have been

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.209 
so these damn smart phones have been
lacking<00:00:54.030> innovations<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:55.530> batteries<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
lacking innovations with batteries for a

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.979 
lacking innovations with batteries for a
while<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.670> I'm<00:00:56.730> really<00:00:56.879> excited<00:00:56.969> for<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.780> one

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
while so I'm really excited for this one

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.069 
while so I'm really excited for this one
also<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> Chinese<00:00:59.250> company<00:00:59.840> supposedly<00:01:00.840> is

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
also so a Chinese company supposedly is

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.930 
also so a Chinese company supposedly is
working<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> new<00:01:01.680> phone<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> battery

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
working on a new phone with a battery

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.509 
working on a new phone with a battery
that<00:01:03.120> or<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.660> 10,000<00:01:04.260> milliamp<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.250> test

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
that or have 10,000 milliamp the test

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.520 
that or have 10,000 milliamp the test
claim<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> battery<00:01:06.360> life<00:01:06.960> could<00:01:07.290> last

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
claim that the battery life could last

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.080 
claim that the battery life could last
for<00:01:07.740> about<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.950> week<00:01:08.400> which<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.790> pretty<00:01:08.939> awesome

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
for about a week which is pretty awesome

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.300 
for about a week which is pretty awesome
so<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:10.020> don't<00:01:10.170> even<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.500> 10,000<00:01:11.010> men<00:01:11.100> like

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
so we don't even have 10,000 men like

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.160 
so we don't even have 10,000 men like
batteries<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.909> 10-inch<00:01:12.240> tablets<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:12.990> stuff

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
batteries and 10-inch tablets and stuff

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.750 
batteries and 10-inch tablets and stuff
like<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.530> there's<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.490> big

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
like that so there's going to be a big

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.179 
like that so there's going to be a big
innovation<00:01:15.360> if<00:01:15.479> they<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.840> pull<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.259> off<00:01:16.470> but

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
innovation if they can pull this off but

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.620 
innovation if they can pull this off but
what<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.520> do<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:18.060> know<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.390> this

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
what you do have to know is that this

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.450 
what you do have to know is that this
thing<00:01:18.840> will<00:01:19.020> take<00:01:19.259> forever<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:20.040> fully<00:01:20.310> charge

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
thing will take forever to fully charge

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.399 
thing will take forever to fully charge
so<00:01:21.000> hopefully<00:01:21.360> they<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.509> some<00:01:21.810> technology

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
so hopefully they have some technology

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.370 
so hopefully they have some technology
that<00:01:22.439> allows<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.040> charge<00:01:23.310> up<00:01:23.520> faster<00:01:23.939> but

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
that allows you charge up faster but

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.810 
that allows you charge up faster but
either<00:01:25.380> way<00:01:25.740> I'm<00:01:25.920> still<00:01:26.189> really<00:01:26.340> excited<00:01:26.790> for

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
either way I'm still really excited for

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.210 
either way I'm still really excited for
it<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.600> coming<00:01:27.930> out<00:01:28.049> number<00:01:28.290> three<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.710> Samsung

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
it so coming out number three is Samsung

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.700 
it so coming out number three is Samsung
safety<00:01:29.670> truck<00:01:29.939> Sam's<00:01:30.450> are<00:01:30.659> making<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.079> world

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
safety truck Sam's are making the world

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.740 
safety truck Sam's are making the world
a<00:01:31.950> safer<00:01:31.979> place<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:32.970> allows<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.570> see

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
a safer place so this allows you to see

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.600 
a safer place so this allows you to see
through<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> truck<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.979> traffic<00:01:35.250> ahead

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
through the truck and the traffic ahead

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.910 
through the truck and the traffic ahead
the<00:01:36.540> safety<00:01:37.020> truck<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.380> equipped<00:01:37.500> with<00:01:37.770> a
