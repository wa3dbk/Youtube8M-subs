is<00:00:54.210> nice<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.989> should<00:00:55.170> definitely<00:00:55.320> help

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
is nice so that should definitely help

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.080 
is nice so that should definitely help
you<00:00:55.829> install<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.280> but<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.489> mean<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.030> don't

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
you install that but I mean I don't

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.430

think<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.420> installation<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.140> should<00:00:58.320> be

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
think the installation on that should be

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.470 
think the installation on that should be
do<00:00:58.680> difficult<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.850> they<00:00:59.940> do<00:01:00.000> show<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.270> where

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
do difficult but they do show you where

some of the brackets go which in my

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.979 
some of the brackets go which in my

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
mandrel bent you can see that here

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.280 
mandrel bent you can see that here
aluminum<00:01:55.060> really<00:01:56.060> high<00:01:56.240> quality<00:01:56.300> poor<00:01:56.900> pieces

everything is polished up really nicely

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.690 
everything is polished up really nicely
and<00:01:59.120> then<00:01:59.600> on<00:01:59.690> the<00:01:59.810> ends<00:02:00.340> of<00:02:01.340> course<00:02:01.580> you've

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
and then on the ends of course you've

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.340 
and then on the ends of course you've
got<00:02:01.850> this<00:02:01.970> lip<00:02:02.240> here<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.570> they<00:02:02.660> don't<00:02:02.900> polish

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350

got this lip here and they don't polish
the<00:02:03.500> very<00:02:03.710> end<00:02:03.890> of<00:02:04.010> that<00:02:04.070> I'm<00:02:04.280> assuming<00:02:04.580> that

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
the very end of that I'm assuming that

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.640 
the very end of that I'm assuming that
just<00:02:04.850> gives<00:02:05.090> better<00:02:05.270> grip<00:02:06.050> to<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.290> silicone

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
just gives better grip to the silicone

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.250 
just gives better grip to the silicone
clamps<00:02:07.010> there<00:02:07.540> but<00:02:08.540> you<00:02:08.690> can<00:02:08.869> tell<00:02:09.050> just

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
clamps there but you can tell just

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.450 
clamps there but you can tell just
classic<00:02:10.250> quality<00:02:10.490> Japanese<00:02:11.120> pieces<00:02:12.460> really

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
classic quality Japanese pieces really

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.490 
classic quality Japanese pieces really
nice<00:02:13.670> flanges<00:02:14.180> there<00:02:14.420> alright<00:02:14.960> let's<00:02:15.200> move<00:02:15.320> on

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
nice flanges there alright let's move on

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:25.440 
nice flanges there alright let's move on
to<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.770> next<00:02:15.890> piece

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.140 

okay<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.600> again<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:27.080> same<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:28.730> piece<00:02:28.940> fall

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
okay and again the same this piece fall

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.390 
okay and again the same this piece fall
is<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:29.360> same<00:02:29.680> qualities<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:30.710> that<00:02:30.950> last<00:02:31.160> one

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
is the same qualities that that last one

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.060 
is the same qualities that that last one
had<00:02:31.780> really<00:02:32.780> smooth<00:02:33.050> inside<00:02:33.410> for<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.710> nice

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
had really smooth inside for a nice

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.610 
had really smooth inside for a nice
smooth<00:02:34.520> airflow<00:02:34.790> good<00:02:35.330> power<00:02:35.540> delivery<00:02:35.960> and

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
smooth airflow good power delivery and

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.030 
smooth airflow good power delivery and
then<00:02:36.680> we've<00:02:36.830> got<00:02:37.040> these<00:02:38.350> lips<00:02:39.350> on<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.710> edges

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
then we've got these lips on the edges

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.660 
then we've got these lips on the edges
here<00:02:41.770> again<00:02:42.770> everything<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:43.130> just<00:02:43.220> polished

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
here again everything you just polished

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.740 
here again everything you just polished
to<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:43.880> nice<00:02:44.620> high-gloss<00:02:45.620> finish<00:02:45.890> they're

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
to a nice high-gloss finish they're

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.610 
to a nice high-gloss finish they're
really<00:02:47.750> good-looking<00:02:48.020> pieces<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:51.260> one<00:02:51.530> I'm

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
really good-looking pieces this one I'm

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.940 
really good-looking pieces this one I'm
assuming<00:02:52.070> is<00:02:52.190> our<00:02:52.400> uppermost<00:02:53.950> intercooler

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
assuming is our uppermost intercooler

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.949 
assuming is our uppermost intercooler
hose<00:02:55.160> is<00:02:55.400> it's<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.760> largest<00:02:56.330> or<00:02:56.510> intercooler

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
hose is it's the largest or intercooler

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.420 
hose is it's the largest or intercooler
pipe<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.500> guess<00:02:57.680> I<00:02:57.800> should<00:02:57.980> say<00:02:58.100> this<00:02:58.250> isn't

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
pipe I guess I should say this isn't

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.580 
pipe I guess I should say this isn't
really<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.760> hose<00:02:59.150> again<00:02:59.900> just<00:03:00.170> same<00:03:00.350> high

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
really a hose again just same high

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.340 
really a hose again just same high
quality<00:03:00.620> bends<00:03:01.510> high<00:03:02.510> quality<00:03:02.870> lips<00:03:03.080> on<00:03:03.260> the

quality bends high quality lips on the
end<00:03:03.500> there<00:03:03.680> just<00:03:03.830> to<00:03:04.280> keep<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.550> clamps<00:03:04.910> on<00:03:05.060> and

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
end there just to keep the clamps on and

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.980 
end there just to keep the clamps on and
smooth<00:03:07.220> bends<00:03:07.580> on<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.760> inside<00:03:08.090> for<00:03:08.360> optimal

airflow all right you guys seeing a

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.420 
airflow all right you guys seeing a
pattern<00:03:12.170> here<00:03:12.350> with<00:03:12.620> all<00:03:12.740> these<00:03:12.860> pieces<00:03:13.130> they

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
pattern here with all these pieces they

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.910 
pattern here with all these pieces they
all<00:03:13.550> look<00:03:13.820> pretty<00:03:14.000> much<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.390> same<00:03:14.540> just<00:03:14.990> a

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
all look pretty much the same just a

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.199 
all look pretty much the same just a
different<00:03:16.340> bent<00:03:16.490> but<00:03:16.670> I<00:03:16.700> didn't<00:03:16.880> want<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.060> show

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
different bent but I didn't want to show

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.400 
different bent but I didn't want to show
them<00:03:17.300> all<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:17.810> guys<00:03:17.900> just<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.320> can

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
kind of get an idea of what we're

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.580 
kind of get an idea of what we're
looking<00:03:19.550> at<00:03:19.760> here<00:03:20.200> see<00:03:21.200> if<00:03:21.260> there's<00:03:21.410> any

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
looking at here see if there's any

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.730 
looking at here see if there's any
irregularities<00:03:22.400> on<00:03:22.550> any<00:03:22.730> of<00:03:22.880> them

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
irregularities on any of them

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.040 
irregularities on any of them
alright<00:03:24.740> so<00:03:24.920> that's<00:03:25.070> it<00:03:25.190> as<00:03:25.340> far<00:03:25.520> as<00:03:25.550> the

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
alright so that's it as far as the

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.479 
alright so that's it as far as the
intercooler<00:03:27.050> pipes<00:03:27.470> go<00:03:27.769> now<00:03:28.130> let's<00:03:28.310> start

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
intercooler pipes go now let's start

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.460 
intercooler pipes go now let's start
looking<00:03:28.580> into<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:29.239> silicone<00:03:29.989> hoses<00:03:30.200> that

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
looking into the silicone hoses that

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.350 
looking into the silicone hoses that
they<00:03:30.620> include<00:03:30.890> with<00:03:31.040> this<00:03:31.130> as<00:03:31.340> well<00:03:31.489> so<00:03:31.730> first

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
they include with this as well so first

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.910 
they include with this as well so first
we've<00:03:32.510> got<00:03:32.690> this<00:03:32.840> big<00:03:33.050> elbow<00:03:33.320> here<00:03:33.680> this<00:03:33.830> looks

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
we've got this big elbow here this looks

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.370 
we've got this big elbow here this looks
like<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.160> reducer<00:03:34.850> 90<00:03:35.510> degree<00:03:35.750> reducer<00:03:36.170> you<00:03:36.260> can

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
like a reducer 90 degree reducer you can

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.140 
like a reducer 90 degree reducer you can
see<00:03:36.530> that<00:03:36.680> they're<00:03:36.970> decided<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.060> is

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
see that they're decided it is

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.949 
see that they're decided it is
reinforced<00:03:39.050> silicone<00:03:39.950> very<00:03:40.700> high-quality

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
reinforced silicone very high-quality

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.570 
reinforced silicone very high-quality
looks<00:03:41.959> like<00:03:42.200> a<00:03:42.410> three<00:03:42.860> layer<00:03:43.010> design<00:03:43.340> or<00:03:43.550> a

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
looks like a three layer design or a

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.040 
looks like a three layer design or a
four<00:03:43.820> layer<00:03:43.940> design<00:03:45.280> side<00:03:46.280> as<00:03:46.430> well<00:03:46.640> okay<00:03:47.150> and

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
four layer design side as well okay and

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.300 
four layer design side as well okay and
then<00:03:48.980> movie<00:03:49.250> not<00:03:49.400> to<00:03:49.580> just<00:03:49.790> be<00:03:49.850> standard

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
then movie not to just be standard

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.199 
then movie not to just be standard
pieces<00:03:52.310> actually<00:03:52.459> this<00:03:52.730> one<00:03:52.910> looks<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.180> little

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
pieces actually this one looks a little

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.259 
pieces actually this one looks a little
bit<00:03:53.540> bent<00:03:53.860> you<00:03:54.860> can<00:03:55.010> see<00:03:55.190> that<00:03:55.340> slide<00:03:55.700> then<00:03:56.090> in

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
bit bent you can see that slide then in

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.530 
bit bent you can see that slide then in
there<00:03:57.430> Fagen<00:03:58.430> multi-layer<00:03:58.940> design<00:03:59.239> same<00:03:59.510> uh

there Fagen multi-layer design same uh

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.990 
there Fagen multi-layer design same uh
same<00:03:59.959> build<00:04:00.920> as<00:04:01.040> that<00:04:01.190> last<00:04:01.430> piece<00:04:01.640> I<00:04:01.790> showed

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
same build as that last piece I showed

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.150 
same build as that last piece I showed
you<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:03.290> then<00:04:03.410> this<00:04:03.530> is<00:04:03.709> where<00:04:03.860> we<00:04:03.890> start

you and then this is where we start

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.320 
you and then this is where we start
getting<00:04:04.190> into<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.549> straight<00:04:04.790> pieces<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.269> you

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
getting into the straight pieces and you

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.430 
getting into the straight pieces and you
can<00:04:05.360> tell<00:04:05.630> the<00:04:05.720> straight<00:04:05.870> pieces<00:04:06.080> because

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
can tell the straight pieces because

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.220 
can tell the straight pieces because
they<00:04:06.560> have<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.799> hk's<00:04:07.160> logo<00:04:07.519> on<00:04:07.670> them<00:04:07.930> so<00:04:08.930> still

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
they have the hk's logo on them so still

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
worm type screw clamp however the

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.880 
worm type screw clamp however the
problem<00:05:26.390> with<00:05:26.510> most<00:05:26.690> worn<00:05:27.020> type<00:05:27.200> screw<00:05:27.560> clamps

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
problem with most worn type screw clamps

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.280 
problem with most worn type screw clamps
is<00:05:28.010> you<00:05:28.130> have<00:05:28.310> these<00:05:28.520> holes<00:05:29.210> here<00:05:29.690> and<00:05:29.840> then

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
is you have these holes here and then

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.520 
is you have these holes here and then
you're<00:05:30.440> basically<00:05:30.560> getting<00:05:31.070> to<00:05:32.230> two<00:05:33.230> sides<00:05:33.470> of

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
you're basically getting to two sides of

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.900 
you're basically getting to two sides of
the<00:05:33.620> clamps<00:05:33.919> coming<00:05:34.190> together<00:05:34.310> and<00:05:34.580> they<00:05:34.669> can

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
the clamps coming together and they can

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.820 
the clamps coming together and they can
squeeze<00:05:35.360> and<00:05:35.660> sometimes<00:05:36.230> pinch<00:05:36.590> and

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
squeeze and sometimes pinch and

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.159 
squeeze and sometimes pinch and
sometimes<00:05:37.130> create<00:05:37.730> holes<00:05:38.000> or<00:05:38.240> tears<00:05:38.450> and<00:05:39.080> the

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
sometimes create holes or tears and the

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:40.780 
sometimes create holes or tears and the
silicone<00:05:39.620> that<00:05:39.770> you're<00:05:39.919> putting<00:05:40.430> on<00:05:40.520> us<00:05:40.669> so

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
silicone that you're putting on us so

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.940 
silicone that you're putting on us so
what<00:05:40.970> each<00:05:41.120> case<00:05:41.390> is<00:05:41.570> done<00:05:41.840> is<00:05:42.710> they've

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
what each case is done is they've

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.560 
what each case is done is they've
included<00:05:43.250> this<00:05:43.550> inner<00:05:43.850> layer<00:05:44.090> you<00:05:44.270> see<00:05:44.419> that

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
included this inner layer you see that

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.790 
included this inner layer you see that
seamless<00:05:45.790> inner<00:05:46.790> layer<00:05:47.000> there<00:05:47.530> now<00:05:48.530> that's

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
seamless inner layer there now that's

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.510 
seamless inner layer there now that's
gonna<00:05:48.950> provide<00:05:49.340> a<00:05:49.610> nice<00:05:49.850> smooth<00:05:51.400> surface<00:05:52.400> on

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
gonna provide a nice smooth surface on

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.800 
gonna provide a nice smooth surface on
which<00:05:52.669> you<00:05:53.060> can<00:05:53.210> actually<00:05:53.390> mount<00:05:53.630> these

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
actually a really good idea you don't

upgrading<00:06:01.790> to<00:06:01.880> the<00:06:01.970> t-bolt<00:06:02.300> clamps<00:06:02.360> but<00:06:02.990> in<00:06:03.080> my

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
upgrading to the t-bolt clamps but in my

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:04.540 
upgrading to the t-bolt clamps but in my
opinion<00:06:03.530> this<00:06:03.620> is<00:06:03.680> just<00:06:04.070> as<00:06:04.190> good<00:06:04.220> as<00:06:04.460> the

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
opinion this is just as good as the

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.159 
opinion this is just as good as the
t-bolt<00:06:04.880> clamps<00:06:04.940> as<00:06:05.270> long<00:06:05.390> as<00:06:05.510> you're<00:06:05.630> not<00:06:05.660> you

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
t-bolt clamps as long as you're not you

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:07.600 
t-bolt clamps as long as you're not you
know<00:06:06.260> cranking<00:06:06.770> down<00:06:06.890> these<00:06:07.070> things<00:06:07.370> I<00:06:07.490> guess

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
know cranking down these things I guess

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.030 
know cranking down these things I guess
that's<00:06:07.790> the<00:06:07.910> one<00:06:08.030> weakness<00:06:08.240> these<00:06:08.630> have<00:06:09.040> you

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
that's the one weakness these have you

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.290 
that's the one weakness these have you
can't<00:06:10.220> put<00:06:10.370> a<00:06:10.400> lot<00:06:10.580> of<00:06:10.700> torque<00:06:10.910> on<00:06:11.030> them<00:06:11.120> but

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
can't put a lot of torque on them but

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.460 
can't put a lot of torque on them but
really<00:06:11.450> I<00:06:11.600> mean<00:06:11.750> with<00:06:11.930> these<00:06:12.050> intercooler

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
really I mean with these intercooler

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.409 
really I mean with these intercooler
pipes<00:06:12.680> you<00:06:12.800> shouldn't<00:06:13.100> need<00:06:13.250> that<00:06:13.520> especially

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
pipes you shouldn't need that especially

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:15.790 
pipes you shouldn't need that especially
with<00:06:14.540> those<00:06:14.630> big<00:06:14.870> lips<00:06:14.900> on<00:06:15.320> the<00:06:15.410> pipes<00:06:15.590> there

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
with those big lips on the pipes there

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.080 
with those big lips on the pipes there
so<00:06:15.919> these<00:06:16.010> are<00:06:16.160> really<00:06:16.430> really<00:06:16.580> high<00:06:17.030> quality

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090
