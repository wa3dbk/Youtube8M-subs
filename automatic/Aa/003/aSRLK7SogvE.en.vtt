00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
fundamentally political because it's got

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.970 
fundamentally political because it's got
this<00:06:20.120> constant<00:06:20.720> interaction<00:06:20.990> between<00:06:21.560> all<00:06:21.919> of

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:21.980 
this constant interaction between all of

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
that was and is still very very

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.389
