Xbox 360 so and it's legit um he reveals
that<00:00:35.820> he's<00:00:36.059> managed<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.660> make<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.350> work<00:00:37.500> using

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
that he's managed to make it work using

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.610 
that he's managed to make it work using
a<00:00:38.040> combination<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.730> joy<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.360> key<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.930> Cronus

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
a combination of joy to key a Cronus

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.979 
a combination of joy to key a Cronus
device<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.129> Kronus<00:00:41.489> bullseye<00:00:41.879> software<00:00:42.480> so

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
device and Kronus bullseye software so

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.670 
device and Kronus bullseye software so
it<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.290> mapped<00:00:43.710> but<00:00:44.510> just<00:00:45.510> think<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.260> ps4

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
it is mapped but just think that a ps4

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.400 
it is mapped but just think that a ps4
controller<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:47.489> work<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:48.090> an<00:00:48.360> Xbox<00:00:48.750> 360<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
controller can work with an Xbox 360 and

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.100 
controller can work with an Xbox 360 and
maybe<00:00:49.860> an<00:00:50.100> Xbox<00:00:50.550> one<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:51.420> don't<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:51.840> yet

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
maybe an Xbox one we don't know yet

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.950 
maybe an Xbox one we don't know yet
because<00:00:52.649> Xbox<00:00:53.190> one<00:00:53.370> isn't<00:00:53.640> out<00:00:53.760> yet<00:00:53.789> but<00:00:54.539> uh<00:00:54.570> he

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
because Xbox one isn't out yet but uh he

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.959 
because Xbox one isn't out yet but uh he
somehow<00:00:55.230> has<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> ps4<00:00:56.160> controller<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.670> don't

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
somehow has a ps4 controller I don't

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.569 
somehow has a ps4 controller I don't
know<00:00:57.090> how<00:00:57.180> he<00:00:57.300> did<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:58.020> uh<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.949> he<00:00:59.219> mapped

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
know how he did that but uh so he mapped

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.660 
know how he did that but uh so he mapped
it<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.059> made<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.359> work<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> Xbox<00:01:01.079> 360<00:01:01.949> we

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
it and made it work with the Xbox 360 we

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.460 
it and made it work with the Xbox 360 we
already<00:01:03.059> know<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.449> bull<00:01:03.629> shock<00:01:03.840> or<00:01:04.140> will

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
already know that bull shock or will

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.190 
already know that bull shock or will
work<00:01:04.769> with<00:01:05.129> PlayStation<00:01:06.030> 3<00:01:06.240> PCs<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.900> Macs

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
right at launch so you can use your

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.120 
right at launch so you can use your

so that's really cool so it's not a huge
surprise<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:18.140> just<00:01:19.140> think<00:01:19.409> if<00:01:19.890> um<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.220> can

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369

use a ps4 controller on an Xbox one or
vice<00:01:23.280> versa<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.939> Xbox<00:01:24.299> one<00:01:24.780> controller<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.320> a

a lot of people are like I play ps3 cuz
the<00:01:37.740> controllers<00:01:38.159> better<00:01:38.340> now<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.060> could

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the controllers better now you could

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.850 
the controllers better now you could
switch<00:01:39.479> back<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.750> forth<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.229> controllers

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
switch back and forth the controllers

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.520 
switch back and forth the controllers
through<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> process<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.299> mapping<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.020> such<00:01:43.259> or

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
through a process of mapping and such or

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.100 
through a process of mapping and such or
even<00:01:43.920> if<00:01:44.040> they're<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.340> compatible<00:01:44.840> how<00:01:45.840> much

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
even if they're just compatible how much

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.780 
even if they're just compatible how much
the<00:01:46.439> console<00:01:46.920> wars<00:01:47.100> would<00:01:47.280> go<00:01:47.399> down<00:01:47.610> from

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
the console wars would go down from

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.420 
the console wars would go down from
there<00:01:47.970> because<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.420> consoles<00:01:48.930> are<00:01:49.430> fairly

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
there because the consoles are fairly

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.200 
there because the consoles are fairly
similar<00:01:51.000> as<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.689> specs<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.710> performance<00:01:53.460> now

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
similar as in specs and performance now

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.709 
similar as in specs and performance now
there<00:01:54.600> are<00:01:54.780> some<00:01:55.110> specs<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.310> make<00:01:56.820> ps4

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
there are some specs that make ps4

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.679 
there are some specs that make ps4
better<00:01:58.049> as<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:59.159> graphics<00:01:59.790> wise<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.390> power

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
better as in graphics wise and power
