00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 welcome today we are going to make a 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.170
 candy bag for birthday 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.809
 rapunzel first let's take a roll 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.059
 empty paper towel and we're going to 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.179
 Give a few cuts cuts of 2 centimeters 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.520
 long by 2 centimeters wide 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.900
 then we are going to fold one in between 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.570
 and we're going to cut the one we doubled and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.750
 then we better accommodate the part that 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.900
 we cut now we are going to draw a 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.900
 window and we're going to cut it 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.600
 once we cut the window now 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.570
 we can paint the paper roll of 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.570
 gray color and we can make certain 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.700
 little details to putting the brush almost 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.860
 almost painting nothing but a little bit of 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.110
 black paint we can make a 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.809
 detail after we're going to get 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.780
 some object that has a circle for 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.600
 we can trace the face we draw it in the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.059
 construction paper and we cut it 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.210
 we draw eyes mouth we put a 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.250
 little bit of wool like bangs after 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.700
 let's take a rule of 15 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.520
 centimeters and we will give it 11 laps 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.610
 with the wool thread after 11 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.660
 we're going to take it out let's cut it 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.790
 one end and the other end 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.380
 we're going to tie a knot and that's it 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.380
 we can make the braid 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.890
 when we already made the braid then we 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.440
 tie with a ribbon 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.229
 to make the grass we will give you three 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.350
 turns to the roll with a serpentine 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.140
 green after we give you a few cuts landmarks 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.990
 above 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.260
 and we paste it with rubber all around 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.780
 from the tower after we crumpled a 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.060
 little to make it look more beautiful a 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.550
 Once we have the lawn ready then we will 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.010
 we are going to stick a basket for mini 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.520
 bread that he cited so that we close the 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.200
 hole that has the tube below and so 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.979
 do not leave the candy when you 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.370
 let's finally hit her the braid 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.410
 the face we put the sweets and we already 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.910
