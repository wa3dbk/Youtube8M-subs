00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
with a bike it what I don't like is it

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.119 
with a bike it what I don't like is it
it<00:00:46.620> hits<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.510> expansion<00:00:48.510> chamber<00:00:48.899> but<00:00:49.129> let's

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
it hits the expansion chamber but let's

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.970 
it hits the expansion chamber but let's
see<00:00:50.280> if<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.520> rattles<00:00:50.940> or<00:00:51.090> not<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:52.440> do<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.800> to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
see if it rattles or not you do have to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.939 
see if it rattles or not you do have to
take<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:54.750> center<00:00:55.140> stand<00:00:55.410> off<00:00:55.590> with<00:00:55.620> this

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
take the the center stand off with this

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.860 
take the the center stand off with this
bike<00:00:56.219> was<00:00:56.430> missing<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> center<00:00:57.329> stand<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
bike was missing the center stand in the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.400 
bike was missing the center stand in the
first<00:00:58.109> place<00:00:58.940> and<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.300> got<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.840> together<00:01:01.050> and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
first place and so I got it together and

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.500 
first place and so I got it together and
I<00:01:01.859> was<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:05.180> let<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.330> hear<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.600> run<00:01:06.900> here

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
I was going to let you hear it run here

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.210 
I was going to let you hear it run here
so<00:01:09.510> yeah<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.590> been<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.790> slow<00:01:12.119> process<00:01:12.150> but

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
so yeah it's been a slow process but

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.920 
so yeah it's been a slow process but
then<00:01:14.220> get<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.549> all<00:01:14.640> back<00:01:14.850> together<00:01:15.060> here<00:01:15.600> so

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
then get it all back together here so

00:01:15.930 --> 00:02:04.750 
then get it all back together here so
here<00:01:16.200> we<00:01:16.259> go

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.570 

so<00:02:05.760> it<00:02:05.850> doesn't<00:02:06.120> sound<00:02:06.300> to<00:02:06.420> bed<00:02:06.660> it's<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.580> you

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
so it doesn't sound to bed it's a you

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.750 
so it doesn't sound to bed it's a you
know<00:02:08.759> these<00:02:08.970> uh<00:02:09.229> these<00:02:10.229> pipes<00:02:10.860> just<00:02:11.009> fit<00:02:11.610> onto

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
know these uh these pipes just fit onto

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.600 
know these uh these pipes just fit onto
some<00:02:12.500> nipples<00:02:13.500> up<00:02:13.680> here<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.160> bolt<00:02:14.400> onto

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
some nipples up here that you bolt onto

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.000 
some nipples up here that you bolt onto
the<00:02:14.760> head<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.360> there's<00:02:16.200> no<00:02:16.290> gasket<00:02:16.890> or

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
the head and there's no gasket or

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.530 
the head and there's no gasket or
anything<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:17.550> eventually<00:02:17.880> that'll<00:02:18.330> get

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
anything so eventually that'll get

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.170 
anything so eventually that'll get
carbon<00:02:18.840> up<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.590> seal<00:02:20.520> up<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.970> where<00:02:21.090> it

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
carbon up and and seal up to where it

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.790 
carbon up and and seal up to where it
won't<00:02:21.300> be<00:02:21.480> smoking<00:02:21.720> out<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.170> front<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
won't be smoking out the front and the

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.270 
won't be smoking out the front and the
back<00:02:23.120> but<00:02:24.120> yeah<00:02:24.450> sounds<00:02:24.990> sounds<00:02:25.800> pretty<00:02:26.040> good
