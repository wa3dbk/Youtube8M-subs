yeah<00:02:40.810> yeah<00:02:41.020> that<00:02:41.200> was<00:02:41.260> sweet<00:02:41.770> here<00:02:42.700> comes<00:02:42.940> in

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
yeah yeah that was sweet here comes in

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.730 
yeah yeah that was sweet here comes in
and<00:02:43.210> out<00:02:43.240> really<00:02:43.450> fast<00:02:43.780> on<00:02:43.990> this<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.620> could

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
and out really fast on this you could

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.500 
and out really fast on this you could
probably<00:02:44.860> put<00:02:45.070> a<00:02:45.100> slowdown<00:02:45.490> mechanism<00:02:46.360> or<00:02:46.450> if

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
probably put a slowdown mechanism or if

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.630 
probably put a slowdown mechanism or if
you<00:02:46.570> got<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.690> spectrum<00:02:47.200> just<00:02:47.410> slow<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.400> speed

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
you got a spectrum just slow the speed

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.130 
you got a spectrum just slow the speed
of<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:48.880> down<00:02:49.030> it'll<00:02:49.270> come<00:02:49.450> down<00:02:49.480> more<00:02:49.810> scale

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
of it down it'll come down more scale

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.970 
of it down it'll come down more scale
like
