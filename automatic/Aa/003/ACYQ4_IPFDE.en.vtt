 without vigor born intent will support 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.580
 very tense and so I was ashamed to do the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.549
 video of the top and the other time I was 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.010

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:33.990
 his is called his channel to a channel 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.430

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.530

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.229

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.510

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.180
 what he put in 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.360
 eyes what if there was the brown if 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.740

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.290

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:10.010
 second thing bad youtube is 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:12.110
 changing it completely is really giving me 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:15.620
 bother I don't want to be written by 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.060
 that google google plus google plus e 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.480
 instead I 'm transcribed for the 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.210
 second time it's the thing that gives me the most 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.250
 annoyance is that messages do not come 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.270
 where they were to be put some time ago 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.400
 watched videos that ran on youtube for 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:36.890
 to do it well I saw Richard's video 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.190
 htt and where he said that practically if 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.170
 someone does not like your video 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.530
 so maybe some package is written 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.990
 of the two videos he admits I like because 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:53.380
 I do n't know a third picture and video weapon 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:56.180
 what you do, another writing does not come to him 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.910
 that is the next future video I will make 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.070
 you see it unless I have from 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.070

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.080

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.420
 have had to attach it to youtube for 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.070
 let the boys fall into tears 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.960
