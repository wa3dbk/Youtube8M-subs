side effects can include acne so what

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.179 
side effects can include acne so what
can<00:01:49.049> we<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.350> since<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:49.890> basically

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
can we do since it's basically

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.179 
can we do since it's basically
