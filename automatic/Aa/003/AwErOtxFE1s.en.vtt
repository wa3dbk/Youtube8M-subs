00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
first damp that's going to go well with

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.410 
first damp that's going to go well with
it<00:02:00.710> you're<00:02:01.310> going<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.580> have<00:02:01.729> enough<00:02:02.030> volume<00:02:02.300> to

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.350 
muddy and dirty you're not hearing how
your<00:02:12.650> fingers<00:02:13.160> are<00:02:13.310> approaching<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.030> strings

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
your fingers are approaching the strings

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.650 
your fingers are approaching the strings
and<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.720> frets<00:02:15.020> you<00:02:15.320> don't<00:02:16.010> hear<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:17.300> small

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
and the frets you don't hear the small

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.229 
and the frets you don't hear the small
flubs<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:18.530> placement<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.430> other<00:02:19.670> problems

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
flubs in placement and other problems

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.260 
flubs in placement and other problems
with<00:02:20.450> technique<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.920> problem<00:02:22.520> with<00:02:22.730> that<00:02:22.760> is

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
with technique the problem with that is

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.449 
with technique the problem with that is
that<00:02:23.630> if<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.780> go<00:02:24.110> three<00:02:24.440> or<00:02:24.560> four<00:02:24.800> years<00:02:25.100> like

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
that if you go three or four years like

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.820 
that if you go three or four years like
that<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:25.970> then<00:02:26.600> you<00:02:26.810> get<00:02:27.020> to<00:02:27.170> an<00:02:27.290> amplifier

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
that and then you get to an amplifier

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.280 
that and then you get to an amplifier
that<00:02:27.860> lets<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:28.430> hear<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:28.850> you've<00:02:29.390> created<00:02:29.690> bad

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
that lets you hear it you've created bad

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.250 
that lets you hear it you've created bad
habits<00:02:30.890> over<00:02:31.190> many<00:02:31.400> years<00:02:31.600> what<00:02:32.600> we<00:02:32.780> want<00:02:33.080> you

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
habits over many years what we want you

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.170 
habits over many years what we want you
to<00:02:33.320> do<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:33.890> start<00:02:34.250> with<00:02:34.400> an<00:02:34.550> amp<00:02:34.760> that's<00:02:35.000> going

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
to do is start with an amp that's going

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.570 
to do is start with an amp that's going
to<00:02:35.239> provide<00:02:35.660> you<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.989> clarity<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:37.190> help<00:02:37.400> you

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
to provide you the clarity to help you

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.250 
to provide you the clarity to help you
refine<00:02:38.060> your<00:02:38.209> technique<00:02:38.510> at<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.019> very

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
refine your technique at the very

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.050 
refine your technique at the very
beginning<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:39.920> let<00:02:40.130> me<00:02:40.250> tell<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:40.610> you're

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
beginning and let me tell you you're

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.940 
beginning and let me tell you you're
going<00:02:41.209> to<00:02:41.269> be<00:02:41.360> so<00:02:41.660> many<00:02:41.780> years<00:02:42.110> ahead<00:02:42.290> of<00:02:42.440> me<00:02:42.590> in

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
going to be so many years ahead of me in

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.400 
going to be so many years ahead of me in
the<00:02:43.100> way<00:02:43.190> I<00:02:43.220> started<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.180> then<00:02:44.630> had<00:02:44.840> turn<00:02:45.110> had

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
the way I started and then had turn had

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.280 
the way I started and then had turn had
to<00:02:45.440> turn<00:02:45.739> around<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.160> spend<00:02:46.400> all<00:02:46.640> that<00:02:46.700> time

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
to turn around and spend all that time

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.720 
to turn around and spend all that time
relearning<00:02:48.290> my<00:02:48.440> technique<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.160> doing<00:02:49.459> it<00:02:49.610> the

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
relearning my technique and doing it the

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.630 
relearning my technique and doing it the
right<00:02:49.880> way<00:02:49.940> okay
