00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:21.710
 simpson new zealand is a company with the latest technology dedicated to the 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.410
 industrial manufacture of clogged mud brick intended for 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.109
 construction of walls in general committed to provide the highest quality 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.210
 both in resistance and finishes the above is achieved through the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.019
 research and technological development in the production and use of brick 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:40.870
 disseminates and advises its clients the architect's structural design 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.550
 The goodness of a chair for brick making depends on 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.540
 various circumstances determined by their plasticity production capacity 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.030
 cession of water 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.520
 binder capacity 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.190
 contraction in the sector sewed and heat behavior 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.770
 plastic chairs when you foresee an inflation of the same can be molded 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.150
 in balls that compressed in one direction any asset originate 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.350
 shouted some a chair has a binding capacity when it will happen 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.520
 can admit to intermix in its mass a certain amount of materials 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.320
 pulverized more or less granulated fatty clays 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.790
 The ethics are characterized by having a strong plasticity along with a remarkable 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.790
 capacity agglutinates 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.980
 houses and are already passed through the hand which reduces the size of the 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.290
 particles to a maximum of one millimeter 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.220
 which, as previously explained, is reflected in the quality of the 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.160
 swine flu 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.150
 another one of the important factors of solar song aggression and the 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.430
 asylum award 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.520
 the desertion depends not only on the applied walk but also on the surface 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.880
 specific of the tlc or chairs and the time of disgrace 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.710
 The maximum commission of the chair depends mainly on the consistency of the 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.240
 chair 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.960
 is also a function of plasticity and water content and 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.649
 who once likes clay discusses its plasticity and reduces the 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.140
 moisture content which results in an increase in pressure 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.140
 of exclusion and achieving greater homogenization 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:19.019
 with a temperature of 110 degrees the sica two one of the most delicate phases 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.829
 and transcendental of the manufacturing process 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.850
 drying on the other hand is a very complex operation 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.969
 where multiple factors converge such as the nature of the chair 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.229
 degree of preparation and homogenization 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:35.419
 pensions that they should have had during the design model and for the 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:35.919
 party 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.409
 drying uniformity and so on 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.020
 allowing brick to retain only 3 percent moisture 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.020
 after 48 hours of processing 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.109
 after the drying process the brick is unloaded from the shelf 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.669
 in a band that sold the stacking area which is carried out 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:59.459
 placing the bricks in such a way that the air circulating inside the oven 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.599
 may occur uniformly to give complete and total cooking 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:10.590
 2 cooking is the most important and delicate phase of the process 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.469
 manufacture with a duration of 48 hours at 5 degrees 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:18.509
 at this stage, 10 is conferred on the desired properties at the same time as 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:22.579
 reveals whether the preceding stages of strong preparation and 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.579
 finished have been carried out correctly or not 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.399
 Gonzalez we use our bricks on wooden pallets wrapped in 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:36.399
 plastic retracted 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.109
 we have transport units equipped with cranes patxi cia had 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.519
 to download the brick packs of work avoiding the handling of April if 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.689
 considerably reducing physical mistreatment southwest generally favorable 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.329
 the discharge to the sea 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.329
 two 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.250
 to support technically would be showing prey we have the 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:03.729
 services of highly qualified and recognized people in our 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:07.280
 country who are in charge of the management of various jobs that 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:11.230
 permanently we carry out institutions like the national center of 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:15.539
 disaster prevention cenapred the engineering institute of the unam 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.609
 the laboratory of structures of the superior school of engineering and 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.609
 architecture of the national polytechnic institute 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:24.889
 although it will not be like that 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.889
 we do not know borders 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.520
 in the brick construction industry 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.840
 it will not be like that 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.280
