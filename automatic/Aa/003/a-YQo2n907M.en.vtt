typically got some fruit in it but about

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.560 
typically got some fruit in it but about
half<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.650> carbohydrates<00:02:45.220> come<00:02:45.459> from<00:02:45.790> some

you<00:03:36.370> have<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.580> eat<00:03:36.760> very<00:03:37.000> many<00:03:37.150> there<00:03:37.299> airy<00:03:37.660> and

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
you have to eat very many there airy and

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.430 
you have to eat very many there airy and
light<00:03:38.170> like<00:03:38.739> a<00:03:38.769> milky<00:03:39.190> way<00:03:39.220> or<00:03:39.489> something<00:03:39.910> um

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
light like a milky way or something um

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.320 
light like a milky way or something um
but<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.739> flavors<00:03:42.160> are<00:03:42.250> these<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.880> ones<00:03:43.090> with

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
but the flavors are these the ones with

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.600 
but the flavors are these the ones with
fruit<00:03:43.600> in<00:03:43.750> them<00:03:43.870> I<00:03:43.989> actually<00:03:44.200> liked<00:03:44.590> more<00:03:45.010> just

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
fruit in them I actually liked more just

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.229 
fruit in them I actually liked more just
because<00:03:46.000> it<00:03:46.420> gave<00:03:46.720> it<00:03:46.900> more<00:03:47.080> of<00:03:47.230> a<00:03:47.670> less<00:03:48.670> chalky

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
because it gave it more of a less chalky

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.710 
because it gave it more of a less chalky
thick<00:03:49.780> something<00:03:50.769> to<00:03:50.860> sweeten<00:03:51.100> it<00:03:51.340> and

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
thick something to sweeten it and

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.479 
thick something to sweeten it and
something<00:03:52.720> a<00:03:52.870> little<00:03:52.989> more<00:03:53.079> air<00:03:53.350> in<00:03:53.500> it<00:03:53.650> so<00:03:53.920> my

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
something a little more air in it so my

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.250 
something a little more air in it so my
favorite<00:03:54.850> was<00:03:54.910> probably<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.720> black<00:03:55.959> cherry

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
favorite was probably the black cherry

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.319 
favorite was probably the black cherry
almond<00:03:56.680> but<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:57.459> know<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.670> blueberry<00:03:58.030> crisp

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
almond but you know the blueberry crisp

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.240 
almond but you know the blueberry crisp
and<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:59.049> oatmeal<00:03:59.350> raisin<00:03:59.739> walnut<00:03:59.860> were<00:04:00.070> both

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
and the oatmeal raisin walnut were both

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.640 
and the oatmeal raisin walnut were both
pretty<00:04:00.489> good<00:04:00.760> that<00:04:01.450> like<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.079> chocolate<00:04:02.260> chip

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
pretty good that like the chocolate chip

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.560 
pretty good that like the chocolate chip
the<00:04:02.950> crunchy<00:04:03.579> peanut<00:04:03.850> butter<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.329> fudge

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
the crunchy peanut butter the fudge

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.330 
the crunchy peanut butter the fudge
brownie<00:04:04.870> I<00:04:05.110> really<00:04:05.590> didn't<00:04:05.799> enjoy<00:04:05.920> any<00:04:06.220> of

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
brownie I really didn't enjoy any of

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.890 
brownie I really didn't enjoy any of
those<00:04:06.459> flavors<00:04:06.820> by<00:04:07.090> any<00:04:07.269> means<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:07.660> didn't

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
those flavors by any means I didn't

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.550 
those flavors by any means I didn't
think<00:04:07.959> they<00:04:08.110> tasted<00:04:08.500> good<00:04:08.709> but<00:04:10.380> you<00:04:11.380> know<00:04:11.500> you

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
think they tasted good but you know you

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.289 
think they tasted good but you know you
can<00:04:11.769> be<00:04:11.860> the<00:04:11.950> judge<00:04:12.100> of<00:04:12.160> that<00:04:12.280> one<00:04:12.970> highlight

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
can be the judge of that one highlight

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.659 
can be the judge of that one highlight
of<00:04:13.420> these<00:04:13.540> bars<00:04:13.750> as<00:04:13.959> they<00:04:14.079> are<00:04:14.230> organic<00:04:15.100> so<00:04:15.400> if

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
of these bars as they are organic so if

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.300 
of these bars as they are organic so if
you<00:04:16.060> are<00:04:16.450> big<00:04:17.230> on<00:04:17.410> organic<00:04:17.919> or

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
you are big on organic or

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.460 
you are big on organic or
try<00:04:18.519> to<00:04:18.579> eat<00:04:18.700> all<00:04:18.820> natural<00:04:19.239> or<00:04:19.299> whatever<00:04:19.540> they

try to eat all natural or whatever they

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.980 
try to eat all natural or whatever they
don't<00:04:20.709> have<00:04:21.070> a<00:04:21.100> lot<00:04:21.519> of<00:04:21.760> highly<00:04:22.750> processed

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
don't have a lot of highly processed

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.010 
don't have a lot of highly processed
ingredients<00:04:23.410> in<00:04:23.919> them<00:04:24.040> but<00:04:24.639> they<00:04:25.600> still<00:04:25.870> have

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
ingredients in them but they still have

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.650 
ingredients in them but they still have
a<00:04:26.050> long<00:04:26.260> ingredients<00:04:26.830> in<00:04:26.950> them<00:04:27.450> most<00:04:28.450> of<00:04:28.570> them

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
a long ingredients in them most of them

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.080 
a long ingredients in them most of them
are<00:04:28.900> pretty<00:04:29.380> pretty<00:04:29.919> decent<00:04:30.610> but<00:04:30.820> like<00:04:30.970> i<00:04:31.060> said

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
are pretty pretty decent but like i said

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.290 
are pretty pretty decent but like i said
this<00:04:31.360> part<00:04:31.600> is<00:04:31.750> for<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.169> hand<00:04:32.350> sugar<00:04:32.560> so<00:04:33.300> it's

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
this part is for the hand sugar so it's

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.730 
this part is for the hand sugar so it's
kind<00:04:34.480> of<00:04:34.510> a<00:04:34.600> hybrid<00:04:34.750> between<00:04:35.020> a<00:04:35.230> candy<00:04:35.560> bar<00:04:35.680> and

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
kind of a hybrid between a candy bar and

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.860 
kind of a hybrid between a candy bar and
a<00:04:35.860> health<00:04:36.010> bar<00:04:36.220> not<00:04:36.910> amazing<00:04:37.330> decent<00:04:37.690> amount

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
a health bar not amazing decent amount

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:38.940 
a health bar not amazing decent amount
of<00:04:37.900> fiber<00:04:38.050> though<00:04:38.290> they<00:04:38.410> do<00:04:38.500> have<00:04:38.530> like<00:04:38.770> five

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
of fiber though they do have like five

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.780 
of fiber though they do have like five

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
grams of fiber the cliff builder bars I

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.159 
grams of fiber the cliff builder bars I
think<00:04:42.790> I've<00:04:42.880> tried<00:04:42.910> all<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.270> flavors<00:04:43.630> I<00:04:43.870> just

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
think I've tried all the flavors I just

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.790 
think I've tried all the flavors I just
kind<00:04:44.350> of<00:04:44.380> grabbed<00:04:44.560> these<00:04:44.710> couple<00:04:45.550> out<00:04:45.700> of<00:04:45.880> my

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
kind of grabbed these couple out of my

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.530 
kind of grabbed these couple out of my

the<00:06:22.600> only<00:06:22.840> way<00:06:22.990> i<00:06:23.020> would<00:06:23.229> recommend<00:06:23.590> these

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
the only way i would recommend these

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.570 
the only way i would recommend these
would<00:06:23.889> be<00:06:23.979> if<00:06:24.100> you<00:06:24.220> need<00:06:24.370> them<00:06:24.520> for

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
would be if you need them for

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.700 
would be if you need them for
convenience<00:06:25.210> and<00:06:26.110> there<00:06:26.229> was<00:06:26.349> nothing<00:06:26.440> else

convenience and there was nothing else

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.070 
convenience and there was nothing else
available<00:06:27.240> like<00:06:28.240> it<00:06:28.360> so<00:06:28.450> the<00:06:28.539> regular<00:06:28.720> cliff

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
building bar I don't know why I would

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.050 
building bar I don't know why I would
recommend<00:06:32.560> that<00:06:32.770> the<00:06:33.130> soy<00:06:33.340> protein<00:06:33.760> really

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
recommend that the soy protein really

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.120 
recommend that the soy protein really
disappoints<00:06:34.630> me<00:06:34.659> but<00:06:35.650> I<00:06:35.680> hope<00:06:35.860> this<00:06:35.979> is
