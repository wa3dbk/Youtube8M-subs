your sync plates the spire will build

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.740 
your sync plates the spire will build
off<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> distance<00:00:29.160> however<00:00:30.060> if<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.510> leave

progress you have made on building the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.479 
progress you have made on building the
spire<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.380> need<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.800> keep<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.100> enemies

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.330 
spire so you need to keep the enemies
far<00:00:38.940> away<00:00:39.360> from<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> plates<00:00:40.250> provided<00:00:41.250> you

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
far away from the plates provided you

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.459 
far away from the plates provided you
kill<00:00:41.579> enemies<00:00:41.790> quickly<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.719> stay<00:00:42.989> within<00:00:43.200> the

kill enemies quickly and stay within the
sync<00:00:43.739> plate<00:00:43.980> your<00:00:44.489> spider<00:00:44.879> will<00:00:45.090> form<00:00:45.420> and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
sync plate your spider will form and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.389 
sync plate your spider will form and
send<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.989> beam<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.440> light<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.950> vault<00:00:47.250> of

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
send a beam of light to the vault of

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.490 
send a beam of light to the vault of
glass<00:00:47.430> entrance<00:00:48.239> once<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.140> beam<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.469> light

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
glass entrance once the beam of light

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.889 
glass entrance once the beam of light
hits<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.039> door<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.730> door<00:00:50.969> will<00:00:51.149> pop<00:00:51.360> open<00:00:51.570> and

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
hits the door the door will pop open and

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.270 
hits the door the door will pop open and
then<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.260> actually<00:00:52.500> begin<00:00:53.070> your<00:00:53.250> journey

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
then you can actually begin your journey

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.639 
then you can actually begin your journey
into<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> vault<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.050> obviously<00:00:55.469> much

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
into the vault this is obviously much

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.099 
into the vault this is obviously much
easier<00:00:56.100> said<00:00:56.430> than<00:00:56.640> done<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:57.570> will<00:00:57.809> require

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
easier said than done this will require

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.049 
easier said than done this will require
a<00:00:58.410> good<00:00:58.649> bit<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.949> communication<00:00:59.430> between<00:00:59.789> your

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
a good bit of communication between your

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.970 
a good bit of communication between your
teammates<00:01:00.449> as<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.840> sync<00:01:01.140> plates<00:01:01.379> are<00:01:01.620> spread

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
teammates as the sync plates are spread

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.070 
teammates as the sync plates are spread
very<00:01:02.430> far<00:01:02.850> apart<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:03.660> not<00:01:03.809> really

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
very far apart so it's not really

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.840 
very far apart so it's not really
feasible<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.739> wandering<00:01:05.430> group<00:01:05.670> to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
feasible to have a wandering group to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.090 
feasible to have a wandering group to
