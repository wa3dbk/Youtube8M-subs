00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
sort of looseness almost kind of

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.849 
sort of looseness almost kind of
sporadic<00:00:50.539> in<00:00:50.690> a<00:00:50.749> way<00:00:50.929> you<00:00:51.170> know<00:00:51.289> like<00:00:51.530> it<00:00:51.679> just

a<00:00:52.010> way<00:00:52.550> it<00:00:52.639> just<00:00:52.789> kind<00:00:52.969> of<00:00:53.030> came<00:00:53.210> together<00:00:53.449> you

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
a way it just kind of came together you

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.290 
a way it just kind of came together you
know<00:00:53.989> as<00:00:54.139> opposed<00:00:54.469> to<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:55.609> other<00:00:55.760> teens<00:00:56.089> that

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
know as opposed to the other teens that

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.689 
know as opposed to the other teens that
are<00:00:56.359> very<00:00:56.960> much<00:00:57.139> like<00:00:57.199> sort<00:00:57.649> of<00:00:57.710> organized<00:00:58.399> and

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
are very much like sort of organized and

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.360 
are very much like sort of organized and
there's<00:00:58.850> a<00:00:58.909> method<00:00:59.120> to<00:00:59.329> so<00:00:59.809> I<00:01:00.289> mean<00:01:00.920> we<00:01:01.039> wanted

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
there's a method to so I mean we wanted

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.299 
there's a method to so I mean we wanted
to<00:01:01.460> do<00:01:01.579> something<00:01:01.909> animated<00:01:02.690> I<00:01:03.079> had<00:01:03.949> this<00:01:04.100> idea

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
to do something animated I had this idea

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.550 
to do something animated I had this idea
to<00:01:04.610> do<00:01:04.850> something<00:01:05.210> with<00:01:05.360> windup<00:01:05.810> toys<00:01:06.080> at<00:01:06.380> one

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
to do something with windup toys at one

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.249 
to do something with windup toys at one
point

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
point

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.590 
point
lays<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.829> myself<00:01:08.159> really<00:01:08.520> liked<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.090> idea

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
lays it myself really liked that idea

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.719 
lays it myself really liked that idea
but<00:01:09.869> we<00:01:10.020> thought<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:10.320> could<00:01:10.469> do<00:01:10.590> some<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.920> step

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
but we thought we could do some a step

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.020 
but we thought we could do some a step
further<00:01:12.890> so<00:01:13.890> we<00:01:14.009> just<00:01:14.189> went<00:01:14.340> with<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.670> with

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
further so we just went with this with

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.569 
further so we just went with this with
this<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.380> animator<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.189> just<00:01:17.369> really

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
this with this animator that just really

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.459 
this with this animator that just really
made<00:01:17.820> sense<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.329> really<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.899> aesthetic

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:19.469 
made sense we really like this aesthetic

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.730 
made sense we really like this aesthetic
and<00:01:19.649> so<00:01:20.399> that's<00:01:20.579> only<00:01:20.850> went<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.509> can't<00:01:22.170> believe

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
and so that's only went I can't believe

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.580 
and so that's only went I can't believe
it's<00:01:23.100> been<00:01:23.189> ten<00:01:23.520> years<00:01:27.020> maybe<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.110> maybe<00:01:28.409> it

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
it's been ten years maybe I maybe it

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.179 
it's been ten years maybe I maybe it
feels<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:29.399> been<00:01:29.579> ten<00:01:29.819> years<00:01:29.850> but<00:01:31.189> but

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
feels like it's been ten years but but

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.350 
feels like it's been ten years but but
