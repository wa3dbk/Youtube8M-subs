school<00:01:47.830> is<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.220> try<00:01:48.400> to<00:01:48.430> envision<00:01:48.940> an<00:01:49.240> ideal

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
school is to try to envision an ideal

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.420 
school is to try to envision an ideal
solution<00:01:49.840> without<00:01:50.350> worrying<00:01:50.980> about<00:01:51.130> what's

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
solution without worrying about what's

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.060 
solution without worrying about what's
possible<00:01:51.670> so<00:01:52.630> let's<00:01:52.690> start<00:01:53.170> by<00:01:53.410> visualizing

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
possible so let's start by visualizing

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.570 
possible so let's start by visualizing
my<00:01:54.190> usual<00:01:54.520> solution<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:56.740> pictured<00:01:57.130> an<00:01:57.250> ideal

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
my usual solution we pictured an ideal

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.400 
my usual solution we pictured an ideal
solution<00:01:57.790> that'll<00:01:58.390> allow<00:01:58.600> you<00:01:58.660> to<00:01:59.110> attach

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
solution that'll allow you to attach

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.620 
solution that'll allow you to attach
your<00:01:59.650> Apple<00:01:59.980> TV<00:02:00.010> to<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.760> back<00:02:00.910> of<00:02:01.120> your<00:02:01.240> TV

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
your Apple TV to the back of your TV

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.360 
your Apple TV to the back of your TV
this<00:02:02.260> way<00:02:02.500> you<00:02:02.560> wouldn't<00:02:02.830> have<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.010> worry

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
this way you wouldn't have to worry

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.310 
this way you wouldn't have to worry
about<00:02:03.460> routing<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.390> cables<00:02:04.870> through<00:02:05.140> your

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
about routing the cables through your

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.370 
about routing the cables through your
wall<00:02:05.530> or<00:02:06.160> having<00:02:06.460> any<00:02:06.610> exposed<00:02:07.150> wires<00:02:07.570> you

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
wall or having any exposed wires you

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.540 
wall or having any exposed wires you
also<00:02:08.530> want<00:02:08.740> to<00:02:08.770> make<00:02:08.920> sure<00:02:09.100> that<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.369> could

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
also want to make sure that you could

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.430 
also want to make sure that you could
mount<00:02:09.820> your<00:02:10.000> Apple<00:02:10.270> TV<00:02:10.300> without<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:11.200> course

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
mount your Apple TV without of course

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.220 
mount your Apple TV without of course
using<00:02:11.650> tape<00:02:12.160> or<00:02:12.340> glue<00:02:12.900> after<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.930> lot<00:02:14.110> of

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
using tape or glue after a lot of

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.080 
using tape or glue after a lot of
prototyping<00:02:14.890> we<00:02:15.070> were<00:02:15.190> able<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.460> develop<00:02:16.000> a

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
prototyping we were able to develop a

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.910 
prototyping we were able to develop a
solution<00:02:16.330> then<00:02:16.870> met<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.200> requirements<00:02:17.800> for

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
solution then met the requirements for

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.220 
solution then met the requirements for
our<00:02:18.040> ideal<00:02:18.280> solution<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.570> way<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.900> works

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
our ideal solution and the way it works

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.530 
our ideal solution and the way it works
is<00:02:20.620> by<00:02:20.830> clipping<00:02:21.430> on<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.030> vents<00:02:22.390> in<00:02:22.510> the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
is by clipping on to the vents in the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.770 
is by clipping on to the vents in the
back<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:22.959> your<00:02:23.080> TV<00:02:23.370> we've<00:02:24.370> tested<00:02:24.640> over<00:02:24.940> 50<00:02:25.420> TVs

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
back of your TV we've tested over 50 TVs

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.900 
back of your TV we've tested over 50 TVs
and<00:02:26.050> it<00:02:26.170> works<00:02:26.320> great<00:02:26.620> it's<00:02:27.010> very<00:02:27.220> secure<00:02:27.670> it

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
and it works great it's very secure it

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.030 
and it works great it's very secure it
doesn't<00:02:28.180> require<00:02:28.390> any<00:02:28.690> tools<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.380> it<00:02:29.830> clips

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
doesn't require any tools and it clips

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.750 
doesn't require any tools and it clips
on<00:02:30.280> almost<00:02:31.030> instantly<00:02:32.280> really<00:02:33.280> happy<00:02:33.610> with

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
on almost instantly really happy with

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.820 
on almost instantly really happy with
how<00:02:33.970> total<00:02:34.480> maps<00:02:34.660> turned<00:02:35.020> out<00:02:35.230> it's<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:35.800> very

how total maps turned out it's a very

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.100 
how total maps turned out it's a very
simple<00:02:36.280> solution<00:02:36.550> but<00:02:37.090> yet<00:02:37.240> very<00:02:37.270> effective

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
simple solution but yet very effective

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.480

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
that it clips onto the back of the TV

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.030 
that it clips onto the back of the TV
the<00:02:49.269> second<00:02:49.840> is<00:02:50.019> that<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.380> can<00:02:50.470> clip<00:02:50.680> onto<00:02:50.890> the

you<00:02:53.650> really<00:02:53.830> want<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.550> can<00:02:54.760> screw<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:55.239> to

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
you really want to you can screw it to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.479 
you really want to you can screw it to
the<00:02:55.450> wall<00:02:55.570> but<00:02:56.470> our<00:02:56.590> personal<00:02:56.860> favorite<00:02:57.400> is

the wall but our personal favorite is

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.400 
the wall but our personal favorite is
just<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.820> clip<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.540> total<00:02:58.870> mount<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.260> back

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
just to clip the total mount to the back

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.520 
just to clip the total mount to the back
of<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.650> TV<00:02:59.830> hit<00:03:00.730> this<00:03:00.880> fast<00:03:01.330> tool<00:03:01.900> three<00:03:02.290> and

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
of the TV hit this fast tool three and

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.040 
of the TV hit this fast tool three and
doesn't<00:03:02.860> damage<00:03:03.010> your<00:03:03.130> wall<00:03:03.900> we're<00:03:04.900> really
