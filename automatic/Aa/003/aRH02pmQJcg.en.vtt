00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.910
 one with Helen the one lem talibane it goes 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.450
 not very good and you yes I'm fine 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.030
 in first year of business school 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.250
 post-baccalaureate so the business school at 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.090
 republic called sg 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.160
 management school 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.260
 okay we see there I am since the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.789
 beginning of the year before that I had done 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.140
 of the faculty no no we will not talk about it 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.289
 not because it was bad 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.609
 experience you say faculty could have 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.410
 lose bigger in France who 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.329
 difficulty in business school 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.239
 would usually be the recipient of the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.579
 trade is true but I do not know too much 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.170
 if it suits me because we say 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.649
 often from me that I do not have too much 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.270
 the commercial spirit shiro a little shy 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.399
 a little reserved so suddenly for the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.680
 trade was not necessarily going so 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.130
 maybe in a magazine I'd like 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.320
 well 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:59.430
 at her house at mademoiselle you 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.710
 announce voices the cash it is 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.850
 crazy and therefore you ti was thinking 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.520
 you decided to register this 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.170
 addition that's why it's not dull 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.120
 my stuff to do in my life before 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.520
 die this case listed in the role to 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.730

 the Czechs I am delighted with checa 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.190
 today so that's so it's the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.770
 moment you have to tell I do not 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.450
 do not know what are you wearing what then 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.440
 whereas before we start then already I 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.650
 go take off that lousy scarf 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.630
 okay here are the ugly charters that 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.920
 comes from primark ok we do not care 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.119
 it's still class what do you see 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.560
 Unemployed exhaust wings let go 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.800
 take I took match but hey she is 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.140
 ugly no because I started with a 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.690
 thing that will me 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.090
 the way down in the polls 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.870
 on the fort to search the rabbit yes ah 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.030
 the la 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.409
 so know I do not even want to me 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.950
 defend because I know I'm wrong 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.570
 ok I know I'm wrong so I do not 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.280
 should not I have not even why I 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.390
 lick tgm not why I wear it but 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.400
 it's hot 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.830
 yes and I bought them in thrift shop at 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.420
 20 euros cheap to my heart 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.759
 ok I think it's nice when 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.560
 even ok because his breakthrough weight tone 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.050
 trick and do not beat that much 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.280
 so it's pretty good 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.690
 so below I have a perfecto a 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.260
 perfecto from zara 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.209
 yeah so leather with I like a lot 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.440
 the details on on the shoulders but 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.090
 so I'm a little disappointed because 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.410
 a lot of people obviously have it all 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.930
 which is dear to many people 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.480
 but hey it's still 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.980
 so much so that's my bag 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.860
 it's my baby here so he has a 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.140
 story a story is that basically 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.630
 this is the gift that I made with 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.120
 my first pay okay so this is a 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.739
 saga balloon ok but I'm not going 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.660
 pay the price of the saga valley because 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.630
 that good I also have not been 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.880
 paid no more than ten thousand euros so 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.440
 here I bought them used is 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.590
 so I did something that 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.629
 many girls should do 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.519
 do not be afraid to do it is that I 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.760
 bought them on the right corner 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.319
 and so I sent a check from a 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.670
 sum still quite significant to 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.080
 someone I did not know in 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.030
 a village that I did not know 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.920
 so I could never have found the 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.930
 nobody if she had not jammed bag 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.220
 and then finally she sent it to me 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.940
 turns out it's a real one so it's not 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.250
 a counterfeit 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.590
 and so it's my baby then on the other hand 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.629
 I was a little disappointed because they 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.430
 had to arrive black finally he 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.200
 arrives and anthracite gray but have 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.910
 finally it's more beautiful below 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.940
 I have a good vintage american vest 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:35.959

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:42.049
