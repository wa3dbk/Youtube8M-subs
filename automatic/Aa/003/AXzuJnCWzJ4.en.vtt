00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.740 

we're<00:03:34.280> feeling<00:03:36.970> you<00:03:37.970> just<00:03:38.030> continue<00:03:38.600> this

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
we're feeling you just continue this

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.030 
we're feeling you just continue this
until<00:03:39.350> you<00:03:39.920> get<00:03:40.070> to<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.280> top<00:03:41.740> okay<00:03:42.740> when

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
until you get to the top okay when

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.230 
until you get to the top okay when
you're<00:03:43.160> done<00:03:43.190> it<00:03:43.520> should<00:03:43.550> look<00:03:43.700> like<00:03:43.850> this

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
you're done it should look like this

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.200
