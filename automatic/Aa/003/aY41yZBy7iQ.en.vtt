00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:08.639
 overall good control if they are good 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.090
 tuned to stream timely 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:16.980
 jump a little dropped out after all studied 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:20.779
 few to can high you almost cycle 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.150
 per second optimal breath hold 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.609
 on the first leg but unfortunately here 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.130
 misses the turn and unfortunately i don't 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.009
 saw the release of a bullet now tragic 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.350
 good on the first cycle of immature breath 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.329
 farther breathing 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.910
 although overall coordination is pretty 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.489
 good fucking course grabs three 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.430
 Movies from the center work but here 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.710
 here again did not fit like an eagle 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.190
 but this is our best result today 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.980
 We will work and now a little more about 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.989
 but this is the main mistake they 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.020
 she does not take off her hands arrow 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.289
 although in the water brought down and advancing from 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.480
 bad debt slips you 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:06.299
 regarding footwork here I would like to 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.840
 start a neighbor on the swim with oksana you 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.430
 you can see in the background Yellow model but 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.619
 very high leg position very 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.049
 high lock out of such a position 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.540
 there is a blow to the water with inadequate 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.750
 speed is not usually powerful 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.530
 effective after us manifesting this 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.560
 is a surge of official few 2 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.659
 seconds but this is for oksana by the way time 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.110
 characteristic as for they 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.479
 clever foot movements rather 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.950
 compensatory she aligns 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:47.320
 harmonizes technique but as such a blow 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:53.430
 kicks are non-aggressive and from them 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:58.140
 promotion until so on talk 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.820
 now we see that folding the arms 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.380
 standard for genkine 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.040
 sequences first immersed 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.130
 shoulder into the water then forearm and 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.100
 on the frame you can see that the palm is still above the water 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.060
 is in a dolphin impossible so 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.470
 called 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.850
 how to see it and putting hands 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.970
 distal sequence that is 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.680
 first brush then forearm then 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.860
 shoulder 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:30.610
 this is dictated by the sum of the features of the technique 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.940
 Klim's swimming pins but minimize 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:38.980
 the difference between the moment of insertion of the shoulder 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:42.340
 and if it makes sense 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:47.340
 which reduces resistance here 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.980
 particular on the formation of a wave 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.730
 further a little about the position of the brushes 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.709
 she is here vertical palm back 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.880
 side look at each other big 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:04.320
 fingers pointing down but considered 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:09.190
 classic when the position of the palms 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:12.790
 the fact that they are already on the trans hard water 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:16.390
 I do not think this is a gross mistake. 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.060
 the features of technology especially further 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.019
 it is clear that at the moment 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:29.640
 Brass inserts will be a second 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:32.490
 align the freeze frame and 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.590
 directly moment itself 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.140
 folding palms will be 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:43.890
 about 45 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:48.390
 degrees further along the axis of water will not 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.090
 rotate somewhat leveled and there are 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.060
 of course deep inside extra 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.790
 resistance but i don't think it's on 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.910
 this leads to significant braking and 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.690
 essential bearings and conclusion 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:06.720
 I want to praise my student here on 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.920
 sevenfold lapse seen that 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:15.120
 she gave floating and solidly not bad 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:19.260
 coordination is so great and inside the cycle you 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.010
 and hesitations will remind you that the word swimming 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.190
 smoothly 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:27.200
 but here me some smoothness in 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.200
 our smooth made
