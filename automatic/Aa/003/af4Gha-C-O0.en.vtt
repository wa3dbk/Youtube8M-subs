00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
those strips and cut them into four

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.770 
those strips and cut them into four
pieces<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> usually<00:01:17.580> start<00:01:18.150> by<00:01:18.390> cutting<00:01:18.570> it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
pieces so I usually start by cutting it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.600 
pieces so I usually start by cutting it
in<00:01:18.840> half<00:01:19.490> so<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.610> kind<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.030> get<00:01:21.180> them<00:01:21.299> even

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
in half so I can kind of get them even

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.710 
in half so I can kind of get them even
and<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:23.850> cut<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.210> again<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:29.700> then<00:01:29.970> one<00:01:30.479> more

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
and then cut it again and then one more

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.160 
and then cut it again and then one more
time<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.579> going<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.119> give<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.960> what

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
time so that is going to give you what

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.190 
time so that is going to give you what
you<00:01:34.290> need<00:01:34.590> for<00:01:35.549> your<00:01:35.700> little<00:01:35.880> toes<00:01:36.180> now<00:01:37.140> you

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
you need for your little toes now you

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.130 
you need for your little toes now you
toes<00:01:37.950> probably<00:01:38.250> are<00:01:38.549> not<00:01:38.579> shaped<00:01:39.150> like<00:01:39.450> this

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
toes probably are not shaped like this

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.080 
toes probably are not shaped like this
that<00:01:40.500> wouldn't<00:01:40.860> really<00:01:40.920> work<00:01:41.189> very<00:01:41.220> well<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.060> I

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
that wouldn't really work very well so I

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.149 
that wouldn't really work very well so I
usually<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.600> kind<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.229> look<00:01:43.470> at<00:01:43.590> my<00:01:43.710> toenails

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
usually just kind of look at my toenails

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.249 
usually just kind of look at my toenails
and<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.640> kind<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.000> get<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> general<00:01:45.780> idea<00:01:45.960> I

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
and just kind of get a general idea I

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.380 
and just kind of get a general idea I
really<00:01:46.470> don't<00:01:46.740> make<00:01:46.890> them<00:01:47.100> perfect<00:01:47.549> but<00:01:48.270> then

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
really don't make them perfect but then

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.270 
really don't make them perfect but then
just<00:01:48.600> kind<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.869> round<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.409> corners<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> little

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
just kind of round the corners a little

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.690 
just kind of round the corners a little
bit

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
bit

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.200 
bit
of<00:01:51.210> how<00:01:51.479> you're<00:01:51.689> gonna<00:01:51.840> need<00:01:52.049> them<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:53.210> to

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
of how you're gonna need them just to

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.440 
of how you're gonna need them just to
make<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:55.170> know<00:01:55.290> fit<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.680> little<00:01:55.860> better<00:01:56.450> not

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
make it you know fit a little better not

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.310 
make it you know fit a little better not
too<00:01:57.600> big<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.930> deal

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
too big of a deal

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.080 
too big of a deal
and<00:01:58.409> one<00:01:58.920> thing<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.310> would<00:01:59.430> advise<00:01:59.820> yeah<00:02:00.060> I

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
and one thing that I would advise yeah I

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.600 
and one thing that I would advise yeah I
ended<00:02:00.360> up<00:02:00.420> with<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.689> piece<00:02:00.930> with<00:02:01.229> no<00:02:01.610> plastic

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
ended up with this piece with no plastic

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.700 
ended up with this piece with no plastic
left<00:02:02.909> sticking<00:02:03.270> out<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:04.140> makes<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.439> really

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
left sticking out that makes it really

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.210 
left sticking out that makes it really
hard<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.189> get<00:02:05.310> off<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.030> bottom<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.039> so

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
hard to get off of the bottom it is so

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.390 
hard to get off of the bottom it is so
much<00:02:08.459> easier<00:02:09.030> if<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.020> have<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.709> little<00:02:11.099> bit<00:02:11.310> of

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
much easier if you have a little bit of

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.610 
much easier if you have a little bit of
this<00:02:11.580> left<00:02:11.910> on<00:02:12.209> each<00:02:12.540> side<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.349> that<00:02:13.410> you

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
this left on each side so that you

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.170 
this left on each side so that you
can<00:02:13.739> peel<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:13.980> off<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.549> makes<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.970> much

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
can peel it off that makes it much

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.350 
can peel it off that makes it much
easier<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.590> also<00:02:16.830> know<00:02:17.250> my<00:02:17.519> toes<00:02:17.970> are

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
easier and I also know my toes are

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.930 
easier and I also know my toes are
pretty<00:02:18.720> squared<00:02:19.560> on<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.010> bottom<00:02:20.129> so<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.670> always

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
pretty squared on the bottom so I always

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.789 
pretty squared on the bottom so I always
cut<00:02:21.239> off<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> little<00:02:21.659> bit<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:22.019> this<00:02:22.200> rounded

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
cut off a little bit of this rounded

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.210 
cut off a little bit of this rounded
edge<00:02:23.360> like<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.200> fits<00:02:25.409> my<00:02:25.620> toes

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
edge like that and that fits my toes

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.979 
edge like that and that fits my toes
all<00:02:27.060> righty<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.480> then<00:02:27.569> I'm<00:02:27.659> gonna<00:02:27.750> pull<00:02:27.959> my

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
all righty and then I'm gonna pull my

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.140 
all righty and then I'm gonna pull my
heater<00:02:28.260> over<00:02:28.470> what<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.549> guys<00:02:29.670> can't<00:02:29.909> see<00:02:30.060> it

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
heater over what you guys can't see it
