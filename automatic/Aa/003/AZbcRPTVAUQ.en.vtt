00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.130
 the high-water channel veessen weapon field 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.080
 is 1 of the measures from it 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.099
 national program space for the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.510
 river 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.610
 protect with this program with 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.620
 Dutch river area better 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.870
 flooding 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.369
 high water channel will lie between these 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.050
 and arms field 15 km south of zwolle 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.510
 the flood channel is used alone 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.340
 at extremely high water and then takes care of it 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.730
 a drop in the water level on the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.650
 IJssel with one and 70 centimeters 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.750
 this happens on average once in the people 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.890
 life is for the rest of the time 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.540
 area as now in agricultural use 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.700
 the smell is not dug but 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.980
 arises from the construction of two dikes 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.469
 the approximately 8 km long 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.170
 the width of the channel varies from 500 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.829
 up to fifteen hundred meters 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.360
 the channel gets an inlet and outlet 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.850
 Two new pumping stations and two bridges this 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.289
 bridges church dike and werver dike 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.149
 ensure that the area to the east 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.060
 van de gul remains accessible 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.040
 when the grille is in use the bridge 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.869
 Kerkdijk and the inlet work 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.210
 body the south side of the group we 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.010
 fear here the ijsseldijk becomes one 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.680
 part excavated making new 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.600
 floodplain arises at the same time as the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.010
 Kerkdijk replaced by a bridge in front 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.990
 car traffic 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.500
 a movable inlet will be installed under the bridge 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.720
 work at a water level of 5 meters 65 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.330
 the inlet is lowered 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.740
 and the water flows, the growth on the 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.960
 south side of the bridge comes one 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.060
 exposed cycle path at high tide 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.770
 cyclists can use the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.810
 bridge itself becomes the current yard time 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.030
 excavated and replaced in two places 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.830
 through a bridge the journey in the dike at the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.500
 curve cool remains 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.750
 because of the cultural-historical value the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.700
 bridge yards dike is intended for cars and 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.860
 bicycle traffic north of the plug de 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.740
 there are natural heights and height 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.600
 and summer quay that is reinforced this 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.660
 height and the quay protect the green 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.690
 reach the quay at normal high water 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.970
 is the end point of the odor in the 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.010
 wharf ass and exhaust work through this 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.200
 exhaust work the water flows out like 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.270
 the growth in use has been milled 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.270
 pump the last part of the water away 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.000
 at the western and eastern dike 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.800
 come new grace 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.930
 here you can see an impression of the pumping station 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.640
 thorn forest that comes to the western dike 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.590
 the pumping stations ensure that the 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.980
 water management in the area in order 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.870
 stays in the green area 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.700
 existing road connections 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.050
 the cycle path network is being expanded 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.630
 on the west side of the flood channel 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.550
 comes and landscape care 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.590
 this is a new nature reserve between the 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.870
 westdijk and the great wetering 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.230
 in this strip there is room for nature and 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.890
 recreation on the great wetlands comes one 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.890
 canal route 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.430
 in the northern part of the trench 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.290
 light and meadow bird area 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.470
 every spring here brood for mr. 10 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.090
 de l'ours snipe and godwits 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.770
 from the cycle path to the west dike 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.200
 light have cyclists and others 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.290
 recreationists soon beautiful view on this at 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.160
 the bird area when the group is in 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.870
 use 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.910
 may trees or plants 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.560
 do not impede circulation 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.410
 therefore , the trees and shrubs must be in it 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.660
 green area on film spots disappear 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.190
 stay in a few places 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.410
 characteristic rows of trees such as on the 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.280
 lanes and here at the paste road though 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.290
 preserved south of the late 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.790
 the resting point with a beautiful view of the 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.430
 IJssel in the floodplain 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.560
 the route runs from the resting point 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.930
 the excavating an embankment ijssel 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.500
 bike path to the north in the new 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.780
 a footpath has also been crushed from the innkeeper 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.550
 blog water channel veessen weapon field is 1 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.459
 of national measures 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.560
 program space for the river 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.990
 together measures ensured that 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.340
 Dutch river area better 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.340
 protected against flooding
