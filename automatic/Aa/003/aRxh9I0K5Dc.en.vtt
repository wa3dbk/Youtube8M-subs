00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
it shrinks so I'm going to actually have

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:16.759 
it shrinks so I'm going to actually have
to<00:02:15.030> go<00:02:15.120> back<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:15.599> like<00:02:16.019> I<00:02:16.170> said<00:02:16.379> this<00:02:16.560> is

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
to go back in like I said this is

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.670 
to go back in like I said this is
time-consuming<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.819> here<00:02:18.629> you<00:02:19.049> want<00:02:19.170> a

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
time-consuming and here you want a

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.970 
time-consuming and here you want a
little<00:02:20.250> bit<00:02:20.579> more<00:02:20.730> easier<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.709> let's<00:02:22.709> go<00:02:22.829> like

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
little bit more easier and let's go like

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.789 
little bit more easier and let's go like
that<00:02:25.730> again<00:02:26.730> just<00:02:26.970> kind<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.440> bring<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.470> all<00:02:28.650> the

that again just kind of bring it all the

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.319 
that again just kind of bring it all the
way<00:02:28.980> down<00:02:30.260> that's<00:02:31.260> how<00:02:31.409> easy<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.129> now<00:02:33.120> one

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
way down that's how easy it is now one

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.420 
way down that's how easy it is now one
thing<00:02:33.569> that<00:02:33.750> will<00:02:33.900> really<00:02:34.290> make<00:02:34.440> your<00:02:34.680> and

along
he'll<00:02:42.629> putty<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.250> well<00:02:44.250> right<00:02:44.640> there<00:02:44.909> is<00:02:45.120> a

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
he'll putty it well right there is a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.349 
he'll putty it well right there is a
good<00:02:45.329> example<00:02:48.560> it's<00:02:49.560> right<00:02:49.799> here<00:02:50.280> you'll<00:02:51.030> see
