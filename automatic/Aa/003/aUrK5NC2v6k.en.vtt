00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:27.020
 Well, it's everyone cédric luxury 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.000
 strength to go well today we get 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.380
 found for a small hollow exo as 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.939
 you're used to seeing on my 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.470
 chain and today I made a 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.300
 little madness 10 bought at 8a notwithstanding 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.710
 you can I prefer to have a lot 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.390
 many years to make 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.649
 several attempts at the same time as 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.719
 you see it with the solos moncla people 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.940
 really quite the same 8 notwithstanding 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.789
 so I tell myself go go we're going 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.079
 start doing rune stuffing 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.449
 diehards by cons I believe that 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.210
 I could not sign all these streets 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.469
 during all these all these rings good 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.609
 it's not for the first time I'm going 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.050
 not sign the sign when I 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.089
 will go up everything if ever it does not pass 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.550
 or if ever it goes either too bad 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.489
 will go unsigned we see the following 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.710
 I try to get as close as possible 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.690
 thaw and more and more perfect possible 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.620
 we could see that there is no prospection 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.900
 but three-quarters of the players are 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.340
 beat the balls since lo 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.600
 now as time goes by 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.270
 there will be nothing more to drop and so that's it 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.930
 go it's gone first one goes 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.790
 not second to 90 not feel I would have 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.860
 had to put waiting for a little elite I 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.480
 come back here come back excuse me from this 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.710
 little carpet and ellipses so here we go 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.840
 I said so just before 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.260
 I was going to put a ring here for 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.260
 return 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.580
 here we are at that it's not that one 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.430
 wide hockey quebec operates there go the 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.510
 second if you leila every time that 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.400
 makes me hope it's ikoula that it's 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:48.590
 something crazy 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:50.420
 3rd hop nothing at all 4th either to 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.960
 and we have already done half so there we 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.790
 continue to the whore that's good a father 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.990
 who passes so that's rather 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.670
 nice 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.140
 an option that passes so I believe before 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.390
 ten to fifteen million it depends on the g that 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.580
 is past we 'll see that right after so 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.730
 let's go we're always going 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.229
 nothing the last the ultimate event no 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.940
 more so here's a lob stands anyway 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.470
 who passed without then in a beautiful 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.819
 prowess given that we made eight 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.069
 attempts in eight attempts was 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.230
 past I mean it's rather earlier 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.739
 rather nice so sailing so what 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.519
 we spent that she I did not where 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.519
 damn it 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.709
 the sea ​​should not shine as wisdom 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.080
 so that's not that one ah yes often 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:39.440
 stopover in the middle of a field at 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:42.950
 so here's 180 pdv out of 239 out of 40 48 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.680
 on a 50 it seems to me the whore 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.700
 risks or if they are barred or where 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.940
 I do not care when I have 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.849
 back up the success g to west and me who 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.349
 watch out what fucking cunt as good bah 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.470
 worse for homes pushed so 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.269
 the opuses it plays much less than before 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.709
 no we will try to sell that when 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.760
 even 10 million I think it's a 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.890
 good price that we can draw 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.540
 that's good I hope it made you 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.739
 pleasure when I am super happy 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.629
 to have upgraded to 1 optional 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.950
 today's program I think that 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.739
 I pushed for so first 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.840
 around 13:30 something like that and then you 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.579

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.560

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.359

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.329
