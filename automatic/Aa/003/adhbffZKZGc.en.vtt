00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
but this is basically a youtube comment

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.760 
but this is basically a youtube comment
that<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.799> did<00:01:08.040> find<00:01:08.630> on<00:01:09.630> another<00:01:10.080> speculation

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
that I did find on another speculation

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.039 
that I did find on another speculation
video<00:01:11.010> about<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.430> stuff<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.909> he<00:01:12.600> said<00:01:12.869> that

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
video about this stuff and he said that

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.140 
video about this stuff and he said that
it<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> venomous<00:01:14.189> dragon<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.030> may<00:01:15.119> be

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
it is a venomous dragon so it may be

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.660 
it is a venomous dragon so it may be
dragon<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.810> poison<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:17.159> didn't<00:01:17.460> really

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
dragon and poison and I didn't really

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.850 
dragon and poison and I didn't really
know<00:01:17.850> anything<00:01:18.330> about<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.810> creature<00:01:19.350> thing

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
know anything about this creature thing

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.649 
know anything about this creature thing
mythical<00:01:20.400> creature<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.210> looked<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.450> up<00:01:21.509> on

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
mythical creature so I looked it up on

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.749 
mythical creature so I looked it up on
Wikipedia<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.189> said<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.580> has<00:01:23.729> a

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
Wikipedia and as I said it has a

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.200 
Wikipedia and as I said it has a
dragon's<00:01:24.330> head<00:01:25.130> reptilian<00:01:26.130> body<00:01:26.340> two<00:01:26.939> legs

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
dragon's head reptilian body two legs

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.109 
dragon's head reptilian body two legs
sometimes<00:01:27.840> none<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.350> barbed<00:01:28.590> tail<00:01:29.119> they

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
sometimes none and a barbed tail they

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.330 
sometimes none and a barbed tail they
can<00:01:30.270> breathe<00:01:30.450> fire<00:01:30.750> or<00:01:30.810> possess<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.740> venomous

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
can breathe fire or possess a venomous

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.260 
can breathe fire or possess a venomous
bite<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:34.100> looking<00:01:35.100> at<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.460> looking<00:01:35.939> at<00:01:36.240> a

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
bite so looking at this looking at a

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.679 
bite so looking at this looking at a
belt<00:01:36.479> all<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:37.500> does<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:37.979> two<00:01:38.159> legs<00:01:38.659> has<00:01:39.659> a

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
belt all it does have two legs has a

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.219 
belt all it does have two legs has a
dragon<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.200> head<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.970> big<00:01:42.210> tail<00:01:42.780> could

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
dragon like head and the big tail could

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.889 
dragon like head and the big tail could
probably<00:01:43.920> be<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> stinger<00:01:45.360> kind<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.750> like

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
probably be like a stinger kind of like

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.020 
probably be like a stinger kind of like
a<00:01:45.960> scorpion<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.649> guess<00:01:46.829> it's<00:01:47.759> got<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.000> a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
a scorpion I guess it's got like a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.810 
a scorpion I guess it's got like a
purple<00:01:48.540> Mane<00:01:48.869> which<00:01:49.560> also<00:01:50.040> kind<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.520> points

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
purple Mane which also kind of points

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.090 
purple Mane which also kind of points
towards<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.180> poison<00:01:51.600> type<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.049> then<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.710> veins

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
towards a poison type and then the veins

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.270 
towards a poison type and then the veins
going<00:01:54.000> through<00:01:54.420> its<00:01:54.600> arms<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.560> big<00:01:55.710> tail

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
going through its arms and a big tail

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.420 
going through its arms and a big tail
also<00:01:56.909> kind<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.420> point<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.960> as<00:01:58.170> well<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.430> it

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
also kind of point to this as well so it

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.910 
also kind of point to this as well so it
does<00:01:59.700> have<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> dragon<00:02:00.299> like<00:02:00.420> body<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.649> sense

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
does have a dragon like body in a sense

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.270 
does have a dragon like body in a sense
especially<00:02:02.130> looking<00:02:02.790> at

notice is its most common in Indian
force<00:03:11.799> so<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:13.250> fact<00:03:13.459> that<00:03:13.519> it's<00:03:13.730> in<00:03:13.850> dense

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
force so the fact that it's in dense

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.800 
force so the fact that it's in dense
forests<00:03:14.829> is<00:03:15.829> just<00:03:16.370> where<00:03:16.730> xerneas<00:03:17.150> was<00:03:17.450> and

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
forests is just where xerneas was and

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.380 
forests is just where xerneas was and
also<00:03:18.769> right<00:03:19.160> below<00:03:19.459> this<00:03:19.609> and<00:03:19.850> says<00:03:20.030> they<00:03:20.180> also

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
for the horns so I mean ghost-type does

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.190 
for the horns so I mean ghost-type does

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
grass type I could completely understand

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.569 
grass type I could completely understand
because<00:03:40.970> they're<00:03:41.180> in<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.690> forest<00:03:42.230> in<00:03:42.500> any<00:03:43.430> of

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
the shots that we see of xerneas so that

the shots that we see of xerneas so that
doesn't<00:03:47.150> really<00:03:47.630> explain<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.500> many<00:03:48.680> colors

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
doesn't really explain the many colors

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.340 
doesn't really explain the many colors
on<00:03:49.340> its<00:03:49.459> horns<00:03:49.880> I'm<00:03:50.180> sure<00:03:50.630> that<00:03:50.780> maybe<00:03:51.049> like

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350

seasons but one of their speculation was

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.660 
seasons but one of their speculation was
the<00:03:54.109> fact<00:03:54.290> that<00:03:54.350> it<00:03:54.470> could<00:03:54.590> be<00:03:54.709> a<00:03:54.739> steel<00:03:55.160> ghost

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
the fact that it could be a steel ghost

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.699 
the fact that it could be a steel ghost
type<00:03:56.000> which<00:03:56.239> is<00:03:56.359> something<00:03:56.569> many<00:03:57.079> many<00:03:57.290> people

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709

ghosts<00:04:00.109> but<00:04:00.350> looking<00:04:00.590> at<00:04:00.709> its<00:04:00.829> legs<00:04:01.160> that<00:04:01.819> can

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
ghosts but looking at its legs that can

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.059 
ghosts but looking at its legs that can
also<00:04:02.090> point<00:04:02.389> to<00:04:02.600> a<00:04:02.630> steel<00:04:03.079> type<00:04:03.380> so

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
also point to a steel type so

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.750 
also point to a steel type so
I<00:04:05.099> could<00:04:05.700> understand<00:04:06.209> grass<00:04:07.189> and<00:04:08.189> I<00:04:08.489> can<00:04:08.640> also

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
I could understand grass and I can also

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.170 
I could understand grass and I can also
understand<00:04:09.480> steel<00:04:09.989> ghost<00:04:10.980> is<00:04:11.340> probably<00:04:11.969> one

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
understand steel ghost is probably one

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.849 
understand steel ghost is probably one
of<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.299> types<00:04:12.629> but<00:04:12.900> looking<00:04:13.230> also<00:04:13.409> what<00:04:13.620> she

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
of the types but looking also what she

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.310 
of the types but looking also what she
tells<00:04:14.069> a<00:04:14.459> real<00:04:14.819> quick<00:04:15.090> getting<00:04:16.079> sidetracked

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
tells a real quick getting sidetracked

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.349 
tells a real quick getting sidetracked
it<00:04:16.709> does<00:04:16.859> have<00:04:17.070> spots<00:04:17.430> on<00:04:17.669> its<00:04:17.850> back<00:04:18.060> if<00:04:18.269> you

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
it does have spots on its back if you

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.620 
it does have spots on its back if you
look<00:04:18.509> closely<00:04:19.220> three<00:04:20.220> one<00:04:20.489> red<00:04:20.729> pink<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.389> one

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
look closely three one red pink and one

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.840 
look closely three one red pink and one
blue<00:04:22.039> so<00:04:23.039> that's<00:04:23.310> cool

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
blue so that's cool

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.170 
blue so that's cool
but<00:04:24.949> that's<00:04:25.949> just<00:04:26.100> my<00:04:26.310> speculation<00:04:26.580> so

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
but that's just my speculation so

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.300 
but that's just my speculation so
between<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.660> two<00:04:27.900> types<00:04:28.889> that<00:04:29.039> I'm<00:04:29.190> thinking

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
between the two types that I'm thinking

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.330 
between the two types that I'm thinking
about<00:04:29.610> steel<00:04:30.030> ghost<00:04:30.360> or<00:04:30.830> grass<00:04:31.830> ghost<00:04:32.160> I'm

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
about steel ghost or grass ghost I'm

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.219 
about steel ghost or grass ghost I'm
sure<00:04:32.520> many<00:04:32.759> would<00:04:33.000> love<00:04:33.240> steel<00:04:33.660> goes<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:34.080> much

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
sure many would love steel goes to much

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.670 
sure many would love steel goes to much
more<00:04:34.530> but<00:04:35.490> um<00:04:35.880> those<00:04:36.870> two<00:04:37.259> I'm<00:04:37.380> not<00:04:37.560> really

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
more but um those two I'm not really

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.589 
more but um those two I'm not really
sure<00:04:38.070> what<00:04:38.280> this<00:04:38.430> one<00:04:38.610> could<00:04:38.759> be<00:04:38.789> it<00:04:39.150> it's<00:04:39.389> all

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
sure what this one could be it it's all

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.230 
sure what this one could be it it's all
really<00:04:40.169> out<00:04:40.380> there<00:04:40.680> there's<00:04:40.889> no<00:04:41.030> specific<00:04:42.030> one

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240
