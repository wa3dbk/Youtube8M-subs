00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
puppet is is that the wand isn't

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.670 
puppet is is that the wand isn't
removable<00:01:21.910> but<00:01:22.910> they<00:01:23.150> go<00:01:23.360> and<00:01:23.660> if<00:01:24.230> we<00:01:24.350> open<00:01:24.620> it

gampy<00:02:20.810> puppet<00:02:21.350> as<00:02:21.590> well<00:02:21.830> which<00:02:22.490> was<00:02:22.820> I<00:02:23.180> think

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
gampy puppet as well which was I think

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.720 
gampy puppet as well which was I think
it<00:02:23.660> was<00:02:23.690> city's<00:02:24.230> cousin<00:02:24.800> I<00:02:24.980> can't<00:02:25.310> remember<00:02:25.580> I

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
it was city's cousin I can't remember I

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.130 
it was city's cousin I can't remember I
haven't<00:02:25.940> seen<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.210> show<00:02:26.240> for<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.630> very<00:02:26.900> long

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
haven't seen the show for a very long

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.640 
haven't seen the show for a very long
time<00:02:27.940> but<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.000> think<00:02:29.660> it<00:02:29.840> was<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.960> good<00:02:30.230> way<00:02:30.590> to

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
them because they're they're quite a

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.710 
them because they're they're quite a
nice<00:03:00.470> thing<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.710> have<00:03:01.270> especially<00:03:02.270> if<00:03:02.600> you're

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
nice thing to have especially if you're

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.760 
nice thing to have especially if you're
a<00:03:02.750> collector<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:04.730> again<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:05.780> know<00:03:06.380> this<00:03:06.530> has

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
a collector and again I know this has

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.920 
a collector and again I know this has
got<00:03:07.280> nothing<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.550> do<00:03:07.700> but<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.480> think<00:03:08.630> it's

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
got nothing to do but the I think it's

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.830 
got nothing to do but the I think it's
supposed<00:03:09.080> to<00:03:09.230> be<00:03:09.320> based<00:03:09.620> on<00:03:10.480> such<00:03:11.480> as<00:03:11.720> he

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
supposed to be based on such as he

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.380 
supposed to be based on such as he
appeared<00:03:12.230> in<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:12.680> think<00:03:12.860> it's<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.130> 70s<00:03:13.820> 80s<00:03:14.030> and

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
appeared in I think it's the 70s 80s and

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.450 
appeared in I think it's the 70s 80s and
90s<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:14.960> 2000<00:03:15.560> zero<00:03:15.770> this<00:03:15.950> one's<00:03:16.130> supposed<00:03:16.340> to

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
90s and 2000 zero this one's supposed to

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.920 
90s and 2000 zero this one's supposed to
be<00:03:16.520> based<00:03:16.760> on<00:03:17.060> because<00:03:17.630> I<00:03:17.660> remember<00:03:17.900> the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120

all<00:04:20.239> began<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:21.049> I<00:04:21.410> think<00:04:22.220> it's<00:04:22.400> a<00:04:22.490> very<00:04:22.700> is<00:04:22.970> one

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
all began and I think it's a very is one

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.510 
all began and I think it's a very is one
of<00:04:23.270> those<00:04:23.419> shows<00:04:23.750> which<00:04:24.169> I<00:04:24.530> think<00:04:24.919> cuz<00:04:25.160> I<00:04:25.370> think

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
of those shows which I think cuz I think

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.580 
of those shows which I think cuz I think
it's<00:04:25.760> Richard<00:04:25.940> Cardella<00:04:26.930> saying<00:04:27.230> I<00:04:27.350> think

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
it's Richard Cardella saying I think

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.040 
it's Richard Cardella saying I think
he's<00:04:27.890> trying<00:04:28.160> to<00:04:28.250> bring<00:04:28.610> City<00:04:29.030> back<00:04:29.390> to<00:04:29.720> as<00:04:29.870> he

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
he's trying to bring City back to as he

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.590 
he's trying to bring City back to as he
was<00:04:30.200> originally<00:04:30.620> met<00:04:30.830> remembered<00:04:31.400> as

was originally met remembered as
especially<00:04:32.600> I<00:04:33.020> think<00:04:33.050> it<00:04:33.289> was<00:04:33.380> his<00:04:33.500> LA

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980

month it was his anniversary I seem to

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.200 
month it was his anniversary I seem to
recall<00:04:36.710> because<00:04:37.580> there<00:04:37.790> was<00:04:37.880> a<00:04:37.940> thing<00:04:38.120> about

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
recall because there was a thing about

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.000 
recall because there was a thing about
it<00:04:38.420> in<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:38.570> paper<00:04:39.050> and<00:04:40.180> but<00:04:41.260> still<00:04:42.260> I<00:04:42.440> mean<00:04:42.650> it

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
it in the paper and but still I mean it

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.850 
it in the paper and but still I mean it
and<00:04:43.160> then<00:04:43.370> afterwards<00:04:44.230> Mathew<00:04:45.230> Corbett<00:04:45.680> took

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
and then afterwards Mathew Corbett took

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.880 
and then afterwards Mathew Corbett took
over<00:04:46.130> for<00:04:46.610> a<00:04:46.670> bit<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:47.210> then<00:04:47.540> it<00:04:47.900> was<00:04:48.080> as<00:04:48.410> I<00:04:48.560> said

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
over for a bit and then it was as I said

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.400 
over for a bit and then it was as I said
Richard<00:04:49.130> car<00:04:49.460> bells<00:04:49.700> the<00:04:49.970> current<00:04:50.410> presenter

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
Richard car bells the current presenter

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
Richard car bells the current presenter
and<00:04:51.760> my<00:04:52.760> personal<00:04:53.270> opinion<00:04:53.780> on<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.170> city

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
and my personal opinion on the city

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.100 
and my personal opinion on the city
presenters<00:04:55.430> I<00:04:55.760> kind<00:04:56.240> of<00:04:56.330> like<00:04:56.510> Harry<00:04:56.810> Corps

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
presenters I kind of like Harry Corps

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.650 
presenters I kind of like Harry Corps
but<00:04:57.260> obviously<00:04:57.650> sees<00:04:57.950> the<00:04:58.100> first-ever<00:04:58.670> one<00:04:59.450> I

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
but obviously sees the first-ever one I

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.330 
but obviously sees the first-ever one I
think<00:04:59.930> Matthew<00:05:00.140> Corbett's<00:05:00.860> probably<00:05:01.220> my

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
think Matthew Corbett's probably my

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.010 
think Matthew Corbett's probably my
favorite<00:05:02.000> because<00:05:02.150> I<00:05:02.360> seem<00:05:02.570> I<00:05:02.780> always

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
favorite because I seem I always

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.390 
favorite because I seem I always

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
remember when I was little I used to

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.290 
remember when I was little I used to
watch<00:05:04.640> the<00:05:05.630> city<00:05:06.020> of<00:05:07.310> show<00:05:07.550> with<00:05:07.790> which

was presented by Matthew I'm not a big

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.420 
was presented by Matthew I'm not a big
fan<00:05:12.170> of<00:05:12.200> Richard<00:05:12.620> Carr<00:05:12.860> though<00:05:13.040> he's<00:05:13.190> still

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
fan of Richard Carr though he's still

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.990

good though

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.540 
good though
so<00:05:14.330> then<00:05:14.960> gonna<00:05:15.050> be<00:05:15.170> wrong<00:05:15.380> but<00:05:15.890> so<00:05:16.040> I<00:05:16.190> still

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
so then gonna be wrong but so I still

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.330 
so then gonna be wrong but so I still
think<00:05:16.760> it's<00:05:16.940> still<00:05:17.420> a<00:05:17.480> really<00:05:17.990> good<00:05:18.200> show<00:05:19.130> for

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
think it's still a really good show for

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.310 
think it's still a really good show for
kids<00:05:19.580> it's<00:05:20.330> I<00:05:20.630> wouldn't<00:05:21.080> say<00:05:21.200> it's

kids it's I wouldn't say it's

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.080 
kids it's I wouldn't say it's
educational<00:05:22.040> because<00:05:22.370> there's<00:05:22.670> quite<00:05:22.850> a<00:05:22.880> bit

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
educational because there's quite a bit

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.440 
educational because there's quite a bit
of<00:05:23.140> silly<00:05:24.140> bits<00:05:24.440> in<00:05:24.650> it<00:05:24.800> but<00:05:25.100> you<00:05:25.940> know<00:05:26.060> it's

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
adult's hand can easily fit inside the

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.120 
adult's hand can easily fit inside the
puppet<00:05:44.480> to<00:05:44.840> make<00:05:44.990> it<00:05:45.170> move<00:05:45.320> around<00:05:45.500> which<00:05:46.010> I

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
puppet to make it move around which I

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.530 
puppet to make it move around which I
was<00:05:46.220> surprised<00:05:46.520> that<00:05:46.550> really<00:05:47.060> because<00:05:47.240> oh

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
was surprised that really because oh

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.660 
was surprised that really because oh
because<00:05:48.170> I<00:05:48.350> was<00:05:48.890> sorting<00:05:49.190> out<00:05:49.280> some<00:05:49.340> stuff

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
because I was sorting out some stuff

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.640 
because I was sorting out some stuff
recently<00:05:49.940> and<00:05:50.360> I<00:05:50.390> came<00:05:50.750> across<00:05:50.870> the<00:05:51.230> puppet<00:05:51.560> I

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
recently and I came across the puppet I

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.080 
recently and I came across the puppet I
thought<00:05:51.830> I'll<00:05:52.010> because<00:05:52.250> of<00:05:52.280> my<00:05:52.790> hands

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
thought I'll because of my hands

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.510 
thought I'll because of my hands
obviously<00:05:53.690> grown<00:05:54.080> up<00:05:54.260> quite<00:05:54.950> a<00:05:55.040> bit<00:05:55.160> since<00:05:55.370> I

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
obviously grown up quite a bit since I

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.160 
obviously grown up quite a bit since I
was<00:05:55.670> a<00:05:55.700> child<00:05:55.760> and<00:05:56.150> might<00:05:56.390> not<00:05:56.570> work<00:05:56.780> anymore
