but going back to the lighting cable we
need<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.299> have<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> lightning<00:01:16.020> cable<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.530> attach

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
need to have a lightning cable to attach

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.219 
need to have a lightning cable to attach
to<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> dock<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.659> right<00:01:18.900> here

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
to the dock and I have that right here

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.770 
to the dock and I have that right here
and<00:01:19.439> we'll<00:01:20.009> simply<00:01:20.340> slide<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.060> through

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
and we'll simply slide it in through

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.140 
and we'll simply slide it in through
this<00:01:21.900> little<00:01:22.110> channel<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.040> then<00:01:23.700> we'll

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
this little channel here and then we'll

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.249 
this little channel here and then we'll
kind<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.170> press<00:01:25.770> down<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.310> one<00:01:27.060> end<00:01:27.270> right<00:01:28.020> here

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
kind of press down on one end right here

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.450 
kind of press down on one end right here
and<00:01:28.530> then<00:01:29.280> he'll<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.090> securely<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.619> dock

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
and then he'll be securely in the dock

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.880 
and then he'll be securely in the dock
and<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.720> won't<00:01:33.900> be<00:01:34.020> moving<00:01:34.290> around<00:01:34.650> or

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
and it won't be moving around or

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.429 
and it won't be moving around or
anything<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.909> now<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.479> simply<00:01:36.930> put<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
anything so now we just simply put the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.440 
anything so now we just simply put the
actual<00:01:38.159> cable<00:01:38.369> through<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.850> channel<00:01:39.210> here

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
actual cable through the channel here

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.670 
actual cable through the channel here
and<00:01:40.369> now<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:41.430> put<00:01:41.970> our<00:01:42.210> magnetic<00:01:43.020> base<00:01:43.259> and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
and now we put our magnetic base and

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.310 
and now we put our magnetic base and
just<00:01:44.549> attach<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.750> course<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.140> going<00:01:46.259> to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
just attach it and of course is going to

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.280 
just attach it and of course is going to
magnetically<00:01:47.189> attached<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.600> other<00:01:48.780> part

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
magnetically attached to the other part

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.350 
magnetically attached to the other part
so<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.280> all<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.579> assembly<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.119> need<00:01:51.270> to

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
so that is all the assembly we need to

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.210 
so that is all the assembly we need to
do<00:01:51.540> with<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.930> dock<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.439> now<00:01:52.770> we're<00:01:52.950> ready<00:01:52.979> to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
do with the dock and now we're ready to

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.240 
do with the dock and now we're ready to
try<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.700> with<00:01:54.360> our<00:01:54.600> iphone<00:01:54.990> 5<00:01:55.200> dogged<00:01:55.619> onto<00:01:56.130> it

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
try it with our iphone 5 dogged onto it

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.090 
try it with our iphone 5 dogged onto it
now<00:01:57.030> when<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.299> dark<00:01:57.570> my<00:01:57.719> iphone<00:01:58.020> 5<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.710> course

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
now when that dark my iphone 5 of course

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.550 
now when that dark my iphone 5 of course
it<00:01:59.280> does<00:01:59.430> have<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.880> audio<00:02:00.270> jack<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.869> also

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
it does have that audio jack and also

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.100 
it does have that audio jack and also
the<00:02:01.860> lightning<00:02:02.189> cable<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.759> course<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.360> it

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the lightning cable of course and it

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.050 
the lightning cable of course and it
seems<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.469> it's<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:05.130> there<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.759> dogs

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
seems like it's it's on there and dogs

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.479 
seems like it's it's on there and dogs
on<00:02:06.270> there<00:02:06.479> securely<00:02:06.740> without<00:02:07.740> any<00:02:08.129> type<00:02:08.459> of

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
on there securely without any type of

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.330 
on there securely without any type of
wobbling<00:02:09.149> or<00:02:09.330> anything<00:02:09.690> now<00:02:10.379> some<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.310> may

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
wobbling or anything now some of you may

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.520 
wobbling or anything now some of you may
be<00:02:11.520> asking<00:02:12.000> if<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.330> works<00:02:12.720> with<00:02:12.930> cases

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
be asking if this works with cases

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.160 
be asking if this works with cases
now<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.069> did<00:02:14.340> try<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.640> with<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.180> case<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:15.959> had

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
now I did try it with a case that I had

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.410 
now I did try it with a case that I had
laying<00:02:16.440> around<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.950> it's<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.580> idea<00:02:17.970> America

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
laying around and it's the idea America

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.790 
laying around and it's the idea America
case<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.959> this<00:02:19.800> one<00:02:20.040> actually<00:02:20.190> has<00:02:20.459> an<00:02:21.000> open

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
case and this one actually has an open

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.990 
case and this one actually has an open
bottom<00:02:22.800> down<00:02:23.280> there<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.640> has<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.790> little

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
bottom down there it has a little

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.750 
bottom down there it has a little
opening<00:02:24.420> at<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.600> bottom<00:02:24.720> for<00:02:25.440> your<00:02:26.430> audio

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
opening at the bottom for your audio

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.030 
opening at the bottom for your audio
jack<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.690> also<00:02:27.990> your<00:02:28.140> lightning<00:02:28.319> cables<00:02:28.860> so

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
jack and also your lightning cables so

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.760 
jack and also your lightning cables so
it<00:02:29.700> doesn't<00:02:30.030> affect<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.480> so<00:02:30.720> whenever<00:02:31.590> I<00:02:31.680> do

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
it doesn't affect that so whenever I do

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.760 
it doesn't affect that so whenever I do
doc<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.280> on<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:33.000> belkin<00:02:33.600> doc<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:34.290> doesn't

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
doc it on to the belkin doc it doesn't

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.840 
doc it on to the belkin doc it doesn't
affect<00:02:35.220> anything<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:36.120> sits<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.660> there<00:02:36.810> well<00:02:37.050> so

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
affect anything it sits on there well so

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.390 
affect anything it sits on there well so
the<00:02:38.850> answer<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.239> your<00:02:39.959> guys<00:02:40.650> questions<00:02:40.860> if<00:02:41.280> you

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
the answer to your guys questions if you

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.580 
the answer to your guys questions if you
had<00:02:41.700> questions<00:02:42.330> about<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.959> working<00:02:43.380> with

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
had questions about it working with

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.699 
had questions about it working with
cases<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.310> does<00:02:44.790> work<00:02:45.570> with<00:02:46.050> i<00:02:46.320> would<00:02:46.530> say

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
cases it does work with i would say

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.670 
cases it does work with i would say
majority<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.430> cases<00:02:47.700> if<00:02:48.150> not<00:02:48.390> all<00:02:48.660> because<00:02:49.650> of

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
majority of cases if not all because of

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.280 
majority of cases if not all because of
the<00:02:50.010> way<00:02:50.160> that<00:02:50.730> lightning<00:02:51.360> cable<00:02:51.750> sticks<00:02:52.050> out

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
the way that lightning cable sticks out

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.490 
the way that lightning cable sticks out
and<00:02:52.760> also<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.940> audio<00:02:54.330> jack<00:02:54.630> cable<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.410> you

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
and also the audio jack cable and you

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.309 
and also the audio jack cable and you
see<00:02:55.709> here<00:02:55.980> up<00:02:56.280> close<00:02:56.519> so<00:02:57.300> i<00:02:57.330> think<00:02:57.810> it'll<00:02:58.200> work

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
see here up close so i think it'll work

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.040 
see here up close so i think it'll work
with<00:02:58.769> most<00:02:59.010> cases<00:02:59.340> if<00:02:59.730> not<00:03:00.180> all<00:03:00.390> like<00:03:00.600> i<00:03:00.780> said

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
with most cases if not all like i said

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.320 
with most cases if not all like i said
now<00:03:01.500> what<00:03:01.680> if<00:03:01.800> you<00:03:01.950> didn't<00:03:02.280> want<00:03:02.489> this<00:03:02.850> audio

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
now what if you didn't want this audio

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.509 
now what if you didn't want this audio
jack<00:03:03.690> sticking<00:03:04.230> out<00:03:04.350> there<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:05.040> want<00:03:05.280> to

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
jack sticking out there and you want to

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.690 
jack sticking out there and you want to
dock<00:03:05.790> other<00:03:06.090> things<00:03:06.450> well<00:03:07.140> simply<00:03:07.800> unattach

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
dock other things well simply unattach

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.059 
dock other things well simply unattach
the<00:03:09.150> little<00:03:09.540> magnetic<00:03:09.810> base<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.440> then<00:03:10.890> now<00:03:11.010> we

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
the little magnetic base and then now we

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.150 
the little magnetic base and then now we
can<00:03:11.280> flip<00:03:11.489> this<00:03:11.700> down<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.450> we<00:03:13.410> just<00:03:13.680> have<00:03:13.920> our

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
can flip this down and we just have our

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.000 
can flip this down and we just have our
lightning<00:03:14.489> cable<00:03:15.090> sticking<00:03:15.870> out<00:03:15.989> so<00:03:16.650> now<00:03:16.980> for

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
lightning cable sticking out so now for

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.210 
lightning cable sticking out so now for
example<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:17.730> can<00:03:17.910> dock<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.560> actual<00:03:19.560> iPad

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
example you can dock and actual iPad

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.880 
example you can dock and actual iPad
Mini<00:03:20.489> which<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:21.090> something<00:03:21.630> I<00:03:21.840> tried<00:03:22.200> now<00:03:22.860> I

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
Mini which is something I tried now I

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.560 
Mini which is something I tried now I
don't<00:03:23.010> think<00:03:23.220> I've<00:03:23.310> shown<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.730> yet<00:03:23.970> but<00:03:24.000> it

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
don't think I've shown this yet but it

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.690 
don't think I've shown this yet but it
does<00:03:24.780> have<00:03:24.989> an<00:03:25.170> auxiliary<00:03:25.709> port<00:03:26.070> back<00:03:26.250> here<00:03:26.549> so

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
does have an auxiliary port back here so

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.870 
does have an auxiliary port back here so
you<00:03:26.760> can<00:03:26.910> plug<00:03:27.840> in<00:03:28.019> some<00:03:28.200> headphones<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:29.070> also

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
you can plug in some headphones and also

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.729 
you can plug in some headphones and also
some<00:03:30.090> speakers<00:03:30.480> if<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.870> wanted<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.320> wow<00:03:31.530> this

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
some speakers if you wanted to wow this

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.940 
some speakers if you wanted to wow this
is<00:03:31.920> docked<00:03:32.250> so<00:03:33.019> when<00:03:34.019> this<00:03:34.170> is<00:03:34.320> docked<00:03:34.650> of

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
is docked so when this is docked of

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.140 
is docked so when this is docked of
course<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.579> will<00:03:35.730> need<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:35.940> have<00:03:36.090> that

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
course you will need to have that

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.120 
course you will need to have that
headphone<00:03:36.660> jack<00:03:36.989> sticking<00:03:37.380> up<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:37.769> plugged

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
case and even a smart cover on it so it

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.199 
case and even a smart cover on it so it
will<00:04:01.350> work<00:04:01.560> with<00:04:01.590> cases<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.430> course<00:04:02.790> not<00:04:02.970> all

will work with cases of course not all
of<00:04:03.390> cases<00:04:03.780> because<00:04:04.109> i<00:04:04.140> know<00:04:04.260> with<00:04:04.470> ipad<00:04:04.859> mini's

of cases because i know with ipad mini's
there<00:04:05.459> will<00:04:05.579> be<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:05.730> little<00:04:06.000> bulkier<00:04:06.660> and<00:04:06.810> it

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
there will be a little bulkier and it

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.370 
there will be a little bulkier and it
won't<00:04:07.680> have<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.010> much<00:04:08.519> room<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:09.230> support<00:04:10.230> a

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.949 
won't have that much room to support a
case<00:04:10.680> so<00:04:11.400> i<00:04:11.730> have<00:04:12.030> it<00:04:12.239> with<00:04:12.390> just<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.780> simple

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
case so i have it with just a simple

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.550 
case so i have it with just a simple
back<00:04:13.320> cover<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:13.950> also<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.760> smart<00:04:15.359> cover<00:04:15.600> and<00:04:16.320> it

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
back cover and also a smart cover and it

back cover and also a smart cover and it
worked<00:04:16.739> fine<00:04:16.919> but<00:04:17.910> other<00:04:18.060> than<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.269> guys

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.449 
worked fine but other than that guys
that's<00:04:19.049> going<00:04:19.200> to<00:04:19.260> be<00:04:19.320> it<00:04:19.440> for<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.680> review<00:04:19.799> if

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459
