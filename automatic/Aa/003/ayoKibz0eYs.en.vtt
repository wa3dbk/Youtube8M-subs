00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
time we started with the usual suspects

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.580 
time we started with the usual suspects
that<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.939> we<00:00:21.060> first<00:00:21.359> replace<00:00:21.689> all<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.260> spark

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
that is we first replace all the spark

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.920 
that is we first replace all the spark
plugs<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.039> ignition<00:00:23.640> coils<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.090> even<00:00:24.359> all<00:00:24.570> six

injectors<00:00:31.800> being<00:00:32.040> brand<00:00:32.369> new<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:33.149> continued

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
injectors being brand new we continued

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.260 
injectors being brand new we continued
by<00:00:33.809> replacing<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.469> EGR<00:00:34.770> valve<00:00:35.160> as<00:00:35.370> well<00:00:35.430> but

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
by replacing the EGR valve as well but

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.630 
by replacing the EGR valve as well but
that<00:00:36.450> didn't<00:00:36.750> help<00:00:36.960> either<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.800> now<00:00:38.040> these<00:00:38.340> two

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
that didn't help either so now these two

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.630 
that didn't help either so now these two
sensors<00:00:38.940> are<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.360> next<00:00:39.600> logical<00:00:39.899> step<00:00:40.640> this

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
sensors are the next logical step this

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.750 
sensors are the next logical step this
is<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> fairly<00:00:42.300> easy<00:00:42.660> job<00:00:43.370> provided<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.520> you

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
is a fairly easy job provided that you

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.660 
is a fairly easy job provided that you
don't<00:00:45.180> mind<00:00:45.480> working<00:00:46.079> under<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.559> car<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.129> you

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
don't mind working under the car and you

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.180 
don't mind working under the car and you
can<00:00:47.879> also<00:00:48.120> locate<00:00:48.570> where<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.379> parts<00:00:49.739> are<00:00:49.890> in

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
can also locate where the parts are in

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.549 
can also locate where the parts are in
the<00:00:50.489> engine<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.660> always<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> good<00:00:52.199> idea<00:00:52.320> to
