00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 the answer, sorry, they took it from me 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.980
 context to me they asked me the 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.730
 direction of the court and I said no 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.769
 I knew because I really did not know and 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.110
 ask any other player 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.969
 club if you know the address of lanús and 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.119
 I guess you will answer the same no 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.460
 but but good was taken out of context and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.769
 I think he did not know and and daily he put together 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.110
 as if the same was a provocation 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.090
 obviously I'm sorry 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.440
 you see yourself on the court out there doing 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.810
 those gestures and obviously that the truth 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.120
 I 'm sorry but good was the 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.070
 moment and also as I said before no no 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.320
 is for justifying me but but the 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.900
 reality is that one is accumulating things 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.190
 the match is hot 15 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.250
 seconds that I catch the ball 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.190
 insulted before they said everything and good 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.770
 one beyond the professional is also 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.860
 human and reacts from a lot of 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.390
 way I'm not also a fan of lanús and 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.960
 I gestured around 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.960
 but the rivalry is there I am a fan 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.300
 of the club and it took obviously very bad 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.100
 but but nothing, no, I'm not an instigator of 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.380
 violence in a violent as I heard 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.750
 in a lot of places or anything by the 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.630
 style I do not think that self-criticism has 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.280
 to be of all not also the fan 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.080
 may be entitled to anything 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.060
 say anything and we for him 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.240
 by the fact of being professionals 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.940
 we have to shut up anything is 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.490
 difficult is difficult but the good I think 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.680
 that anyone has taken out in his 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.149
 moment even you are like a 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.210
 journalist when people tell you of 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.830
 everything is not easy to put the barrier a 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.149
 meter further back no and then there is 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.630
 when I say no 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.329
 obviously in a high tone 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.119
 and lousteau decides to get me yellow but 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.729
 there was no reason to delay and the play 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.880
 it was the same and the second yellow gives me 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.229
 the feeling that was played 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.680
 of yellows that decided not to remove it and to 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.320
 I played very fast I do not think it 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.659
 I know somehow how to compensate not 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.670
 what I had done that I do not think 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.009
 had expelled us in more the way that 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.269
 the banfield players do not like 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.400
 matching in some way but but 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.409
 good 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.780
 the referee can also be wrong 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.189
 you have to accept are the rules but 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.640
 it was like he saw himself coming 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:25.750
 the very very rushed card with the 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.910
 players of lanús and the truth that 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.680
 that out there you could see that you could come 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.170
 go matching a bit the things of that 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.680
 way but not everything is human and you can 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.690
 wrong 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.420
 lautaro some consideration has made 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.580
 Guillermo after the game over there 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.580
 to finish with eleven matches 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.260
 If I had done it before 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.020
 I had referred to the whole team 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.780
 that to win the games we had to 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.060
 finish with eleven that these types of 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.560
 party was very difficult with inferiority 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.600
 No, I did not know what to do 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.990
 stupidity and the truth that 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.570
 I was good in my case it was not like that and good 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:12.900
 I explained the situation of exclusion 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:15.689
 and beyond obviously justifying me 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.909
 I'm not right I have to obviously 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:21.810
 adjust some things that I come 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:24.299
 working and they really do not serve me 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.019
 neither me nor the team 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:30.480
 about this I wanted to ask you why 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.489
 I notice as a contrary profile what 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.230
 are you saying in the last stages of 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:38.069
 your career, on the contrary, I see you as 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:41.110
 every day more irritated in the field 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:44.320
 very protestón game 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.930
 as very high all the time or to 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.760
 sometimes rightly sometimes for no reason but 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.230
 it gives the impression that it is calling 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.660
 Attention this you said just as 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.100
 that you were working on this topic of how 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.920
 relate to the knowledge of the 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.270
 boqueteros like all the time on the edge 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.270
 of a nervous breakdown 'shall we say 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:11.030
 if it's my way of playing out there now 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:14.000
 that I am more exposed cmb but from 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.329
 that of you with 17 years old that I am from the 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.370
 same way the Argentine player is 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.109
 complicated in general not but but good 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.600
 not talking about my particular case 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.410
 obviously he tried to correct the 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.690
 things without that I do 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.840
 out there gives the impression that I am now 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.540
 more protective more protest not or something like that 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.120
 but I really was always that my 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.010
 way to be 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:43.080
 and that he tried to correct it for not right 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:46.620
 because of any kind you talked to 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.860
 walter erviti because they are known by mouth 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.449
 they greeted each other friendly and 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.710
 during the match afterwards from 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.979
 your expulsion is seen and he was seen very 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.690
 angry at him for your attitude and for the 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.090
 you had the chance to communicate and I do not know 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:04.220
 yes to apologize but to talk 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.220
 with him or you did not do it you will not do it 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.720
 no no no no I did not speak with the truth 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.710
 what 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.320
 can not talk we do not communicate and 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:18.160
 for me, beyond what happened and 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.050
 that I repeat again I said 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.170
 an earlier interview for me to me not 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:26.290
 I liked what he said beyond that 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.180
 I did not like that for me, things are left 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.540
 inside the court for me the friendship 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.560
 that I have with return 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:36.440
 it does not stop being equal and for me this 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.480
 is inside the court after good 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.000
 for him he will be able to take it from different 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.480
 ways but mine is within the 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.480
 court nothing
