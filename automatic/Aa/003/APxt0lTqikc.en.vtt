00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:09.839
 how 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.930
 after in this section have 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:25.100
 past famous the likes of mayweather 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:27.890
 Paul Walker Christian Ronaldo and Messi 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.130
 today it's the turn of someone to give it to me 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.010
 you have been asking for 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.190
 practically the beginning of the series and 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.940
 if today we are going to talk a little bit about 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.220
 vin diesel this american actor 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.760
 known by the vast majority of the public 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:54.140
 for the fast and movie saga 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:56.780
 furious was born on July 18 , 1967 in 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.480
 the city ​​of new york fits to stand out 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.179
 that much of the success of this 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.000
 actor is because of the movie series 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:08.060
 of fast and furious but it has also 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.970
 starred and directed other films 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.510
 as for example the chronicles of riddick 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.150
 the pacifier or pitch black 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.700
 and as silly and curious fact of the day you 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.190
 I will say that this actor really is not 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.820
 bald although in the vast majority of his 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.140
 movies appear with shaved hair 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.360
 certainly it does have hair what 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.120
 What happens is that he likes to take it 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.460
 style that takes it and good leaving this 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.520
 little nonsense on the side I did not know how 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.700
 focus on this section to vin diesel if 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.280
 from the perspective of fast toretto 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.670
 and furious or if from the perspective 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.979
 of the diesel vin actor but good as 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.070
 Many have asked me this way or at 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.250
 less this video is going to devote to the 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.150
 fast and toretto perspective 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.820
 furious so what car is the most 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.550
 he likes toretto in what comes 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.650
 being as fast and furious saga 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.869
 good if we start thinking the truth 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.330
 is that it's a complicated question there 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.240
 seven movies in which he has 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.240
 used different cars but good 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:22.520
 today I'm going to focus on one 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:25.220
 the dodge charger of 1970 the one that uses 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.610
 if I 'm not wrong in two or three 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.420
 first movies that car plus everything 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.810
 pretty pretty rude and big and 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.060
 that if we analyze it from the 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.940
 perspective of gta there is enough controversy 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.150
 in it because well simply 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.660
 because there are two cars which the 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:51.110
 people argue enough whether it is one or the 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.860
 another the first one inside gta always what 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.290
 I remember it would be the duke or you know 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.580
 that car that can only be bought in 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.460
 the story mode and the second the second 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.750
 of the controversy would be the bigger or the 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.160
 truth is that the two look alike 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.470
 quite 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.700
 both are quite inspired by the 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.660
 dodge charger dodge charger of 1970 but 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.740
 good that I leave you at your choice 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.580
 comment on comments 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:25.700
 which of the two seems more successful 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.340
 and little more thing in this section today 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.490
 remember that down in the comments I 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.640
 you can leave to what famous you want that 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:37.520
 do or dedicate this next video of 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.220
 this section and nothing we see in a 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.430
 next video a salutary and up 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.430
 soon
