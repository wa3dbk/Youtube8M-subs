00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.690
 those pilots crazy short sports goal that we suddenly see you got there 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.820
 it is mainly waiting 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.899
 especially 

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:11.899
 after my goal 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:14.929
 although the cda 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.929
 Mario leg 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.140
 cheaper but more came 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.329
 I think it's a hot tip 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.470
 it's a storm 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.470
 the article 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.250
 we can also on 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.810
 give it a try 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.760
 tip 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.020
 I doubt 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.020
 he also explained 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.930
 except that leaves the market 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.950
 as an adult 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.800
 the brit 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.920
 with a win they get 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.060
 club Brugge 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.070
 after sending away 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.070
 I look forward to it 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.420
 Marc Janko 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.520
 lombardy 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.520
 all pepper 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.330
 the second quarter 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.750
 I have the margin for a while 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.590
 be sure 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.270
 according to corporate director 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.040
 but the temporary nature knows what you're used to 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.770
 thereby can be refused defense 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.080
 steve mcclaren 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.470
 because actually 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.370
 8 city 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.640
 but according to the boys, we already reported that it will continue 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.840
 the desk 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.180
 start there 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.019
 Yes really 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.559
 9 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:14.820
 those pilots loved sports 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.610
