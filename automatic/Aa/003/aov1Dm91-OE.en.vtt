starting<00:00:28.150> off<00:00:28.210> the<00:00:28.330> first<00:00:28.660> part<00:00:29.130> open<00:00:30.130> D

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
starting off the first part open D

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.240 
starting off the first part open D
string<00:00:30.369> and<00:00:31.890> then<00:00:32.890> we're<00:00:32.980> going<00:00:33.070> to<00:00:33.129> play

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.630 
back to open D 7 on G back to open D 5
and<00:00:55.629> then<00:00:56.530> back<00:00:56.710> to<00:00:56.860> open<00:00:57.070> D<00:00:57.190> right<00:00:57.430> away
