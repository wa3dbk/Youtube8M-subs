00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.660
 welcome all viewers of my channel 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.950
 today for review and want to show you here 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.950
 such a cuckoo clock 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:27.410
 my watch case is made of wood 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:27.410
 the front part is made of plastic 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:40.100
 arrows throwing everywhere I as leads in 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.100
 movement two 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:50.399
 left and sets in motion a mechanism about 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:59.510
 ticks of the right and Ira leads the movement 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:01:03.680
 the battle mechanism on the left is 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:08.689
 window to be convenient 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.689
 chain up the pinion gear 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:20.159
 right is exactly the same window 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:26.490
 so that it is convenient to fill the chain on 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:30.600
 mind feminine mechanism of combat also with 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:35.430
 the right window is a lever for 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:45.890
 to adjust the correctness of the battle each 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:45.890
 every half hour there is a howl 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:06.840
 when will be four o'clock 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:10.040
 punch four times you see frequent 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.670
 show 4 colors 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:20.760
 Abel only three times for this and need 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:24.390
 lever to crank up the battle mechanism we 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.710
 click on it until the clock 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.710
 struck four times 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.080
 here the clock struck four times this 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.720
 clean parts 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:58.430
 tuned in next 1 hour and will 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:03:01.780
 one break for half an hour and at 5 o'clock already 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.780
 will beat five 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:34.689
 about setting the input is there a clock 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:39.129
 hanged they don't go need to shift them 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:44.109
 or left or right here so see 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:47.919
 I shifted they stopped need them 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:51.849
 align so that the pendulum cat was 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:04:02.950
 stable and clicked in two directions 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:04:16.690
 equally pendulum stroke is stable 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:21.210
 it is correct 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:25.139
 principle on this all put huskies 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.139
 thank you for your attention
