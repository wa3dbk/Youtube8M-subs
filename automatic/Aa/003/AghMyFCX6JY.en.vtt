 Hello guys 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.009
 It's okay, the one who talks to you is the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.380
 maximum 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.630
 and today I'm going to give you a hint of 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.510
 How can you optimize your 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.890
 computer and perform better in the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.080
 conventional use and in the use of more 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.059
 come on let's come here on my 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:40.320
 computer a right mouse button 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:49.619
 properties in advanced settings 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:55.909
 system in the advanced bim performance in 

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:55.909
 settings and here in settings 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:05.960
 place here to adjust for a 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:17.270
 best performance and here we go to the abeta 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:17.270
 only show thumbnails and schemes 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:32.850
 now let's close the second step that 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:36.360
 will disable programs that start 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:41.180
 with windows will encourage here in 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.330
 bay tasks right button too 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.330
 task Manager 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.960
 if for you to appear that way you 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.350
 More details here 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.640
 will this via boot and us here 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.260
 you can view the programs that are 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.260
 started with windows 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:25.970
 here you will select the program that 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:31.130
 Do you want to disable me? 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.590
 I want him to do this program and click on 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.220
 enable 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.950
 here you so here is the wind you 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.180
 only leave the programs that really 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:50.920
 do you want to see with the operating system? 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:55.550
 It's over you leave all rock on 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:59.420
 the third step that will make a 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.480
 cleaning our computer is what 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:11.350
 we had here with the right button of the 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:11.350
 mouse during the team perform the exchange 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.739
 in percentage 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.079
 in this part had people can dispense 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:32.079
 all those who are here and 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.079
 write 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:44.510
 the meat continues to happen over a long period 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:47.960
 and it is not for colleagues to improve and 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.800
 let's enough here that information 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.800
 that are not needed 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:04.060
 here again sakineh type 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.860
 the fourth step we will see here 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:13.800
 run 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:13.800
 Now, we're not just going. Let's go, okay? 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.829
 Let's continue also let's select 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:29.920
 the files that are here because the 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:29.920
 and we will also exclude 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.730
 that could not be deleted does not have 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.730
 as 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:47.270
 closing the next step that in my 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.280
 computer said the place if we go 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:56.260
 mark it by right-clicking the 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:56.260
 mouse properties without disk cleanup 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:04.970
 let's wait for it to load the files 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:14.240
 here you can select all these 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:17.260
 boxes selecting everything ok and 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.260
 discuss that 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:29.669
 finalized to use an ok here I 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:32.520
 I recommend that you use the program 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:35.400
 I know that the year has been here in 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:41.669
 my machine if you have you do not have 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:49.020
 it's worth downloading games here 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:52.979
 need to compensate it here use and 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.189
 open here we can make a new one 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.189
 mp 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.859
 the moblin ps 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:14.489
 and it was in a well recorded environment let's 

00:06:10.859 --> 00:06:20.129
 do a search maybe on some record 

00:06:14.489 --> 00:06:21.839
 Incorrect which located Nigerians 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:28.439
 here you will do a backup or not 

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:31.039
 because it does not correct because it is the company 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:31.039
 close 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.990
 So how do we guys want to have a 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.890
 good performance 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:48.260
 nobody needs them to do is also 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:53.090
 always have on our computer 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:57.890
 the most current drives on the motherboard and 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:07:00.380
 especially the video card 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.660
 the motherboard if you do not know what the 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:06.340
 Motherboard model I recommend you 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:10.130
 use a cpu z here on mother board 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:14.210
 you can see the name of the board 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.680
 in the case of some model and 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.380
 this information that you can enter 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:22.280
 on the motherboard manufacturer's website do 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:24.230
 download the most recent drives and 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:29.240
 so you have the best use 

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:34.490
 Our equipment can also 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:36.910
 one analyzed our video card goes 

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.470
 confirm which is our graphics card 

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.220
 So that's what I want to do. 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.340
 for you 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:46.340
 I hope you enjoyed it if you liked the 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:50.050
 jewel in the channel
