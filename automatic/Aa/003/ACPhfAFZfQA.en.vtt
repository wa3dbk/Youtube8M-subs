around<00:01:14.240> a<00:01:14.750> CD<00:01:15.170> or<00:01:15.490> you<00:01:16.490> could<00:01:16.670> also<00:01:16.850> use<00:01:17.240> a

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
around a CD or you could also use a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.700 
around a CD or you could also use a
saucer<00:01:18.170> just<00:01:18.979> something<00:01:19.369> circular<00:01:20.500> I'm<00:01:21.500> going

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
saucer just something circular I'm going

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.880 
saucer just something circular I'm going
to<00:01:21.770> use<00:01:21.890> a<00:01:21.920> fabric<00:01:22.220> pen<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:23.510> draw<00:01:23.660> around<00:01:24.020> the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
to use a fabric pen to draw around the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.610 
to use a fabric pen to draw around the
city<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.970> advantage<00:01:26.480> of<00:01:26.630> using<00:01:26.690> a<00:01:27.080> vanishing

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
city the advantage of using a vanishing

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.640 
city the advantage of using a vanishing
fabric<00:01:28.130> pen<00:01:28.460> is<00:01:28.730> that<00:01:29.210> you<00:01:29.450> don't<00:01:29.750> get<00:01:29.990> marks

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
fabric pen is that you don't get marks

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.950 
fabric pen is that you don't get marks
on<00:01:30.800> your<00:01:30.920> flowers<00:01:31.420> when<00:01:32.420> you<00:01:32.540> finish<00:01:32.810> with

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
on your flowers when you finish with

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.520 
on your flowers when you finish with
them<00:01:33.140> because<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:34.700> just<00:01:34.850> disappears<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:36.350> once

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
them because it just disappears so once

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.860 
them because it just disappears so once
you've<00:01:36.680> got<00:01:36.830> your<00:01:36.860> circle<00:01:37.430> shape<00:01:37.840> we're<00:01:38.840> going

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
you've got your circle shape we're going

to cut around about a centimeter from
the<00:01:44.990> side<00:01:45.320> in<00:01:45.800> a<00:01:46.220> swirly<00:01:46.790> pattern<00:01:48.910> don't<00:01:49.910> worry

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
the side in a swirly pattern don't worry

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.080 
the side in a swirly pattern don't worry
if<00:01:50.240> it's<00:01:50.450> not<00:01:50.630> completely<00:01:51.200> accurate<00:01:51.940> just<00:01:52.940> as

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
if it's not completely accurate just as

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.910 
if it's not completely accurate just as
long<00:01:53.240> as<00:01:53.360> you've<00:01:53.480> got<00:01:53.510> enough<00:01:53.870> space<00:01:53.920> either

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920

the<00:01:59.360> end<00:01:59.480> and<00:02:00.409> that's<00:02:00.560> going<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:00.800> make<00:02:00.950> the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
the end and that's going to make the

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.070 
the end and that's going to make the
base<00:02:01.280> of<00:02:01.340> our<00:02:01.670> flower<00:02:02.000> I'm<00:02:02.720> going<00:02:02.870> to<00:02:02.930> leave

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
base of our flower I'm going to leave

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.450 
base of our flower I'm going to leave
about<00:02:03.260> that<00:02:03.920> much<00:02:03.980> space<00:02:04.659> and<00:02:05.659> to<00:02:06.380> create<00:02:07.190> this

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
about that much space and to create this

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.809 
about that much space and to create this
kind<00:02:07.700> of<00:02:07.820> petals<00:02:08.330> of<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.599> equity<00:02:09.519> I'm<00:02:10.519> just

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
kind of petals of the equity I'm just

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.580 
kind of petals of the equity I'm just
going<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.269> cut<00:02:11.780> in<00:02:12.019> two

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
going to cut in two

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.059 
going to cut in two
the<00:02:12.709> edge<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:14.150> felt<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:16.010> create<00:02:16.340> like

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
the edge of the felt to create like

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.430 
the edge of the felt to create like
almost<00:02:19.069> like<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.310> wave<00:02:19.610> defect<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.050> petals

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
almost like a wave defect so the petals

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.309 
almost like a wave defect so the petals
are<00:02:21.920> roughly<00:02:22.519> a<00:02:22.640> centimeter<00:02:23.330> along<00:02:23.629> you

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
are roughly a centimeter along you

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.930 
are roughly a centimeter along you
continue<00:02:24.769> until<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.160> reach<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.640> end<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:26.030> your

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
continue until you reach the end of your

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.890 
continue until you reach the end of your
swirl<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:31.030> then<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.180> create<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.660> flower

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
swirl and then to create the flower

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.770 
swirl and then to create the flower
shape<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:33.590> start<00:02:33.920> at<00:02:34.129> the<00:02:34.220> very<00:02:34.400> end<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:35.540> what

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
shape you start at the very end and what

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.770 
shape you start at the very end and what
we're<00:02:35.930> going<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.170> do<00:02:36.379> is<00:02:36.620> just<00:02:37.930> twist<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:41.510> felt

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
we're going to do is just twist the felt

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.500 
we're going to do is just twist the felt
up<00:02:42.049> you<00:02:43.010> can<00:02:43.160> use<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.310> glue<00:02:43.640> gun<00:02:43.910> or<00:02:44.120> you<00:02:44.239> can<00:02:44.360> use

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
up you can use a glue gun or you can use

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.850 
up you can use a glue gun or you can use
tacky<00:02:44.810> glue<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:47.180> I'm<00:02:47.329> just<00:02:47.540> gonna<00:02:47.720> start

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.199 

folding<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:52.250> in<00:02:54.040> as<00:02:55.040> I<00:02:55.310> fold<00:02:55.579> I'm<00:02:55.849> just<00:02:56.060> going

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
folding it in as I fold I'm just going

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.199 
folding it in as I fold I'm just going
to<00:02:56.239> keep<00:02:56.420> adding<00:02:56.599> little<00:02:57.140> bits<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.560> glue<00:02:58.209> just

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
to keep adding little bits of glue just

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.210 
to keep adding little bits of glue just
to<00:02:59.420> keep<00:02:59.599> it<00:02:59.780> in<00:02:59.870> place

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.550 

so<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:05.850> can<00:03:06.120> see<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.420> flowers<00:03:06.840> taking<00:03:07.290> shape

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
so you can see the flowers taking shape

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.520 
so you can see the flowers taking shape
now<00:03:07.770> it<00:03:08.040> really<00:03:08.310> looks<00:03:08.430> like<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.820> real<00:03:09.120> rose

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
now it really looks like a real rose

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.010 
now it really looks like a real rose
this<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.590> where<00:03:10.890> we<00:03:11.010> attach<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.610> base<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.750> I'm

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
this is where we attach the base so I'm

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.610 
this is where we attach the base so I'm
gonna<00:03:13.110> add<00:03:13.350> glue<00:03:13.710> onto<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.190> bottom<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:16.170> then

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
gonna add glue onto the bottom and then

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.460 
gonna add glue onto the bottom and then
that<00:03:16.830> just<00:03:17.040> covers<00:03:17.370> up<00:03:17.580> all<00:03:18.020> the<00:03:19.020> extra<00:03:19.350> bits

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
that just covers up all the extra bits

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.570 
that just covers up all the extra bits
and<00:03:19.770> becomes<00:03:20.250> an<00:03:20.910> extra<00:03:21.240> petal<00:03:21.950> so<00:03:22.950> then<00:03:23.460> you

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
and becomes an extra petal so then you

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.250 
and becomes an extra petal so then you
can<00:03:23.730> stick<00:03:24.030> your<00:03:24.060> flowers<00:03:24.600> using<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.050> glue

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
can stick your flowers using the glue

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.160 
can stick your flowers using the glue
gun<00:03:25.290> onto<00:03:25.800> your<00:03:26.100> wreath<00:03:26.310> you<00:03:26.720> can<00:03:27.720> decorate<00:03:27.930> it

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
gun onto your wreath you can decorate it

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.650 
gun onto your wreath you can decorate it
however<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:28.800> like

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
however you like

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.330 
however you like
but<00:03:30.660> I<00:03:30.690> think<00:03:30.870> having<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.680> around<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.070> base<00:03:32.310> of

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
but I think having it around the base of

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.030 
but I think having it around the base of
the<00:03:32.670> wreath<00:03:32.880> or<00:03:33.090> just<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.630> one<00:03:33.840> side<00:03:34.170> gives<00:03:34.920> a

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
the wreath or just to one side gives a

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.470 
the wreath or just to one side gives a
really<00:03:35.310> nice<00:03:35.460> effect<00:03:37.850> there<00:03:38.850> we<00:03:39.000> go<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:39.390> that's

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
really nice effect there we go so that's

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.060 
really nice effect there we go so that's
the<00:03:39.690> last<00:03:39.930> flower<00:03:42.260> so<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.350> can<00:03:43.500> see<00:03:43.680> how<00:03:43.860> we've

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.650
