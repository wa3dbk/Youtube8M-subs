 they are built-in automatically 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.160

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.109

 had just come out and when I already 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.810
 a few days before it can 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.640
 I also have to enter the game earlier 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.769
 my hand only had 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.870

 somewhat competitive a bit of poo 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.079
 blunt et cetera et cetera 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.520
 and he bought call of duty ghosts yesterday 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.510
 and he has already had it a bit 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.800
 with the game he needs a little more 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.510
 so income 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.280
 he thinks of cherry trees there very quickly 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.600
 dead he just needs an income and the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.340
 candidate game also play chill 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.289
 but he just sent me a picture 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.820
 about skype and that image makes me 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.649
 really just laughing because i will 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.870
 one at the bottom right of the screen 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.820
 you can also see it for yourself and sit on it 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.170
 the image on the left because its two 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.390
 image in one on the left 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.979
 image see the may dream and of 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.960
 modern warfare 3 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.640
 everyone knows someone really just the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.290
 everyone's favorite folder 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.760
 who must be who have played 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.040
 personally not found my favorite man 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.750
 I from a little too small and occasionally none 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.369
 I play this comes the go and 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.640
 very first time that can stuff citigo 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.960
 I almost pan again on mars iphone and 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.450
 I had that with more sports travel 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.920
 there is what is really very small and 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.689
 that's exactly the same with the mug 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.100
 Thomas I thought a little okay two 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.500
 little snacks that will take a little bit 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.880
 resemble each other and then the studio has to 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.930
 so just that image and on the left 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.180
 matsier is the folder 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.850
 tone from mondorf 3 and on the straight maxi 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.009
 the websites and which I like here and on 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.110
 you just see it is exactly the same 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.369
 it really is exactly the same they have 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.500
 added a few things 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.820
 they have changed a few things but 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.390
 it's just still precise 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.820
 the same 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.829
 I'm walking now but I'm just coming out 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.570
 I walked into the cottage that was the 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.689
 dead of tomorrow 3 that I now have to go to 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.000
 so walk to the battle like me 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.219
 the pastor 's good is the cottage 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.049
 of the market uncle is where I am walking now 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.850
 is the mold tree's house there 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.350
 right that flag then you go pastor 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.000
 plays websites and sits there again 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.310
 flag so just really think it's normal 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.990
 brilliant that they have by 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.690
 reduced 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.450
 8 in call or duty ghost but in total 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.340
 another way it is totally different 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.710
 environment it is totally different folder 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.870
 but again the same folder with 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.460
 almost exactly the same formats 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.530
 a few more roads 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.750
 if that houses are standing behind me 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.920
 there is an extra corridor in it 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.320
 bringing you to the center of the mat 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.150
 can come if I am red here 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.190
 instead of going down the stairs 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.750
 there is no more stairs there are no points 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.820
 the more they are a few small 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.590
 but it is still different 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.060
 just exactly the same folder as you 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.650
 look at the bottom right on the card 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.270
 the videos you see it added 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.010
 both mop dome you see two steps 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.500
 sit if you are a bit left at the bottom 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.200
 look go look and hit him or something like that 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.870
 See you in exactly the same place you see 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.480
 two tabs is in it is normal 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.040
 exactly the same folder and here you also see 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.870
 back down a ladder if you know the bunker 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.000
 walking in and out is another one 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.120
 hill so it's just exactly 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.710
 created a totally new one in the same folder 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.930
 and so it like on a new folder 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.030
 while exactly the same I 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.990
 think it's downright genius I now know about it 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.490
 more such folders 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.560
 added in call of duty ghosts with 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.990
 this one that I did so far 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.690
 and i love it i hope if 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.760
 make remakes of, for example 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.160
 folders from morpher 3 as they did 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.050
 in black or two of black obscene such as 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.830
 the mepsche with uplink went crazy 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.400
 stage 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.170
 and the folder was no longer a clue there 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.970
 A few remixing is also made like that 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.680
 they are also going to do cozy in the coast 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.930
 I hope she does it that way 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.580
 act like the weird struise because you play 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.170
 now from the moto 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.730
 write such is the new man shows so 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.370
 if you have dome in chilling folders 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.110
 found in call of duty mole deposit 3 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.340
 I also advise you to just know the journey 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.560
 to play such a game because it is precise 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.540
 the same folder is only it is slightly 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.440
 otherwise made are a few extra cash 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.940
 is added 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.160
 we are a few things in the middle 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.920
 crammed from the folder like houses 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.150
 while those two round houses at the 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.550
 kick you up 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.709
 the huffy or the tank 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.890
 presented in 3 moodle warfare on the mug 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.800
 show this truck that you state that 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.200
 represents that wall if you are the bunker 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.989
 spout the first thing that is new is it 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.669
 this cam you sport up there that was there 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.470
 not only there you could do a bit 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.639
 on default to which their feed is where you 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.259
 just that person painter 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.419
 and you can also jump on the herbie 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.770
 I think it's really brilliant 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.090
 he also takes brilliant pass them 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.650
 video and briefly thumbs up and wants 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.240
 you have even more matte of this kind 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.099
 that was actually exactly the same as 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.969
 marv three out of a total of another 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:39.680
 approach 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:42.020
 let's know for a moment because I think so 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.460
 genius to know the image can 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.199
 see you for yourself i will still 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.759
 once enlarged image so can 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:49.009
 you compare for yourself 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.419
 the dome is front in cottage the cottage is 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.389
 The bunker is just houses 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.310
 changed to open and ria and for the rest 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.210
 is just fun same and i love it 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.550
 downright 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.379
 genius than watching people cruel 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.340
 please don't like it and say for it 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:04.629
 now to people 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.629
 time and again and bye bye
