00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
wedding appropriate I'm not sure if it's

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.070 
wedding appropriate I'm not sure if it's
because<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.090> different<00:00:30.480> lighting<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
because of the different lighting and

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.650 
because of the different lighting and
the<00:00:31.140> camera<00:00:31.619> angles<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.579> when<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.059> was<00:00:33.270> looking

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
the camera angles but when I was looking

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.150 
the camera angles but when I was looking
through<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.050> video<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.620> looking<00:00:35.010> through

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
through the video and looking through
