I<00:04:07.310> do<00:04:07.519> agree<00:04:07.970> that<00:04:08.209> student<00:04:08.690> interests<00:04:09.620> aren't

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
I do agree that student interests aren't

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.300 
I do agree that student interests aren't
being<00:04:10.580> met<00:04:10.879> though<00:04:11.180> I<00:04:11.420> do<00:04:11.480> know

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
being met though I do know

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.280 
being met though I do know
and<00:04:12.520> like<00:04:12.700> it's<00:04:12.880> absolutely<00:04:13.120> ridiculous<00:04:13.959> I<00:04:14.230> do

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
and like it's absolutely ridiculous I do

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.949 
and like it's absolutely ridiculous I do
agree<00:04:14.650> but<00:04:15.400> what's<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:16.000> Dora<00:04:16.269> said<00:04:16.540> earlier

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.170 
agree but what's the Dora said earlier
at<00:04:17.769> this<00:04:17.920> point<00:04:18.220> I<00:04:18.340> don't<00:04:18.430> think<00:04:18.760> we<00:04:18.880> should<00:04:18.910> go

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
at this point I don't think we should go

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.699 
at this point I don't think we should go
back<00:04:19.359> like<00:04:19.600> our<00:04:19.750> money<00:04:19.930> should<00:04:20.139> be<00:04:20.290> returned

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
back like our money should be returned

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.170 
back like our money should be returned
and<00:04:20.980> this<00:04:21.100> time<00:04:21.340> should<00:04:21.489> be<00:04:21.549> taken<00:04:21.970> for

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
and this time should be taken for

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.830 
and this time should be taken for
students<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.780> work<00:04:22.990> so<00:04:23.770> that<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:25.150> Union<00:04:25.630> can

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
students to work so that the Union can

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.409 
students to work so that the Union can
resolve<00:04:26.260> this<00:04:26.560> like<00:04:26.919> this<00:04:27.340> time<00:04:27.610> they've<00:04:28.389> been

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
resolve this like this time they've been

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.360
