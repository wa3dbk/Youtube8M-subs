to ski slow to medium speeds okay and
some<00:00:32.460> construction<00:00:33.120> features<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.690> it's

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
some construction features that it's

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.810 
some construction features that it's
going<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.200> help<00:00:34.440> them<00:00:34.739> get<00:00:35.370> better<00:00:35.550> and

going to help them get better and

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.130 
going to help them get better and
progress<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.300> next<00:00:36.540> level<00:00:36.780> are<00:00:36.840> going<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.050> be

progress the next level are going to be
what<00:00:37.350> yeah<00:00:37.739> we<00:00:37.950> do<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> load<00:00:38.489> bearing<00:00:38.730> cap<00:00:39.059> with

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
what yeah we do a load bearing cap with

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.639 
what yeah we do a load bearing cap with
this<00:00:39.390> ski<00:00:39.600> we<00:00:39.780> do<00:00:39.899> one<00:00:40.110> layer<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.469> fiberglass

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
this ski we do one layer of fiberglass

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.209 
this ski we do one layer of fiberglass
so<00:00:41.640> creates<00:00:42.059> great<00:00:42.329> torsional<00:00:42.780> rigidity<00:00:43.219> but

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
so creates great torsional rigidity but

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.790 
so creates great torsional rigidity but
it<00:00:44.340> does<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.700> with<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> while<00:00:46.050> maintaining<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
it does it with a while maintaining a

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.130 
it does it with a while maintaining a
real<00:00:46.980> lightweight<00:00:47.340> ski<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> composite

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
real lightweight ski and the composite

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.479 
real lightweight ski and the composite
core<00:00:49.260> helps<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.770> definitely

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
core helps with that definitely

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.880 
core helps with that definitely
composite<00:00:51.090> core<00:00:51.239> versus<00:00:51.690> wood<00:00:51.930> makes<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.649> ski

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
composite core versus wood makes the ski

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.689 
composite core versus wood makes the ski
lighter<00:00:53.190> livelier<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.160> skier<00:00:56.489> will

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
lighter livelier and so the skier will

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.790 
lighter livelier and so the skier will
get<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> little<00:00:57.210> bit<00:00:57.329> more<00:00:57.570> energy<00:00:57.899> out<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
get a little bit more energy out of the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.010 
get a little bit more energy out of the
ski<00:00:59.010> okay<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.699> some<00:01:00.329> things<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.660> help<00:01:00.899> make

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
ski okay and some things that help make

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.189 
ski okay and some things that help make
this<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.579> quiet<00:01:02.579> calm<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.390> know<00:01:03.510> smooth<00:01:03.870> ride

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
this a quiet calm you know smooth ride

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.660 
this a quiet calm you know smooth ride
for<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.589> ladies<00:01:04.920> are<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.400> stuff

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
like the pauls pad2002 okay which is a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.950 
like the pauls pad2002 okay which is a
tip<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.299> isn't<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.880> upright<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.689> helps

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
tip that isn't so upright so it helps

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.990 
tip that isn't so upright so it helps
hug<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.380> snow<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.280> you're<00:01:17.400> going<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.580> get<00:01:17.759> a

better<00:01:18.210> contact<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> front<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.409> ski

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
better contact in the front of the ski

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.649 
better contact in the front of the ski
and<00:01:19.860> then<00:01:20.400> as<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.790> mentioned<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.180> pulse<00:01:21.420> pad

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and then as you mentioned the pulse pad

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.840 
and then as you mentioned the pulse pad
which<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> vibration<00:01:23.070> dampening<00:01:23.670> layer

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
which is a vibration dampening layer

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.030 
which is a vibration dampening layer
that's<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.509> over<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> edge<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.770> when<00:01:25.920> you're

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
power line for women yeah the power line

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.170 
power line for women yeah the power line
for<00:01:34.140> women<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.619> designed<00:01:35.460> for<00:01:35.670> shock

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
for women is designed for shock

for women is designed for shock
absorption<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.560> help<00:01:37.770> with<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> little<00:01:38.970> bit

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
absorption and to help with a little bit

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.080 
absorption and to help with a little bit
of<00:01:39.329> energy<00:01:39.540> transfer<00:01:40.170> from<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.439> skier<00:01:40.939> to<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
of energy transfer from the skier to the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.249 
of energy transfer from the skier to the
ski<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:43.799> lime<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.869> little<00:01:45.869> bit<00:01:46.020> wider

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
ski and the lime is a little bit wider

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.130 
ski and the lime is a little bit wider
in<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.890> tip<00:01:47.159> okay<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.759> full<00:01:48.270> centimeter<00:01:48.810> water

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
in the tip okay a full centimeter water

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.469 
in the tip okay a full centimeter water
in<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> tip<00:01:49.710> then<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.460> lagoon<00:01:50.850> which<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
in the tip then the lagoon which is the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.359 
in the tip then the lagoon which is the
next<00:01:51.630> model<00:01:52.049> down<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.040> going<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.189> have

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
next model down so it's going to have

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.100 
next model down so it's going to have
more<00:01:53.640> psychotic<00:01:54.180> oh<00:01:54.360> it's<00:01:54.720> going<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.960> work

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
more psychotic oh it's going to work
