00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
does that have to do just because the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.699 
does that have to do just because the
expectations<00:02:18.989> are<00:02:19.080> high<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.200> get<00:02:19.440> him<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
expectations are high you get him in the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.380 
expectations are high you get him in the
stadium's<00:02:20.160> container<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:20.940> good<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.300> good

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
stadium's container is a good a good

opportunity<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.319> may<00:02:22.590> be<00:02:23.010> something<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.459> do

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
opportunity it may be something to do

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.160 
opportunity it may be something to do
with<00:02:23.640> expectations<00:02:24.390> probably<00:02:24.720> more<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.140> just

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
with expectations probably more so just

end of the first week and I don't think

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.110 
end of the first week and I don't think
it<00:02:28.709> wasn't<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.069> willingness<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:30.000> just

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
it wasn't the willingness to it just

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.640 
it wasn't the willingness to it just
didn't<00:02:30.390> look<00:02:30.420> like<00:02:30.510> they<00:02:30.840> were<00:02:30.870> as<00:02:31.110> fresh<00:02:31.410> as

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
something new and they seemed acting

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.650 
something new and they seemed acting
real<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.890> like<00:02:41.129> the<00:02:41.280> talent<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.790> like<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.180> pace<00:02:42.420> I

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
real I like the talent I like the pace I

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.690 
real I like the talent I like the pace I
like<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.989> consistency<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.890> I've<00:02:44.069> liked<00:02:44.340> the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
like the consistency and I've liked the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.910 
like the consistency and I've liked the
execution<00:02:45.390> for<00:02:45.840> all<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.709> you<00:02:46.769> just

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
execution for all that that you just

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.520 
execution for all that that you just
mentioned<00:02:47.099> for<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.819> first<00:02:48.120> six<00:02:49.050> or<00:02:49.260> seven

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
mentioned for the first six or seven

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.130 
mentioned for the first six or seven
days<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.480> probably<00:02:51.480> ahead<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.840> where<00:02:52.110> I

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
days so probably ahead of where I

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.690 
days so probably ahead of where I
thought<00:02:52.470> we<00:02:52.680> would<00:02:52.830> be<00:02:52.980> if<00:02:53.129> I<00:02:53.220> had<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.550> be

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
thought we would be if I had to be

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.330 
thought we would be if I had to be
pinpointed<00:02:54.030> down

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
pinpointed down

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.470 
pinpointed down
but<00:02:56.340> I'd<00:02:56.430> like<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.640> hear<00:02:56.909> it<00:02:56.970> sound<00:02:57.299> different

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
but I'd like to hear it sound different

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.509 
but I'd like to hear it sound different
and<00:02:57.840> look<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.110> be<00:02:58.230> faster<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:58.860> conditioning<00:02:59.430> is

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
and look to be faster so conditioning is

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.949 
and look to be faster so conditioning is
still<00:02:59.549> going<00:02:59.819> to<00:02:59.879> be<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.060> huge<00:03:00.209> factor<00:03:00.480> with<00:03:00.840> the

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
still going to be a huge factor with the

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.410 
still going to be a huge factor with the
temple<00:03:01.319> and<00:03:01.760> defensively<00:03:02.760> that's<00:03:03.209> what<00:03:03.390> I

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
temple and defensively that's what I

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.759 
temple and defensively that's what I
noticed<00:03:03.780> most<00:03:03.900> today<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.290> took<00:03:04.409> more<00:03:04.620> of<00:03:04.680> a

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
noticed most today it took more of a

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.229 
noticed most today it took more of a
toll<00:03:05.129> on<00:03:05.159> those<00:03:05.459> guys<00:03:05.640> than<00:03:05.819> what<00:03:05.939> I<00:03:06.000> thoughts

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
toll on those guys than what I thoughts

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.850 
toll on those guys than what I thoughts
which<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.659> good<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.900> know<00:03:06.989> now<00:03:07.200> so<00:03:07.439> maybe<00:03:07.739> we

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
which is good to know now so maybe we

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.949 
which is good to know now so maybe we
can<00:03:08.010> build<00:03:08.129> that<00:03:08.310> capacity<00:03:08.540> of<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.689> newcomers

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
can build that capacity of the newcomers

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.199 
can build that capacity of the newcomers

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
better if we don't have to because each

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.099 
better if we don't have to because each
time<00:03:38.549> we<00:03:38.909> substitute<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.569> opponent<00:03:39.989> when

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
substitute the idea would be at our

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.069 
substitute the idea would be at our
offensive<00:03:42.180> line<00:03:42.329> can<00:03:42.659> get<00:03:42.720> in<00:03:42.810> better<00:03:42.959> shape

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
offensive line can get in better shape

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.379

their end zone than any other team in

their end zone than any other team in
the<00:06:45.259> country<00:06:45.409> last<00:06:45.860> year<00:06:45.979> and<00:06:46.339> right<00:06:47.240> we<00:06:47.360> had<00:06:47.449> a

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 
the country last year and right we had a

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:49.089 
the country last year and right we had a
lot<00:06:47.599> to<00:06:47.719> do<00:06:47.839> with<00:06:47.869> that<00:06:47.990> and<00:06:48.379> so<00:06:48.589> that<00:06:48.919> leads

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:49.099 
lot to do with that and so that leads

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:52.119 
lot to do with that and so that leads
two<00:06:49.249> points<00:06:49.610> and<00:06:49.759> so<00:06:49.879> if<00:06:49.969> Scott<00:06:50.240> can<00:06:51.129> continue

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:52.129 
two points and so if Scott can continue

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:54.309 
two points and so if Scott can continue
with<00:06:52.219> that<00:06:52.399> trend<00:06:52.759> which<00:06:52.939> in<00:06:53.209> campy<00:06:53.569> has<00:06:53.749> each

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 
with that trend which in campy has each

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:55.449 
with that trend which in campy has each
time<00:06:54.589> we've<00:06:54.740> asked<00:06:54.949> him<00:06:55.039> to<00:06:55.129> put<00:06:55.249> it<00:06:55.309> inside

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:55.459 
time we've asked him to put it inside

00:06:55.459 --> 00:06:57.369 
time we've asked him to put it inside
the<00:06:55.729> tent<00:06:55.909> as<00:06:56.029> a<00:06:56.089> team<00:06:56.269> challenge<00:06:56.300> he's<00:06:56.899> done

00:06:57.369 --> 00:06:57.379 
the tent as a team challenge he's done

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:59.529 
the tent as a team challenge he's done
and<00:06:57.529> I<00:06:57.559> think<00:06:57.740> that's<00:06:57.889> five<00:06:58.039> times<00:06:58.279> now<00:06:58.459> so<00:06:58.939> and

00:06:59.529 --> 00:06:59.539 
and I think that's five times now so and

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:01.509 
and I think that's five times now so and
I'm<00:06:59.749> impressed<00:07:00.050> with<00:07:00.259> that<00:07:00.289> our<00:07:00.860> snapper
