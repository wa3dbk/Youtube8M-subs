00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
of months called tropical island so this

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.630 
of months called tropical island so this
is<00:00:43.390> the<00:00:43.510> biggest<00:00:43.750> house<00:00:44.080> that<00:00:44.800> I've<00:00:45.040> built<00:00:45.370> in

speed<00:00:57.760> build<00:00:58.059> because<00:00:58.330> I<00:00:58.780> decided<00:00:59.320> to<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:01.390> do

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
speed build because I decided to just do

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.509 
speed build because I decided to just do
it<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.720> timeless<00:01:02.140> way<00:01:02.350> because<00:01:02.739> if<00:01:02.920> I<00:01:03.100> would

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
it the timeless way because if I would

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.030 
it the timeless way because if I would
do<00:01:03.790> it<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:04.059> speed<00:01:04.360> boat<00:01:04.570> way<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:05.500> speed<00:01:05.770> boat

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
do it the speed boat way the speed boat

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.630 
do it the speed boat way the speed boat
would<00:01:06.700> be<00:01:06.729> like<00:01:07.090> one<00:01:07.600> hour<00:01:07.840> long<00:01:08.350> if<00:01:09.190> I<00:01:09.520> would

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
would be like one hour long if I would

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.320 
would be like one hour long if I would
speed<00:01:09.880> it<00:01:10.030> up<00:01:10.180> like<00:01:10.990> six<00:01:11.380> times<00:01:11.620> so<00:01:12.220> I<00:01:12.549> didn't

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
speed it up like six times so I didn't

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.390 
speed it up like six times so I didn't
like<00:01:13.510> that<00:01:13.720> so<00:01:14.020> I<00:01:14.049> decided<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.650> just<00:01:14.890> go<00:01:15.010> for

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
like that so I decided to just go for

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.789 
like that so I decided to just go for
this<00:01:15.549> way<00:01:15.790> which<00:01:16.600> makes<00:01:16.869> this<00:01:17.170> video<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.530> little

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
this way which makes this video a little

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.620 
this way which makes this video a little
bit<00:01:17.890> shorter<00:01:18.310> but<00:01:18.340> I<00:01:18.610> think<00:01:18.880> it<00:01:18.970> also<00:01:19.150> turn<00:01:19.479> out

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
bit shorter but I think it also turn out

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
bit shorter but I think it also turn out
to<00:01:19.810> be<00:01:19.840> pretty<00:01:20.170> cool

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
to be pretty cool

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.609 
to be pretty cool
and<00:01:21.610> I<00:01:21.670> hope<00:01:21.940> you<00:01:22.060> think<00:01:22.119> the<00:01:22.390> same<00:01:22.690> this<00:01:23.380> is<00:01:23.590> a

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
and I hope you think the same this is a

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.270 
and I hope you think the same this is a
1<00:01:24.299> now<00:01:25.299> a<00:01:25.330> two-bedroom<00:01:26.170> two-bathroom<00:01:26.770> house

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
1 now a two-bedroom two-bathroom house

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.240 
1 now a two-bedroom two-bathroom house
on<00:01:27.939> the<00:01:28.150> ocean<00:01:28.360> just<00:01:29.350> as<00:01:29.590> you<00:01:29.710> can<00:01:29.860> see<00:01:30.070> it's

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
on the ocean just as you can see it's

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.370 
on the ocean just as you can see it's
really<00:01:30.520> located<00:01:31.119> on<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.420> ocean<00:01:31.900> I've<00:01:32.050> decided

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
really located on the ocean I've decided

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.570 
really located on the ocean I've decided
to<00:01:32.860> build<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:33.700> unlike<00:01:34.590> ocean<00:01:35.590> foundations<00:01:36.310> if

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
to build it unlike ocean foundations if

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.490 
to build it unlike ocean foundations if
you<00:01:36.670> can<00:01:36.820> call<00:01:37.000> like<00:01:37.180> that<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.720> I<00:01:38.170> think<00:01:38.230> it's

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
you can call like that and I think it's

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.170 
you can call like that and I think it's
really<00:01:38.650> turned<00:01:38.950> out<00:01:39.070> to<00:01:39.130> look<00:01:39.310> amazing<00:01:39.640> it's
