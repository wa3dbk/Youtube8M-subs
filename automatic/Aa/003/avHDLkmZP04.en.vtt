00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:42.560 
and then the g20 which i think the
meetings<00:05:41.400> towards<00:05:41.729> the<00:05:41.789> end<00:05:41.880> of<00:05:41.970> april<00:05:42.389> i

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
meetings towards the end of april i

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.540 
meetings towards the end of april i
think<00:05:43.260> we'll<00:05:43.380> see<00:05:43.530> a<00:05:43.560> lot<00:05:43.800> more<00:05:43.860> carnage<00:05:44.430> in

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
think we'll see a lot more carnage in

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.089 
think we'll see a lot more carnage in
all<00:05:44.639> kinds<00:05:45.030> of<00:05:45.120> markets<00:05:45.419> before<00:05:46.139> then<00:05:46.289> i<00:05:46.470> think

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
all kinds of markets before then i think

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:50.779 
all kinds of markets before then i think
gold<00:05:47.340> might<00:05:47.550> even<00:05:47.700> go<00:05:47.880> down<00:05:47.910> and<00:05:48.620> the<00:05:49.639> 30<00:05:50.639> year

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
gold might even go down and the 30 year

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.510 
gold might even go down and the 30 year
bond<00:05:51.030> obviously<00:05:51.599> is<00:05:51.979> going<00:05:52.979> back<00:05:53.099> and<00:05:53.130> forth

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
bond obviously is going back and forth

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.190 
bond obviously is going back and forth
at<00:05:53.700> some<00:05:53.910> point<00:05:54.150> 30<00:05:54.479> year<00:05:54.599> bond<00:05:54.780> will<00:05:54.960> collapse

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
at some point 30 year bond will collapse

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.189 
at some point 30 year bond will collapse
but<00:05:55.770> right<00:05:55.950> now<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.910> word<00:05:57.150> on<00:05:57.419> the<00:05:57.449> street<00:05:57.750> out

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
but right now the word on the street out

00:05:58.199 --> 00:05:59.990 
but right now the word on the street out
there<00:05:58.229> is<00:05:58.620> that<00:05:58.889> europe's<00:05:59.370> doing<00:05:59.639> worse<00:05:59.820> than

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
there is that europe's doing worse than

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.240 
there is that europe's doing worse than
us<00:06:00.150> where's<00:06:00.570> the<00:06:00.690> united<00:06:00.990> states<00:06:01.229> if<00:06:01.860> you<00:06:02.099> can

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
us where's the united states if you can

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.670 
us where's the united states if you can
imagine<00:06:02.340> that<00:06:02.849> so<00:06:03.720> i<00:06:03.750> think<00:06:03.960> we'll<00:06:04.229> see<00:06:04.380> a<00:06:04.410> lot

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
imagine that so i think we'll see a lot

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.510 
imagine that so i think we'll see a lot
of<00:06:05.090> carnage<00:06:06.090> before<00:06:06.660> the<00:06:06.900> g20<00:06:07.470> and<00:06:07.650> then<00:06:08.400> it'll

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
of carnage before the g20 and then it'll

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.879 
of carnage before the g20 and then it'll
be<00:06:08.669> up<00:06:08.760> to<00:06:08.789> the<00:06:09.000> g20<00:06:09.660> and<00:06:09.930> we'll<00:06:10.470> have<00:06:10.860> a

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
be up to the g20 and we'll have a

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:13.490 
be up to the g20 and we'll have a
worldwide<00:06:11.580> solution<00:06:12.330> to<00:06:12.780> this<00:06:12.930> worldwide

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
worldwide solution to this worldwide

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.460 
worldwide solution to this worldwide
