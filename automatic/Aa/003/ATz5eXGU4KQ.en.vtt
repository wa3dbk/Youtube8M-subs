00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.100 
point which is what brought up my
win-loss<00:02:18.220> ratio<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:18.970> got<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.150> 3-1<00:02:19.570> loss<00:02:19.720> and

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
win-loss ratio so I got a 3-1 loss and

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.040 
win-loss ratio so I got a 3-1 loss and
that<00:02:20.830> just<00:02:21.070> about<00:02:21.220> with<00:02:22.090> uh<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.570> got<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.870> pretty

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
that just about with uh I got a pretty

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.290 
that just about with uh I got a pretty
nice<00:02:23.290> win<00:02:23.620> streak<00:02:23.890> in<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.190> it's<00:02:24.940> really<00:02:25.150> hard

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
nice win streak in that it's really hard

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.580 
nice win streak in that it's really hard
to<00:02:25.390> get<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.510> win<00:02:25.690> streak<00:02:25.960> in<00:02:26.080> black<00:02:26.290> ops<00:02:26.470> 2

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
to get a win streak in black ops 2

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.180 
to get a win streak in black ops 2
because<00:02:27.130> oh<00:02:27.570> all<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.810> dashboard<00:02:29.380> enough<00:02:29.620> the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
because oh all the dashboard enough the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.900 
because oh all the dashboard enough the
host<00:02:30.400> dashboards<00:02:31.090> then<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.990> pretty<00:02:32.200> much

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
host dashboards then you pretty much

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.150 
host dashboards then you pretty much
lose<00:02:33.910> your<00:02:34.350> win<00:02:35.350> streak<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:36.250> let's<00:02:36.940> pray<00:02:37.180> lame

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
lose your win streak so let's pray lame

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
obviously ballista is my most used I've

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.540 
obviously ballista is my most used I've
been<00:03:51.340> using<00:03:51.519> it<00:03:51.730> for<00:03:51.760> ever<00:03:52.330> now<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:53.459> you<00:03:54.459> know

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
been using it for ever now and you know

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.890 
been using it for ever now and you know
it<00:03:55.330> just<00:03:55.390> take<00:03:55.780> took<00:03:56.590> over<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.100> DSR<00:03:57.900> towards

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
it just take took over the DSR towards

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.790 
it just take took over the DSR towards
like<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.290> half<00:03:59.500> of<00:03:59.769> black<00:04:00.459> ops<00:04:00.700> 2<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.120> just

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
like the half of black ops 2 and I just

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.229 
like the half of black ops 2 and I just
kind<00:04:02.800> of<00:04:02.830> stopped<00:04:03.100> using<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.489> DSR<00:04:03.910> a<00:04:03.940> couple

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
kind of stopped using the DSR a couple

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.449 
kind of stopped using the DSR a couple
weeks<00:04:04.390> ago<00:04:04.510> and<00:04:04.840> that's<00:04:05.590> why<00:04:05.860> I<00:04:05.890> have<00:04:06.250> more

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.440 
weeks ago and that's why I have more
kills<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.180> ballista<00:04:07.570> now<00:04:08.459> Essex<00:04:09.459> 6,000<00:04:10.150> kills

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
percent accuracy so going for those

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.720 
percent accuracy so going for those
headshots<00:04:16.120> not<00:04:17.049> a<00:04:17.080> good<00:04:17.320> Katie<00:04:17.530> but<00:04:18.100> obviously

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.300 
less head shots with this one but a
higher<00:04:37.360> accuracy<00:04:37.950> obviously<00:04:38.950> because<00:04:39.130> I

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
higher accuracy obviously because I

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.760 
higher accuracy obviously because I
didn't<00:04:39.550> go<00:04:39.670> for<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:39.910> head<00:04:40.060> shots<00:04:40.330> and
