candy when I was showing stuff and it's

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.459 
candy when I was showing stuff and it's
usually<00:06:06.479> it's<00:06:06.569> just<00:06:06.599> out<00:06:06.840> of<00:06:06.870> focus<00:06:07.110> and<00:06:07.440> I

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:07.469 
usually it's just out of focus and I

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:09.709 
usually it's just out of focus and I
tend<00:06:07.680> not<00:06:07.710> to<00:06:07.800> light<00:06:08.039> it<00:06:08.159> too<00:06:08.340> much<00:06:08.490> so<00:06:08.789> the

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:09.719 
tend not to light it too much so the

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:11.330 
tend not to light it too much so the
main<00:06:09.870> focus<00:06:10.080> is<00:06:10.380> what<00:06:10.529> you're<00:06:10.740> showing<00:06:10.919> people

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
main focus is what you're showing people

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.249 
main focus is what you're showing people
but<00:06:12.120> I<00:06:12.150> just<00:06:12.389> think<00:06:12.539> it<00:06:12.659> lifts<00:06:13.020> the<00:06:13.080> whole

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:13.259

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:15.860 
but I just think it lifts the whole
environment<00:06:13.919> where<00:06:14.849> I<00:06:14.909> do<00:06:14.969> my<00:06:15.270> reviews<00:06:15.659> and
