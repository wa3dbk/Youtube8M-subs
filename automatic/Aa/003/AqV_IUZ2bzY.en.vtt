especially three matches you cannot do I

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.730 
especially three matches you cannot do I
quit<00:01:32.880> match<00:01:33.149> us<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.540> think<00:01:33.710> at<00:01:34.710> least<00:01:34.920> as<00:01:35.160> I<00:01:35.310> saw

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.530 

and<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:41.369> think<00:01:41.700> they<00:01:41.850> should<00:01:42.060> add<00:01:42.300> back<00:01:42.509> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
and I think they should add back the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.749 
and I think they should add back the
camera<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.500> go<00:01:43.740> for<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.070> move<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.399> did<00:01:44.580> right

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
camera and go for that move I did right

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.520 
camera and go for that move I did right
there<00:01:45.020> it<00:01:46.020> looked<00:01:46.259> more<00:01:46.490> dangerous<00:01:47.490> before

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
there it looked more dangerous before

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.499 
there it looked more dangerous before
and<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.039> fifth<00:01:50.310> six<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.940> game<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.330> pretty

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
and the fifth six in the game is pretty

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.969 
and the fifth six in the game is pretty
much<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.780> same<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.539> ask<00:01:55.170> someone<00:01:55.680> if

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
much the same and and to ask someone if

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.340 
much the same and and to ask someone if
they<00:01:56.220> want<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.520> quit<00:01:56.789> they<00:01:57.600> simply<00:01:57.990> wear<00:01:58.170> them

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
they want to quit they simply wear them

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.419 
they want to quit they simply wear them
down<00:01:58.560> go<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.580> them<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.090> press<00:02:00.479> B<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:02.310> then

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
down go to them and press B and then

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.240 
down go to them and press B and then
they<00:02:02.580> will<00:02:02.670> ask<00:02:02.910> him<00:02:03.149> well<00:02:03.810> did<00:02:04.110> there<00:02:05.009> will<00:02:05.130> be

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
they will ask him well did there will be

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.609 
they will ask him well did there will be
this<00:02:05.429> bar<00:02:05.759> coming<00:02:06.149> up<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.600> she<00:02:06.810> kicked<00:02:07.229> out<00:02:07.410> off

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
this bar coming up we she kicked out off

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.630 
this bar coming up we she kicked out off
right<00:02:07.979> away<00:02:08.600> it's<00:02:09.770> pretty<00:02:10.770> much<00:02:10.950> like<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
right away it's pretty much like the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.640 
right away it's pretty much like the
submission<00:02:12.120> system<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:13.050> from<00:02:14.000> svrs<00:02:15.000> 6<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.650> like

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
submission system be from svrs 6 I like

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.470 
submission system be from svrs 6 I like
the<00:02:16.860> idea<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.250> having<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.610> submission<00:02:17.880> system<00:02:18.180> I

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
the idea of having a submission system I

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.210 
the idea of having a submission system I
can't<00:02:18.780> see<00:02:18.959> any<00:02:19.110> other<00:02:19.260> way<00:02:19.500> for<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.010> work

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
can't see any other way for it to work

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.540 
can't see any other way for it to work
anyways<00:02:21.080> so<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:23.180> like<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.360> how<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.750> now<00:02:24.959> I

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
anyways so I like it how it is now I

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.220 
anyways so I like it how it is now I
liked<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:26.849> how<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.150> breaking<00:02:27.690> point<00:02:27.900> thing

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
liked it in how the breaking point thing

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.300 
liked it in how the breaking point thing
because<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.709> would<00:02:28.830> have<00:02:28.920> been<00:02:28.980> horrible

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
because that would have been horrible

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.430 
because that would have been horrible
they<00:02:30.300> had<00:02:30.540> something<00:02:31.050> else<00:02:32.780> this<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:33.959> an<00:02:34.110> OMG

what that is cold but it's a replay for

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.460 
what that is cold but it's a replay for
that<00:03:17.890> yes<00:03:18.160> I<00:03:18.400> like<00:03:18.850> those<00:03:18.880> replays<00:03:19.570> by<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.320> way

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
that yes I like those replays by the way

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.430 
that yes I like those replays by the way
but<00:03:21.400> replays<00:03:21.820> on<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.090> end<00:03:22.240> they<00:03:22.750> are<00:03:22.930> horrible

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
but replays on the end they are horrible

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.120 
it might be I didn't see right there is
it<00:03:25.600> would<00:03:25.750> be<00:03:25.870> almost<00:03:25.990> impossible<00:03:26.200> for<00:03:26.650> him<00:03:27.040> to

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
it would be almost impossible for him to

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.430 
it would be almost impossible for him to
quit<00:03:27.340> there<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.540> can<00:03:28.570> do<00:03:28.930> this<00:03:29.050> as<00:03:29.260> well

and<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.910> should<00:03:37.120> choose<00:03:37.330> epic<00:03:37.990> though<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.440> big

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
and you should choose epic though a big

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:46.020 
and you should choose epic though a big
match<00:03:39.250> experience<00:03:39.790> as<00:03:40.120> much<00:03:40.690> better<00:03:44.910> but<00:03:45.910> yeah

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
match experience as much better but yeah

match experience as much better but yeah
that's<00:03:46.210> my<00:03:46.450> opinion<00:03:46.750> on<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.170> math<00:03:47.410> on<00:03:47.650> this

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
that's my opinion on the math on this

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.560 
that's my opinion on the math on this
match<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.610> I<00:03:48.820> actually<00:03:49.030> got<00:03:49.420> an<00:03:49.480> achievement

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
match and I actually got an achievement

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:55.190 
match and I actually got an achievement
for<00:03:49.990> it<00:03:51.930> for<00:03:52.930> example<00:03:53.260> antique<00:03:53.500> coins<00:03:53.740> I

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
for it for example antique coins I

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.390 
for it for example antique coins I
thought<00:03:56.200> I<00:03:56.410> hate<00:03:56.680> how<00:03:56.860> they<00:03:56.890> didn't<00:03:57.220> add<00:03:57.370> the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
thought I hate how they didn't add the

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.110 
thought I hate how they didn't add the
reading<00:03:58.060> animation<00:03:58.540> room<00:03:59.160> and<00:04:00.160> also<00:04:00.580> when<00:04:01.000> I'm

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
reading animation room and also when I'm

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.420 
reading animation room and also when I'm
noticed<00:04:01.570> if<00:04:01.780> you<00:04:01.900> press<00:04:02.140> Start<00:04:02.280> after<00:04:03.280> the

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
noticed if you press Start after the

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.060 
noticed if you press Start after the
replays<00:04:03.790> on<00:04:04.000> them<00:04:04.230> they<00:04:05.230> will<00:04:05.350> actually<00:04:05.890> not

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
replays on them they will actually not

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.930
