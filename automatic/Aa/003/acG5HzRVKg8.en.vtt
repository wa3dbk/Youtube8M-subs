Hi!

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.900
I will show you how to do this fabric flower

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:27.900
you will need a piece of fabric

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:45.900
and you will have to cut 5 equal cicles

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.900
I already made 4 petals

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.900
Fold the circle in half

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:30.900
and start sewing on the semicircle side

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.900
sew like this all 5 petals

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:50.900
then pull next to the others

00:01:50.900 --> 00:02:15.900
and now sew the last one to the first one

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.900
cut the thread

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.900
on the back put a small fabric circle

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.900
and on the frond a button or rhinestone

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.900
This is it!

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:10.900
