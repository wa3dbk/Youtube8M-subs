00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
face-to-face yeah i think we wrote about

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.160 
face-to-face yeah i think we wrote about
this<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:44.180> bit<00:00:44.270> one<00:00:44.540> of<00:00:44.629> the<00:00:44.720> things<00:00:44.870> i<00:00:44.989> thought

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
this a bit one of the things i thought

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.439 
this a bit one of the things i thought
about<00:00:45.320> was<00:00:45.620> that<00:00:45.670> there<00:00:46.670> are<00:00:47.000> things<00:00:47.330> that

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
about was that there are things that

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.439 
about was that there are things that
i've<00:00:47.659> written<00:00:48.100> that<00:00:49.100> clarify<00:00:49.760> matters<00:00:49.970> better

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
i've written that clarify matters better

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.420 
i've written that clarify matters better
than<00:00:50.720> I<00:00:51.080> could<00:00:51.379> talk<00:00:51.559> about<00:00:51.769> it<00:00:52.010> you<00:00:52.100> know<00:00:52.129> so

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
than I could talk about it you know so

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.640 
than I could talk about it you know so
you<00:00:52.460> can<00:00:52.760> say<00:00:53.570> instead<00:00:53.900> of<00:00:54.019> listening<00:00:54.229> to<00:00:54.559> me

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
you can say instead of listening to me

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.340 
you can say instead of listening to me
for<00:00:54.860> 20<00:00:55.100> minutes<00:00:55.400> here<00:00:55.580> read<00:00:55.879> this<00:00:55.909> and<00:00:56.420> then

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
for 20 minutes here read this and then

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.710 
for 20 minutes here read this and then
that<00:00:57.530> lets<00:00:57.800> us<00:00:57.979> not<00:00:58.550> start<00:00:58.879> with<00:00:59.000> from<00:00:59.360> point<00:00:59.600> A

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
that lets us not start with from point A

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.020 
that lets us not start with from point A
but<00:00:59.960> from<00:01:00.170> point<00:01:00.409> d<00:01:00.589> or<00:01:00.830> c<00:01:00.860> or<00:01:01.339> whatever<00:01:01.729> along

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
but from point d or c or whatever along

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.910 
but from point d or c or whatever along
the<00:01:02.180> way<00:01:02.299> it<00:01:02.750> helps<00:01:02.900> get<00:01:03.170> a<00:01:03.199> jump<00:01:03.500> start<00:01:03.530> to<00:01:03.830> the

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
the way it helps get a jump start to the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.649 
the way it helps get a jump start to the
conversation<00:01:04.040> so<00:01:04.549> when<00:01:04.699> that<00:01:04.879> kind<00:01:05.570> of

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
conversation so when that kind of

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.270 
conversation so when that kind of
synchronicity<00:01:05.960> happens<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:06.860> that's<00:01:07.159> a

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
synchronicity happens that that's a

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.940 
synchronicity happens that that's a
really<00:01:07.640> nice<00:01:07.760> interaction<00:01:08.540> between

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
really nice interaction between

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.810 
really nice interaction between
scholarship<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.070> teaching<00:01:10.130> that<00:01:10.520> happens

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
scholarship and teaching that happens

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.300 
scholarship and teaching that happens
every<00:01:10.940> once<00:01:11.150> in<00:01:11.360> a<00:01:11.420> while<00:01:11.570> but<00:01:11.930> heed<00:01:12.920> often

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
every once in a while but heed often

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.510 
every once in a while but heed often
works<00:01:13.490> that<00:01:13.670> way<00:01:14.200> yeah<00:01:15.200> i'm<00:01:15.409> really<00:01:16.010> bad<00:01:16.190> at<00:01:16.250> it

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
works that way yeah i'm really bad at it

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.440 
works that way yeah i'm really bad at it
i<00:01:16.729> think<00:01:17.290> because<00:01:18.290> i<00:01:18.740> just<00:01:18.770> feel<00:01:19.100> that<00:01:19.130> my<00:01:19.790> you

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
i think because i just feel that my you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.870 
i think because i just feel that my you
know<00:01:20.570> area<00:01:20.990> of<00:01:21.050> specialization<00:01:21.950> is<00:01:22.130> somehow

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
know area of specialization is somehow

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.930 
know area of specialization is somehow
not<00:01:23.890> interesting<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:25.160> undergrads<00:01:25.610> which

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
not interesting to undergrads which

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.670 
not interesting to undergrads which
maybe<00:01:26.180> it<00:01:26.360> could<00:01:26.600> be<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:27.080> i<00:01:27.200> just<00:01:27.380> haven't

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
maybe it could be and i just haven't

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.620 
maybe it could be and i just haven't
figured<00:01:27.770> out<00:01:28.010> how<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:28.310> but<00:01:29.060> our<00:01:29.150> departments

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
figured out how to but our departments

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.150 
figured out how to but our departments
so<00:01:29.750> small<00:01:30.110> that<00:01:30.590> i<00:01:31.310> feel<00:01:31.700> this<00:01:31.880> probably<00:01:32.810> false

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
so small that i feel this probably false

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.590 
so small that i feel this probably false
sense<00:01:34.160> of<00:01:34.310> responsibility<00:01:34.580> to<00:01:35.270> like

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
sense of responsibility to like

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.570 
sense of responsibility to like
represent<00:01:36.200> all<00:01:36.350> religious<00:01:36.890> studies<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:37.460> know

with<00:01:38.390> one<00:01:38.540> and<00:01:38.630> a<00:01:38.690> half<00:01:38.720> people<00:01:38.990> in<00:01:39.230> our

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
with one and a half people in our

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.240 
with one and a half people in our
department<00:01:40.180> so<00:01:41.180> it<00:01:41.270> seems<00:01:41.420> like<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:42.020> like<00:01:43.010> in

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
department so it seems like to like in

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.510 
department so it seems like to like in
self-indulgent<00:01:44.240> for<00:01:44.510> me<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.720> use<00:01:44.960> my<00:01:45.520> teaching

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
self-indulgent for me to use my teaching

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.260 
self-indulgent for me to use my teaching
as<00:01:46.640> a<00:01:46.670> way<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:46.910> work<00:01:47.180> on<00:01:47.360> scholarship<00:01:48.640> but<00:01:49.640> what

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
as a way to work on scholarship but what

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.210 
as a way to work on scholarship but what
I<00:01:50.300> think<00:01:50.570> I<00:01:50.750> don't<00:01:51.080> know<00:01:51.140> I<00:01:51.290> like<00:01:51.560> I<00:01:51.800> think

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
I think I don't know I like I think

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.060 
I think I don't know I like I think
would<00:01:52.310> be<00:01:52.430> good<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:53.050> work<00:01:54.050> on<00:01:54.230> that<00:01:54.410> because<00:01:54.980> I

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
would be good to work on that because I

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.260 
would be good to work on that because I
think<00:01:55.250> maybe<00:01:55.400> it<00:01:55.580> would<00:01:55.670> be<00:01:55.790> actually<00:01:56.060> a

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
think maybe it would be actually a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.880 
think maybe it would be actually a
really<00:01:56.390> great<00:01:56.630> teaching<00:01:57.110> experience<00:01:57.620> that<00:01:57.830> I

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
really great teaching experience that I

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.700 
really great teaching experience that I
just<00:01:58.070> haven't<00:01:59.060> tried<00:01:59.570> it<00:01:59.600> yeah<00:02:00.140> well

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
just haven't tried it yeah well

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.710 
just haven't tried it yeah well
something<00:02:00.980> I<00:02:01.010> noticed<00:02:01.159> this<00:02:01.430> week<00:02:01.700> in<00:02:02.090> San

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
something I noticed this week in San

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.990 
something I noticed this week in San
Diego<00:02:03.050> I've<00:02:03.440> sit<00:02:03.650> in<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:03.800> few<00:02:04.010> sessions<00:02:04.220> and<00:02:04.640> I<00:02:04.760> I

Diego I've sit in a few sessions and I I

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.120 
Diego I've sit in a few sessions and I I
learn<00:02:05.540> a<00:02:05.570> lot<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:06.110> I<00:02:06.260> think<00:02:06.290> I'm<00:02:06.590> replicating

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
learn a lot and I think I'm replicating

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.889

know<00:02:36.360> we<00:02:36.480> get<00:02:36.630> these<00:02:36.780> course<00:02:37.110> descriptions

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
know we get these course descriptions

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.430 
know we get these course descriptions
but<00:02:38.250> we<00:02:38.400> have<00:02:38.550> so<00:02:38.850> much<00:02:39.030> latitude<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:40.260> just

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
but we have so much latitude and I just

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.320 
but we have so much latitude and I just
like<00:02:40.680> teaching<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.310> which<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.610> right<00:02:41.819> on<00:02:42.000> no

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
like teaching that which I right on no

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.840 
like teaching that which I right on no
just<00:02:42.600> economies<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.620> intertextual<00:02:44.400> ality

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
just economies and intertextual ality

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.130 
just economies and intertextual ality
and<00:02:45.000> things<00:02:45.180> like<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.720> i<00:02:45.780> think<00:02:46.050> there's

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
and things like that and i think there's

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.360 
and things like that and i think there's
interest<00:02:46.530> but<00:02:46.709> i<00:02:46.770> think<00:02:46.950> there's<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.160> synergy

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
interest but i think there's a synergy

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.910 
interest but i think there's a synergy
when<00:02:48.000> i'm<00:02:48.120> actually<00:02:48.330> writing<00:02:48.740> engaging<00:02:49.740> in

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
when i'm actually writing engaging in

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.290 
when i'm actually writing engaging in
greater<00:02:50.100> conversations<00:02:50.790> when<00:02:50.910> i<00:02:50.940> bring<00:02:51.150> them

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
greater conversations when i bring them

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.300 
greater conversations when i bring them
to<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.510> students<00:02:51.900> i<00:02:51.990> think<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.200> students<00:02:52.560> can

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
to the students i think the students can

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.010 
to the students i think the students can
sense<00:02:53.520> that<00:02:53.670> too<00:02:53.910> instead<00:02:54.510> something<00:02:54.750> that's

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
sense that too instead something that's

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.530 
sense that too instead something that's
