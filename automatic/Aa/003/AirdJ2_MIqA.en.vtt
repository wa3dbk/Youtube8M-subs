00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
 The beginning of the story is like this...

 The fourth quarter...to the Thunder... lose 8 points... 

00:00:08.868 --> 00:00:13.848
 Jeremy is leading the bench as usual... even killing this item... 

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:21.961
 I didn’t expect Xiao Xiaolin to go crazy like this.... 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.600
 Jeremy led the team to a 10-2 offensive in 2 minutes~~ 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.900
 In less than 3 minutes, led the Lakers to play a 13-2 offensive.... 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.840
 At this time... It’s too late to say!! 

00:01:41.514 --> 00:01:44.314

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.500
 I am coming to kill... (design dialogue) 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.240
 Then... again as usual "When"!! 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.220
 Forget it, this is just one of the games I have done in countless games... (Design dialogue)
