00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.580 

so<00:00:20.920> my<00:00:21.100> next<00:00:21.400> step<00:00:21.520> would<00:00:21.820> be<00:00:21.880> to<00:00:22.300> insert<00:00:23.110> the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
so my next step would be to insert the

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.000 
so my next step would be to insert the
HS<00:00:24.100> for<00:00:24.400> 25<00:00:25.000> servos<00:00:25.600> into<00:00:26.200> the<00:00:26.290> wing<00:00:26.530> before<00:00:26.950> I

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
HS for 25 servos into the wing before I

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.030 
HS for 25 servos into the wing before I
glue<00:00:27.360> them<00:00:28.360> together<00:00:28.630> on<00:00:29.020> each<00:00:29.230> side<00:00:29.529> because

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
glue them together on each side because

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.360 
glue them together on each side because
the<00:00:30.160> wire<00:00:30.400> has<00:00:30.640> to<00:00:30.820> run<00:00:31.060> through<00:00:32.190> that's<00:00:33.190> a

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
the wire has to run through that's a

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.820 
the wire has to run through that's a
good<00:00:33.580> tip<00:00:33.820> to<00:00:34.030> remember<00:00:34.180> if<00:00:34.750> anyone<00:00:35.110> builds

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
good tip to remember if anyone builds

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.750 
good tip to remember if anyone builds
this<00:00:35.950> plane<00:00:36.690> before<00:00:37.690> you<00:00:38.140> glue<00:00:38.739> the<00:00:39.220> wings<00:00:39.460> on

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
this plane before you glue the wings on

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.810 
this plane before you glue the wings on
you<00:00:40.720> might<00:00:40.900> want<00:00:41.140> to<00:00:41.260> run<00:00:41.379> the<00:00:41.530> servos<00:00:42.010> that

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
you might want to run the servos that

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.430 
you might want to run the servos that
are<00:00:42.940> going<00:00:43.090> to<00:00:43.180> run<00:00:43.330> the<00:00:43.449> ELA<00:00:43.660> runs<00:00:43.989> through

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
are going to run the ELA runs through

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.520 
are going to run the ELA runs through
with<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.489> wires<00:00:45.730> that<00:00:46.180> way<00:00:46.840> you<00:00:46.900> have<00:00:47.140> a<00:00:47.199> step

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
with the wires that way you have a step

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.840 
with the wires that way you have a step
ahead<00:00:47.680> and<00:00:47.980> don't<00:00:48.160> have<00:00:48.309> to<00:00:48.430> go<00:00:48.610> back<00:00:48.790> and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
ahead and don't have to go back and

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.329 
ahead and don't have to go back and
rewire<00:00:49.449> everything<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:52.600> let's<00:00:53.050> move<00:00:53.260> back<00:00:53.559> to

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
rewire everything so let's move back to

00:00:54.339 --> 00:01:00.930 
rewire everything so let's move back to
so<00:00:55.059> I<00:00:55.449> have<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:57.309> wings<00:00:57.580> here<00:00:59.460> along<00:01:00.460> with<00:01:00.489> my

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
so I have the wings here along with my

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.180 
so I have the wings here along with my
two<00:01:01.800> HS<00:01:02.800> 425<00:01:03.670> servos<00:01:04.590> now<00:01:05.590> what<00:01:05.830> I'm<00:01:05.920> going<00:01:06.100> to

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
two HS 425 servos now what I'm going to

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.180 
two HS 425 servos now what I'm going to
do<00:01:06.400> here<00:01:06.690> still<00:01:07.690> old<00:01:07.870> epoxy<00:01:08.440> section<00:01:08.890> but<00:01:09.040> this

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
do here still old epoxy section but this

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.010 
do here still old epoxy section but this
should<00:01:09.340> be<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.549> last<00:01:09.580> part<00:01:10.180> of<00:01:10.299> the<00:01:10.479> epoxy

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
should be the last part of the epoxy

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.770 
should be the last part of the epoxy
session<00:01:11.440> so<00:01:12.370> I'm<00:01:12.640> going<00:01:12.670> to<00:01:12.909> go<00:01:13.030> ad<00:01:13.210> insert<00:01:13.659> on

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
session so I'm going to go ad insert on

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.760 
session so I'm going to go ad insert on
the<00:01:13.810> elder<00:01:14.260> one<00:01:14.470> servo<00:01:15.240> inside<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.450> wing

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the elder one servo inside the wing

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.760 
the elder one servo inside the wing
before<00:01:17.770> I<00:01:17.860> can<00:01:18.070> move<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:19.390> wings<00:01:19.630> together<00:01:19.869> and

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
before I can move the wings together and

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.340 
before I can move the wings together and
the<00:01:21.490> reason<00:01:21.850> being<00:01:21.880> that<00:01:22.299> it's<00:01:22.960> because<00:01:23.320> the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
the reason being that it's because the

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.940 
the reason being that it's because the
wires<00:01:23.740> have<00:01:24.070> to<00:01:24.220> run<00:01:24.630> through<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.840> wing<00:01:26.050> into

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
wires have to run through the wing into

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.920 
wires have to run through the wing into
the<00:01:27.070> main<00:01:27.280> section<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:28.060> go<00:01:28.210> up<00:01:28.390> inside<00:01:28.750> the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
the main section to go up inside the

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.740 
the main section to go up inside the
fuselage<00:01:29.410> when<00:01:29.680> i<00:01:29.710> hook<00:01:29.890> it<00:01:30.040> to<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.280> receiver

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
fuselage when i hook it to the receiver

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.080 
fuselage when i hook it to the receiver
so<00:01:32.070> we'll<00:01:33.070> go<00:01:33.190> ahead<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:33.370> come<00:01:33.610> packaged

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
so we'll go ahead and come packaged

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.510 
so we'll go ahead and come packaged
these<00:01:34.330> and<00:01:35.080> go<00:01:35.290> ahead<00:01:35.470> and<00:01:35.620> insert<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.100> servo

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
these and go ahead and insert the servo

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.360 
these and go ahead and insert the servo
then<00:01:37.240> i<00:01:37.390> get<00:01:37.660> back<00:01:37.870> to<00:01:37.900> you<00:01:38.260> and<00:01:38.740> we'll<00:01:38.980> move<00:01:39.160> on

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
then i get back to you and we'll move on

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.880 
then i get back to you and we'll move on
from<00:01:39.400> there<00:01:39.640> ok<00:01:40.120> so<00:01:40.180> as<00:01:40.480> you<00:01:40.600> can<00:01:40.750> see<00:01:41.080> I've

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
from there ok so as you can see I've

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.870 
from there ok so as you can see I've
already<00:01:42.690> ran<00:01:43.690> servo<00:01:44.320> wires<00:01:44.920> through<00:01:45.550> here

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.110 

servos<00:01:49.680> are<00:01:50.680> installed<00:01:51.340> in<00:01:51.580> there<00:01:51.790> if<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:51.940> can

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
servos are installed in there if you can

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.950 
servos are installed in there if you can
see<00:01:52.330> in<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.540> bottom<00:01:52.720> there<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:54.300> mean<00:01:55.300> can<00:01:55.930> you

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
see in the bottom there I mean can you

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.040 
see in the bottom there I mean can you
guys<00:01:56.230> believe<00:01:56.440> how<00:01:56.650> big<00:01:57.100> these<00:01:57.310> wings<00:01:57.640> are

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
guys believe how big these wings are

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.300 
guys believe how big these wings are
that<00:01:59.050> it<00:01:59.260> actually<00:01:59.440> is<00:01:59.740> going<00:01:59.920> to<00:01:59.980> turn<00:02:00.130> out<00:02:00.250> to

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
that it actually is going to turn out to

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.100 
that it actually is going to turn out to
be<00:02:00.580> 92<00:02:01.360> when<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.630> put<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.670> fake<00:02:03.670> gas<00:02:04.570> tanks<00:02:04.990> on

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
be 92 when I put the fake gas tanks on

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.690 
be 92 when I put the fake gas tanks on
the<00:02:05.200> end

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.479 

so<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.759> left<00:02:09.060> enough<00:02:09.420> room<00:02:09.630> here<00:02:10.009> in<00:02:11.009> between

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
so I left enough room here in between

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.130 
so I left enough room here in between
the<00:02:11.640> wing<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:14.040> add<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.459> epoxy<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.360> put<00:02:16.050> them

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
the wing to add to epoxy and put them

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.070 
the wing to add to epoxy and put them
together<00:02:16.819> everything<00:02:17.819> fits<00:02:18.090> nice<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.510> tight

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
together everything fits nice and tight

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.300 
together everything fits nice and tight
and<00:02:19.260> snug<00:02:21.019> so<00:02:22.019> I<00:02:22.050> got<00:02:22.319> some<00:02:22.500> epoxy<00:02:22.830> here<00:02:23.220> and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
and snug so I got some epoxy here and

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.240 
and snug so I got some epoxy here and
we'll<00:02:23.400> go<00:02:23.519> ahead<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.730> mix<00:02:24.470> together<00:02:25.470> here<00:02:26.010> I

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
we'll go ahead and mix together here I

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.729 
we'll go ahead and mix together here I
mean<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:27.209> think<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.690> bigger<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.230> the

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
mean it's think the bigger it is the

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.180 
mean it's think the bigger it is the
easier<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.280> play<00:02:29.489> this<00:02:29.730> believed<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.900> build

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
easier to play this believed to build

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.430 
easier to play this believed to build
faster<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.670> don't<00:02:32.849> have<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.300> twist<00:02:33.989> little

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
faster you don't have to twist little

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.949 
faster you don't have to twist little
screws<00:02:34.769> it<00:02:35.130> figured<00:02:36.060> your<00:02:36.269> fingers<00:02:36.690> in<00:02:36.870> the

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
screws it figured your fingers in the

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.160 
screws it figured your fingers in the
areas<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:38.239> you<00:02:39.239> normally<00:02:39.390> would<00:02:39.720> have<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.989> do

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
areas that you normally would have to do

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.800 
areas that you normally would have to do
with<00:02:40.380> smaller<00:02:40.769> plane<00:02:41.130> 60<00:02:42.000> size<00:02:42.209> is<00:02:42.450> not<00:02:42.599> that

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
with smaller plane 60 size is not that

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.770 
with smaller plane 60 size is not that
bad<00:02:43.489> this<00:02:44.489> one<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.819> really<00:02:45.000> huge<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.599> it's

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
bad this one is really huge and it's

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.949 
bad this one is really huge and it's
going<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.080> little<00:02:46.260> real<00:02:46.470> fast<00:02:47.660> so<00:02:48.660> I'm<00:02:48.720> going<00:02:48.930> to

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
going a little real fast so I'm going to

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:56.780 
going a little real fast so I'm going to
add<00:02:49.140> my<00:02:49.410> pot<00:02:49.830> see<00:02:50.069> here<00:02:50.340> on<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.030> wood<00:02:55.790> just

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
add my pot see here on the wood just

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.089 
add my pot see here on the wood just
enough<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.510> doesn't<00:02:57.900> spread<00:02:58.440> out<00:02:58.739> when<00:02:58.950> I

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
enough so it doesn't spread out when I

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.069 
enough so it doesn't spread out when I
smash<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.239> wings<00:03:00.450> together<00:03:00.599> it<00:03:00.900> doesn't

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
smash the wings together it doesn't

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:11.550 
smash the wings together it doesn't
who's<00:03:01.890> up<00:03:02.250> sometimes<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:03.090> do<00:03:03.150> that

that<00:05:12.150> should<00:05:12.390> be<00:05:12.540> a<00:05:12.570> little<00:05:12.900> more<00:05:13.370> cooler

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
that should be a little more cooler

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:24.180 
that should be a little more cooler
state<00:05:14.760> to<00:05:14.940> this<00:05:15.090> side

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.580 

push<00:05:24.610> it<00:05:24.790> all<00:05:24.970> down<00:05:25.150> and<00:05:25.330> squeeze<00:05:25.720> it<00:05:25.990> nice

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
push it all down and squeeze it nice

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:42.480 
push it all down and squeeze it nice
tight<00:05:27.010> fit<00:05:27.250> no<00:05:27.700> gaps<00:05:30.240> right<00:05:31.240> at<00:05:31.450> six<00:05:41.490> more

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:53.239 

which<00:05:51.839> should<00:05:52.110> we<00:05:52.169> get<00:05:52.409> it<00:05:52.589> all<00:05:52.770> squeezed

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:53.249 
which should we get it all squeezed

which should we get it all squeezed
tightly

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.370 

that<00:06:04.000> we<00:06:04.210> haven't

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
that we haven't

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:13.110 
that we haven't
the<00:06:06.950> wings

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.500 

so<00:06:13.750> next<00:06:14.020> we'll<00:06:14.320> be<00:06:14.560> seeing<00:06:15.040> the<00:06:15.970> ellen<00:06:16.300> runs

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
so next we'll be seeing the ellen runs

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.930 
so next we'll be seeing the ellen runs
in<00:06:16.840> i<00:06:17.250> will<00:06:18.250> be<00:06:18.370> seeing<00:06:18.669> the<00:06:19.380> runner<00:06:20.380> in<00:06:20.710> CA<00:06:21.639> and

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
in i will be seeing the runner in CA and

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.900 
in i will be seeing the runner in CA and
the<00:06:22.030> elevators<00:06:22.660> in<00:06:22.810> and<00:06:23.139> what<00:06:23.350> better<00:06:23.470> push

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
the elevators in and what better push

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:30.540 
the elevators in and what better push
rod<00:06:25.650> so<00:06:27.690> we<00:06:28.690> have<00:06:28.810> five<00:06:29.139> steps<00:06:29.620> of<00:06:29.770> CA<00:06:30.010> glue<00:06:30.340> to

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
rod so we have five steps of CA glue to

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.590 
rod so we have five steps of CA glue to
be<00:06:30.669> had<00:06:30.880> here<00:06:30.990> to<00:06:31.990> elbow<00:06:32.260> runs<00:06:33.090> two<00:06:34.090> elevators

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600 
be had here to elbow runs two elevators

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.650 
be had here to elbow runs two elevators
and<00:06:35.350> a<00:06:35.620> rudder<00:06:35.830> but<00:06:36.790> that's<00:06:36.940> not<00:06:37.030> next<00:06:37.449> step

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:37.660 
and a rudder but that's not next step

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:45.839 
and a rudder but that's not next step
here
