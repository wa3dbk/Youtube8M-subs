transplant<00:02:19.080> journey<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.739> not<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> very

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
transplant journey is not a very

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.930 
transplant journey is not a very
positive<00:02:21.510> one<00:02:21.660> usually<00:02:22.140> but<00:02:22.950> for<00:02:23.220> me<00:02:23.430> overall

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
positive one usually but for me overall

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.970 
positive one usually but for me overall
it<00:02:24.180> was<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.330> very<00:02:24.629> positive<00:02:24.870> experience<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.950> I

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
it was a very positive experience and I

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.800 
it was a very positive experience and I
think<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.310> was<00:02:26.430> all<00:02:26.670> because<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.390> doctors

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
think it was all because of the doctors

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.070 
think it was all because of the doctors
and<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.230> nurses<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.950> fellows<00:02:29.340> here<00:02:29.790> and

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
because of them that definitely inspired

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.170 
because of them that definitely inspired
