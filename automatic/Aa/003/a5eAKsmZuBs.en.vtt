00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
from an off-road motorcycle helmet I

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.070 
from an off-road motorcycle helmet I
like<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.610> changes<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.330> they<00:01:00.420> made<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.839> I

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
like the changes that they made and I

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.469 
like the changes that they made and I
think<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.830> we're<00:01:02.430> definitely<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.299> the<00:01:03.360> right

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:05.600 
think that we're definitely in the right
direction<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.049> they're<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.470> willing<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.979> to

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
direction and they're that willing to to

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.630

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
once I wore it and you know did some

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.790 
once I wore it and you know did some
laughs<00:02:01.150> on<00:02:01.360> I<00:02:01.390> could<00:02:01.720> tell<00:02:01.900> that<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.260> you<00:02:02.680> know

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
laughs on I could tell that the you know

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.770 
laughs on I could tell that the you know
the<00:02:02.920> ventilation<00:02:03.460> on<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.730> helmet<00:02:04.030> had<00:02:04.210> been

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
the ventilation on the helmet had been

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.140 
the ventilation on the helmet had been
improved<00:02:05.320> on<00:02:05.530> it<00:02:05.610> rather<00:02:06.610> than<00:02:06.850> worrying

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
improved on it rather than worrying

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.570 
improved on it rather than worrying
about<00:02:07.300> you<00:02:08.080> know<00:02:08.110> having<00:02:08.560> plastic<00:02:08.890> vent

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
about you know having plastic vent

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.130 
about you know having plastic vent
covers<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.240> things<00:02:10.420> like<00:02:10.570> that<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:11.020> be<00:02:11.050> able

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
covers and things like that to be able

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.290 
covers and things like that to be able
to<00:02:11.320> close<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.620> off<00:02:11.920> we<00:02:12.490> just<00:02:12.550> went<00:02:12.940> ahead<00:02:13.060> and

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
to close it off we just went ahead and

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.480 
to close it off we just went ahead and
opened<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.780> up<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:13.930> maximize<00:02:14.680> airflow<00:02:14.980> through

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
opened it up to maximize airflow through

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.550 
opened it up to maximize airflow through
the<00:02:15.550> helmet<00:02:15.970> think<00:02:16.450> that<00:02:16.690> with<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.200> new<00:02:17.230> pads

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
the helmet think that with the new pads

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.770 
the helmet think that with the new pads
and<00:02:17.740> in<00:02:17.860> ventilation<00:02:18.070> it's<00:02:18.550> just<00:02:19.510> another

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
and in ventilation it's just another

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.570 
and in ventilation it's just another
step<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.140> they<00:02:20.380> made<00:02:20.620> that's<00:02:20.890> it's<00:02:21.310> in<00:02:21.490> the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
step that they made that's it's in the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.200 
step that they made that's it's in the
right<00:02:21.700> direction

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
right direction

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.000

you<00:02:22.330> know<00:02:22.420> I've<00:02:22.540> done<00:02:22.780> some<00:02:23.200> long<00:02:23.380> testing<00:02:23.920> on

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
you know I've done some long testing on

it and I've never never got goggle drip

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.260 
it and I've never never got goggle drip

out how to solve that problem we went

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.540 
out how to solve that problem we went
ahead<00:03:16.850> and<00:03:17.000> we<00:03:17.209> installed<00:03:17.630> a<00:03:18.520> stainless<00:03:19.520> steel

visor just for appearance to say Ricky

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.610 
visor just for appearance to say Ricky
told<00:03:50.269> us<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:50.540> we<00:03:50.660> needed<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:50.989> have<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.260> longer

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
told us that we needed to have a longer

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.650 
told us that we needed to have a longer
visor<00:03:52.010> for<00:03:52.400> additional<00:03:52.850> protection<00:03:53.000> from

visor for additional protection from

visor for additional protection from
roost<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.590> Sun<00:03:54.860> and<00:03:55.160> our<00:03:55.670> engineers<00:03:56.390> on

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
roost and the Sun and our engineers on

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.050 
roost and the Sun and our engineers on
the<00:03:57.080> spot<00:03:57.410> increased<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.550> length<00:03:58.760> of<00:03:58.970> the

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
the spot increased the length of the

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.420 
the spot increased the length of the
visor<00:03:59.300> and<00:03:59.660> had<00:04:00.260> him<00:04:00.470> test<00:04:00.800> it<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.100> determine

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
visor and had him test it to determine

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.120 
visor and had him test it to determine
the<00:04:01.610> proper<00:04:02.030> length<00:04:02.239> so<00:04:02.600> I<00:04:02.630> think<00:04:02.959> I<00:04:03.500> think<00:04:04.070> I

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
the proper length so I think I think I

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.039 
the proper length so I think I think I
helped<00:04:04.400> a<00:04:04.459> little<00:04:04.580> bit<00:04:04.790> on<00:04:04.970> improving<00:04:05.930> the

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049
