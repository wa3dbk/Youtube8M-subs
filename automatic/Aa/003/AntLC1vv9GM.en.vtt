00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
invisible wall that I hate - getting it

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.830 
invisible wall that I hate - getting it
onto<00:04:42.480> these<00:04:42.810> things<00:04:42.870> that<00:04:43.530> thing<00:04:43.890> that<00:04:44.130> thing

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
unfortunately there's a wall this but

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.480 
unfortunately there's a wall this but
honestly<00:04:52.110> these<00:04:52.350> these<00:04:52.620> maps<00:04:52.920> don't<00:04:53.190> have<00:04:53.340> as

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
honestly these these maps don't have as

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.830 
honestly these these maps don't have as
many<00:04:53.670> as<00:04:54.110> like<00:04:55.110> cod4<00:04:55.410> didn't<00:04:56.690> really<00:04:57.690> wish

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
many as like cod4 didn't really wish

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.780 
many as like cod4 didn't really wish
that<00:04:57.960> they<00:04:58.110> had<00:04:58.230> kept<00:04:58.440> it<00:04:58.650> I<00:04:58.770> mean<00:04:58.980> it<00:04:59.190> they

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
that they had kept it I mean it they

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.040 
that they had kept it I mean it they
have<00:04:59.970> more<00:05:00.240> than<00:05:00.450> black<00:05:00.690> ops<00:05:01.250> but<00:05:02.250> I<00:05:02.550> mean<00:05:03.050> not

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
have more than black ops but I mean not

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.340 
have more than black ops but I mean not
as<00:05:04.170> much<00:05:04.350> as<00:05:04.500> mono<00:05:04.710> for<00:05:04.980> two<00:05:05.130> or<00:05:05.430> even<00:05:05.820> or<00:05:06.540> cut

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
as much as mono for two or even or cut

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.250 
as much as mono for two or even or cut
for<00:05:07.910> so<00:05:08.910> uh<00:05:08.940> well<00:05:09.510> I<00:05:09.540> guess<00:05:09.750> you<00:05:09.840> can<00:05:09.960> do<00:05:10.050> that

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
for so uh well I guess you can do that
