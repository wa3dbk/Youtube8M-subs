00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.940 
without worrying about writing I still
do<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.479> with<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.049> written<00:01:43.380> videos<00:01:43.740> I'll

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
do that with the written videos I'll

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.069 
do that with the written videos I'll
write<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.189> out<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:45.149> well<00:01:45.390> planned<00:01:45.570> and

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
write it out so it's well planned and

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.780 
write it out so it's well planned and
then<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.649> lot<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.009> times<00:01:47.189> I'll<00:01:47.310> go<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.700> just

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
then a lot of times I'll go in and just

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.160 
then a lot of times I'll go in and just
try<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.000> improve<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.689> do<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:49.020> what

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
try and improve it and do like what

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.620 
try and improve it and do like what
feels<00:01:49.409> more<00:01:49.710> natural<00:01:50.070> i<00:01:50.939> guess<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.360> i<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.540> have

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
feels more natural i guess so i do have

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.510

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
to grow and succeed on youtube I think

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.450 
to grow and succeed on youtube I think
you<00:03:09.600> just<00:03:09.630> have<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:09.990> adapt<00:03:10.320> plus<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:11.370> have

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
you just have to adapt plus you have
