our little animals trying to eat them
squirrels<00:02:24.070> or<00:02:24.400> rats<00:02:24.610> or<00:02:24.900> possums<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.050> what<00:02:26.650> I

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
squirrels or rats or possums and what I

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.510 
squirrels or rats or possums and what I
had<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:26.920> do<00:02:27.040> basically<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.520> is<00:02:27.820> cut<00:02:28.540> off<00:02:29.340> any<00:02:30.340> of

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
had to do basically is is cut off any of

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.949 
had to do basically is is cut off any of
the<00:02:30.610> leaves<00:02:30.850> that<00:02:31.270> were<00:02:31.810> in<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.380> way<00:02:33.959> because

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
the leaves that were in the way because

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.810 
the leaves that were in the way because
as<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.650> can<00:02:35.770> see<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:36.870> leaves<00:02:37.870> are<00:02:38.140> pretty<00:02:38.470> big

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
as you can see the leaves are pretty big

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.580 
as you can see the leaves are pretty big
coming<00:02:39.820> down<00:02:39.940> there<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.170> had<00:02:41.320> to<00:02:41.380> chop

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
coming down there and so I had to chop

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.430 
coming down there and so I had to chop
off<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:41.950> lower<00:02:42.100> lower<00:02:42.700> leaves<00:02:43.260> now<00:02:44.260> which

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
off the lower lower leaves now which

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.479 
off the lower lower leaves now which
won't<00:02:44.620> hurt<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:44.920> plant<00:02:47.040> in<00:02:48.040> order<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.340> be<00:02:48.430> able

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
won't hurt the plant in order to be able

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:55.890 
won't hurt the plant in order to be able
to<00:02:48.700> wrap<00:02:48.880> it<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.560> there<00:02:50.560> is<00:02:50.770> the<00:02:51.010> final<00:02:54.900> final

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
to wrap it and there is the final final

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.690 
to wrap it and there is the final final
wrapping<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.860> pretty<00:02:57.310> much<00:02:57.400> should

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
wrapping and that pretty much should

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.800 
wrapping and that pretty much should
discourage<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:59.830> little<00:03:00.070> critters<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:01.270> I'm

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
discourage the little critters so I'm

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.910 
discourage the little critters so I'm
the<00:03:02.020> only<00:03:02.140> one<00:03:02.290> that's<00:03:02.500> going<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.650> be<00:03:02.739> able<00:03:02.830> to

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
the only one that's going to be able to

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:12.080 
the only one that's going to be able to
eat<00:03:03.040> these<00:03:03.250> hopefully

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.150 

you
