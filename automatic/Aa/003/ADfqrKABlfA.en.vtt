00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
to use this one which is the white it's

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.439 
to use this one which is the white it's
really<00:00:22.880> really<00:00:23.179> light<00:00:23.980> inner<00:00:24.980> corners<00:00:28.449> choose

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
really really light inner corners choose

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.670 
the rest of the eye and on the outer
corner<00:01:08.659> like<00:01:08.869> this<00:01:10.509> just<00:01:11.509> blend<00:01:12.080> those<00:01:12.350> two

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
corner like this just blend those two

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.539 
corner like this just blend those two
together<00:01:14.229> this<00:01:15.229> try<00:01:15.770> not<00:01:15.950> to<00:01:16.070> bring<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.340> color

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
together this try not to bring the color

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.600 
together this try not to bring the color
too<00:01:16.909> far<00:01:17.360> we're<00:01:17.659> keeping<00:01:17.960> it<00:01:18.080> it's<00:01:19.009> only<00:01:19.250> outer

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
too far we're keeping it it's only outer

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.140 
too far we're keeping it it's only outer
two-thirds<00:01:21.759> now<00:01:22.759> my<00:01:23.030> eyes<00:01:23.240> are<00:01:23.570> closed<00:01:24.259> set<00:01:25.150> so

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
two-thirds now my eyes are closed set so

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.310 
two-thirds now my eyes are closed set so
this<00:01:26.390> is<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:26.600> technique<00:01:27.049> that<00:01:27.110> I<00:01:27.380> use<00:01:28.000> every<00:01:29.000> day

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
this is a technique that I use every day

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.340 
this is a technique that I use every day
so<00:01:30.320> just<00:01:30.350> even<00:01:30.829> them<00:01:31.220> out<00:01:31.369> a<00:01:31.400> little<00:01:31.840> there<00:01:32.840> now

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
so just even them out a little there now

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.899 
so just even them out a little there now
I'm<00:01:33.439> gonna<00:01:33.530> take<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:33.740> darker<00:01:34.250> color<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:34.790> I'm

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
I'm gonna take a darker color and I'm

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.200 
I'm gonna take a darker color and I'm
gonna<00:01:35.000> use<00:01:35.240> black<00:01:36.070> so<00:01:37.070> we<00:01:37.399> can<00:01:37.670> really<00:01:37.909> see

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
gonna use black so we can really see

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.910 
gonna use black so we can really see
that<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.689> the<00:01:38.780> black<00:01:38.990> is<00:01:39.170> in<00:01:39.290> this<00:01:39.470> palette

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
that and the black is in this palette

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.480 
that and the black is in this palette
it's<00:01:40.340> there<00:01:40.790> the<00:01:41.299> corner<00:01:41.750> go<00:01:42.530> really<00:01:43.340> really

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
it's there the corner go really really

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.870 
it's there the corner go really really
carefully<00:01:44.090> with<00:01:44.720> that<00:01:45.040> just<00:01:46.040> on<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.520> outer

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
carefully with that just on the outer

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.170 
carefully with that just on the outer
corner<00:01:48.070> just<00:01:49.070> a<00:01:49.310> touch<00:01:51.579> on<00:01:52.579> the<00:01:52.640> outer<00:01:52.909> corner

now we're just going to give her a
really<00:02:03.670> good<00:02:03.970> blend<00:02:04.330> all<00:02:04.660> together<00:02:05.040> now<00:02:06.040> this

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
really good blend all together now this

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:14.640 
really good blend all together now this
is<00:02:06.370> a<00:02:06.400> look<00:02:06.640> actually<00:02:07.150> I<00:02:07.600> would<00:02:08.500> wear<00:02:13.380> I'm<00:02:14.380> just

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
is a look actually I would wear I'm just

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.640 
is a look actually I would wear I'm just
blending<00:02:14.950> those<00:02:15.280> three<00:02:15.640> colors<00:02:16.030> together<00:02:19.650> and

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
blending those three colors together and

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.620 
blending those three colors together and
I'm<00:02:20.770> quite<00:02:20.980> into<00:02:21.310> matte<00:02:21.580> shadows<00:02:22.360> at<00:02:22.570> the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
I'm quite into matte shadows at the

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.740 
I'm quite into matte shadows at the
moment<00:02:23.080> because<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.250> have<00:02:24.670> slightly<00:02:25.090> prominent

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
moment because I have slightly prominent

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.050 
moment because I have slightly prominent
eyes<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.620> just<00:02:26.920> helps<00:02:27.280> flatten<00:02:27.790> them<00:02:27.940> out

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
eyes and it just helps flatten them out

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:38.000 
eyes and it just helps flatten them out
a<00:02:28.120> little<00:02:30.960> they're<00:02:31.960> very<00:02:32.170> easy<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.890> blend

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.880 

there<00:02:39.010> we<00:02:39.130> go<00:02:39.840> those<00:02:40.840> three<00:02:41.200> are<00:02:41.410> nicely

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
there we go those three are nicely

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.130 
there we go those three are nicely
blended<00:02:42.550> and<00:02:42.700> just<00:02:42.880> wing<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.150> out<00:02:43.450> slightly

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
blended and just wing it out slightly

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.470 
blended and just wing it out slightly
now<00:02:44.920> take<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.160> black<00:02:45.460> or<00:02:45.790> brown<00:02:46.090> Kohl<00:02:46.450> pencil

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
now take a black or brown Kohl pencil

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.760 
now take a black or brown Kohl pencil
and<00:02:47.230> line<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.940> upper<00:02:48.970> line<00:02:49.600> just<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.440> outer

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
and line the upper line just the outer

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:59.670 
and line the upper line just the outer
corners<00:02:57.150> we<00:02:58.150> want<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.540> place<00:02:58.780> all<00:02:59.140> of<00:02:59.530> the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
corners we want to place all of the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:11.339 
corners we want to place all of the
emphasis<00:03:00.510> on<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:02.320> outer<00:03:02.530> corners<00:03:03.190> only

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.510 

like<00:03:11.950> this

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520
