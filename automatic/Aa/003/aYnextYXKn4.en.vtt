00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
right right here that's my sound card

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.820 
right right here that's my sound card
right<00:03:59.740> here<00:04:00.180> hmm<00:04:01.240> I<00:04:01.420> just<00:04:02.200> realized<00:04:02.620> these

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
right here hmm I just realized these

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.140 
right here hmm I just realized these
fans<00:04:04.800> well<00:04:05.800> half<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.130> this<00:04:06.250> fan<00:04:06.490> is<00:04:06.640> a<00:04:06.670> slightly

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
fans well half of this fan is a slightly

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.760 
fans well half of this fan is a slightly
blocked<00:04:07.570> out<00:04:07.750> by<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:07.959> sound<00:04:08.260> card<00:04:08.530> so<00:04:08.680> the

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
blocked out by the sound card so the

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.630 
blocked out by the sound card so the
intake<00:04:09.190> might<00:04:09.610> be<00:04:09.780> not<00:04:10.780> like<00:04:11.020> four<00:04:11.410> but<00:04:11.860> well

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
intake might be not like four but well

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.850 
intake might be not like four but well
that's<00:04:12.820> all<00:04:12.910> I<00:04:13.000> can<00:04:13.180> do<00:04:13.390> basically<00:04:13.840> cuz<00:04:14.200> I<00:04:14.230> hit

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
that's all I can do basically cuz I hit

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.890 
that's all I can do basically cuz I hit
an<00:04:15.010> accident<00:04:15.490> I<00:04:15.550> actually<00:04:15.730> broke<00:04:16.239> off<00:04:16.510> my

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
an accident I actually broke off my

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.909 
an accident I actually broke off my
bottom<00:04:17.680> PCI<00:04:18.070> slot<00:04:18.520> right<00:04:18.730> here<00:04:18.970> so<00:04:19.919> they

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
bottom PCI slot right here so they

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.260 
bottom PCI slot right here so they
wouldn't<00:04:21.130> take<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:21.370> back<00:04:21.669> they<00:04:21.850> said<00:04:22.090> that

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
wouldn't take it back they said that

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.820 
wouldn't take it back they said that
unless<00:04:22.600> you<00:04:22.810> force<00:04:23.110> that<00:04:23.230> they<00:04:23.500> don't<00:04:23.680> break

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
unless you force that they don't break

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.850 
unless you force that they don't break
and<00:04:24.220> I<00:04:24.880> did<00:04:25.120> force<00:04:25.450> it<00:04:25.630> just<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:25.900> little<00:04:26.020> bit<00:04:26.230> so

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
and I did force it just a little bit so

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.510 
and I did force it just a little bit so
it<00:04:27.250> broke<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:28.570> nothing<00:04:28.870> I<00:04:28.960> can<00:04:29.110> do<00:04:29.230> about<00:04:29.320> that

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
it broke the nothing I can do about that

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.860
