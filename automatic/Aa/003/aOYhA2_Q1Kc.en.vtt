00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.520
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.410
 this year's summer tire test the 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.480
 We are critical of the consumption 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.570
 plank and tasci dente and test for 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.199
 you have 16 different size 195 tires 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.939
 65 15 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.400
 in a total of twelve criteria, the 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.470
 Tires show their qualities only 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.359
 professional test area offers 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.030
 the necessary space and the technical 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.220
 conditions for this year's 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.010
 hawaii 16 different summer tires 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.800
 marks selected on this high 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.110
 stacks are the premium brands 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.790
 the newly developed tires for the test 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.140
 compete 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.720
 in the middle but the so-called 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.270
 second brands the name is well known 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.280
 also a little less cost and in the 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.860
 usually good performance I do 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.350
 then we have three more mature ones 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.930
 lowest price segment was selected 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.790
 Of course , want to look very carefully 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.310
 the quality is not or the price suffers 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.890
 We start with the tests on dry 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.770
 street first discipline the 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.030
 external noise measurement 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.130
 This is followed by the measurement of the braking distance 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.530
 between the best tires of dunlop 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.680
 and the worst soon 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.940
 There are six meters difference 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.909
 surprisingly well here is the 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.009
 apollo alma 4g also in the handling 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.429
 properties that drove without esp 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.110
 become 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:31.970
 the next falls significantly during 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.179
 the rest of the test field is not 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.490
 experience is slip 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:38.740
 when trying to wet on larger 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.909
 to expect differences 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.090
 before, however, a new sentence 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.509
 Test tires also mounted the air pressure 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.340
 just needs to be a particularly good beats 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.380
 again the dunlop final light 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.569
 this time because then the tempo 100 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.500
 enormous 13 meter braking distance needs 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:00.250
 extra security 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.630
 aquaplaning offers the semperit speed 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.759
 worst tire is again the near 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.840
 may be in deeper puddles 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.789
 special care is the pure 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.980
 readings say little about it 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.650
 how the car on wet road 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.269
 Add a good tire when wet 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.940
 great influence on the subjective 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.320
 feeling safe so it does not help much 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.609
 if the car exceeds the 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.109
 abrupt boundary suddenly breaks out 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:29.150
 Here work out with high 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:31.760
 expense developed premium brands 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.769
 all the decisive advantage of the 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.470
 Cheap tires can only the apollo 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.630
 now the others will keep up 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.790
 Criteria the rolling resistance and price 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.799
 takes into account the following results 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.900
 picture the best tires to offer 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.060
 exception of classmates still the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.859
 premium brands that the apollo in 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.910
 some disciplines top values 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.800
 is reached 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.410
 Surprise, however, it still lacks the 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.150
 fine cut with consistently appealing 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.010
 achievements, the Dutch pushes 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.230
 speak unobtrusively in the stone 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.300
 top field no surprise am 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.830
 the back end of the field the cheap ones 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.830
 mature from next and you can
