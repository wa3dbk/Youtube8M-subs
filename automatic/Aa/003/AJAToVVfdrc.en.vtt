00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
highlighting cream that doesn't add any

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.520 
highlighting cream that doesn't add any
color<00:01:29.550> but<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.330> don't<00:01:30.750> know<00:01:30.810> if<00:01:30.870> you<00:01:30.960> can<00:01:31.140> see<00:01:31.380> it

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
color but I don't know if you can see it

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.430 
color but I don't know if you can see it
but<00:01:31.890> answer<00:01:32.460> shine<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> face<00:01:33.420> which<00:01:34.080> gives

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
but answer shine to the face which gives

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.440 
but answer shine to the face which gives
the<00:01:34.620> illusion<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.280> higher<00:01:35.700> cheekbones<00:01:36.030> it

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the illusion of higher cheekbones it

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.390 
the illusion of higher cheekbones it
just<00:01:36.630> draws<00:01:36.870> the<00:01:36.900> light<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.560> them<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
just draws the light to them and the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.370 
just draws the light to them and the
contouring<00:01:38.910> part<00:01:39.180> here<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.660> cream<00:01:40.020> as<00:01:40.200> well

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
contouring part here is a cream as well

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.460 
contouring part here is a cream as well
and<00:01:41.040> I'll<00:01:41.130> put<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.430> next<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.940> and<00:01:42.330> it<00:01:43.260> has<00:01:43.290> a

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
and I'll put it next to it and it has a

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.800 
and I'll put it next to it and it has a
gray<00:01:43.920> cast<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.000> which<00:01:45.150> I<00:01:45.270> don't<00:01:45.330> think<00:01:45.690> is

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
gray cast to it which I don't think is

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.720 
gray cast to it which I don't think is
coming<00:01:46.020> across<00:01:46.200> too<00:01:46.620> long<00:01:46.800> on<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.980> camera<00:01:47.370> and

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
coming across too long on the camera and

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.070 
coming across too long on the camera and
the<00:01:47.850> reason<00:01:48.090> that's<00:01:48.270> good<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.660> because<00:01:48.960> you

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
the reason that's good is because you

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.140 
the reason that's good is because you
want<00:01:49.260> to<00:01:49.320> create<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.590> shadow<00:01:49.980> and<00:01:50.550> shadows<00:01:50.940> tend

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
want to create a shadow and shadows tend

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.900 
want to create a shadow and shadows tend
to<00:01:51.390> be<00:01:51.540> gray<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.890> makes<00:01:53.280> perfect<00:01:53.790> sense

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
to be gray so this makes perfect sense

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.710 
to be gray so this makes perfect sense
to<00:01:54.120> me<00:01:54.330> I<00:01:55.310> can<00:01:56.310> honestly<00:01:56.490> say<00:01:56.730> these<00:01:57.120> are<00:01:57.270> 55

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
pounds here in the UK so they're

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.980
