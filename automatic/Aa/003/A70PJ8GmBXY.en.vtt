00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.190
 I believe that the tuning of the car he 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.949
 acceptable when a person understands 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.340
 what is he doing that is touring the pilot 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.680
 Permian, you can easily go and buy 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.310
 tank go and so incredible 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.810
 shells and the meaning is you ride on really 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.560
 dangerous thing which is from the place and 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.480
 deadly 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.940
 the car is no different 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.340
 absolutely no one at least it will be so 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.129
 even though it will be there gelenvagen itself 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.050
 charged engine unfortunately 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.340
 drivers in the modern world have not forgotten 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.030
 or do not understand or do not want to understand 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.579
 the fact that they are owners 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.800
 much of a serious subject like 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.510
 the car that keeps on the road is not 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.260
 all your body and in small packs 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.910
 rubber 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.699
 which is essentially lethal 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.289
 arms in the wrong hands 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.180
 This myth unfortunately has become very 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.239
 actively support automakers , 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.860
 as much as possible electronics and people 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.030
 again unfortunately many drivers 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.220
 ceased to understand that all the same 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.010
 required training required some 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.479
 at least sometimes you need to visit in 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.159
 driving courses 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.290
 not necessarily that this will become 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.799
 one hundred percent pilots yes immediately sport 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.580
 will go 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.159
 well, what's another example you give but 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.619
 put on don't know girls there yes if 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.030
 high heel shoes and run on treadmill 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.920
 track you do not do in dress 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.049
 sneakers or there at least correctly 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.650
 equipment or you won't go to 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.150
 expensive shoes for 3,000 euros 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.799
 patent on the hunt you buy again 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.869
 equip you at least like that 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.240
 understand that's the topic with cars to 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.250
 Unfortunately, the situation is extremely wrong on 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.270
 nobody considers today 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.220
 the bulk 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.439
 where I think it is unnecessary, I drive 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.270
 I went to work here and when 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.340
 there is a critical situation in 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.750
 all was at least once life begins 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.240
 wonder what is it 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.050
 did wrong and most often will happen 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.350
 we know about the bill 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.570
 my opinion is my stupid answer 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.520
 when I lost control I am not 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.560
 I understand that it happened there is not something 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.330
 braked it all means uniquely 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.820
 man does not understand what he is doing 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.540
 it is desirable not to sit on the steering wheel 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.280
 sense not finish any course absolutely 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.920
 driving or contra- driver and either 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.840
 extreme professional drivers 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.430
 and understanding cars are not with 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.230
 point of view how it looks from the point 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.300
 view that you can do with it absolutely 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.010
 no matter how cars drive for 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.600
 his car is a means of either 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.970
 express themselves in a good way 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.250
 words yes no no Ponte how would I buy 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.780
 I watch what the car namely, 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.150
 subject of expression 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.920
 if he understands that he is good at 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.450
 rally style he knows what car 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.520
 need to buy if you remind that 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.110
 cars need for business whatever it is 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.520
 nor was the golden pilot ready for you 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.890
 car which will be his 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.510
 present as a good suit there 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.220
 wagon drivers to which absolutely 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.130
 really do not care what's ride 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.110
 can buy a car with a little 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.370
 engine capacity may be general 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.230
 diesel it may not be necessary 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.570
 there can be all-wheel drive front 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.310
 driven but drive and enjoy 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.810
 driving will be no worse about 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.180
 comfortable evil how driver 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.690
 1 order way higher than on more expensive 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.970
 car so again my opinion 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.280
 whatever you buy what was not yours 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.239
 car at least once half a year to pass 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.239
 and short driving course
