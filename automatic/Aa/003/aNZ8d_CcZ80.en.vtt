until there's actually food on his
inventory<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.280> if<00:00:39.000> he<00:00:39.149> eats<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.660> there's

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
narco berries those are probably the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.720 
narco berries those are probably the
most<00:00:55.590> important<00:00:56.100> part<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> taming

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
most important part of the taming

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.209 
most important part of the taming
because<00:00:57.600> those<00:00:57.840> are<00:00:58.020> white<00:00:58.199> peaches<00:00:58.469> torfur

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
because those are white peaches torfur

up there at the bottom right corner

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
and that's what keeps them unconscious

the video website you have to watch the

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.750 
the video website you have to watch the
entire<00:01:24.970> thing<00:01:25.390> that<00:01:26.020> you<00:01:26.229> take<00:01:26.440> forever<00:01:26.950> to

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
entire thing that you take forever to

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.660 
entire thing that you take forever to
attain<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.510> gun<00:01:28.750> sword<00:01:29.080> and<00:01:29.410> also<00:01:30.369> because

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
attain the gun sword and also because

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.280 
attain the gun sword and also because
the<00:01:30.850> frame<00:01:31.119> rates<00:01:31.390> really<00:01:31.660> shaking<00:01:32.140> on<00:01:32.260> the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
the frame rates really shaking on the

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.440 
the frame rates really shaking on the
game<00:01:32.530> so<00:01:33.040> I<00:01:33.070> figure<00:01:33.430> if<00:01:33.550> I<00:01:33.670> speed<00:01:34.000> it<00:01:34.030> up<00:01:34.240> a<00:01:34.420> bit

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
game so I figure if I speed it up a bit

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.719 
game so I figure if I speed it up a bit
then<00:01:34.810> it<00:01:34.960> might<00:01:35.080> not<00:01:35.229> look<00:01:35.440> as<00:01:35.590> shitty<00:01:35.800> like

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
then it might not look as shitty like

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.350 
then it might not look as shitty like
this<00:01:37.090> looks<00:01:37.420> way<00:01:37.810> better<00:01:38.080> than<00:01:38.380> I<00:01:38.560> was

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
this looks way better than I was

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.550 
this looks way better than I was
anyway<00:01:41.360> so<00:01:41.420> basically<00:01:42.020> I'm<00:01:42.170> going<00:01:42.409> to<00:01:42.500> be

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
anyway so basically I'm going to be

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.469 
anyway so basically I'm going to be
doing<00:01:42.710> here<00:01:43.070> is<00:01:43.190> grabbing<00:01:43.520> all<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.880> berries<00:01:44.330> I

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
doing here is grabbing all the berries I

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.450 
doing here is grabbing all the berries I
can<00:01:44.750> bring<00:01:45.050> it<00:01:45.110> back<00:01:45.409> to<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.650> dinosaur<00:01:46.159> I

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
can bring it back to the dinosaur I

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.580 
can bring it back to the dinosaur I
recommend<00:01:47.210> this<00:01:47.600> be<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:47.990> first<00:01:48.290> thing<00:01:48.530> that

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
recommend this be the first thing that

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.980

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
you do when you start on server because

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.260 
you do when you start on server because
it's<00:01:51.350> really<00:01:51.619> easy<00:01:51.830> to<00:01:52.070> do<00:01:52.280> it's<00:01:52.760> more<00:01:53.090> of<00:01:53.180> a

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
just use my fish like get a lower level

just use my fish like get a lower level
sinusoid<00:02:02.240> this<00:02:02.390> one's<00:02:02.600> on<00:02:02.750> level<00:02:03.140> two<00:02:03.350> and

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
sinusoid this one's on level two and

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.430 
sinusoid this one's on level two and
then<00:02:04.759> once<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.210> came<00:02:05.420> on<00:02:05.659> he<00:02:05.810> didn't<00:02:06.020> level<00:02:06.320> up

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
then once you came on he didn't level up

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.719 
then once you came on he didn't level up
with<00:02:07.400> you<00:02:07.729> like<00:02:07.970> you<00:02:08.119> haven't<00:02:08.330> level<00:02:08.630> up<00:02:09.729> great

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
when you level up but gradually he will

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.070 
when you level up but gradually he will
love<00:02:13.459> a<00:02:13.520> lot<00:02:13.730> by<00:02:13.940> both<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.330> same<00:02:14.540> rate<00:02:14.840> and

loading more resources that use for
making<00:03:45.890> a<00:03:46.189> base<00:03:46.400> now<00:03:47.030> once<00:03:47.239> you're<00:03:47.450> high

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
making a base now once you're high

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.479 
making a base now once you're high
enough<00:03:47.689> level<00:03:48.260> that<00:03:48.409> you<00:03:48.469> make<00:03:48.799> wooden<00:03:49.069> stuff

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
enough level that you make wooden stuff

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:50.979 
enough level that you make wooden stuff
that's<00:03:49.760> why<00:03:49.969> i<00:03:50.000> recommend<00:03:50.239> you<00:03:50.629> make<00:03:50.659> your

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
that's why i recommend you make your

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.380 
that's why i recommend you make your
actual<00:03:51.319> days<00:03:51.530> if<00:03:52.010> you<00:03:52.310> have<00:03:52.579> more<00:03:52.819> people<00:03:53.060> may

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
actual days if you have more people may

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.780 
actual days if you have more people may
take<00:03:53.629> over<00:03:53.870> dinosaurs<00:03:54.470> anything<00:03:54.799> you<00:03:55.609> can

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
take over dinosaurs anything you can

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.580 
take over dinosaurs anything you can
wait<00:03:55.970> even<00:03:56.299> longer<00:03:56.359> because<00:03:56.840> you<00:03:57.140> guys<00:03:57.290> can

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
wait even longer because you guys can

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.259 
wait even longer because you guys can
survive<00:03:58.010> very<00:03:58.310> well<00:03:58.430> especially<00:03:58.790> if<00:03:59.120> you<00:03:59.239> have

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
survive very well especially if you have

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.569 
survive very well especially if you have
a<00:03:59.390> bunch<00:03:59.629> of<00:03:59.750> dinosaurs<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:01.129> you<00:04:01.280> want<00:04:01.489> to

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
a bunch of dinosaurs and you want to

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.539 
a bunch of dinosaurs and you want to
make<00:04:01.700> sure<00:04:01.730> your<00:04:02.090> first<00:04:02.359> dinosaur<00:04:03.049> is<00:04:03.319> a

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
make sure your first dinosaur is a

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.649 
make sure your first dinosaur is a
herbivore<00:04:04.549> like<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.849> one<00:04:04.969> I<00:04:05.000> took<00:04:05.180> over

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
herbivore like the one I took over

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.690 
herbivore like the one I took over
because<00:04:06.230> if<00:04:06.379> you<00:04:06.469> take<00:04:06.500> out<00:04:06.859> like<00:04:07.069> a<00:04:07.099> raptor

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
because if you take out like a raptor

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.069 
because if you take out like a raptor
which<00:04:08.000> probably<00:04:08.269> won't<00:04:08.450> be<00:04:08.599> able<00:04:08.720> to<00:04:08.959> do

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
which probably won't be able to do

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.860 
which probably won't be able to do
anyways<00:04:09.500> or<00:04:09.950> more<00:04:10.700> realistically<00:04:10.909> one<00:04:11.689> of<00:04:11.780> the

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
anyways or more realistically one of the

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.569 
anyways or more realistically one of the
stickers<00:04:12.349> and<00:04:12.919> then<00:04:13.010> you<00:04:13.129> have<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.340> actually

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
stickers and then you have to actually

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.909 
stickers and then you have to actually
keep<00:04:14.000> feeding<00:04:14.450> that<00:04:14.480> brought<00:04:14.900> me<00:04:15.169> and<00:04:15.439> you're

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:17.560 
keep feeding that brought me and you're
not<00:04:16.070> going<00:04:16.310> to<00:04:16.400> have<00:04:16.519> a<00:04:16.549> lot<00:04:16.789> Romney<00:04:17.299> and<00:04:17.449> to

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
till the game to optimize a little

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.969 
till the game to optimize a little
better<00:05:04.870> so<00:05:05.110> the<00:05:05.199> game<00:05:05.380> doesn't<00:05:05.590> look<00:05:05.770> safe

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
better so the game doesn't look safe
