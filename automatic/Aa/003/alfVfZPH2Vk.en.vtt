00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.190
 later i'm on the scales and fix the bang for 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.290
 order to create street volume 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.470
 the resulting tail we divide by three 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:54.220
 equal parts and start working with one 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.750
 of three parts we divide into three parts and 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.449
 start to braid 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.489
 An ordinary braid this hairstyle is very 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.430

 I fix it with a small rubber I 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.280
 getting down to work on the next zone 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.270
 the remaining hair mass I divide approximately 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.360
 into two equal parts and start working with 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.060
 one of them is the next zone i 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.970
 in a similar way I divide by three equal 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.980
 parts and exactly the same start prop fly 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.980

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.250
