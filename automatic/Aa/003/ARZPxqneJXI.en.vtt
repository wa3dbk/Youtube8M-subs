00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:07.229
 we will prepare the chocolate cake 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.680
 ingredients that we need are for the 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:13.350
 creamy cake 6 eggs 200 grams of 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.049
 chocolate for desserts 250 grams of 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.570
 200 butter sugar plus a little bit 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.550
 20 grams of pure cocoa powder 50 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.039
 grams of wheat flour and 50 of 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.160
 cornstarch and for icing 100 grams of 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.920
 chocolate 40 grams of butter 200 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.160
 of icing sugar or powder and 4 tablespoons of 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.010
 water and let's start by taking our 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.679
 23 centimeter mold and we're going to 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.999
 butter and with a teaspoon of 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:44.670
 flour we 're going to flour it so 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:47.809
 then it costs us a little bit to unmold 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.809
 our cake 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.300
 we throw the rest of flour and we're going to 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.870
 book and now let's take the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.989
 eggs and with the rod blender and 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.879
 adding the sugar we are going to assemble 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.600
 until they are sparkling and 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.600
 whitish 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.400
 we put an intermediate speed because not 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.980
 the maximum power of the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.610
 blender for this we take the 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:20.910
 butter and chocolate and we put it together 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.310
 in a bowl and medium taps of 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.000
 we are going to melt it in the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.160
 microwave little by little 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.790
 we are moving it between tap and 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.790
 tap 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.060
 and back to get to it 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.060
 let's get completely melted 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.490
 it is normal that the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.079
 butter but this will also help 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.079
 that chocolate melts better 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.250
 once we have it all we go back to 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.299
 our blender that will already be 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.299
 mounted eggs 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.750
 and carefully we are going to add the mixture 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.259
 of chocolate and butter to the dough 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.259
 of eggs 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.960
 without stopping the blender is not necessary 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.270
 Once everything integrated stop 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.270
 we remove the bowl from the blender 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.580
 and with the help of a sieve or colander 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.580
 let's throw the flour 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.980
 and pure cocoa powder 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.710
 I remind you that cocoa is not worth 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.750
 breakfast has to be pure I know that in 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.050
 other countries instead of saying cocoa 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.460
 Cocoa says and this is the one we should use 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.520
 we cast a little bit and with the help of the 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.930
 spatula we integrate it little by little to 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.930
 Do not make too many lumps 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.130
 we add another bit and go back to 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.130
 integrate it with the spatula 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.470
 and so on until we have integrated it 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.470
 all 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.370
 it is better that we do it so if 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.110
 we do it then, sure 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.020
 that we will have some very lumps 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.430
 thick in the dough and then that will make 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.430
 the cake does not look good 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.590
 Pure cocoa always tends to stay 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.739
 pretty much lumps milestone so what 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.099
 we help a little by crushing it with the 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.099
 fingers 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.650
 because we do not have to waste it 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:36.260
 once we have the mass of our 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.260
 we are going to put it in the mold 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.000
 and with the oven preheated to 180 degrees 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.360
 we're going to put it in first we give it a few 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.370
 taps so that the 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.040
 bubbles that may have remained and what 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.810
 we put in the oven at 180 degrees between 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.810
 half an hour and about 40 minutes 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.470
 I look at wardrobe as a snack while 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.900
 we make our recipe 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.420
 once the time has passed we will click it 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.890
 and if the needle comes out stained a tad 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.350
 but the cake has a height 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.720
 considerable and scabbed 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.820
 is that it will be already then I remind you that 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.820
 this cake has to be creamy 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.200
 now let's do the coverage and for 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.910
 so let's get the butter and 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.820
 the chocolate and we 're going to go back to 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.050
 melt as we have done before in the 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.050
 cake step 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:46.610
 we're going to melt it well and we're going to 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.400
 adding the icing sugar or little powder to 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.310
 little as it tends to harden 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.680
 much the mixture when adding the sugar 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:59.980
 we have to also incorporate the 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.980
 water little by little we add a little 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:03.869
 and we integrate it 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.570
 then we continue adding the sugar 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.570
 also little by little 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.180
 a little more water 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.970
 although I give you amounts for this 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.130
 type of coverage you have to have 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.039
 be careful as always depending on 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.870
 the brand of cocoa and everything can 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.759
 be to attend too liquid or 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.540
 too thick so you have to 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:34.790
 control the water and do not pass 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.880
 Now let's make our system 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.230
 glace ar tarts and place a plate 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.470
 big 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.450
 with the mortar upside down or with what we 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.090
 simply serve so that it does not get dirty 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:50.480
 and make us how to pluck 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.520
 we place the cake without the edge of the 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.220
 mold 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.229
 and we cast coverage with decision and to 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.800
 center of the pie and let it go 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:03.870
 spreading the lonely 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.870
 or she alone the clear coverage 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.300
 once we have thrown all 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:18.159
 we remove the bowl 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.159
 and without touching it too much 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.310
 let's try to extend it 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.820
 moving the cake a little towards the 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.360
 sides 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.360
 or the cake 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.610
 A) Yes 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.010
 nothing happens if it drips a little bit 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.040
 It will be much more colorful and more 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:44.800
 nice besides this coverage tends to 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:47.800
 harden very fast so we're not going 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.920
 to waste almost nothing we collect the 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.260
 and let it stand for a while or 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.480
 if you want you can eat it directly 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.120
 well this cake is very grateful and 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:01.240
 it's so freshly made fresh as day 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:04.120
 next I can not tell you how long it lasts 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:07.060
 because I take very little time to finish 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:11.940
 our house and it's not surprising because 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.940
 it is evident that it was delicious
