 I'll get it. 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:18.660
 Since the bond was necessary for transportation and many other things, it still needs 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:23.430
 Does not ahniraseo it as much as the old case now oh Friday that so 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:28.590

 It is good to give it to you by gold, because it is because it is re-use and the salt is distributed now 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.950
 Same thing, but it's the same. 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.610

 The atmosphere we talked about is the most popular, that is, it is universalized and easily broken 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.100
 Because there must be a number.
