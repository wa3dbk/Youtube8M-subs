00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.670
 Hi all, Swami channel and windows 8 and 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.520
 today we will talk about what 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.889
 such restore windows 8. 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.590
 restoring windows 8 is this 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.980
 the ability to save operating 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.310
 systems in the form when it is 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.539
 the operating system was 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.419
 workable and functions I have not been 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.839
 broken at the restore point you can 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:35.980
 do it manually and you can also set it as 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:37.780
 would have some kind of schedule for creating these points 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.360
 when the system itself will automatically 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.210
 do it by default if at all this 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.790
 feature is enabled in the system because 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.590
 sometimes it happens that very often that she 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.510
 disabled by default and so 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.030
 the system does not create any points 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.270
 save so here by default if it 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.280
 enabled system creates dots 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.620
 restore after installation or 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.300
 uninstall certain programs but how 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.230
 rule it concerns drivers on 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.259
 equipment 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.909
 well or some other programs that you 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.039
 install it before installation 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.679
 programs system automatically 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:15.920
 automatically creates . 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:18.079
 recovery and if after 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.000
 installation of this program which you 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.009
 installed in the system went some 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.109
 failures and malfunctions and you can't them 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.810
 then you can fix it 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:28.579
 come back ie run 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.829
 system restore and 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.319
 the system returned crumpled at that moment in 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.819
 what it was before installing this 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:36.799
 programs yes that is it is very convenient 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:38.509
 if you tried something there 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.840
 set experimented and this 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.560
 led to some kind of crash how to create 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.599
 restore point and how its system then 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.549
 have you become the point you created 

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:51.829
 I will show recovery now in order 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.049
 to create a restore point we 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.849
 we hover over the label 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.200
 menu let us click the right button 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:04.369
 here we select the system in the opened 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:09.440
 window we choose the system protection in this 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:12.060
 the window we can already configure the protection 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.550
 our system, that is, firstly we 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.290
 in the window where we have our displayed 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.470
 drives can be on or off 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.300
 actually this protection that is include 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:29.640
 or turn off point creation 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:31.230
 restore or we can create 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.300
 or restore, that is, we can 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.250
 for example, set up a system selected there 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.250
 we choose to configure and here we can 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:43.489
 choose to enable protection or disable a 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:47.060
 also we can choose the place volume 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:51.060
 hard drive memory which will be 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.400
 spend on data storage 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.819
 and this is necessary for example 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.170
 the system kept a large number of points 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.200
 save that is less space and 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.569
 fewer restore points you will have 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.700
 preserve and system accordingly 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.980
 if there is little space on the older point 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.459
 recovery will be automatically automatically 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.360
 dare so by this slider you 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:17.700
 regulate how much space you have 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:21.460
 agree release let out under 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:25.120
 restored us apply hands and everything 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.640
 so you can do from 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.769
 all other disks but usually 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.180
 recovery concerns system disk 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.659
 that is , the disk on which it stands 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.220
 windows operating system so for 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.400
 order to create a restore point 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:43.799
 we select the drive and click create with us 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.959
 opens a window where we are for convenience 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:49.900
 I recommend writing a date to file and 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.959
 then you could remember what it is 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.519
 restore point and somehow 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.459
 to navigate because if there are many 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.230
 then you can get confused and click create and here 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.519
 we went to the actual creation process 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.920
 . restore the way of saying this 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.989
 and those programs that are installed and those 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.299
 settings what are these drivers 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.299
 who is and all that is here 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.819
 is now preserved in the event that 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.949
 Later you will need to create 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.959
 restore point the computer will return 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:24.310
 that's who the state he is in 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.870
 We have now received a message from. created by 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.520
 successfully closes in order to 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.099
 restore here is the point 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.360
 restore click this item with us 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:33.580
 this window opens 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.720
 system recovery we choose further 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.849
 here we have a choice of these 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.830
 points if we manually to business yes that is 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:45.569
 this which we have just created 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.629
 here which was created before 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:51.569
 removal of the program which was lying on 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:53.879
 for example and here we can choose that or 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:58.610
 a different restore point press pressure 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:05:00.810
 further and here we are already going 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.410
 the confirmation 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.570
 fire restoration is ready and here 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.220
 we receive a message that after launch 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.889
 system restore abort 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.570
 impossible if we press waste with us 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.870
 the recovery process will begin but we 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:19.310
 we will not press this but you must 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.900
 understand that here on this in general 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:26.210
 all that matters 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:29.220
 system restore how to do it and 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:32.419
 how do you use it with you 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.400
 channel about windows 8 all for now and remember 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.760
 that any problem can be solved the main thing 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.760
 know how
