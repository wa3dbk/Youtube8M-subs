00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.350
 hamid and design 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.200
 I am cordial greeting from the 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.439
 miki design team'm the designer 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.910
 giovanni hernÃ¡ndez and this time 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.849
 we come with the third part of the 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.660
 Introduction skies book design and me 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:30.340
 some small tools were missing or 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.529
 a rather employment of some 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.980
 tools that we are already seeing and 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.230
 I did not want to leave it in the air because it's 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.510
 very important that you know and 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.910
 to be able to start developing their 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.760
 sketches in a better way and well the 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.489
 tools that I wanted to teach them 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.309
 was the vector tools we're going to 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.749
 create another layer of vectors so that 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.149
 you can see how you can trace 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:59.699
 some details with this I will use 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:03.030
 of my personal palette of white color and 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.320
 I will use the pen 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.320
 let me do a little 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.869
 the sketch 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.899
 if they realize that I had an error in 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.340
 the software if they come to give their 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.380
 toolbars that have 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.439
 you here can access 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.520
 them in this part of here if they are given 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:30.460
 account here are labeled all the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.939
 floating toolbars that 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.740
 I was hidden was this is the main 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.350
 there you can access it there is no 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.420
 no problem well here what I'm going to 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.220
 to do is change the width of the 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.500
 my line the intensity and I usually 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.550
 I use this kind of tools to 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.850
 mark what they are we can say 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.860
 light contours 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.600
 which will help us have a 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.970
 better better detail in our sketches 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.520
 we leave it there if they occur 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.069
 account is below my drawing me 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.739
 I generally recommend that you be if this 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.980
 to the top of all 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.380
 layers to make it look more 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.810
 clear if you notice and you see much more 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.100
 clear this detail I will reduce a 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:27.430
 little bit the size and I'm going to mount another 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.609
 Unlike surface line here 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.989
 this also depends a lot on the style of 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.750
 pose is with the technique that you 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.769
 you are used to using 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:42.939
 in his sketches it is advisable that yes 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:46.750
 know how to draw freehand on paper and 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:47.769
 pen a pencil so extra so already 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.209
 that will help them a lot 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.130
 empower the tools that 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.530
 have this software 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.960
 and well, another of the great 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.569
 tools that you have and that the version 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.370
 pro 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.900
 if you own and that is one of the 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.609
 tools that are most used in those 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.500
 versions is where we can I do not know 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.590
 color 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.640
 with having some I do not know any trace 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.830
 that we have already done previously but 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.930
 we want to change it color as we are going to 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.470
 I'll do this with the 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:26.340
 crystal remember that the crystal I made 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.000
 in a pixel layer and I do not know then I 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.720
 I want to add that crystal 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.510
 and another color without needing to have 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.310
 masks because sometimes the masks if 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.030
 they are very complex objects or very 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:44.030
 complicated in its forms is difficult 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.240
 be in mask not all then what 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.950
 What we can do is the following 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.960
 and I will show first form 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.150
 a little vulgar for you to 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.930
 understand easily 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:00.150
 I do not know I have or paint some color 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.819
 I do not know with my pen with my down 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.269
 green color as we have it here 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:10.450
 I want to trace in that same layer about 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:13.170
 this same on this same line or this 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:17.880
 same stain that I did but without getting out 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:20.769
 another way of just painting inside this one 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.310
 we can say this form without having to 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.770
 make a mask is down here we have 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.139
 these two icons that represent the 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.990
 modes of which we are drawing 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.240
 coloring and I'm going to select this that 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.990
 has a little candadito a little candadito 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.630
 here and I'm going to change the color orange 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.199
 this is going to allow me to layer in 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.620
 what am I 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:47.590
 I currently block the object that is 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.430
 there and I can only color over him 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.430
 observe 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:56.270
 if you realize I can only color 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:59.300
 on top of this one 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.139
 we can say this in this way of 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.710
 this stain 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:07.050
 is another way to use something like 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.360
 masks or masks but without 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.940
 really have to trace with 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.200
 selection tools 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.330
 this is a very important tool 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.510
 now I'm going to show you I'm going to eliminate 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.620
 this layer and I'm going to show it with the layer 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:27.320
 of the crystal I will use my airbrush 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:29.800
 I will use a color I do not know a 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.680
 rose a purple 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.440
 and I'm going to block as you can see here 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.449
 this icon is selected and when 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.460
 to be coloring I will use this 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:44.110
 trick is here 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.789
 just let me color over the 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.180
 traces that I had previously in 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:50.650
 that layer as you can realize 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.389
 I have selected this icon I return to 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.910
 go back to the other icon and now yes 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:56.259
 I can place anywhere that 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.990
 tool was very important not the 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:00.009
 I wanted to leave it in the air as it exists 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.360
 a tool that they will be 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.360
 using a lot also 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:09.819
 and more than most do not need it 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.919
 because the cycle that was the most important 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:14.979
 what was left in the air but it was 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.930
 fundamental that I did not know and so good 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:19.029
 this video was much shorter than 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.189
 us but I hope that in content 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:23.110
 equally important I say goodbye 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:27.189
 silent to mention that you visit our 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:31.659
 page that is www.dicyt.com or the block 

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:34.659
 is www.unicef.es pot.com or look for them in 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:36.520
 facebook like my kim and saint then I 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:38.939
 I say goodbye and see you in the following 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.939
 tutorial videos
