through our bearing and we use it to

through our bearing and we use it to
knock<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.320> opposing<00:03:43.320> cup<00:03:43.530> out<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.920> other

get this to remove what we'll do is we

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.719 
get this to remove what we'll do is we
would<00:06:46.199> pass<00:06:46.470> it<00:06:46.680> through<00:06:46.889> one<00:06:47.550> of<00:06:47.639> the

make sure that we're nice and level and

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.040 
make sure that we're nice and level and
then<00:06:54.090> we<00:06:54.419> would<00:06:54.539> strike<00:06:54.870> this<00:06:55.080> with<00:06:55.260> a<00:06:55.289> hammer

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050 
then we would strike this with a hammer

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.589
