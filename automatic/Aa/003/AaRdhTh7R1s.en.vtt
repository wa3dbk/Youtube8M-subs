quickscoping<00:02:23.560> was<00:02:23.709> really<00:02:23.920> effective<00:02:24.370> but

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
quickscoping was really effective but

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.640 
quickscoping was really effective but
only<00:02:25.000> if<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.269> knew<00:02:25.750> how<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:25.989> do<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.319> well<00:02:26.470> and

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
only if you knew how to do it well and

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.800 
only if you knew how to do it well and
it<00:02:27.190> was<00:02:27.370> an<00:02:27.519> overpowered<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.239> quite<00:02:28.780> frankly

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
it was an overpowered and quite frankly

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.309 
it was an overpowered and quite frankly
an<00:02:29.230> AK<00:02:29.590> normally<00:02:30.099> beat<00:02:30.310> out<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.489> m40<00:02:31.180> um<00:02:31.959> unless

heads up on the other guy and everybody

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.420 
heads up on the other guy and everybody
liked<00:02:36.879> it<00:02:37.030> was<00:02:37.239> perfect<00:02:38.110> I<00:02:38.230> mean<00:02:38.410> I<00:02:38.590> don't

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
liked it was perfect I mean I don't

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.710 
liked it was perfect I mean I don't
think<00:02:39.549> mother<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.790> two<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.030> overpowered<00:02:40.480> some

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
think mother of two is overpowered some

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.600 
think mother of two is overpowered some
might<00:02:40.870> argue<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.230> was<00:02:41.349> and<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:41.920> would<00:02:42.310> go<00:02:42.459> as<00:02:42.579> far

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
might argue it was and I would go as far

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.699 
might argue it was and I would go as far
as<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.849> say<00:02:43.090> mono<00:02:43.450> 43<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:43.900> kind<00:02:44.079> of<00:02:44.140> too<00:02:44.260> easy<00:02:44.500> to

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
as to say mono 43 is kind of too easy to

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:45.930 
as to say mono 43 is kind of too easy to
quickscope<00:02:45.069> it<00:02:45.250> makes<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.519> kind<00:02:45.670> of<00:02:45.700> boring

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
quickscope it makes it kind of boring

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.970 
quickscope it makes it kind of boring
and<00:02:46.360> it's<00:02:46.959> something<00:02:47.140> that<00:02:47.260> everybody<00:02:47.769> does

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
and it's something that everybody does

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.250 
and it's something that everybody does
you<00:02:48.459> know<00:02:48.579> you<00:02:49.120> have<00:02:49.299> the<00:02:49.329> sweaty<00:02:49.750> nerds<00:02:49.989> at

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
you know you have the sweaty nerds at

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.619 
you know you have the sweaty nerds at
school<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:51.010> know<00:02:51.160> they<00:02:52.030> don't<00:02:52.060> worry<00:02:52.450> about

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
school you know they don't worry about

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.210 
school you know they don't worry about
Katie<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.140> stuff<00:02:53.349> they<00:02:53.470> even<00:02:53.739> they<00:02:53.829> can<00:02:54.040> quick

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
Katie and stuff they even they can quick

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.039 
Katie and stuff they even they can quick
scope<00:02:54.489> so<00:02:54.670> then<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.060> kind<00:02:55.239> of<00:02:55.299> gets<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.959> the

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
scope so then it kind of gets to the

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.900 
scope so then it kind of gets to the
point<00:02:56.170> where<00:02:56.290> it's<00:02:56.440> like<00:02:56.470> all<00:02:56.799> right<00:02:57.040> guys<00:02:57.730> are

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
point where it's like all right guys are

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.990 
point where it's like all right guys are
kind<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.120> getting<00:02:58.299> carried<00:02:58.629> away<00:02:58.780> here<00:02:59.079> but<00:02:59.260> um

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
kind of getting carried away here but um

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.610 
kind of getting carried away here but um
so<00:03:01.000> yeah<00:03:01.120> so<00:03:01.299> everybody<00:03:01.629> thought<00:03:01.750> that<00:03:01.810> cod4

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
so yeah so everybody thought that cod4

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.979 
so yeah so everybody thought that cod4
is<00:03:02.769> going<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.099> be<00:03:03.209> let's<00:03:04.209> go<00:03:04.329> black<00:03:04.660> ops<00:03:04.810> ii<00:03:04.870> was

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
is going to be let's go black ops ii was

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.210 
is going to be let's go black ops ii was
gonna<00:03:05.109> have<00:03:05.230> this<00:03:05.319> like<00:03:05.500> cod4<00:03:05.920> style

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
gonna have this like cod4 style

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.280 
gonna have this like cod4 style
quickscoping<00:03:06.579> words<00:03:06.819> like<00:03:06.940> really<00:03:07.290> effective

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
quickscoping words like really effective

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.729 
quickscoping words like really effective
but<00:03:08.530> it's<00:03:08.980> still<00:03:09.190> balanced<00:03:09.819> I<00:03:09.910> guess<00:03:10.090> but<00:03:10.660> um

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
but it's still balanced I guess but um

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.930 
but it's still balanced I guess but um
there<00:03:11.739> was<00:03:11.829> a<00:03:11.890> leak<00:03:12.099> that<00:03:12.310> recently<00:03:12.640> came<00:03:12.730> out
