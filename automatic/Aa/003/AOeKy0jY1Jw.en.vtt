00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
doing it for damn near free I do have a

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.450 
doing it for damn near free I do have a
product<00:00:16.560> here<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.800> would<00:00:16.949> cost<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.279> some

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
product here that would cost you some

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.980 
product here that would cost you some
money<00:00:17.640> but<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:18.029> don't<00:00:18.300> have<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.660> use<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.960> you

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
money but you don't have to use it you

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.140 
money but you don't have to use it you
could<00:00:19.199> use<00:00:19.320> any<00:00:19.500> pot<00:00:19.800> for<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.189> but<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.730> also

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
could use any pot for this but I also

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.460 
could use any pot for this but I also
figured<00:00:21.390> it'd<00:00:21.630> be<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.720> good<00:00:21.900> time<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.109> show<00:00:22.410> you

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.779 
figured it'd be a good time to show you
about<00:00:22.619> these<00:00:22.800> since<00:00:23.010> I've<00:00:23.130> been<00:00:23.189> talking<00:00:23.369> to

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
about these since I've been talking to

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.890 
about these since I've been talking to
you<00:00:23.970> about<00:00:24.000> them<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.570> air

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
you about them on the air

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.150 
you about them on the air

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
I think if you're going to be starting a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.370 
I think if you're going to be starting a
lot<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.490> trees<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.420> we're<00:00:27.900> going<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.109> be<00:00:28.199> doing

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
lot of trees and we're going to be doing

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.599 
lot of trees and we're going to be doing
that<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:28.650> our<00:00:28.769> own<00:00:28.890> property<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
that for our own property and for the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.669 
that for our own property and for the
property<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.179> others<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.199> consider<00:00:31.590> a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
property of others that you consider a

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.200 
property of others that you consider a
product<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.910> called<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
product like this this is called the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.870 
product like this this is called the
cone<00:00:33.510> painter<00:00:34.050> which<00:00:34.890> I'm<00:00:35.040> sure<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.370> marketing

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
cone painter which I'm sure is marketing

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.700 
cone painter which I'm sure is marketing
speak<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.540> does<00:00:36.899> describe<00:00:37.290> what<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.649> is

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
speak but it does describe what it is

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.250 
speak but it does describe what it is
really<00:00:38.190> well<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.149> cone<00:00:39.390> shaped<00:00:39.780> container

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
really well it's a cone shaped container

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.940 
really well it's a cone shaped container
container<00:00:41.870> you<00:00:42.870> can<00:00:42.960> order<00:00:43.260> these<00:00:43.379> racks<00:00:43.710> they

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
container you can order these racks they

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.410 
container you can order these racks they
come<00:00:44.190> with<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.730> they'll<00:00:44.879> sit<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.210> there

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
come with so that they'll sit in there

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.959 
come with so that they'll sit in there
I'd<00:00:46.230> say<00:00:46.260> these<00:00:46.680> probably<00:00:47.160> get<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.610> know<00:00:47.700> good

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
I'd say these probably get you know good

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.819 
I'd say these probably get you know good
5<00:00:48.210> or<00:00:48.239> 6<00:00:48.570> uses<00:00:48.899> out<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.170> them<00:00:49.289> depending<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.710> how

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
5 or 6 uses out of them depending on how

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.799 
5 or 6 uses out of them depending on how
long<00:00:49.950> your<00:00:50.100> trees<00:00:50.399> stay<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.760> them<00:00:50.879> these<00:00:51.449> racks

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
long your trees stay in them these racks

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.150 
long your trees stay in them these racks
here<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.050> think<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.410> probably<00:00:52.500> last<00:00:52.860> about<00:00:53.010> as

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
here I think is probably last about as

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.819 
here I think is probably last about as
long<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.760> would<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.500> kind<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
long as you would so this is kind of the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.160 
long as you would so this is kind of the
disposable<00:00:56.460> component<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.690> racks<00:00:57.930> I'd

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
disposable component and the racks I'd

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.779 
disposable component and the racks I'd
say<00:00:58.350> are<00:00:58.410> more<00:00:58.649> as<00:00:58.980> long<00:00:59.160> for<00:00:59.219> taking<00:00:59.579> care<00:00:59.760> of

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
say are more as long for taking care of

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.110 
say are more as long for taking care of
the<00:01:00.320> permanent<00:01:01.320> component<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:01.949> system

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
the permanent component of this system

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.670 
the permanent component of this system
what<00:01:03.120> makes<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.539> unique<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.290> when<00:01:04.559> you're

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
what makes it unique is when you're

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.380 
what makes it unique is when you're
growing<00:01:04.860> trees<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.430> want<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> roots<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.090> go

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
growing trees you want the roots to go

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.660 
growing trees you want the roots to go
down<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.020> drive<00:01:07.200> down<00:01:07.439> into<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> soil<00:01:07.979> you

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
down and drive down into the soil you

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.580 
down and drive down into the soil you
want<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.909> little<00:01:09.119> rap<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> little<00:01:09.810> rapping<00:01:10.409> is

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.960 
are little bitty ridges and those ridges
when<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.380> roots<00:01:31.619> start<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.070> circle<00:01:32.400> run<00:01:32.759> into

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
when the roots start to circle run into

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.399 
when the roots start to circle run into
that<00:01:33.060> Ridge<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.570> drives<00:01:33.840> them<00:01:34.049> straight<00:01:34.380> down

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
that Ridge it drives them straight down

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.560 
that Ridge it drives them straight down
so<00:01:34.829> you're<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.159> very<00:01:35.400> deep<00:01:35.729> straight

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
so you're going to be very deep straight

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.710 
so you're going to be very deep straight
downward<00:01:37.200> roots<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.710> your<00:01:37.770> tree<00:01:38.070> seedlings

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
downward roots and your tree seedlings

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.300 
downward roots and your tree seedlings
so<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:39.960> think<00:01:40.380> that's<00:01:40.560> going<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.890> work<00:01:41.040> really

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
so we think that's going to work really

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.460 
so we think that's going to work really
well<00:01:41.430> what<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.540> tell<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> reviews

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
well what I can tell you is the reviews

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.560 
well what I can tell you is the reviews
I've<00:01:43.649> read<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.250> looked<00:01:44.880> at<00:01:45.030> online<00:01:45.390> are

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
I've read and looked at online are

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.940 
I've read and looked at online are
really<00:01:45.840> good<00:01:45.990> for<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.290> product<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.860> it

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
really good for this product and it

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.410 
really good for this product and it
seems<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.280> me<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.399> it'll<00:01:47.790> work<00:01:47.970> we<00:01:48.119> haven't

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
seems to me like it'll work we haven't

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.350 
seems to me like it'll work we haven't
grown<00:01:48.570> enough<00:01:48.899> yet<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.229> find<00:01:49.439> out<00:01:49.619> if<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.860> will

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
grown enough yet to find out if it will

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.420 
grown enough yet to find out if it will
but<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.540> that's<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.899> container<00:01:52.350> right<00:01:53.189> here

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
but so that's the container right here

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.200 
but so that's the container right here
I've<00:01:53.549> got<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.790> rack<00:01:54.659> laid<00:01:54.979> loaded<00:01:55.979> up<00:01:56.210> these

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
I've got a rack laid loaded up these

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.510 
I've got a rack laid loaded up these
three<00:01:57.540> rows<00:01:57.750> here<00:01:57.990> are<00:01:58.170> pearl<00:01:58.380> acacia<00:01:58.770> which

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
three rows here are pearl acacia which

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.160 
three rows here are pearl acacia which
is<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> really<00:01:59.969> edgy<00:02:00.450> thing<00:02:00.659> we<00:02:00.840> don't<00:02:00.930> know<00:02:01.079> if

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
is a really edgy thing we don't know if

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.139 
is a really edgy thing we don't know if
these<00:02:01.259> are<00:02:01.320> going<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.590> make<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.009> here<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.090> our

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
these are going to make it here in our

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
climate they haven't started to

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.530 
climate they haven't started to
germinate<00:02:05.610> yet<00:02:05.820> they've<00:02:05.969> been<00:02:06.119> in<00:02:06.240> here<00:02:06.270> about

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
germinate yet they've been in here about

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.839 
germinate yet they've been in here about
two<00:02:06.750> weeks<00:02:06.990> but<00:02:07.680> there<00:02:07.920> are<00:02:08.069> really<00:02:08.220> hard<00:02:08.610> to

two weeks but there are really hard to

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.940 
two weeks but there are really hard to
germinate<00:02:09.270> leguminous<00:02:09.750> seed<00:02:10.110> use<00:02:10.709> what's

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
germinate leguminous seed use what's

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.470 
germinate leguminous seed use what's
called<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.250> hot<00:02:11.400> water<00:02:11.670> trick<00:02:12.030> on<00:02:12.239> them<00:02:12.330> which

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
called a hot water trick on them which

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.880 
called a hot water trick on them which
means<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.780> boil<00:02:13.140> water

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
means you boil water

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.430 
means you boil water
you<00:02:13.980> put<00:02:14.130> them<00:02:14.250> into<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.520> jar<00:02:14.940> like<00:02:15.660> this<00:02:15.720> and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
you put them into a jar like this and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.320 
you put them into a jar like this and
then<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:16.980> dump<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.490> water<00:02:17.640> once<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.120> stops

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
then you dump the water once it stops

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.699 
then you dump the water once it stops
boiling<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:19.020> take<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.319> off<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.560> heat

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
boiling and you take it off the heat

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.559 
boiling and you take it off the heat
over<00:02:20.069> top<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.520> them<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.790> let<00:02:21.240> them<00:02:21.330> sit

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
over top of them and let them sit

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.510 
over top of them and let them sit
overnight<00:02:21.600> we've<00:02:22.590> done<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.100> with<00:02:23.310> black

apples<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.410> they<00:03:05.010> were<00:03:05.100> just<00:03:05.220> picking<00:03:05.430> up

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
apples and they were just picking up

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.970 
apples and they were just picking up
apple<00:03:06.060> cores<00:03:06.300> off<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.780> roads<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.470> starting

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
apple cores off the roads and starting

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.310 
apple cores off the roads and starting
the<00:03:08.100> seeds<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.600> I<00:03:09.630> learned<00:03:09.870> how<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.110> do

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
the seeds and so I learned how to do

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.960 
the seeds and so I learned how to do
that<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.590> what<00:03:10.680> he<00:03:10.739> said<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.100> every<00:03:11.489> tree<00:03:11.760> they

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
that and what he said is every tree they

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.390 
that and what he said is every tree they
grew<00:03:12.239> produced<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.780> good<00:03:12.930> apple<00:03:13.410> now<00:03:13.890> these<00:03:14.220> are

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
grew produced a good apple now these are

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.430 
grew produced a good apple now these are
Fuji<00:03:14.880> apple<00:03:15.239> seeds<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.750> have<00:03:15.930> no<00:03:16.140> belief

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
Fuji apple seeds and I have no belief

Fuji apple seeds and I have no belief
that<00:03:16.830> I'm<00:03:16.920> gonna<00:03:17.010> get<00:03:17.160> Fuji<00:03:17.700> apples<00:03:18.239> I'll<00:03:18.720> get

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
that I'm gonna get Fuji apples I'll get

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.350 
that I'm gonna get Fuji apples I'll get
some<00:03:19.230> kind<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.530> Fuji<00:03:20.070> like<00:03:20.340> unique<00:03:20.760> Apple<00:03:21.239> to

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
some kind of Fuji like unique Apple to

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.720 
some kind of Fuji like unique Apple to
my<00:03:21.510> climate<00:03:22.079> and<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.620> these<00:03:22.769> particular<00:03:23.130> seeds

know<00:05:19.650> to<00:05:19.860> do<00:05:20.040> that<00:05:20.070> just<00:05:20.970> to<00:05:21.150> reach<00:05:21.330> in<00:05:21.750> and

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
know to do that just to reach in and

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.220 
know to do that just to reach in and
take<00:05:23.190> some<00:05:23.220> of<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:23.580> dirt<00:05:24.020> out<00:05:25.020> of<00:05:25.170> the

way and have a little pile of dirt by
your<00:05:44.850> side<00:05:45.090> and<00:05:45.560> then<00:05:46.560> we'll<00:05:46.680> just<00:05:46.830> water<00:05:47.070> that

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
your side and then we'll just water that

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.370 
your side and then we'll just water that
in<00:05:47.580> and<00:05:47.820> hopefully<00:05:48.300> we'll<00:05:48.510> end<00:05:48.720> up<00:05:48.840> with<00:05:49.020> apple

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
in and hopefully we'll end up with apple

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.180 
in and hopefully we'll end up with apple
trees<00:05:49.620> again<00:05:50.040> I'm<00:05:50.670> not<00:05:50.910> expecting<00:05:51.630> to<00:05:51.750> get

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
trees again I'm not expecting to get

top-quality Fuji apples what I'm

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.720 
top-quality Fuji apples what I'm
actually<00:05:55.470> trying<00:05:55.830> to<00:05:55.980> get<00:05:56.160> is<00:05:56.310> something<00:05:56.520> a

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
actually trying to get is something a

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.030 
actually trying to get is something a
lot<00:05:56.940> harder<00:05:57.330> and<00:05:57.810> a<00:05:57.840> lot<00:05:58.050> more<00:05:58.080> adapted<00:05:58.860> to<00:05:58.890> my

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
lot harder and a lot more adapted to my

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.490 
lot harder and a lot more adapted to my
climate<00:05:59.490> over<00:05:59.730> time<00:05:59.940> as<00:06:00.150> we<00:06:00.270> do<00:06:00.480> this<00:06:00.690> but

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
climate over time as we do this but

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.050 
climate over time as we do this but
don't<00:06:01.710> be<00:06:01.830> afraid<00:06:02.100> to<00:06:02.220> give<00:06:02.340> this<00:06:02.490> a<00:06:02.640> try<00:06:02.790> it's

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
don't be afraid to give this a try it's

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.490 
don't be afraid to give this a try it's
a<00:06:03.090> really<00:06:03.330> simple<00:06:03.540> thing<00:06:03.750> your<00:06:04.080> kids<00:06:04.320> will

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
a really simple thing your kids will

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.560 
a really simple thing your kids will
like<00:06:04.680> it<00:06:04.950> and<00:06:05.400> consider<00:06:05.850> these<00:06:06.090> were<00:06:06.270> just<00:06:06.480> a

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
like it and consider these were just a

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.240 
like it and consider these were just a
couple<00:06:06.780> happens<00:06:07.410> from<00:06:07.590> the<00:06:07.710> grocery<00:06:08.160> store

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
couple happens from the grocery store

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.420 
couple happens from the grocery store
that<00:06:08.730> we<00:06:09.360> did<00:06:09.570> this<00:06:09.720> with<00:06:09.960> and<00:06:10.200> we<00:06:10.290> got<00:06:10.470> a<00:06:10.500> 95

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
that we did this with and we got a 95

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.370 
that we did this with and we got a 95
percent<00:06:11.460> germination<00:06:12.180> rate<00:06:12.900> using<00:06:13.080> this

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
percent germination rate using this

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.220 
percent germination rate using this
technique<00:06:14.600> start<00:06:15.600> thinking<00:06:15.870> about<00:06:15.960> like

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.230 
technique start thinking about like

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.170 
technique start thinking about like
places<00:06:16.620> you<00:06:16.740> know<00:06:16.980> that<00:06:17.340> you<00:06:17.640> have<00:06:17.850> local

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
places you know that you have local

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.030 
places you know that you have local
apples<00:06:18.780> already<00:06:19.200> that<00:06:19.410> you<00:06:19.500> could<00:06:19.650> get<00:06:19.830> some

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
apples already that you could get some

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.010 
apples already that you could get some
of<00:06:20.130> their<00:06:20.250> apples<00:06:20.670> from<00:06:20.910> them<00:06:21.120> and<00:06:21.330> give<00:06:21.840> this

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
of their apples from them and give this

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.770 
of their apples from them and give this
a<00:06:22.080> shot<00:06:22.670> apples<00:06:23.670> are<00:06:23.790> a<00:06:23.850> great<00:06:24.120> fruit<00:06:24.420> to<00:06:24.600> grow

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
a shot apples are a great fruit to grow

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.800 
a shot apples are a great fruit to grow
throughout<00:06:25.080> most<00:06:25.320> of<00:06:25.440> the<00:06:25.530> United<00:06:25.620> States<00:06:25.920> and

while you're at it consider giving the
