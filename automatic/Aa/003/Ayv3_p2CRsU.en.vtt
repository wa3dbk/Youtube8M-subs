00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.129 
is a different approach you a clown acts
same<00:00:11.280> game<00:00:11.490> but<00:00:11.670> they<00:00:12.120> were<00:00:12.180> like<00:00:12.510> they<00:00:12.930> are

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
same game but they were like they are

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.429 
same game but they were like they are
great<00:00:13.469> clams<00:00:13.770> and<00:00:14.400> they<00:00:14.670> like<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.540> say<00:00:15.719> there

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:16.439 
great clams and they like you say there

great clams and they like you say there
is<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> big<00:00:16.860> shoot<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.310> feel<00:00:17.550> but<00:00:18.450> I<00:00:18.480> think<00:00:18.840> we

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
is a big shoot to feel but I think we

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.790 
is a big shoot to feel but I think we
are<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.680> different<00:00:20.250> rhythm<00:00:20.720> if<00:00:21.720> they<00:00:21.960> they<00:00:22.590> were

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
are a different rhythm if they they were

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.979 
are a different rhythm if they they were
music<00:00:23.310> they<00:00:23.460> were<00:00:23.610> more<00:00:23.910> similar<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.570> jazz<00:00:24.960> and

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:24.989 
music they were more similar to jazz and

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:31.339 
music they were more similar to jazz and
we<00:00:25.710> are<00:00:25.770> more<00:00:25.980> similar<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:29.300> that<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.599> we<00:00:30.840> are<00:00:31.110> at

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
we are more similar to that so we are at

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.440 
we are more similar to that so we are at
least<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.860> go<00:00:32.009> faster<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.790> different<00:00:33.000> if<00:00:33.300> a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
least we go faster is it different if a

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.650 
least we go faster is it different if a
different<00:00:33.920> rhythm<00:00:34.920> yeah<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.059> music<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.570> I
