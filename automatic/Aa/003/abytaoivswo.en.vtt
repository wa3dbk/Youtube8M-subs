00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:02.760
 Hi everyone 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.770
 nooo 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.770
 how to get the title this basic tutorial 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.769
 regarding 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:10.839
 modeling 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:13.860
 venha a little and are the basic tools used to shape 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.329
 the key thing is to remove the pieces 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.369
 from and from the frame 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.999
 then clippers 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.439
 I use clippers 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.689
 angella sitael 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.539
 rapallo handle larger than those of the family ande 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.220
 most comfortable telecom 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.740
 naples last torre pedrera celebrating the xbox penis 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.810
 percing 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.440
 year modeling cine trout 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.170
 it was a 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.170
 greater precision was prepared at the hardware store 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.750
 at least I have never tried them 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.630
 so precise in hardware 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.660
 so very important time is precise 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.800
 because otherwise you risk the worst pieces when you remove 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.370
 then 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.970
 I always advise you to buy 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.090
 of specific material for modeling 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.310
 then 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.050
 buy your sitarello high miles or some other brand 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.050
 however specific for modeling 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.940
 other fundamental thing 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.810
 seen d 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.900
 cont make sure 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.440
 the metal core 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.880
 this because over time when you want to do by force 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.790
 when you cut 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.790
 all this part here inside 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.420
 is subjected to stress 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.770
 furthermore it can be broken very easily 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.260
 I lost my mother 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.450
 if it is not made of metal 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.590
 breaks 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.630
 prevention because it is on the market 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.630
 there are economic sects like these 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.340
 with many women 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.850
 but of the pegs 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.539
 which have a plastic core 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.649
 I had a dinner 3 left because I cooked the other two 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.379
 just for that triad problem 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.769
 now I have a penalty payment 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.119
 then 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:25.119
 as said scalpel cutter 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:26.969
 so 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.159
 other thing thong 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.619
 very convenient to find in haberdashery 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.019
 nail file 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.889
 on the one hand there is a part more 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.169
 we say it is harder Mediterranean 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.639
 on the other side 1 thinner part 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.639
 given the shape it also arrives in the parts 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.299
 more inaccessible 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.519
 always for filing abrasive paper 

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:59.239
 date 120 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.299
 400 share also good 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.299
 other 1000 grit paper 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.099
 it costs much finer 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.280
 for the finishes 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.139
 final then 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.139
 regarding the detail 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:19.169
 gianna market. 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.599
 ganda mu model maker 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.599
 cannot not have the anna marchetti 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.079
 then these black 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.049
 poinx - also another gray 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.719
 because I wanted to try making palm trees gray hares 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:37.249
 then I realized 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:40.249
 that there is not much difference between this asked 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:42.669
 I discovered though 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:46.759
 even if you really want to keep carige panels 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.689
 you can use 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.979
 the pencil 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:55.569
 however used on you want very thin panels 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.639
 a mechanical pencil one evening, 5 to thin a lot is drawn 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.259
 soap 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:06.809
 from. bricoman you 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:09.809
 on a 1000 abrasive paper 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.799
 eh thin you 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.899
 the trait so 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:18.039
 you will lose a very very fine stretch 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.680
 this is fine even if you want 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.569
 horror give Italy one of the points 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:26.569
 cream can be defined I try some panels 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:29.300
 ie kent don't have 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.620
 two sides but only one 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.939
 to fuck you rude 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:36.889
 they are not points 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.419
 how this is here 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.419
 but like this for example 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.699
 ok 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.750
 eh ok I would say regarding the hill instead 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.300
 I recommend the up family glue 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:00.679
 is this necklace with or designed specifically for plastic 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:06.530
 practically this fondant glue lilly pieces of plastic troll between them 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:13.649
 it's a good glue if you really want to remove the seam lines between the 

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:14.930
 prices 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.930
 to remove that ugly aesthetic effect 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.699
 obviously if you want to do it 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.639
 anything 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.499
 it is assumed that you want to calculate price schedules 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:30.150
 then 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.930
 app abound with glue 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.539
 top 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.889
 then sand down the access the glue you have been hardened 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.099
 and then 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:44.210
 hard colored from above 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.849
 of the council 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.930
 the glue of the android up 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.400
 why at least 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.830
 all that in all and there the bottles I bought the handball 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.699
 they lost the brush 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:57.479
 the first is the trend 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.479
 to break away 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:04.259
 with thanks for your attention 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.220
 in the case restaurants there will need to do just as real 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.779
 I will do it 

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:11.589
 to the next
