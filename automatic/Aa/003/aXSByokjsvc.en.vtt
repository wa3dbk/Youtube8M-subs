00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:01.319 
show you guys a little bit of what I

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.039 
show you guys a little bit of what I
look<00:00:01.770> for<00:00:01.829> when<00:00:02.040> I<00:00:02.190> when<00:00:02.879> I<00:00:02.909> make<00:00:03.179> my<00:00:03.210> taps<00:00:03.659> into

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
look for when I when I make my taps into

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.099 
look for when I when I make my taps into
the<00:00:04.350> tree<00:00:04.650> I'll<00:00:05.310> go<00:00:05.520> ahead<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:05.819> try<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:06.690> find

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
the tree I'll go ahead and try and find

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.379 
the tree I'll go ahead and try and find
a<00:00:07.350> you<00:00:08.010> know<00:00:08.099> an<00:00:08.250> area<00:00:08.519> where<00:00:08.730> there's<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.179> big

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
a you know an area where there's a big

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.860 
a you know an area where there's a big
root<00:00:09.660> or<00:00:10.170> something<00:00:10.469> that's<00:00:11.809> coming<00:00:12.809> up

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
root or something that's coming up

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.140 
root or something that's coming up
through<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.200> tree<00:00:13.500> when<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.519> usually

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
through the tree when it usually

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.480 
through the tree when it usually
coincides<00:00:15.630> with<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:16.199> big<00:00:16.470> limb<00:00:16.740> on<00:00:16.949> top<00:00:17.190> and

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
coincides with a big limb on top and

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.609 
coincides with a big limb on top and
that's<00:00:17.640> where<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.880> lot<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.090> your<00:00:18.359> your<00:00:19.260> saps

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
that's where a lot of your your saps

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.859 
that's where a lot of your your saps
going<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.010> be<00:00:20.100> running<00:00:20.460> up<00:00:20.609> on<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.300> side<00:00:21.600> so

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
going to be running up on that side so

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.810 
going to be running up on that side so
if<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.080> could<00:00:22.230> try<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.529> get<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.010> maybe

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
if you could try and get to that maybe

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.900 
if you could try and get to that maybe
the<00:00:23.970> south<00:00:24.210> side<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.930> or<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.789> know

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
the south side of it or to the you know

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.339 
the south side of it or to the you know
wherever<00:00:27.119> there's<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.539> big<00:00:27.570> root<00:00:27.930> like<00:00:28.170> that

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
wherever there's a big root like that

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.150 
wherever there's a big root like that
you'll<00:00:28.529> get<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.740> majority<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.340> lot<00:00:29.670> more<00:00:29.849> SAP<00:00:30.179> out

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
you'll get a majority a lot more SAP out

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.200 
you'll get a majority a lot more SAP out
you<00:00:32.160> see<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.460> temperatures<00:00:32.880> starting<00:00:33.120> to

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
you see that temperatures starting to

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.880 
you see that temperatures starting to
warm<00:00:33.390> up<00:00:33.540> already<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.960> morning<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.590> and

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
warm up already this morning in it and

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.869 
warm up already this morning in it and
it's<00:00:35.309> apsa<00:00:35.730> starting<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> run<00:00:36.630> pretty<00:00:36.809> good<00:00:37.079> so

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
it's apsa starting to run pretty good so

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.160 
it's apsa starting to run pretty good so

good warm day like today should get a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.000 
good warm day like today should get a
lot<00:00:40.350> side<00:00:41.870> you<00:00:42.870> got<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.140> SAP<00:00:43.379> all<00:00:43.590> click<00:00:43.860> to

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
lot side you got the SAP all click to

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.389 
lot side you got the SAP all click to
the<00:00:44.070> next<00:00:44.129> step<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.820> boil<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.480> down<00:00:45.890> so<00:00:46.890> I

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
the next step is to boil it down so I

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.819 
the next step is to boil it down so I
want<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.390> show<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.809> little<00:00:49.230> bit<00:00:49.320> about<00:00:49.620> my

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
want to show you a little bit about my

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.760 
want to show you a little bit about my
setup<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.399> don't<00:00:50.610> take<00:00:50.789> much<00:00:50.820> nothing<00:00:51.600> fancy<00:00:51.780> I

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
setup it don't take much nothing fancy I

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.799 
setup it don't take much nothing fancy I
would<00:00:53.370> recommend<00:00:53.520> doing<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.090> outside<00:00:54.270> because

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
would recommend doing it outside because

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.569 
would recommend doing it outside because
it<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.289> got<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.530> do<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> lot<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.860> boiling<00:00:56.399> then

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
it you got to do a lot of boiling then

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.790 
it you got to do a lot of boiling then
puts<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.910> lot<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.059> moisture<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.410> air<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.710> it

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
puts a lot of moisture in the air and it

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.319 
puts a lot of moisture in the air and it
could<00:00:58.980> make<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.219> cabinets<00:00:59.789> and<00:00:59.940> stuff<00:01:00.149> kind

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
could make the cabinets and stuff kind

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.720 
could make the cabinets and stuff kind
of<00:01:00.500> sticky<00:01:01.500> with<00:01:01.649> all<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> syrup<00:01:02.129> or<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.640> all

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
of sticky with all the syrup or to all

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.640 
of sticky with all the syrup or to all
the<00:01:02.879> sugar<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.110> would<00:01:04.619> recommend

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the sugar in it so I would recommend

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.250 
the sugar in it so I would recommend
doing<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.369> outside<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.210> build<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.900> like<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
doing it outside you can build it like a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.130 
doing it outside you can build it like a
regular<00:01:07.530> fire<00:01:07.950> with<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> kettle<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.930> got

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
regular fire with a kettle like I got

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.649 
regular fire with a kettle like I got
here<00:01:10.530> or<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:11.040> make<00:01:11.280> something<00:01:11.670> up<00:01:12.270> your

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
here or you can make something up your

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.410 
here or you can make something up your
backyard<00:01:13.200> just<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:14.250> know<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.490> your<00:01:14.670> own<00:01:14.790> it

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
backyard just you know on your own it

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.700 
backyard just you know on your own it
don't<00:01:15.600> like<00:01:15.810> says<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.350> matter<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.650> getting

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
don't like says just a matter of getting

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.149 
don't like says just a matter of getting
the<00:01:16.950> fire<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:18.290> be<00:01:19.290> mindful<00:01:19.530> whatever<00:01:20.009> you

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
the fire in it be mindful whatever you

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.609 
the fire in it be mindful whatever you
use<00:01:20.369> if<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.700> use<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.390> different<00:01:22.350> types<00:01:22.500> of

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
use if you use like different types of

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.920 
use if you use like different types of
fuel<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.040> takes<00:01:23.250> quite<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.549> bit<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.790> boiling<00:01:24.299> to

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
fuel it takes quite a bit of boiling to

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.780 
fuel it takes quite a bit of boiling to
to<00:01:25.409> boil<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.770> down<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.340> you're<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.729> be

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
to boil it down so you're going to be

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.719 
to boil it down so you're going to be
going<00:01:26.909> through<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.240> lot<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.950> fuel<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.490> so

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
going through a lot of a fuel for it so

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.090 
going through a lot of a fuel for it so
I<00:01:29.759> would<00:01:30.060> recommend<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.900> fire<00:01:31.500> where<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.950> can

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
I would recommend a fire where you can

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.460 
I would recommend a fire where you can
get<00:01:32.490> some<00:01:32.700> firewood<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.049> do<00:01:34.380> it

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
get some firewood and just and do it

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.999 
get some firewood and just and do it
with<00:01:34.560> wood<00:01:34.939> it<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.299> lot<00:01:36.780> cheaper<00:01:37.229> than<00:01:37.259> buying

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
with wood it a lot cheaper than buying

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.080 
with wood it a lot cheaper than buying
LP<00:01:38.460> gas<00:01:38.729> or<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.689> something<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.530> so

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
LP gas or like something like that so

anything<00:03:41.479> that<00:03:41.629> got<00:03:41.780> in<00:03:41.840> with<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.680> kill<00:03:42.949> with

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
anything that got in with the kill with

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.280 
anything that got in with the kill with
when<00:03:43.609> i<00:03:43.639> was<00:03:43.819> cooking<00:03:44.209> it<00:03:44.359> a<00:03:44.479> lot<00:03:45.019> of<00:03:45.079> times

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
when i was cooking it a lot of times

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.189 
when i was cooking it a lot of times
I'll<00:03:45.530> uh<00:03:45.940> I'll<00:03:46.940> strain<00:03:47.389> it<00:03:47.569> if<00:03:47.690> I<00:03:47.810> got<00:03:47.989> a<00:03:48.019> lot<00:03:48.169> of

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:48.199 
I'll uh I'll strain it if I got a lot of

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.289 
I'll uh I'll strain it if I got a lot of
stuff<00:03:48.470> in<00:03:48.650> it<00:03:48.799> when<00:03:49.010> i<00:03:49.040> first<00:03:49.639> get<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.150> out<00:03:50.269> of

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
stuff in it when i first get it out of

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.849 
stuff in it when i first get it out of
the<00:03:50.419> buckets<00:03:50.810> there<00:03:51.019> before<00:03:51.349> i<00:03:51.379> put<00:03:51.560> it<00:03:51.650> in<00:03:51.769> the

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
the buckets there before i put it in the

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.580 
the buckets there before i put it in the
kettle<00:03:52.209> but<00:03:53.209> this<00:03:53.780> morning<00:03:54.049> i<00:03:54.229> didn't<00:03:54.440> have<00:03:54.560> a

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
kettle but this morning i didn't have a

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.649 
kettle but this morning i didn't have a
whole<00:03:54.739> lot<00:03:54.769> of<00:03:54.979> stuff<00:03:55.159> in<00:03:55.419> like<00:03:56.419> i<00:03:56.479> said

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
whole lot of stuff in like i said

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.360 
whole lot of stuff in like i said
earlier<00:03:56.810> when<00:03:57.139> it<00:03:57.229> warms<00:03:57.439> up<00:03:57.680> you'll<00:03:57.949> get<00:03:58.069> bugs

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
earlier when it warms up you'll get bugs

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.599 
earlier when it warms up you'll get bugs
and<00:03:58.849> all<00:03:59.329> kinds<00:03:59.659> of<00:03:59.689> stuff<00:03:59.750> like<00:04:00.079> that<00:04:00.109> in<00:04:00.409> and

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
and all kinds of stuff like that in and

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.099 
and all kinds of stuff like that in and
maybe<00:04:01.609> bar<00:04:01.939> gets<00:04:02.239> knocked<00:04:02.419> down<00:04:02.599> from

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
maybe bar gets knocked down from

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.089 
maybe bar gets knocked down from
different<00:04:04.099> things<00:04:04.310> so<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:05.859> strained<00:04:06.859> all<00:04:06.949> that

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
different things so I strained all that

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:12.689 
different things so I strained all that
before<00:04:07.250> cook<00:04:07.669> it<00:04:07.849> so<00:04:10.509> okay<00:04:11.509> now<00:04:11.750> you<00:04:11.810> get<00:04:12.079> with

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:12.699 
before cook it so okay now you get with

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.439 
before cook it so okay now you get with
just<00:04:13.699> regular<00:04:13.849> starting<00:04:14.540> to<00:04:14.629> look<00:04:14.720> like<00:04:14.900> syrup

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
just regular starting to look like syrup

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.599 
just regular starting to look like syrup
okay<00:04:17.449> now<00:04:17.630> how<00:04:17.900> do<00:04:17.959> I<00:04:18.049> know<00:04:18.109> how<00:04:18.470> for<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:19.130> boil

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
okay now how do I know how for the boil

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.659 
okay now how do I know how for the boil
it<00:04:19.759> down<00:04:19.789> to<00:04:20.409> well<00:04:21.409> the<00:04:22.039> boiling<00:04:22.430> temperature

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
it down to well the boiling temperature

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:23.680 
it down to well the boiling temperature
of

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
of

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.670 
of
water<00:04:23.840> is<00:04:24.170> 212<00:04:25.010> degrees<00:04:25.300> so<00:04:26.300> as<00:04:26.450> a<00:04:26.680> sugar

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
water is 212 degrees so as a sugar

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.880 
water is 212 degrees so as a sugar
content<00:04:28.210> increases<00:04:29.210> in<00:04:30.140> here<00:04:30.530> because<00:04:30.680> you're

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
content increases in here because you're

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.760 
content increases in here because you're
boiling<00:04:31.040> away<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.520> water<00:04:31.730> so<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.210> sugar

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
boiling away the water so the sugar

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.920 
boiling away the water so the sugar
content<00:04:33.770> increases<00:04:34.510> the<00:04:35.510> boiling<00:04:36.380> point

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
content increases the boiling point

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.600 
content increases the boiling point
rises<00:04:38.930> so<00:04:39.860> I<00:04:40.840> kind<00:04:41.840> of<00:04:41.930> if<00:04:42.140> they<00:04:42.710> say<00:04:42.950> if<00:04:43.280> you

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
rises so I kind of if they say if you

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.650 
rises so I kind of if they say if you
get<00:04:43.910> seven<00:04:44.540> degrees<00:04:44.870> above<00:04:46.270> boiling<00:04:47.270> point

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
get seven degrees above boiling point

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.520 
get seven degrees above boiling point
with<00:04:47.810> 212<00:04:48.470> so<00:04:48.890> that<00:04:49.040> would<00:04:49.160> be<00:04:49.510> to<00:04:50.510> 19<00:04:50.930> to<00:04:51.140> 20

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
with 212 so that would be to 19 to 20

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.670 
with 212 so that would be to 19 to 20
it's<00:04:52.130> done<00:04:52.460> so<00:04:53.330> that's<00:04:53.930> usually<00:04:54.110> what<00:04:54.410> I<00:04:54.440> do<00:04:54.560> I

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
it's done so that's usually what I do I

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.020 
it's done so that's usually what I do I
got<00:04:54.980> a<00:04:55.060> candy<00:04:56.060> thermometer<00:04:56.240> and<00:04:57.730> I'll<00:04:58.730> just

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
got a candy thermometer and I'll just

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.520 
got a candy thermometer and I'll just
stick<00:04:59.270> it<00:04:59.450> in<00:04:59.600> there<00:04:59.840> and<00:05:00.080> watch<00:05:00.380> the

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
stick it in there and watch the

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.380 
stick it in there and watch the
temperature<00:05:00.980> once<00:05:01.550> it<00:05:01.700> gets<00:05:01.850> the<00:05:01.970> bullying<00:05:02.300> it

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
temperature once it gets the bullying it

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.880 
temperature once it gets the bullying it
takes<00:05:02.570> a<00:05:02.690> while<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.960> get<00:05:03.110> to<00:05:03.170> the<00:05:03.650> boiling

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
takes a while to get to the boiling

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.160 
takes a while to get to the boiling
again<00:05:04.160> and<00:05:04.640> then<00:05:05.120> that<00:05:05.300> temperature<00:05:05.540> once<00:05:05.990> it

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
again and then that temperature once it

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.200 
again and then that temperature once it
reaches<00:05:07.480> 220<00:05:09.010> that's<00:05:10.010> when<00:05:10.220> I<00:05:10.250> know<00:05:10.400> if<00:05:10.670> it's

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
reaches 220 that's when I know if it's

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.790 
reaches 220 that's when I know if it's
good<00:05:11.510> enough<00:05:11.540> for<00:05:11.690> syrup<00:05:12.200> so<00:05:12.410> that's<00:05:12.590> when<00:05:12.770> I

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
good enough for syrup so that's when I

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.170 
good enough for syrup so that's when I
that's<00:05:13.160> when<00:05:13.370> I<00:05:13.400> usually<00:05:13.460> shut<00:05:13.940> everything

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
that's when I usually shut everything

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.010 
that's when I usually shut everything
down<00:05:14.380> calling<00:05:15.380> good<00:05:16.540> okay<00:05:17.540> well<00:05:17.690> I'm<00:05:17.780> putting

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
down calling good okay well I'm putting

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.100 
down calling good okay well I'm putting
the<00:05:18.080> final<00:05:18.230> touches<00:05:18.380> to<00:05:18.710> that<00:05:19.280> batch<00:05:19.520> of<00:05:19.700> syrup

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
the final touches to that batch of syrup

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.020 
the final touches to that batch of syrup
here's<00:05:21.110> what<00:05:21.320> I<00:05:21.350> cooked<00:05:21.650> down<00:05:22.180> yesterday<00:05:23.260> so

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
here's what I cooked down yesterday so

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.510 
here's what I cooked down yesterday so
that's<00:05:26.030> the<00:05:26.180> end<00:05:26.600> result<00:05:26.980> actually<00:05:27.980> got<00:05:28.280> about

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
that's the end result actually got about

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.900 
that's the end result actually got about
a<00:05:28.790> pint<00:05:29.180> and<00:05:29.300> a<00:05:29.419> half<00:05:29.630> of<00:05:29.870> syrup<00:05:30.260> off<00:05:30.890> of<00:05:31.340> almost

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
a pint and a half of syrup off of almost

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.710 
a pint and a half of syrup off of almost
about<00:05:32.210> eight<00:05:32.390> gallons<00:05:32.660> of<00:05:33.080> sap<00:05:34.120> so<00:05:35.120> that's<00:05:35.570> how

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
about eight gallons of sap so that's how

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.409 
about eight gallons of sap so that's how
much<00:05:35.930> boiling<00:05:36.770> yet<00:05:36.919> I<00:05:37.100> do<00:05:37.310> what<00:05:38.060> you<00:05:38.150> do<00:05:38.270> with

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
much boiling yet I do what you do with

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.690 
much boiling yet I do what you do with
it<00:05:38.480> now<00:05:38.630> I<00:05:38.660> can<00:05:39.020> actually<00:05:39.290> just<00:05:39.680> put<00:05:39.740> a<00:05:39.890> plastic

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
it now I can actually just put a plastic

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.520 
it now I can actually just put a plastic
lid<00:05:40.910> on<00:05:41.090> and<00:05:41.270> keep<00:05:41.810> this<00:05:42.020> in<00:05:42.230> the<00:05:42.290> frigerator

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
lid on and keep this in the frigerator

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.750 
lid on and keep this in the frigerator
for<00:05:43.070> several<00:05:43.790> months<00:05:43.970> probably<00:05:44.450> or<00:05:45.760> while

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
for several months probably or while

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.540 
for several months probably or while
it's<00:05:46.970> still<00:05:47.210> hot<00:05:47.270> I<00:05:47.870> can<00:05:48.710> get<00:05:48.890> some<00:05:49.130> jars

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
it's still hot I can get some jars

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.250
