00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
it's a girl I'm sorry I assume

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.039 
it's a girl I'm sorry I assume
incorrectly<00:01:42.320> she<00:01:43.320> he<00:01:43.799> has<00:01:44.659> suggested<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.990> I

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
call them easy several times so i guess

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.530 
call them easy several times so i guess
i<00:01:50.070> should<00:01:50.280> start<00:01:50.490> saying<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.030> welcome<00:01:51.479> to
