different Morty you get X hyphen mode

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.750 
different Morty you get X hyphen mode
which<00:00:35.480> is<00:00:35.660> likely<00:00:35.960> it's<00:00:36.740> the<00:00:36.920> new<00:00:37.310> one<00:00:37.550> it's

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
which is likely it's the new one it's

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.390 
which is likely it's the new one it's
like<00:00:37.850> a<00:00:38.240> rebalance<00:00:39.170> mode<00:00:39.470> of<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:39.740> arcade<00:00:40.160> mode

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.180 
like a rebalance mode of the arcade mode
then<00:00:40.940> X<00:00:41.180> mod<00:00:41.450> is<00:00:41.660> just<00:00:41.900> the<00:00:41.990> arcade<00:00:42.350> mode<00:00:42.590> why

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
then X mod is just the arcade mode why

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.580 
then X mod is just the arcade mode why
mode<00:00:43.490> is<00:00:43.730> match<00:00:43.970> three<00:00:44.270> roles<00:00:44.510> and<00:00:44.870> zeg<00:00:45.110> mod<00:00:45.350> is

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
mode is match three roles and zeg mod is

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.850

blocks<00:01:34.100> falling<00:01:34.400> down<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:35.000> you've<00:01:35.120> gotta

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
blocks falling down and you've gotta

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.390 
blocks falling down and you've gotta
delete<00:01:35.900> them<00:01:36.140> by<00:01:36.320> using<00:01:36.680> these<00:01:36.920> red<00:01:37.130> circles

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
delete them by using these red circles

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.130 
delete them by using these red circles
well<00:01:37.880> obviously<00:01:38.210> he'll<00:01:38.479> also<00:01:38.630> prefer<00:01:39.050> yellow

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
well obviously he'll also prefer yellow

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.660 
well obviously he'll also prefer yellow
but<00:01:39.500> you've<00:01:39.620> got<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:39.770> use<00:01:39.950> a<00:01:39.979> circle<00:01:40.460> città

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
but you've got to use a circle città

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.399 
but you've got to use a circle città
link<00:01:40.880> them<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.540> that's<00:01:41.690> the<00:01:41.810> only<00:01:42.110> way<00:01:42.229> that

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
link them and that's the only way that

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:43.990 
link them and that's the only way that
you<00:01:42.470> can<00:01:42.500> delete<00:01:42.890> them<00:01:43.010> on<00:01:43.159> this<00:01:43.310> morning<00:01:43.640> so

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
you can delete them on this morning so

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.850 
you can delete them on this morning so
you<00:01:44.060> could<00:01:44.330> make<00:01:44.540> up<00:01:44.720> an<00:01:44.870> absolutely<00:01:45.500> massive

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
you could make up an absolutely massive

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.219 
you could make up an absolutely massive
block<00:01:46.340> of<00:01:46.490> blue<00:01:46.640> ones<00:01:46.970> because<00:01:47.479> that's<00:01:48.080> the

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
block of blue ones because that's the

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.510 
block of blue ones because that's the
thing<00:01:48.380> of<00:01:48.470> one<00:01:48.860> of<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.040> other<00:01:49.130> things<00:01:49.190> about

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
thing of one of the other things about

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.070 
thing of one of the other things about
begin<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:50.240> more<00:01:50.450> that<00:01:50.630> you<00:01:50.690> block<00:01:50.960> up

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
begin the more that you block up

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.899 
begin the more that you block up
together<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.710> blocks<00:01:51.979> change<00:01:52.280> size<00:01:52.549> so<00:01:52.820> you

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
together the blocks change size so you

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.310 
together the blocks change size so you
could<00:01:53.030> get<00:01:53.180> an<00:01:53.270> absolutely<00:01:53.570> massive<00:01:53.720> blue<00:01:54.049> one

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
could get an absolutely massive blue one

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.320 
could get an absolutely massive blue one
well<00:01:54.770> unless<00:01:54.979> you've<00:01:55.159> got<00:01:55.190> a<00:01:55.310> blue<00:01:55.549> surf<00:01:56.150> will

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
well unless you've got a blue surf will

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.280 
well unless you've got a blue surf will
come<00:01:56.510> down<00:01:56.720> there<00:01:56.900> you<00:01:57.049> can't<00:01:57.260> delete<00:01:57.440> them

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
come down there you can't delete them

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.960 
come down there you can't delete them
so<00:01:58.710> that's<00:01:59.130> pretty<00:01:59.310> much<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.490> was<00:01:59.700> for<00:01:59.730> that

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
so that's pretty much it was for that

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.640 
so that's pretty much it was for that
one<00:02:00.180> although<00:02:00.690> obviously<00:02:00.900> as<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.320> might<00:02:01.530> have

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
one although obviously as you might have

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.710 
one although obviously as you might have
guessed<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.820> way<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.090> it's<00:02:03.390> similar<00:02:03.570> to

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
guessed it the way that it's similar to

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.930 
guessed it the way that it's similar to
wear<00:02:03.870> for<00:02:04.170> your<00:02:04.200> poor<00:02:04.530> your<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.460> if<00:02:05.700> you

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
wear for your poor your is that if you

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.550 
wear for your poor your is that if you
do<00:02:06.150> well<00:02:06.390> or<00:02:06.630> if<00:02:06.720> your<00:02:06.870> opponent<00:02:07.020> goes<00:02:07.350> well

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
do well or if your opponent goes well

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.980 
do well or if your opponent goes well
then<00:02:07.950> crap<00:02:08.490> or<00:02:08.670> fly<00:02:08.880> off<00:02:09.090> at<00:02:09.210> your<00:02:09.390> side<00:02:09.690> and

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
then crap or fly off at your side and

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.810 
then crap or fly off at your side and
they've<00:02:10.740> got<00:02:10.770> numbers<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.340> them<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:11.670> that

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
they've got numbers on them and that

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.610 
they've got numbers on them and that
basically<00:02:12.240> says<00:02:12.660> how<00:02:12.840> many<00:02:13.020> turns<00:02:13.350> they've

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
basically says how many turns they've

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.680 
basically says how many turns they've
got<00:02:13.800> left<00:02:14.010> before<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.430> turn<00:02:14.610> into<00:02:14.790> gems<00:02:15.030> but

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
got left before the turn into gems but

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.300 
got left before the turn into gems but
they're<00:02:15.870> also<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.170> color<00:02:16.500> because<00:02:17.040> if<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.280> put

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
they're also a color because if you put

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.770 
they're also a color because if you put
some<00:02:17.610> blocks<00:02:17.850> next<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.270> them<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.510> then<00:02:18.600> get

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
some blocks next to them and then get

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.810 
some blocks next to them and then get
the<00:02:18.960> circle<00:02:19.770> of<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.040> color<00:02:20.280> then<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.700> can

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
the circle of that color then you can

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.760 
the circle of that color then you can
delete<00:02:21.060> them<00:02:21.180> roughly<00:02:21.360> as<00:02:21.570> well<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.530> I'm<00:02:22.620> just

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
delete them roughly as well so I'm just

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.350 
delete them roughly as well so I'm just
going<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.980> shut<00:02:23.130> up<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.430> bit<00:02:23.610> like<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.150> listen

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
going to shut up a bit like you listen

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.700 
going to shut up a bit like you listen
to<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.510> music<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.930> then<00:02:25.140> I'll<00:02:25.230> cut<00:02:25.410> into<00:02:25.620> the

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
to the music and then I'll cut into the

00:02:25.710 --> 00:03:14.670 
to the music and then I'll cut into the
match<00:02:25.860> twinkling

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.020 

Zoey<00:03:15.680> for<00:03:15.920> them<00:03:16.070> this<00:03:16.340> is<00:03:16.460> the<00:03:16.580> march<00:03:16.760> three

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
Zoey for them this is the march three

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.910 
Zoey for them this is the march three
more<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:17.570> as<00:03:17.660> you<00:03:17.780> can<00:03:17.930> quite<00:03:18.170> simply<00:03:18.500> see<00:03:18.680> the

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
more and as you can quite simply see the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.180 
more and as you can quite simply see the
whole<00:03:19.040> point<00:03:19.190> is<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.580> match<00:03:19.850> to<00:03:20.120> your<00:03:20.150> so<00:03:21.190> roll

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
whole point is to match to your so roll

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.920 
whole point is to match to your so roll
on<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.430> right<00:03:22.550> side<00:03:22.820> me<00:03:23.030> screen<00:03:23.300> there<00:03:23.510> just

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
on the right side me screen there just

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.060 
on the right side me screen there just
look<00:03:24.050> through<00:03:24.200> there<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.620> get<00:03:24.770> all<00:03:24.830> together

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
look through there you get all together

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.370 
look through there you get all together
then<00:03:25.610> but<00:03:25.880> then<00:03:26.000> delete<00:03:26.270> it<00:03:26.420> maceo<00:03:27.080> like

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
then but then delete it maceo like

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.010 
then but then delete it maceo like
Martin<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:27.740> don't<00:03:27.980> like<00:03:28.190> it<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:28.940> I<00:03:28.970> suppose<00:03:29.630> it's

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
Martin I don't like it so I suppose it's

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.110 
Martin I don't like it so I suppose it's
similar<00:03:30.320> to<00:03:30.470> wear<00:03:30.650> columns<00:03:31.190> this<00:03:31.520> mod<00:03:31.790> and

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
similar to wear columns this mod and

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.940 
similar to wear columns this mod and
it's<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.600> just<00:03:33.050> as<00:03:33.200> I<00:03:33.290> see<00:03:33.470> it<00:03:33.500> what<00:03:33.770> were<00:03:33.860> the

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
it's a just as I see it what were the

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.710 
it's a just as I see it what were the
fact<00:03:34.130> is<00:03:34.340> all<00:03:34.400> these<00:03:34.610> different<00:03:34.820> more<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.390> just

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
fact is all these different more to just

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.170 
fact is all these different more to just
add<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.320> lot<00:03:36.590> more<00:03:36.650> gameplay<00:03:37.100> to<00:03:37.430> it<00:03:37.550> and<00:03:37.700> I<00:03:37.970> just

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
add a lot more gameplay to it and I just

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.970 
add a lot more gameplay to it and I just
think<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.600> waterful<00:03:39.200> as<00:03:39.350> well<00:03:39.500> having<00:03:39.739> the

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
think the waterful as well having the

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.220 
think the waterful as well having the
different<00:03:40.250> mods<00:03:40.430> so<00:03:41.270> this<00:03:41.780> is<00:03:41.810> this<00:03:42.020> mod

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
different mods so this is this mod

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.780 
different mods so this is this mod
anywhere<00:03:42.560> I've<00:03:42.770> gone<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.220> water<00:03:43.400> yet<00:03:43.580> more

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
anywhere I've gone to the water yet more

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
you can watch it blocks clockwise or

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.670 
you can watch it blocks clockwise or
counterclockwise<00:04:08.239> and<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.260> rules<00:04:09.470> are

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
counterclockwise and the rules are

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.979 
counterclockwise and the rules are
similar<00:04:10.100> to<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.340> first<00:04:10.520> game<00:04:10.880> you<00:04:11.390> can<00:04:11.900> only

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
similar to the first game you can only

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.330 
similar to the first game you can only
delete<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.440> blocks<00:04:12.680> by<00:04:12.890> touching<00:04:13.160> the

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
delete the blocks by touching the

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.039 
delete the blocks by touching the
spheres<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:13.850> them<00:04:14.000> but<00:04:14.390> you<00:04:14.480> can<00:04:14.630> still<00:04:14.840> make

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
spheres to them but you can still make

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.320 
spheres to them but you can still make
up<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.260> big<00:04:15.440> blocks<00:04:15.739> and<00:04:16.220> you<00:04:16.940> can't<00:04:17.150> actually

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
up the big blocks and you can't actually

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.820 
up the big blocks and you can't actually
want<00:04:17.630> to<00:04:17.720> get<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:17.900> big<00:04:18.049> blocks<00:04:18.260> on<00:04:18.410> this<00:04:18.530> so

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
want to get the big blocks on this so

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:19.810 
want to get the big blocks on this so
it's<00:04:18.979> the<00:04:19.010> type<00:04:19.190> of<00:04:19.220> thing<00:04:19.340> that<00:04:19.489> you<00:04:19.640> have<00:04:19.669> to

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
it's the type of thing that you have to

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.820 
it's the type of thing that you have to
be<00:04:19.940> very<00:04:20.180> careful<00:04:20.810> with<00:04:21.140> when<00:04:21.350> you<00:04:21.440> make<00:04:21.620> them

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
be very careful with when you make them

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.560 
be very careful with when you make them
so<00:04:22.040> obviously<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.400> get<00:04:22.520> more<00:04:22.729> points<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:23.360> you

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
so obviously you get more points and you

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.510 
so obviously you get more points and you
can<00:04:23.720> like<00:04:24.200> overall<00:04:24.680> deal<00:04:24.890> more<00:04:25.070> damage<00:04:25.130> to

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
can like overall deal more damage to

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.610 
can like overall deal more damage to
your<00:04:25.640> opponent<00:04:25.700> but<00:04:26.600> at<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:26.990> same<00:04:27.140> time<00:04:27.410> they

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
your opponent but at the same time they

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.170 
your opponent but at the same time they
can<00:04:27.740> also<00:04:27.890> screw<00:04:28.280> your<00:04:28.430> all<00:04:28.580> but<00:04:28.610> if<00:04:28.880> you<00:04:28.970> don't

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
can also screw your all but if you don't

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.900 
can also screw your all but if you don't
get<00:04:29.330> the<00:04:29.450> full<00:04:29.570> of<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:29.780> United<00:04:30.229> so<00:04:30.910> especially
