00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.790 
this you're not going to need it anymore
to<00:04:39.160> just<00:04:39.190> throw<00:04:39.580> it<00:04:39.669> away<00:04:40.169> so<00:04:41.169> I'm<00:04:41.500> going<00:04:41.650> to<00:04:41.680> do

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
to just throw it away so I'm going to do

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.250 
to just throw it away so I'm going to do
off<00:04:43.590> when<00:04:44.590> you<00:04:44.680> reconnect<00:04:45.010> this<00:04:45.930> all<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:47.110> do

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
off when you reconnect this all you do

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.360 
off when you reconnect this all you do
is<00:04:47.380> insert<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.919> line<00:04:48.160> and<00:04:49.889> make<00:04:50.889> sure<00:04:51.039> this<00:04:51.190> is

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
is insert the line and make sure this is

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.270 
is insert the line and make sure this is
tightened<00:04:51.789> down<00:04:51.849> securely<00:04:52.979> which<00:04:53.979> I'm<00:04:54.130> going

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
tightened down securely which I'm going

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.490 
tightened down securely which I'm going
to<00:04:54.370> do<00:04:54.490> down<00:04:54.639> there<00:04:54.880> there's<00:04:55.150> no<00:04:55.270> room<00:04:55.570> for<00:04:55.810> a

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
to do down there there's no room for a

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.150 
to do down there there's no room for a
camera<00:04:57.090> but<00:04:58.090> you<00:04:58.360> just<00:04:58.660> stick<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.160> regular

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
camera but you just stick the regular

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.909 
camera but you just stick the regular
line<00:05:00.340> right<00:05:00.669> back<00:05:00.880> in<00:05:01.150> and<00:05:01.710> according<00:05:02.710> to<00:05:02.740> the

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
line right back in and according to the

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:04.620 
line right back in and according to the
instructions<00:05:03.250> it<00:05:03.669> says<00:05:03.700> with<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.360> pressure

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
instructions it says with the pressure

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.260 
instructions it says with the pressure
the<00:05:04.900> air<00:05:04.930> would<00:05:05.410> seal<00:05:05.770> it<00:05:05.800> so<00:05:06.700> we're<00:05:07.120> going<00:05:07.210> to

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
the air would seal it so we're going to

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.440 
the air would seal it so we're going to
test<00:05:07.510> we're<00:05:07.780> going<00:05:07.900> to<00:05:07.960> test<00:05:08.139> it<00:05:08.349> to<00:05:08.380> make<00:05:08.500> sure

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
test we're going to test it to make sure

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.670 
test we're going to test it to make sure
so<00:05:10.450> I'm<00:05:10.510> going<00:05:10.630> to<00:05:10.660> already<00:05:11.020> install<00:05:11.440> the
