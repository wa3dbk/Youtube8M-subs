00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.240 
do that if I were to like detangle at
this<00:00:46.620> point<00:00:47.270> then<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.930> would<00:00:49.289> just<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:50.070> an

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
this point then I would just have an

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.430 
this point then I would just have an
afro<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.270> that's<00:00:51.570> not<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.809> look<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.140> I'm

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
afro and that's not the look that I'm

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.299 
afro and that's not the look that I'm
going<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.910> so<00:00:53.910> instead<00:00:54.690> I'll<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.320> try<00:00:56.250> to

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
going for so instead I'll just try to

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.170 
going for so instead I'll just try to
scrunch<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.000> into<00:00:57.300> my<00:00:57.480> hair<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.370> I<00:00:59.370> will

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
scrunch it into my hair and I will

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.720 
scrunch it into my hair and I will
follow<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.840> up<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.170> some<00:01:01.739> grapeseed<00:01:02.399> oil

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
follow that up with some grapeseed oil

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.939 
follow that up with some grapeseed oil
and<00:01:03.270> then<00:01:03.390> I'll<00:01:03.570> apply<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.680> same

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
and then I'll apply that in the same

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.920 
and then I'll apply that in the same
manner<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.339> just<00:01:05.549> kind<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.850> scrunch<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.360> into<00:01:06.780> my

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
manner I just kind of scrunch it into my

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.830 
manner I just kind of scrunch it into my
hair<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.979> went<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.700> left<00:01:08.970> squish<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
hair that I went to the left squish the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.520 
hair that I went to the left squish the
right<00:01:10.049> by<00:01:10.530> block<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.189> I'll<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.240> two<00:01:12.930> layers<00:01:13.290> of

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
right by block and I'll do two layers of

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.520 
right by block and I'll do two layers of
that<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.189> I'll<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.670> leave<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.270> oil<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.259> I'll

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.789 
that so I'll do leave in oil and I'll
shake<00:01:16.890> real<00:01:17.130> good<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:18.450> then<00:01:18.509> I'll<00:01:18.810> do<00:01:19.049> leaving

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
shake real good and then I'll do leaving

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.539 
shake real good and then I'll do leaving
and<00:01:20.189> oil<00:01:20.880> again<00:01:23.689> on<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:25.200> particular<00:01:25.619> day<00:01:25.830> I

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
and oil again on this particular day I

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.600 
and oil again on this particular day I
was<00:01:27.210> trying<00:01:27.659> out<00:01:27.990> flexi<00:01:28.650> jail<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.280> first

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
was trying out flexi jail for the first

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.640 
was trying out flexi jail for the first
time<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.479> did<00:01:31.409> not<00:01:31.770> care<00:01:32.310> for<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.759> because<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:34.290> had

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
time I did not care for it because I had

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.450 
time I did not care for it because I had
chunks<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.310> flat<00:01:35.759> feet<00:01:36.030> gel<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.750> my<00:01:36.810> hair<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.159> it

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
chunks of flat feet gel in my hair so it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.240 
chunks of flat feet gel in my hair so it
probably<00:01:38.700> works<00:01:38.939> well<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:40.140> ourselves<00:01:40.740> but

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
probably works well for ourselves but

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.510 
probably works well for ourselves but
for<00:01:41.310> me<00:01:42.060> for<00:01:42.619> washing<00:01:43.619> goes<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.009> does<00:01:44.159> not<00:01:44.310> work

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
for me for washing goes it does not work

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.069 
for me for washing goes it does not work
but<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.970> were<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.149> apply<00:01:45.570> some<00:01:45.869> sort<00:01:46.049> of

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
but if you were to apply some sort of

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.380 
but if you were to apply some sort of
porting<00:01:46.439> product<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.759> will<00:01:47.939> be<00:01:48.090> when<00:01:48.270> you

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
porting product this will be when you

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.399 
porting product this will be when you
add<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.899> right<00:01:49.049> before<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.549> your<00:01:51.409> final
