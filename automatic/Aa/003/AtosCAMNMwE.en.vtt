me show you the back of this this unit

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.640 
me show you the back of this this unit
only<00:03:44.819> uses<00:03:45.209> two<00:03:45.420> fans<00:03:45.720> because<00:03:46.139> I<00:03:46.170> change<00:03:46.500> the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
only uses two fans because I change the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.890 
only uses two fans because I change the
way<00:03:46.769> I<00:03:46.799> did<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.100> back<00:03:47.269> these<00:03:48.269> holes<00:03:48.569> are<00:03:48.750> cut

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
way I did it back these holes are cut

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.750 
way I did it back these holes are cut
out<00:03:48.930> much<00:03:49.470> more<00:03:49.829> precise<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.310> they're<00:03:50.670> not

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
out much more precise and they're not

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.390 
out much more precise and they're not
going<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:50.940> let<00:03:51.060> any<00:03:51.239> air<00:03:51.420> in<00:03:51.630> so<00:03:51.900> it's<00:03:52.500> three

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
going to let any air in so it's three
