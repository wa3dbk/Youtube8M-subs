00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.560 
granted when we had 15 rounds on there
yes<00:02:27.110> yeah<00:02:28.110> we<00:02:28.380> did<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:28.770> many<00:02:28.890> mistakes<00:02:29.360> do<00:02:30.360> you

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570

think<00:02:30.750> it's<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:31.020> disadvantage<00:02:31.950> playing

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
think it's a disadvantage playing

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.670 
think it's a disadvantage playing
against<00:02:33.060> your<00:02:33.270> your<00:02:33.480> ex-teammates<00:02:33.780> speakers

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
against your your ex-teammates speakers

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.180 
against your your ex-teammates speakers
as<00:02:34.890> they<00:02:35.400> know<00:02:35.810> how<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:36.870> play<00:02:37.260> better<00:02:38.040> than

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
as they know how you play better than

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.260 
as they know how you play better than
anyone<00:02:38.580> else<00:02:38.850> no<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.780> think<00:02:39.930> we<00:02:40.410> have<00:02:40.440> better

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
anyone else no I think we have better

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.980 
anyone else no I think we have better
control<00:02:42.270> over<00:02:42.480> how<00:02:43.170> they<00:02:43.380> play<00:02:43.680> because<00:02:44.460> I

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
control over how they play because I

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.340 
control over how they play because I
