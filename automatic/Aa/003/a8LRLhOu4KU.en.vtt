to worry about all that time messing

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.959 
to worry about all that time messing
around<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.620> setting<00:00:34.980> up<00:00:35.190> lines<00:00:35.489> here<00:00:35.790> there

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
around and setting up lines here there

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.610 
around and setting up lines here there
and<00:00:36.090> everywhere<00:00:36.149> what<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.170> get<00:00:37.350> with<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.590> kit

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
and everywhere what you get with the kit

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.430 
and everywhere what you get with the kit
is<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.640> multi<00:00:39.000> link<00:00:39.180> bracket<00:00:39.629> which<00:00:39.840> fits<00:00:40.140> in

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
is the multi link bracket which fits in

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.410 
is the multi link bracket which fits in
several<00:00:41.070> sides<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.879> tool<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.270> make<00:00:42.360> it

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
several sides of the tool to make it

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.139 
several sides of the tool to make it
even<00:00:42.629> more<00:00:42.809> versatile<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:44.340> has<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> clamp<00:00:44.940> on

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
even more versatile this has a clamp on

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.880 
even more versatile this has a clamp on
the<00:00:45.270> end<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.170> can<00:00:46.230> clamp<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the end so you can clamp it on to the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.910 
the end so you can clamp it on to the
timber<00:00:47.399> back<00:00:47.910> at<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.149> door<00:00:48.420> chair<00:00:49.410> anything

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
timber back at the door chair anything

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.350 
timber back at the door chair anything
like<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.430> depending<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:51.210> application

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
like that depending on what application

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.900 
like that depending on what application
you're<00:00:51.960> using<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.440> for<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:53.129> cross<00:00:53.370> line<00:00:53.610> laser

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
you're using it for the cross line laser

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.310 
you're using it for the cross line laser
and<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.180> can<00:00:54.360> see<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> wall<00:00:54.840> over<00:00:55.079> there

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
and you can see on the wall over there

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.240 
and you can see on the wall over there
gives<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.760> horizontal<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.989> vertical

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
gives you a horizontal and a vertical

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.369 
gives you a horizontal and a vertical
reference<00:00:59.250> point<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.930> can<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.260> be

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
reference point and this can then be

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.889 
reference point and this can then be
moved<00:01:01.590> around<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.550> wall<00:01:02.789> one<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> great

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
moved around the wall one of the great

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.570 
moved around the wall one of the great
things<00:01:04.170> about<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.530> cubix<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.280> you've<00:01:05.369> got

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
things about the cubix is and you've got

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.640 
things about the cubix is and you've got
mounting<00:01:05.939> points<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.420> five<00:01:06.810> sides<00:01:07.140> so

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
mounting points on five sides so

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.710 
mounting points on five sides so
whatever<00:01:07.979> way<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.250> need<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.640> use<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.090> there's

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
whatever way you need to use it there's

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.200 
whatever way you need to use it there's
a<00:01:09.840> way<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.290> hold<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.100> position<00:01:11.220> using<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
a way to hold it in position using the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.690 
a way to hold it in position using the
clamp<00:01:12.510> now<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.470> self<00:01:13.770> leveling<00:01:14.159> part<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.580> it

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
clamp now the self leveling part of it

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.730 
clamp now the self leveling part of it
is<00:01:15.119> once<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.509> get<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.750> reasonably<00:01:16.409> straight

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
is once you get it reasonably straight

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.490 
is once you get it reasonably straight
to<00:01:17.100> within<00:01:17.430> four<00:01:17.909> degrees<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:19.110> will<00:01:19.290> then

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
to within four degrees it will then

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.820 
to within four degrees it will then
automatically<00:01:20.390> level<00:01:21.390> itself<00:01:21.840> up<00:01:22.110> there<00:01:22.710> are

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
automatically level itself up there are

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.980 
automatically level itself up there are
two<00:01:22.890> modes<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.720> self

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
two modes that you have on this the self

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.539 
two modes that you have on this the self

leveling mode which you switch on one
side<00:01:26.850> there<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.479> then<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.320> also<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:29.009> the
