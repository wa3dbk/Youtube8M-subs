00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:15.110
 mixer test and roll v4 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.099
 ignition with autotest a par la 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:25.070
 written pal and all the tests are done 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:31.550
 the test setup with two in inputs 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:35.379
 on two cameras the output is sent 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.030
 to a connected preview monitor 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:41.890
 at exit 1 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.079
 this is the output two are two exits 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.510
 absolutely identical and in addition there is a 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.100
 monitor an output for a monitor of 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:58.879
 preview where menus also appear 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:01:04.430
 these are the inputs and these are the 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:06.800
 channel management commands those ones 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.960
 I can switch automatically 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.960
 between one channel and another 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:23.280
 and if I stand in front of it you can also see the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.679
 channel switching is obviously 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:32.209
 what i can do 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:44.369
 and it is the fundamental thing they are done 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:46.229
 also the effects through the bar 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.959
 of the mixer 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:55.590
 here I am again the bar and companions 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:58.349
 with adjusting the memory appear 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.649
 different types of effects for example 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:06.329
 this is a pitcher in pitcher where you are 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:09.239
 he sees the Switzerland in the upper left then 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:16.230
 I can put the pizzera at the top a 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:18.319
 right lower right lower a 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.840
 left 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:26.850
 these are the functions on the position 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.069
 of memory 6 instead there is the normal fade 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.190
 faith options are adjustable 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:36.000
 also through the menu and through the 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:41.819
 effects for example this number 3 is 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.389
 the colorize option where you shoot everything 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.109
 the colored screen or the one 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:51.139
 negative 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:56.099
 or the strobe or multi option 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:58.410
 where the screen splits into two 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:03.090
 single screen multi screen too 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:06.810
 this all planned nothing these 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:11.900
 are the main functions 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:16.260
 then there are also the functions of 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.520
 adjustable immediate switching 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.800
 via the long example button 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:30.370
 the wipe for the curtain one and the mixer 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:34.090
 sorry two and three are the pulldown 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.250
 electronic effects in this case there is 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.620
 this effect but less is possible 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:43.050
 put on others and so on 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:46.050
 these are the main functions of the 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.050
 mixer
