00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.260
 the search for a healthier lifestyle 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.619
 the global economy is going through a radical change in nature the work 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.779
 with profound consequences for the future of society

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.100
 to produce basic goods and services 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.770
 more access 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.770
 machines in shape 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.380
 quickly replaced the human workforce 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.500
 born in the port 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.510
 one of these services 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.870
 just as the industrial age put an end to slave labor 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.370
 the era of access to the final work 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.480
 successive generations have stated from the daily hours of work 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.190
 lettuce for feed 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.770
 in decisions 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.120
 social networks 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.890
 we have a challenge before us 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.890
 to seek alternatives for me 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.610
 regardless of the alternative hide 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
 willingness to rethink the role 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.170
 the new training 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.170
 role of the society of the few to 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.759
 Faced with these facts, it is clear the need to rethink their projects 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:42.659
 professionals 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.570
 previously based almost exclusively on small business nails 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.790
 or in the provision of services 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:50.980
 the question is 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.479
 what to do with the millions of young people 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.109
 that need to be pursued in an increasingly global economy.

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.859
 to conquer your freedom your space in the market 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.489
 the same question is for executives 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.200
 what will they do when the job no longer exists 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:16.469
 and the elderly 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.279
 can still dream of a job opportunity and a social life 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.879
 more active 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.450

 quality of life are they

 renata that generated today 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.490

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.369
 successful businessmen 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:45.989
