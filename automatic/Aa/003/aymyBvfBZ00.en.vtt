00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.170 
likely of downtown break yeah and our
radar<00:01:36.870> we<00:01:37.320> get<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.770> stands<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.730> every<00:01:38.970> five

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
radar we get the stands in every five

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.700 
radar we get the stands in every five
minutes<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.690> so<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.170> windows<00:01:40.440> about

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
minutes and so this is the windows about

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.950 
minutes and so this is the windows about
five<00:01:40.980> minutes<00:01:41.220> old<00:01:41.520> now<00:01:41.760> this<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.420> about<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
five minutes old now this is about the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.500 
five minutes old now this is about the
west<00:01:43.320> northwest<00:01:43.650> of<00:01:43.980> Birmingham<00:01:44.460> but<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.270> five

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
west northwest of Birmingham but in five

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.360 
west northwest of Birmingham but in five
minutes<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.990> will<00:01:46.080> have<00:01:46.200> moved<00:01:46.440> now<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.160> that

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
minutes it will have moved now so that

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.220 
minutes it will have moved now so that
it's<00:01:47.490> almost<00:01:47.760> due<00:01:48.120> north<00:01:48.150> of<00:01:48.540> Birmingham<00:01:48.990> at

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
it's almost due north of Birmingham at

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.710 
it's almost due north of Birmingham at
this<00:01:49.590> time<00:01:49.920> about<00:01:50.250> five<00:01:50.280> minutes<00:01:50.700> ago<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.510> was

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
this time about five minutes ago it was

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.290 
this time about five minutes ago it was
located<00:01:52.080> about<00:01:52.410> 5<00:01:52.680> miles<00:01:52.920> west-northwest<00:01:53.310> so

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
located about 5 miles west-northwest so

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.990 
located about 5 miles west-northwest so
you<00:01:54.360> live<00:01:54.630> for<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.170> move<00:01:55.790> in<00:01:56.790> that

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
you live for that to move in that

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.480 
you live for that to move in that
subsequent<00:01:57.600> time<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.830> probably<00:01:59.160> moved

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
subsequent time and it is probably moved

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.140 
subsequent time and it is probably moved
about

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
about

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.500 
about
time<00:02:01.960> and<00:02:02.320> it<00:02:02.890> is<00:02:03.010> probably<00:02:03.340> moved<00:02:03.640> about<00:02:04.180> that

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
time and it is probably moved about that

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.990 
time and it is probably moved about that
far<00:02:04.840> so<00:02:05.200> that<00:02:06.010> would<00:02:06.220> put<00:02:06.400> it<00:02:06.550> probably<00:02:06.700> there

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
far so that would put it probably there

the radar and a debris ball that I'll
try<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.550> do<00:03:06.000> some<00:03:06.390> measurements<00:03:06.990> of<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:08.160> give

try to do some measurements of that give

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.590 
try to do some measurements of that give
us<00:03:09.000> some<00:03:09.800> idea<00:03:10.800> of<00:03:11.540> what<00:03:12.540> we're<00:03:12.870> seeing<00:03:13.260> here
