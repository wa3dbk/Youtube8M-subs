00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
see some pops of red in there too it was

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
see some pops of red in there too it was
really<00:01:25.860> about<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.220> shape<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
really about the shape and the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.100 
really about the shape and the
silhouette<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.240> season<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.780> thought<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
silhouette this season so I thought the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.410 
silhouette this season so I thought the
color<00:01:28.350> really<00:01:28.619> needed<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.460> be<00:01:29.579> very<00:01:29.790> clean<00:01:30.150> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
color really needed to be very clean and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.780 
color really needed to be very clean and
I<00:01:30.540> think<00:01:30.720> red<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.140> very<00:01:32.040> definition<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
I think red is a very definition of

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.280 
I think red is a very definition of
strength<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.659> felt<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.170> was<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
strength and I felt like it was the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.860 
strength and I felt like it was the
right<00:01:34.439> color

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
right color

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.170
