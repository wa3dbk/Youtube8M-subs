00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:25.009
 just getting nice next to the year, scientists knew about a ccs profit 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:26.089
 4 percent 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:27.220

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.150
 got caught 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.680

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.610
 what a signal difference between work in the Netherlands to your condition 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.630
 at least a group of an operation abroad 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.450

 recycling then difficult 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.090
 to be away from home that simply has to be done every day 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.970
 what a fool 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.010
 if one would pay but we are still on those calls 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.890
 just enough otherwise the research is going to pay 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.180
 the day was wessanen 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.090

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.750
 feyenoord passes to feyenoord 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.750
 that was a record of ordinary people 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.510
 it is raining the latest state of affairs 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.310

 that's what she says 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.670
 no just because the ice is occasionally desired 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.670
 at home just have to be behind computer 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.950
 that is long enough votes 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.020
 the software twice a day 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.020
 to pay 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.920
 thousands of jobs and the stews 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.800
 7 but good from time to time 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.489
 as always for the first time that it went this way 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.739

 can start well back home 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.879
 the most important that we can excel setlist o 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:33.489
 would be the second opponent 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.489
 undoubtedly also the starting signal for the first time a piece of nature 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.039
 so it is important to be 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.979

 so far as we are as much as possible winner of this competition 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:39.999
