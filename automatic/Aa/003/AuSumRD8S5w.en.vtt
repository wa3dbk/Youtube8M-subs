 and well quite not quite there 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.650
 by chance never known at our 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.050
 concert a lady who invited me for the 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.440
 marc vella concert and have not been able to 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.890
 go to this concert the day after the 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.340
 concert 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.560
 I sent an email to his ladies and then the 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.890
 10 years of excusing myself for not being able to 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.680
 to attend this concert and that's what is 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.260
 so only game it seems that it's 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.370
 beautiful and Thursday but I would like 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.560
 that one day we can get back from 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.340
 sir go play it on the square 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.590
 lemmens is like that a little 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.560
 governed a lot of police was going through everything 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.479
 that and I really wanted to spend the 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.479
 cars the thalys by the mission 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.689
 why I chose to play in 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.890
 public places precisely to learn to 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:56.850
 love because in public places 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.399
 sometimes there is sadness sometimes 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.789
 suffering there is violence and the 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.530
 misery 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.299
 there is also joy there are also 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.860
 beautiful things but there are moments 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.530
 difficult so you have to learn to 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.200
 to love all that is this humanity that 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.790
 sometimes is brutal aggressively has always 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.930
 that's when I was a little kid 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.790
 there was a lot of violence at home 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.170
 a lot of races a lot of screaming 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.180
 always wondering if I was going 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.010
 to see my mother alive which was violent 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.959
 not to mention everything I could 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.040
 hear receive so there was a 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:31.680
 piano in my hell and the piano is 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.299
 a bit of a refuge that allowed me to hear 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.299
 the writings of adults
