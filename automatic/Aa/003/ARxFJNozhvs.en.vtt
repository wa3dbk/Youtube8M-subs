can you tell what the difference is

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.670 
can you tell what the difference is
issue<00:06:02.400> horses<00:06:03.300> last<00:06:03.600> or<00:06:03.930> is<00:06:04.080> it<00:06:04.199> too<00:06:04.320> early<00:06:04.380> to

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
issue horses last or is it too early to

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.770 
issue horses last or is it too early to
really<00:06:05.220> get<00:06:05.310> a<00:06:05.370> grasp<00:06:05.669> on<00:06:05.880> now<00:06:06.300> I'll<00:06:06.419> tell<00:06:06.660> you

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.350 
really get a grasp on now I'll tell you
so<00:06:07.259> the<00:06:07.350> difference<00:06:07.530> already<00:06:07.770> happened<00:06:08.360> was

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
so the difference already happened was

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.890 
so the difference already happened was
it<00:06:09.540> two<00:06:09.750> practices<00:06:10.259> ago<00:06:10.820> we<00:06:11.820> were<00:06:11.970> just<00:06:12.180> down

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
it two practices ago we were just down

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.320 
it two practices ago we were just down
there<00:06:13.440> was<00:06:13.560> no<00:06:13.680> energy<00:06:14.070> and<00:06:14.250> that's<00:06:15.150> when

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
there was no energy and that's when

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.450 
there was no energy and that's when
there's<00:06:15.780> more<00:06:15.960> miss<00:06:16.259> opportunities<00:06:16.530> a<00:06:17.220> lot

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
there's more miss opportunities a lot

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.610 
there's more miss opportunities a lot
more<00:06:17.759> misplaced<00:06:18.330> I<00:06:18.600> think<00:06:19.470> the<00:06:19.590> only

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
more misplaced I think the only

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.230 
more misplaced I think the only
difference<00:06:20.070> between<00:06:20.160> last<00:06:20.520> year<00:06:20.759> or<00:06:21.000> any

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
difference between last year or any

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.710 
difference between last year or any
defense<00:06:21.630> in<00:06:21.720> the<00:06:21.810> country<00:06:21.840> is<00:06:22.350> energy<00:06:23.130> I<00:06:23.720> think

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
defense in the country is energy I think

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.510 
defense in the country is energy I think
that<00:06:24.870> that's<00:06:25.199> why<00:06:25.410> I<00:06:25.440> realized<00:06:25.680> if<00:06:26.370> there's

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
that that's why I realized if there's

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.520 
that that's why I realized if there's
energy<00:06:26.669> on<00:06:26.850> defense<00:06:27.270> that's<00:06:28.169> really<00:06:28.350> all<00:06:28.410> you

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
energy on defense that's really all you

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:39.140 
energy on defense that's really all you
need<00:06:35.419> well<00:06:36.440> I'm<00:06:37.440> 210<00:06:37.889> right<00:06:38.070> now<00:06:38.220> I<00:06:38.460> don't

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
need well I'm 210 right now I don't

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.939 
need well I'm 210 right now I don't
think<00:06:39.449> it's<00:06:39.600> the<00:06:39.660> issue<00:06:39.840> but<00:06:40.199> coach<00:06:40.710> once

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:40.949 
think it's the issue but coach once

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:43.460 
think it's the issue but coach once
movie<00:06:41.250> 220<00:06:41.789> I'll<00:06:42.330> try<00:06:42.570> my<00:06:42.780> best<00:06:42.810> to<00:06:43.080> get<00:06:43.229> there

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470 
movie 220 I'll try my best to get there

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.010 
movie 220 I'll try my best to get there
but<00:06:43.680> um<00:06:43.710> if<00:06:44.580> I<00:06:44.699> don't<00:06:44.970> I<00:06:45.180> mean<00:06:45.419> there's<00:06:45.930> a<00:06:45.990> lot

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
but um if I don't I mean there's a lot

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.560 
but um if I don't I mean there's a lot
of<00:06:46.169> people<00:06:46.350> I<00:06:46.500> can<00:06:46.740> compare<00:06:47.639> to<00:06:47.669> that<00:06:47.820> small<00:06:48.240> Oh
