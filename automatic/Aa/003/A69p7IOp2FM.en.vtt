00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.259
 to the golden state 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.100
 ah 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.890
 the people about him 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.960
 that a metal gear becomes a 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.440
 hack and slash in every rule is something that 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.780
 A priori surprises both locals and strangers 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.150
 in cosima productions are never wrong 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.220
 in their decisions the last test of 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.160
 this is the remarkable result obtained 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.420
 in metal gear rising reb in jets the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.640
 decision to let the study 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.770
 platinum games responsible for bayonetta 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.570
 mad world or bank guys will take care of 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.510
 this spin-off starring raiden 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.330
 has produced this fast-paced game 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.060
 of action a surprise that is a lot 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.100
 better than expected 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.649
 one of the strengths of metal 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.840
 gear is its elaborate appearance story 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.740
 that platinum games has been able to transfer 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.289
 this production 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.119
 the numerous eyebrows especially during 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.789
 the first hours of play and that 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.100
 we can jump if we are impatient we 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.750
 They give a good account of the time situation 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.260
 where we are and the enemies 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.150
 that we face 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.130
 the duration of these sequences well 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.830
 adapted to the gameplay is not so 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.290
 exaggerated like the metal gear solid 4 and 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.530
 they do not break the rhythm by serving us some 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.750
 pause before so much action ride to start 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.060
 to this trip as a protector seeing how 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.030
 little skills serve them before a 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.650
 enemy that will leave us to pieces 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.750
 literally speaking will be months 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.970
 after our recomposition 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.790
 biomechanics when we feel a 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.310
 much stronger fighter tough and 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.130
 tremendously lethal ready to 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.810
 face enemies of all kinds to 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.670
 from that moment on we are introduced 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.330
 in a spiral of action against soldiers 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.850
 walking cyborgs robots of all kinds 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.050
 helicopters and other heavy weapons 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.800
 being the confrontations against the 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.650
 difficult 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.380
 -final voices the most outstanding climaxes 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.990
 of this proposal the game mechanics 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.120
 it is simple a strong attack and another 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.830
 fast an action button 1 to use 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.200
 secondary weapons like grenades and 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.850
 bazookas and other a button to run 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.590
 can also perform actions of 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.870
 sweep or blow in combination with the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.750
 movement buttons and free use of 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.420
 the katana 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.470
 the part that catches the most attention and 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.470
 What else are we invited to enjoy? 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.950
 during the adventure being able to reduce 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.210
 pieces any element that we want 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.010
 when activating free use 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.900
 the action will slow down 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.760
 execute vertical movements well 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.640
 horizontal pressing the buttons 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.560
 indicated or better still moving the stick 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.470
 right in the direction we want 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.510
 cut away from being just a simple 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.040
 curiosity the game prompts us to go 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.870
 doing this type of actions for 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.570
 cut the enemies by the box 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.700
 indicated by then activating a 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.239
 movement that will start its substance 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.470
 vital serving us to recharge them if 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.270
 we do not make the cuts of form 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.209
 precise by the orange box 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.070
 we will lose this opportunity better 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.709
 we make the most of them, since all 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.660
 recovery will not be vital 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.540
 we are facing a demanding proposal in 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.459
 how much difficulty the faster 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.350
 we are fulfilling the missions how much 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.750
 more effective and how many more combos 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.910
 let's make more experience score 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.590
 we will have at the end of the mission with 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.330
 these points we can go buying 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.180
 new improvements and combos to be even 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.670
 such in certain missions will be good 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.140
 take advantage of our viewer which 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.750
 allows us to detect even enemies 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.600
 covered can approach from behind 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.150
 and eliminate them with a brand impalement 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.980
 of the house pity that it is not removed more 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.900
 match the scenarios or watching us 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.720
 could leave more exploration options 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.420
 well in this sense these are pretty 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.550
 linear when we are attacked by several 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.730
 enemies we can not leave the area of 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.170
 confrontation until we eliminate them 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.000
 the speed with which the 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.109
 action and the various combos that we can 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.170
 perform with the different buttons 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.910
 they achieve a lot of showiness getting to be 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.600
 the same visual height as those of the 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.900
 excellent 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.270
 cgs meanwhile some scenarios we 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.090
 They have seemed somewhat bland in comparison 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.860
 to the elaborate design of the enemies 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.570
 indicate that there are moments quick time 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.669
 events well to eliminate at a stroke 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.910
 fateful to some enemy or to escape 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.430
 of certain situations 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.730
 in this title there are two big aspects 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.100
 negative the first the camera many 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.740
 too many times does not offer us the point 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.300
 of correct view this is evidenced with 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.220
 the enemies that are jumping from a 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.310
 place to another one of the screen remaining 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.630
 sold on excessive occasions the 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.450
 second the duration 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:08.090
 we are facing a short product close to 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.880
 5 hours too short to be 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.380
 a metal gear that is short but very 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.850
 intense something usual in platinum games 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.380
 we can replay the title to find 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.300
 for example all the hidden files 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.580
 as well as the missions 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.320
 vr being able to access from the menu 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.080
 principal to those that we have 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.850
 discovered we have subtitles in several 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.160
 languages although there are some phrases from 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.840
 text that suddenly change to another language 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.540
 for a few seconds something the 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.900
 understandable good English dubbing in 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.190
 the usual quality of the known ip 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.780
 platinum games wanted to give a touch 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.520
 of humor to the game and in certain moments 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.139
 we will see situations or dialogues 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.580
 hilarious 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.439
 as raiden trying to pass 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.050
 unnoticed with a big hat 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:53.599
 mariachi for example or a child screaming 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.240
 like a bunga by telling us that we are a 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:58.219
 child even counting on some failures 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.449
 that could have been polished the valuation 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:00.560
 What we do with this product is that 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:03.590
 offers an excellent experience 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.110
 totally recommended for fans of 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.210
 the action if you have tried it not 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.330
 let yourself be guided by the demo does not make 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:16.569
 justify metal gear rising ruben genz 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.569
 It is a pleasant surprise a great style 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:26.559
 several friends 

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:26.559
 ah
