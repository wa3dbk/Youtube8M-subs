slight tread pattern change but they

raptor for about 10 years and i've used
it<00:00:38.870> in<00:00:38.989> 2.1<00:00:39.739> 2.2<00:00:41.019> for<00:00:42.019> size<00:00:42.379> and<00:00:42.920> the<00:00:43.640> 2.4

and then they offer the 2.4 in the Moto
that<00:00:59.510> I<00:00:59.540> actually<00:00:59.900> still<00:01:00.199> have<00:01:00.379> a<00:01:00.409> set<00:01:00.650> of<00:01:00.739> the

that I actually still have a set of the
2.4<00:01:01.369> s<00:01:01.519> as<00:01:01.640> well<00:01:02.619> this<00:01:03.619> tire<00:01:03.890> is<00:01:04.479> the<00:01:05.479> opposite

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
2.4 s as well this tire is the opposite

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.480 
2.4 s as well this tire is the opposite
of<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.830> Nano<00:01:07.690> uses<00:01:08.690> large<00:01:09.350> tread<00:01:10.190> blocks

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
of the Nano uses large tread blocks

of the Nano uses large tread blocks
which<00:01:10.790> I<00:01:10.939> will<00:01:11.060> show<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:11.510> difference

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
which I will show you the difference

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.030 
which I will show you the difference
here<00:01:12.130> you<00:01:13.130> see<00:01:13.400> in<00:01:13.610> this<00:01:13.930> this<00:01:14.930> is<00:01:15.080> a<00:01:15.110> 2010<00:01:15.799> I

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
here you see in this this is a 2010 I

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.350 
here you see in this this is a 2010 I
bought<00:01:16.280> up<00:01:16.430> a<00:01:16.520> bunch<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:17.330> new<00:01:17.810> old<00:01:18.020> stock

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
bought up a bunch of the new old stock

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.870 
bought up a bunch of the new old stock
it<00:01:20.360> has<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.570> single<00:01:20.960> knob<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:22.130> widely<00:01:22.460> spaced

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
it has a single knob to widely spaced

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.570 
it has a single knob to widely spaced
knobs<00:01:23.450> here<00:01:23.810> too<00:01:24.350> tightly<00:01:24.620> spaced<00:01:24.950> knobs<00:01:25.190> and

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
knobs here too tightly spaced knobs and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.790 
knobs here too tightly spaced knobs and
then<00:01:25.730> keeps<00:01:26.060> repeating<00:01:26.330> that<00:01:26.540> pattern<00:01:26.800> now

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
then keeps repeating that pattern now

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.210 
then keeps repeating that pattern now
the<00:01:28.400> pattern<00:01:28.730> is<00:01:28.910> too<00:01:29.240> tightly<00:01:30.080> spaced<00:01:30.410> to

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
the pattern is too tightly spaced to

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.610 
the pattern is too tightly spaced to
outer<00:01:31.400> space<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:31.910> tighter<00:01:32.150> space<00:01:32.480> so<00:01:33.290> on<00:01:33.440> so

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
outer space to tighter space so on so

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.940 
outer space to tighter space so on so
forth<00:01:33.650> so<00:01:34.610> they<00:01:34.760> have<00:01:35.030> removed<00:01:35.630> this<00:01:36.320> singular

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
forth so they have removed this singular

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.150 
forth so they have removed this singular
knob<00:01:37.160> and<00:01:37.460> replaced<00:01:38.030> it<00:01:38.270> each<00:01:39.020> time<00:01:39.080> with<00:01:39.680> the

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
knob and replaced it each time with the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.720 
knob and replaced it each time with the
two<00:01:40.370> knobs<00:01:41.360> close<00:01:41.690> together<00:01:42.040> which<00:01:43.040> I<00:01:43.310> rode

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
two knobs close together which I rode

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.180 
two knobs close together which I rode
that<00:01:43.880> tire<00:01:44.150> I<00:01:44.480> don't<00:01:45.080> own<00:01:45.290> them<00:01:45.530> but<00:01:45.950> I<00:01:45.980> have

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
that tire I don't own them but I have

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.410 
that tire I don't own them but I have
test<00:01:46.490> rotem<00:01:46.790> to<00:01:46.880> see<00:01:47.030> if<00:01:47.120> there<00:01:47.240> was<00:01:47.360> a

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
test rotem to see if there was a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.210 
test rotem to see if there was a
difference<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.080> I<00:01:48.380> personally<00:01:48.950> couldn't

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
difference and I personally couldn't

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.310 
difference and I personally couldn't
tell<00:01:49.460> one<00:01:49.700> way<00:01:49.790> or<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:49.909> other<00:01:49.970> other<00:01:50.930> than<00:01:51.200> the

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
tell one way or the other other than the

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.480 
tell one way or the other other than the
fact<00:01:51.440> that<00:01:51.620> it<00:01:51.770> might<00:01:51.920> have<00:01:52.040> even<00:01:52.220> had<00:01:52.460> a

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
fact that it might have even had a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.190 
fact that it might have even had a
little<00:01:52.730> bit<00:01:52.880> better<00:01:53.060> braking<00:01:53.750> traction

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
little bit better braking traction

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.430 
little bit better braking traction
because<00:01:54.950> by<00:01:55.550> replacing<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.210> single<00:01:56.540> knob<00:01:56.690> it

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
because by replacing the single knob it

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.380 
because by replacing the single knob it
actually<00:01:57.770> gains<00:01:58.640> a<00:01:58.790> little<00:01:59.000> more<00:01:59.150> biting

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
actually gains a little more biting

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.800 
actually gains a little more biting
edges<00:01:59.659> for<00:02:00.159> braking<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:01.370> turning<00:02:01.630> so<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:02.690> may

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
edges for braking and turning so it may

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.230 
edges for braking and turning so it may
actually<00:02:02.900> be<00:02:03.200> even<00:02:03.770> a<00:02:03.860> little<00:02:03.890> bit<00:02:04.340> better<00:02:04.909> in

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
actually be even a little bit better in

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.130 
actually be even a little bit better in
that<00:02:05.990> traction<00:02:06.530> department<00:02:07.190> while<00:02:08.140> taking

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
that traction department while taking

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.199 
that traction department while taking
away<00:02:09.379> a<00:02:09.409> little<00:02:09.739> bit<00:02:09.890> more<00:02:10.190> of<00:02:10.519> the<00:02:10.759> rolling

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
away a little bit more of the rolling

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.460 
away a little bit more of the rolling
ability<00:02:12.340> now<00:02:13.340> this<00:02:13.610> is<00:02:13.970> not<00:02:14.390> like<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.750> Nano<00:02:15.110> it

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
ability now this is not like the Nano it

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.610 
ability now this is not like the Nano it
is<00:02:15.860> not<00:02:16.129> a<00:02:16.159> superlight<00:02:17.030> tire<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:18.080> Nano<00:02:18.260> Raptor

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
is not a superlight tire the Nano Raptor

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.259 
is not a superlight tire the Nano Raptor
actually<00:02:18.980> gets<00:02:19.159> down<00:02:19.310> around<00:02:19.519> 500<00:02:20.030> grams

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
actually gets down around 500 grams

nano<00:03:08.150> i<00:03:09.459> prefer<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.489> WCB<00:03:11.000> combination

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:11.689

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.229 
nano i prefer the WCB combination
because<00:03:11.840> i<00:03:12.169> think<00:03:12.889> that<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.250> moto<00:03:13.760> actually

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
because i think that the moto actually

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.839 
because i think that the moto actually
bites<00:03:14.480> a<00:03:14.629> little<00:03:14.870> better<00:03:15.099> than<00:03:16.099> the<00:03:16.549> noveck

all<00:03:17.030> again<00:03:17.329> that's<00:03:17.510> personal<00:03:17.959> preference

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
all again that's personal preference

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
and this certainly is that again

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.360 
and this certainly is that again

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
remember I can recommend it

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.510
