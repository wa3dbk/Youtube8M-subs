00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:32.189
 a First, from the Huawei bar 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:34.760
 For example wavefront is rice words of fiction emerged is the radar professional of the same rubber as the professional 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.120
 In the arts is a bag 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:43.489
 Tenaji 64 This is a little 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:45.579
 Since pitched was got from a friend not be in there was Do I got from one of my friends fairness 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.670
 No spirits pressure 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.850

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.890

 There is already some trouble Yes 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.190
 What this is getting tired 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.990
 The blade is thick and it feels very hard to hit 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.930
 Really soft 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:12.780
 I'm flying but it 's not easy to call 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.780
 It's a medium pen but it's not so easy 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:21.270
 I feel getting a little I guess I specifically to difficult to use 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.560
 I it was a 12000 I quite was high but wonder if hard little use to me specifically 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.600
 It is a feeling 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.100
 But well 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.250
 It was really tower 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.520
 Use motorcycle seat 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.340
 I think this is fine 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.780
 Nde I is a fine rotation type 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:43.759
 Or the counter was in the rotation mainstream Do Nde Well after all violin 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:48.530
 It was the first time, so this was a hard turn 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:52.900
 Though it was easy to do with ordinary block and it was easy to fly 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:58.270
 So I think it is okay to throw that 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:01.750
 People who say that hard rackets should be hard and hard 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.860
 This chinese Yu Yu lc with 10 volumes 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.860
 I think it is better to use 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:15.840
 Nor I have been to quite rain Thank you for your viewing this time 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.989
 I think it's time to change the professional rubber when I introduce you this time 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.500
 Do you not know if it is possible at the end ended up there is also a medium barrel anymore 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:26.650
