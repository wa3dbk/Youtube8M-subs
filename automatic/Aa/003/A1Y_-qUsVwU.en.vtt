 it will be later and to start 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.130
 we will need to research 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.400
 has to still explore we need 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.960
 there will be a bookshelf 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.510
 click on it with the right mouse button and 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.770
 Valya in magic she gets right on me

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.090
 of magic

 all that needles we can learn and all that 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.729
 no glow we will have to open 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.270
 remember when then when 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.409
 studied this ring also appeared such 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.799
 bug stealth i am a random battle i was going 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.769
 just clicked on spells and saw 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.280
 that I had an achivka again see 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.630
 and there is no 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.100
 but somehow I just appeared okay 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.810
 what to denounce the study to us 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:26.160
 will need 2 sand star craft by you 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.290
 craft and you and see on your own rights 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.690
 steel in any only place for you 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:39.130
 but this is not a lot of craft yet 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:43.200
 caps we can take two kinds possible 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.910
 say these so here it is he got 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.290
 onion vegetables which adds this mod 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:53.290
 possible in our old way basically i 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.980
 I do not think that there is a difference and the same 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.500
 the most happened and if the visit itself also 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.790
 it will turn out from sateen 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:08.980
 here we get an ink older letter 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:11.680
 what else we click with the right mouse button and 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.790
 mule what happens our table 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.370
 transformed 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.709
 click on it with the right mouse button and 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.920
 what we see this will be our table 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:26.010
 research for him we need 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.010
 God could have been taken 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:34.830
 we we put the paper is the bottom slot and now 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:39.300
 I see here there is a method of our learning 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.940
 fast and slow in fast you faster 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.780
 essentially there is a chance a big chance you 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:50.030
 lose the item and in the copper we broom you 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:54.360
 and study it less likely that you 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.990
 I lose items constantly 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.950
 slow 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.400
 now we will study not that or guitar not 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.710
 knew 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.170
 for it we will need the aspect of light and 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.880
 of fire 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:15.500
