00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.820
 Hello friends with you now on and 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.509
 today we will have a battle on the tank t-54 not 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.830
 one is the american medium tank 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.820
 drum which is located on 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.340
 ninth level 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.010
 alternative branch of heavy tanks 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.529
 America a lot I'm not talking about him 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.900
 I will only say a few words and basically 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.109
 I will comment on what is happening in this 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.840
 the battle is not so t-54 they are but in my opinion 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.180
 This is such a hybrid of an average heavy tank. 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.760
 and inherited from heavy tanks 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.040
 t-54 one got all the same more 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.780
 properties than the medium in the first place it 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.390
 quite large dimensions 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.370
 it is just like its size 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.170
 heavy tank and for medium tank y 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.120
 he is too mediocre 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.640
 its maximum speed is only 43 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.020
 kilometers per hour and honestly gaining 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.750
 he is not very eager to her 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.120
 from medium tanks t-54 one got 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.719
 armor well, more precisely, almost its full 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.170
 the absence of 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.510
 I now I said t-54 and e50 which 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.040
 apnul you badly in this patch and gave it 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.010
 very good frontal armor 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.740
 Still, I decided for myself that the T-54 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.840
 we go there is no armor and once again generally 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.040
 don't put on it 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.290
 and apart from armor, also in t-54 one from 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.000
 medium tanks have a weapon breaking through 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.340
 the usual you Baska together 10 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.020
 it's not so much subcaliber 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.960
 projectile together 55 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.720
 point at and what are you saving in this weapon 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.909
 so this is a 4 projectile drum and very 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.799
 good one-time damage 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.650
 390 which means potential damage 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.869
 with drums is almost 1600 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.570
 units and accordingly we take away 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.520
 any tank of the eighth level and if we 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.430
 a little lucky with damage then we can even 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.439
 destroy enemy medium tank 9 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.270
 level and before we continue want 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.270
 show one funny episode 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.780
 Well, I hope the enemy lorraine 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.870
 had fun just like me in 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.750
 This fight I laughed for a long time but what we 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.660
 in the meantime, so we continue the situation 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:30.040
 we are following up with us like ours 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:33.760
 as long as we hold here it is planned your 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.519
 skirmishes on our part and I decide now 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.830
 all the same do not support our st because 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.819
 that a lot of them and go 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.640
 go up 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.400
 the seventh forest and you get so 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.560
 foreseen the possible action of the enemy 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.380
 Foch, he decided to take exactly our 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.459
 sevens from the drums and I'll tell you from him 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.959
 It would almost work out if it were not 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.910
 St. Petersburg in armor with 7 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.910
 and of course I don’t know in detail how 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.040
 they all happened new color by sounds 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.530
 first time all the same foch his rule here 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.530
 the other two times not to drop the seven 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.200
 It did not work out well, and here I am already rolling out 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.660
 and naturally no more chances 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.670
 leave the seven wriggles the mighty all 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.950
 I shoot him again on the tracks and and 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.109
 teaching fuel tanks at the same time 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.109
 your lights up and accordingly we 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.940
 seven that's over my drum and even 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.709
 despite the fact that I missed the first 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.200
 we shot him calmly 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.120
 take away and the enemy becomes one 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.820
 top tank less and it is not 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.329
 just a top tank and this I think is the most 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.910
 dangerous 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.010
 the enemy's top tank rolled back to 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.390
 recharge disappeared from the light and at the same time 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.180
 looked at the mini-map and 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.459
 analyzed the situation top in 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.440
 opponents are starting to push our us 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.150
 almost all were killed wasp 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.940
 so much e100 and out of 3 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.010
 and here on the center is i-7 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.680
 which we urgently need from here 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.250
 I just make it to him 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.980
 behind 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.530
 I shoot new fuel tanks again 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.620
 knock down a caterpillar and met a shot he 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.209
 light up than good tanks with a drum 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.010
 then when so that you can shoot by 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.170
 same fuel tank or in 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.170
 engine or even in the area of ​​the ammunition 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.760
 and about the fact that a few shells in 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.130
 same place let you out 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.690
 respectively 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.030
 increased chance of damaging some 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.610
 module + I still have the first pumped 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.530
 the sniper who gives in my plus 3 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.080
 percent gain chance to hurt 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.570
 module and maybe he's some role in 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.190
 this is also playing and again bye 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.050
 recharge drum was 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.360
 opportunity to look at the minimap 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.330
 evaluate the balance of the enemy forces 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.460
 see where not and are going to go and I 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.150
 for myself decided to take a position here near 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.610
 this house 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.100
 to cover our seven she is now 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.889
 acts as agro she has everything 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.870
 opponents will now go with different 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.030
 sides and try to clamp well here 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.120
 please, we are driving 268 I don’t know 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.180
 why he decided to do absolutely 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.250
 vanshotny dead 150 habibullah and he's in 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.940
 forehead rode on the seven on his four but 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.850
 I do not 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.860
 lurched out of 3 took the position 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.740
 conceived now I shoot and cake 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:16.210
 just like the 268 now she 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.860
 trying to drive in the windows and 7 and t-44 to 44 and 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.919
 he will have no problems but he is fine 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.199
 I saw that I was glowing here and so he 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.300
 had to take this into account two 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.880
 the projectile me was in the drum and I them 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.010
 I let out in a commander's turret on a cake 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.660
 while probably still likely 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.030
 contused for some gunner 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.430
 because for some reason he did not want me 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.070
 shoot even out of sight to his 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.930
 safely finishes that way you 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.190
 for the hasty actions of the enemy to us 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.919
 seven managed to defend 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.229
 the central part of the city and our other 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.630
 St-shki at this time dealt with those 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.760
 who was at the bottom of the map they 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.400
 Well done, they did their job now 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.270
 our main task is to return to help 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.729
 44 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.229
 which already knocks down the capture of the enemy and 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:02.050
 strove for 132 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:04.449
 Well, along the way, you can help our 7 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.900
 who are the weight of the third he 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:07.960
 apparently 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:11.110
 guns do not go down we finish IS-3 and 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:14.110
 rushed to the aid of our 44 hp us 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.760
 allows you to calm calls and even reduce 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.460
 eat shot 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.159
 each of the invaders in this call 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.270
 132 again gets fuel tanks and 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:24.760
 lights up 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.860
 Do not know Toli method is very much driven by the 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.110
 Is this really the first sniper so 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.510
 working well 40 unfortunately 40 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.650
 our die from ferdinand who 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.290
 rolled out on a hill 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.690
 but I leave to our 50 fours master 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.120
 at the mercy of opponents remains 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.250
 Ferdinand alone and naturally common 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.830
 efforts to cope with it will not make 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.720
 no problem well, and this can be 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:50.020
 principle already sum up some 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.940
 the fight turned out pretty good usually 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.820
 on the map shots from this arrest 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.250
 i try to play more passively even on 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.800
 Others I will not like I usually occupy 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.560
 the shelf in the square is not 0 from there good 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.840
 shot through many enemy positions 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.750
 tanks but in this battle I decided so 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:10.720
 play can become aggressive at all 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.880
 t-54 one is very good at it 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.920
 feel the situation then how developing 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.380
 yourself because not possessing a big 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.660
 speed as we assume the same drum 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.510
 Butt you can not dramatically change 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:25.540
 position to call there unexpected enemies with 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.020
 poop either from the board and evict the whole 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.820
 drum 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.530
 here it is necessary to clearly represent where 

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:32.350
 is the enemy how much time is he 

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:34.930
 need to go on it and already from this 

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:37.680
 build my game sorry me so 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:41.170
 so far it turns out not to do so 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.360
 some special results on t-54 one 

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.280
 burning did not achieve 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:48.040
 so on this one the bout comes to an end and 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.140
 let's now move on to the results well 

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.360
