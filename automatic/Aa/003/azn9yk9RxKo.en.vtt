can<00:01:22.079> see<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.469> but<00:01:22.710> right<00:01:22.950> here<00:01:23.479> there<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.899> is

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:25.109 
can see it but right here there this is

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:27.469 
can see it but right here there this is
your<00:01:25.259> volume<00:01:25.770> button<00:01:25.799> as<00:01:26.759> well<00:01:27.030> as<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.210> track

your volume button as well as you track
button<00:01:28.039> and<00:01:31.069> it's<00:01:32.069> a<00:01:32.549> little<00:01:33.450> flimsy<00:01:33.950> but<00:01:34.950> I

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
or get caught in something this could

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.349 
or get caught in something this could
easily<00:01:45.509> break<00:01:45.990> off<00:01:46.670> but<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.240> only

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359

build<00:01:59.310> quality<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:01.200> price<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.859> these<00:02:02.009> was

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350

build quality the price in these was
$39.99<00:02:04.350> when<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.679> got<00:02:04.920> them<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.279> Amazon<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.999> don't

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
$39.99 when I got them on Amazon I don't

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.109 
$39.99 when I got them on Amazon I don't
know<00:02:06.359> why<00:02:06.569> but<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.859> prices<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.490> gone<00:02:08.700> up<00:02:08.759> on

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
know why but the prices have gone up on

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.710 
know why but the prices have gone up on
Amazon<00:02:09.330> right<00:02:10.140> now<00:02:10.439> they're<00:02:11.129> at<00:02:11.340> 59

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
Amazon right now they're at 59

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.230 
Amazon right now they're at 59
but<00:02:13.349> then<00:02:13.470> again<00:02:13.560> those<00:02:13.860> prices<00:02:14.220> could

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
but then again those prices could

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.370 
but then again those prices could
hopefully<00:02:15.570> change<00:02:17.840> aesthetically<00:02:18.840> some

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
hopefully change aesthetically some

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.440 
hopefully change aesthetically some
people<00:02:19.680> may<00:02:19.830> not<00:02:20.610> like<00:02:20.880> these<00:02:21.090> as<00:02:21.270> they<00:02:21.390> do

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
people may not like these as they do

them not that they heard it in the start
it's<00:02:52.890> just<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.670> takes<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:54.060> little<00:02:54.210> time

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
they're not noise isolating so they just

right out and it's not a big deal
battery<00:03:56.820> life<00:03:57.120> on<00:03:57.360> it<00:03:57.390> is<00:03:58.400> pretty<00:03:59.400> close<00:03:59.580> to

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
battery life on it is pretty close to

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.720 
battery life on it is pretty close to
advertised<00:04:00.510> I<00:04:00.900> think<00:04:01.200> it's<00:04:01.320> between<00:04:01.700> five<00:04:02.700> to

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
advertised I think it's between five to

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.720 
advertised I think it's between five to
six<00:04:03.060> hours<00:04:03.900> advertised<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.370> is<00:04:05.520> what<00:04:05.700> I

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
six hours advertised and that is what I

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.970 
six hours advertised and that is what I
get<00:04:05.850> and<00:04:06.240> I<00:04:06.480> have<00:04:06.660> tested<00:04:08.510> I've<00:04:09.510> been<00:04:10.410> playing

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
get and I have tested I've been playing

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.150 
get and I have tested I've been playing
music<00:04:11.370> through<00:04:11.820> them<00:04:12.050> constantly<00:04:13.050> for<00:04:13.410> right

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
music through them constantly for right

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.130 
music through them constantly for right
in<00:04:14.310> there<00:04:14.459> between<00:04:14.640> five<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.120> six<00:04:15.510> hours<00:04:15.840> it

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
in there between five to six hours it

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.170 
in there between five to six hours it
starts<00:04:16.680> beeping<00:04:17.340> when<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.580> battery<00:04:17.880> is<00:04:18.030> about

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
starts beeping when the battery is about

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.789 
starts beeping when the battery is about
to<00:04:18.330> die<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:18.959> then<00:04:19.049> about<00:04:19.200> ten<00:04:19.440> minutes<00:04:19.560> later

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
to die and then about ten minutes later

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.750 
to die and then about ten minutes later
it<00:04:20.040> just<00:04:20.340> shuts<00:04:20.640> itself<00:04:20.970> off<00:04:22.040> so<00:04:23.040> some<00:04:23.610> of<00:04:23.700> the

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
it just shuts itself off so some of the

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.640 
it just shuts itself off so some of the
pros<00:04:24.180> is<00:04:24.540> that<00:04:25.140> it<00:04:25.260> is<00:04:25.350> comfortable

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
pros is that it is comfortable

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.550 
pros is that it is comfortable
especially<00:04:26.520> for<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.260> $39.99

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
especially for the $39.99
