00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.380 
sure you're using the same piece of

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.249 
sure you're using the same piece of
hardware<00:00:02.000> it<00:00:03.000> will<00:00:03.149> basically<00:00:03.300> use<00:00:04.020> that

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
hardware it will basically use that

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.280 
hardware it will basically use that
catalog<00:00:04.859> and<00:00:05.160> reapply<00:00:05.879> those<00:00:06.299> pointers<00:00:07.080> to

to<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:57.240> automate<00:02:57.710> so<00:02:58.710> I'm<00:02:58.770> going<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:58.950> go<00:02:59.070> ahead

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
to to automate so I'm going to go ahead

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.390 
and run this command as an administrator
and<00:03:03.050> for<00:03:04.050> that<00:03:04.080> I<00:03:04.230> need<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.530> go<00:03:05.160> through<00:03:05.310> an

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
and for that I need to go through an

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
and for that I need to go through an
elevation<00:03:05.790> prompt<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.860> now<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:08.100> copies<00:03:08.670> all

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
elevation prompt and now that copies all

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.530 
elevation prompt and now that copies all

of my usmt files to the windows 7 OS in
the<00:03:15.600> windows<00:03:15.900> folder<00:03:17.480> now<00:03:18.480> I'm<00:03:18.540> going<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.750> go

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
the windows folder now I'm going to go

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.010 
the windows folder now I'm going to go
through<00:03:19.080> hard<00:03:19.440> link<00:03:19.740> file<00:03:20.700> migration<00:03:21.240> so

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
through hard link file migration so

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.949 
through hard link file migration so
either<00:03:22.140> approximately<00:03:22.830> twenty<00:03:23.720> twenty<00:03:24.720> six

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
either approximately twenty twenty six

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.860 
either approximately twenty twenty six
gigs<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.410> files<00:03:25.700> in<00:03:26.700> both<00:03:27.209> visible<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:27.780> hidden

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
gigs of files in both visible and hidden

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.890 
gigs of files in both visible and hidden
folders<00:03:28.970> about<00:03:29.970> ten<00:03:30.270> thousand<00:03:30.720> five<00:03:30.870> hundred

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
folders about ten thousand five hundred

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.340 
folders about ten thousand five hundred
or<00:03:31.290> so<00:03:31.350> files<00:03:31.770> total<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.900> now<00:03:34.020> i'm<00:03:34.140> migrating

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
or so files total and now i'm migrating

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.440 
or so files total and now i'm migrating
all<00:03:35.070> of<00:03:35.340> those<00:03:35.459> files<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.120> all<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.300> those

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
all of those files and all of those

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.170 
all of those files and all of those
folders<00:03:36.959> into<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.650> windows<00:03:38.010> 7<00:03:38.580> operating

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
folders into the windows 7 operating

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.840 
folders into the windows 7 operating
system<00:03:39.690> so<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:40.680> will<00:03:40.830> run<00:03:41.070> for<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.430> few

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
system so this will run for a few

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.500 
system so this will run for a few
minutes<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:43.490> basically<00:03:44.490> do<00:03:44.880> something<00:03:45.360> and

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
minutes and basically do something and

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.000 
minutes and basically do something and
within<00:03:45.750> a<00:03:45.930> few<00:03:46.140> minutes<00:03:46.350> that<00:03:46.740> would<00:03:46.860> have

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
within a few minutes that would have

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.750 
within a few minutes that would have
taken<00:03:47.540> several<00:03:48.540> hours<00:03:49.050> to<00:03:49.980> do<00:03:50.130> if<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.459> were<00:03:50.550> to

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
taken several hours to do if you were to

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.890 
taken several hours to do if you were to
save<00:03:50.970> those<00:03:51.240> files<00:03:51.570> off<00:03:52.020> to<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:52.890> share<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.490> then

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
save those files off to a share and then

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.040 
save those files off to a share and then
back<00:03:54.900> onto<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:56.180> natively<00:03:57.180> installed<00:03:57.630> windows

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
back onto the natively installed windows

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.170 
back onto the natively installed windows
7<00:03:58.410> LS<00:04:00.800> now<00:04:01.800> obviously<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.370> process<00:04:02.820> would<00:04:03.000> be

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
7 LS now obviously that process would be

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.110 
7 LS now obviously that process would be
faster<00:04:03.630> if<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.900> copied<00:04:04.380> those<00:04:05.370> files<00:04:05.730> out<00:04:06.090> of

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
faster if you copied those files out of

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.590 
faster if you copied those files out of
windows<00:04:06.990> titled<00:04:07.350> add<00:04:07.680> into<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.600> user

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
windows titled add into the user

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.900 
windows titled add into the user
accounts<00:04:10.110> but<00:04:10.500> it<00:04:10.950> would<00:04:11.130> require<00:04:11.310> you<00:04:11.730> to

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
accounts but it would require you to

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.650 
accounts but it would require you to
then<00:04:12.060> go<00:04:12.360> out<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:13.489> remap<00:04:14.489> basically<00:04:15.390> things

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
then go out and remap basically things

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.280 
then go out and remap basically things
like<00:04:15.900> PST<00:04:16.470> files<00:04:16.770> in<00:04:17.100> your<00:04:17.130> in<00:04:17.580> your<00:04:17.640> outlook

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
like PST files in your in your outlook

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.170 
like PST files in your in your outlook
instance<00:04:19.290> or<00:04:19.590> any<00:04:20.459> other<00:04:20.669> application

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
instance or any other application

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.719 
instance or any other application
settings<00:04:21.630> that<00:04:22.350> you<00:04:22.380> would<00:04:22.620> want<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:23.010> maintain

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
settings that you would want to maintain

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:31.320 
settings that you would want to maintain
on<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:25.229> new<00:04:25.410> PC

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.180 

so<00:04:32.330> they're<00:04:32.480> my<00:04:32.630> desktop

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
so they're my desktop

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:44.610 
so they're my desktop
icons<00:04:33.430> have<00:04:33.670> migrated<00:04:34.150> there<00:04:43.050> we<00:04:44.050> have<00:04:44.230> it<00:04:44.260> so

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
icons have migrated there we have it so

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.350 
icons have migrated there we have it so

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.940 
operation now let's go ahead and run a
couple<00:04:49.570> of<00:04:49.780> tests<00:04:50.170> to<00:04:50.290> make<00:04:50.410> sure<00:04:50.470> that<00:04:50.800> my

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
couple of tests to make sure that my

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.920 
couple of tests to make sure that my

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
data was indeed migrated first I'm going

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.830 
data was indeed migrated first I'm going
to<00:04:53.050> go<00:04:53.140> into<00:04:53.290> documents<00:04:53.710> and<00:04:54.300> you'll<00:04:55.300> see<00:04:55.570> that

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
to go into documents and you'll see that

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.490 
to go into documents and you'll see that
I've<00:04:56.350> got<00:04:56.410> all<00:04:56.800> of<00:04:56.830> my<00:04:57.120> documents<00:04:58.500> migrated

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
I've got all of my documents migrated

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.080 
and you'll see that all all of the 26
plus<00:05:43.660> gigabytes<00:05:44.200> of<00:05:44.440> information<00:05:45.090> was

demonstration<00:05:54.100> of<00:05:54.400> us<00:05:54.730> Mt<00:05:55.120> and<00:05:56.050> how<00:05:56.230> that<00:05:56.290> can

demonstration of us Mt and how that can

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.700 
demonstration of us Mt and how that can
be<00:05:56.770> used<00:05:57.010> with<00:05:57.160> the<00:05:57.460> offline<00:05:58.710> migration

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710
