00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
withdraw 1800 k uh now a big thing in my

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.069 
withdraw 1800 k uh now a big thing in my
last<00:01:47.590> price<00:01:47.860> checks<00:01:48.159> I<00:01:48.340> didn't<00:01:48.729> add<00:01:48.880> in<00:01:49.299> the

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
last price checks I didn't add in the

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.160 
last price checks I didn't add in the
runes<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:50.710> I<00:01:51.460> do<00:01:51.579> have<00:01:51.880> 4k<00:01:52.240> each<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.049> the

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
runes and I do have 4k each and the

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.200 
runes and I do have 4k each and the
reason<00:01:53.469> is<00:01:53.590> because<00:01:53.740> there<00:01:54.070> is<00:01:54.219> a<00:01:54.250> there's<00:01:55.060> an

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
reason is because there is a there's an

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.870 
reason is because there is a there's an
autumn<00:01:55.479> out<00:01:55.600> left<00:01:55.869> in<00:01:55.990> my<00:01:56.079> bank<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:56.710> when<00:01:57.579> I<00:01:57.609> by

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
autumn out left in my bank and when I by

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.389 
autumn out left in my bank and when I by
runes<00:01:58.299> I<00:01:58.630> I<00:01:58.930> haven't<00:01:59.530> used<00:01:59.680> ruins<00:02:00.009> recently

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
runes I I haven't used ruins recently

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.580 
runes I I haven't used ruins recently
the<00:02:00.520> only<00:02:00.729> runes<00:02:00.909> that<00:02:01.000> I've<00:02:01.149> used<00:02:01.509> were<00:02:02.109> some

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
the only runes that I've used were some

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.740 
the only runes that I've used were some
blood<00:02:02.859> runes<00:02:03.130> for<00:02:03.250> that<00:02:03.549> for<00:02:04.359> the<00:02:04.420> 1<00:02:04.570> money

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
blood runes for that for the 1 money

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.719 
blood runes for that for the 1 money
making<00:02:04.810> guide<00:02:05.049> other<00:02:05.829> than<00:02:06.039> that<00:02:06.130> I<00:02:06.399> have<00:02:06.490> not

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
making guide other than that I have not

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.169 
making guide other than that I have not
used<00:02:07.000> any<00:02:07.240> ruins<00:02:07.630> so<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:09.009> only<00:02:09.310> possibility

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
used any ruins so the only possibility

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.380 
used any ruins so the only possibility
is<00:02:10.500> for<00:02:11.500> these<00:02:12.070> runes<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.880> be<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.120> roots<00:02:13.270> like

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
is for these runes to be the roots like

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.000 
is for these runes to be the roots like
a<00:02:13.480> few<00:02:13.780> because<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.260> don't<00:02:14.410> know<00:02:14.470> where<00:02:14.710> else<00:02:14.860> it

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
a few because I don't know where else it

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.560 
a few because I don't know where else it
came<00:02:15.340> from<00:02:15.460> because<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.730> haven't<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.390> haven't

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
came from because I haven't I haven't

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.100 
came from because I haven't I haven't
bought<00:02:16.990> in<00:02:17.110> any<00:02:17.230> room<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:18.810> it's<00:02:19.810> really<00:02:19.960> not

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
bought in any room so it's really not

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.180 
bought in any room so it's really not
that<00:02:20.200> big<00:02:20.350> of<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.500> deal<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:20.860> know<00:02:20.980> I'm<00:02:21.040> not

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
that big of a deal you know I'm not

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.400 
that big of a deal you know I'm not
trying<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.580> give<00:02:22.450> myself<00:02:22.600> any<00:02:22.990> advantage

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
trying to give myself any advantage

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.690 
trying to give myself any advantage
because<00:02:23.530> even<00:02:23.800> if<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:23.980> didn't<00:02:24.280> get<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.520> was

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
because even if I didn't get it was

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.760 
because even if I didn't get it was
already<00:02:24.910> my<00:02:25.060> bank<00:02:25.330> well<00:02:26.020> technically<00:02:26.560> it's

already my bank well technically it's

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.620 
already my bank well technically it's
still<00:02:26.830> not<00:02:27.010> profit<00:02:27.460> so<00:02:27.640> it's<00:02:27.850> just<00:02:28.090> it's<00:02:28.360> fine

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
still not profit so it's just it's fine

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.140 
still not profit so it's just it's fine
they<00:02:29.590> they<00:02:29.860> have<00:02:30.070> to<00:02:30.190> be<00:02:30.280> from<00:02:30.400> qbd<00:02:30.760> there's<00:02:30.970> no

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
they they have to be from qbd there's no

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.460 
they they have to be from qbd there's no
other<00:02:31.270> way<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.660> they<00:02:31.780> could<00:02:31.840> have<00:02:32.080> imagined

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
other way that they could have imagined

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.190 
other way that they could have imagined
alee<00:02:32.590> appeared<00:02:32.830> in<00:02:32.920> my<00:02:32.980> bank<00:02:33.190> so<00:02:33.490> uh<00:02:34.060> so<00:02:34.600> far<00:02:34.990> we

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
alee appeared in my bank so uh so far we

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.290 
alee appeared in my bank so uh so far we
got<00:02:35.320> almost<00:02:35.770> 10<00:02:36.100> mil<00:02:36.280> I'm<00:02:36.430> gonna<00:02:36.610> say<00:02:36.940> we're<00:02:37.180> at

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
got almost 10 mil I'm gonna say we're at

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.410 
got almost 10 mil I'm gonna say we're at
like<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:38.370> think<00:02:39.370> last<00:02:39.550> episode<00:02:39.910> was<00:02:39.970> like<00:02:40.090> 12

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
like I think last episode was like 12

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.850 
like I think last episode was like 12
mil<00:02:40.660> so<00:02:40.840> hopefully<00:02:41.440> like<00:02:41.850> 16<00:02:42.850> 17<00:02:43.240> mil<00:02:44.140> that

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
mil so hopefully like 16 17 mil that

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.430 
mil so hopefully like 16 17 mil that
would<00:02:44.980> be<00:02:45.130> nice<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:46.510> think<00:02:47.050> we<00:02:47.170> should<00:02:47.200> be<00:02:47.380> able

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
would be nice I think we should be able

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.220 
would be nice I think we should be able
to<00:02:47.620> beat<00:02:47.800> that<00:02:47.980> if<00:02:48.250> not<00:02:48.580> well<00:02:48.940> then<00:02:49.090> joke's<00:02:50.050> on

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
to beat that if not well then joke's on

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.970 
to beat that if not well then joke's on
me<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.760> let's<00:02:51.910> add<00:02:52.090> these<00:02:52.330> in<00:02:52.690> these<00:02:53.200> sexy<00:02:53.710> logs

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780
