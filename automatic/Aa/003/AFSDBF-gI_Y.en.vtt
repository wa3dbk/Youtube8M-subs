really really awesome news in my opinion

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.500 
really really awesome news in my opinion
I<00:00:31.489> have<00:00:32.489> always<00:00:32.669> thought<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.030> they<00:00:33.300> should

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
I have always thought that they should

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.510 
I have always thought that they should
be<00:00:33.540> like<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:34.200> some<00:00:34.350> kind<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.620> hostile<00:00:35.040> mob<00:00:35.250> in

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
be like it's some kind of hostile mob in

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.790 
be like it's some kind of hostile mob in
the<00:00:35.670> waters<00:00:36.059> because<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:37.230> know<00:00:37.350> there<00:00:37.530> isn't

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
the waters because you know there isn't

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.650 
the waters because you know there isn't
really<00:00:37.950> anything<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.790> can<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.480> can

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
really anything that you can that can

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.740 
really anything that you can that can
hurt<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.040> water<00:00:41.750> obviously

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
hurt you in the in the water obviously

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.840 
hurt you in the in the water obviously
because<00:00:42.870> there's<00:00:43.170> only<00:00:43.260> squids<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.760> know

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
because there's only squids so you know

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.889 
because there's only squids so you know
they<00:00:45.000> didn't<00:00:45.180> really<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.420> anything<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.750> do

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
they didn't really do anything to do

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.840 
they didn't really do anything to do
their<00:00:46.050> passive<00:00:46.410> mobs<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:46.980> they<00:00:47.370> don't<00:00:47.550> attack

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
their passive mobs so they don't attack

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.880 
their passive mobs so they don't attack
you<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.329> would<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.110> been<00:00:49.260> cool<00:00:49.500> if<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.739> was<00:00:49.800> a

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
you I would have been cool if it was a

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.590 
you I would have been cool if it was a
shark<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.879> first<00:00:51.090> thing<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.300> came<00:00:51.539> to

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
shark but the first thing that came to

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.170 
shark but the first thing that came to
my<00:00:51.809> mind<00:00:51.840> was<00:00:52.140> over<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.739> dolphin<00:00:53.250> or<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:54.090> going

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
my mind was over a dolphin or it's going

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.430 
my mind was over a dolphin or it's going
to<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> new<00:00:54.600> boss<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.079> I'd<00:00:55.170> be<00:00:55.289> really

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
to be a new boss that I'd be really

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.439 
to be a new boss that I'd be really
awesome<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:56.010> was<00:00:56.160> thinking<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.670> maybe<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
awesome I was thinking of maybe the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.700 
awesome I was thinking of maybe the
Kraken<00:00:57.899> if<00:00:58.050> you've<00:00:58.170> ever<00:00:58.320> heard<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
Kraken if you've ever heard of the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.340 
Kraken if you've ever heard of the
Kraken<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.340> will<00:01:00.059> put<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.300> picture<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.930> looks

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.709 
Kraken I will put a picture up it looks
absolutely<00:01:01.770> awesome<00:01:02.180> it<00:01:03.180> probably<00:01:03.480> won't<00:01:03.660> be

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
absolutely awesome it probably won't be

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.630

that<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.710> know<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.010> that's<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.460> one

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
