00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 and we are with the one that came to me in pink 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.269
 divine combines with everything now that 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.509
 You are in the bar with my little picture 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.790
 try barbarian but I love the idea 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.949
 to do something contemporary 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.900
 yes because my daughters told me not mom 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.140
 That tiger quoted I do not want that 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.019
 neither does he want to lie in honor of the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.320
 realistic painting do not want well modern 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.630
 against great but also let's see 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.790
 now all the textures to invite 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.010
 glasses of the sea ​​tele of everything 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.110
 that but there are a lot of textures of 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.690
 spectacular and a color image that 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.030
 I like to read part of something that is 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.050
 very fashionable even though it is a 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.100
 journal technique year 1930 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.100
 in an attack 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.980
 by half of wood 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.140
 Of course, this form is increasing 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.630
 they form the flower that we have in the center 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.110
 They are made of wood and have a higher to lower 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.450
 so that it has a certain volume not 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.590
 we can not pretend good either 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.150
 question is that we are going to 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.750
 start for example this is the 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.840
 little leaf making different shapes a 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.840
 centric angle this technique has a lot 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.840
 white and a lot of black for example already 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.680
 we can paint this black and so we go 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.710
 turning of wavy shapes and 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.890
 ways that we want to always give you the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.460
 idea that the laterals are going to be 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:43.270
 painted in full green full color that 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.690
 it's full is painting as it comes out of the pot 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.229
 here the issue is full painting and 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.930
 then as I leave the center 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.060
 the rather white flower all 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.610
 colors are going to go around for example 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.390
 I made this eye very well then what do I do 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.490
 I'm just going to 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:07.000
 to my eye 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.000
 because everything is outlined we go 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.000
 and doing as for example here is 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.610
 so good 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.440
 then around that they painted us 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.450
 let's paint with a color and I chose the 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.130
 green because it was a color that was not 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.410
 in everything he had done 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.390
 these delineated go to the end you 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.360
 think they have to decide the 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.930
 good colors this is all flat 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.410
 really does not have any science go 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.280
 painting like this a second hand too 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.750
 it comes well 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.459
 that's all there is to paintings 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.080
 techniques on glasses are always 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.850
 exciting I tell you because when 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.340
 We put the videos on YouTube with the 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.050
 techniques on glass the pages then 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.270
 it can be done for windows for another 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.330
 type of genres decorated ears for 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.310
 But whatever the idea is to invite 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.140
 those glasses that exist that exist 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.700
 clear very well and with these products 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.239
 divine monitor that are the 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.910
 dimensional and tell them, then the 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.110
 people always ask how to work with 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.110
 dimensions so let's go 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.920
 well now let's decorate the glass what 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.079
 what we have to do is different 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.500
 textures let's imitate the 'crack' it 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.569
 we will call on a line that mars 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.329
 call and we're also going to do one thing 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.370
 new that today I frost but before 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.530
 we need just that which we 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.150
 let us do the divisions 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:40.200
 how are we going to do with 3d monitor 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.200
 let's draw the lines and what not 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:48.019
 usual but really good is to draw 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.180
 what with a rule we support on the edge and 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:54.599
 we passed the with the rule if we want 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.010
 we make another line more this is for 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.230
 when we want to put for example the 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.590
 capital in the middle when we have 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.800
 we already spent six hours we are going to 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.880
 do 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.400
 our product has already run and you 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.100
 we apply folk over look here 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.440
 that I did as a few drops 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.500
 they are also in the finished and those 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:24.410
 droplets we will also achieve what 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:27.890
 long they take the hair that the silver 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:31.790
 look for example we do like this and 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:36.410
 we raise I do not know if it comes close to see 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:38.289
 now let's do with sizing what 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.039
 that it's called 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:45.789
 the marte line that actually in the 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:48.580
 reality or when glass is like that 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:52.449
 really with that name is because the 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:55.129
 glass what is is hammered and then 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:58.009
 put back in the oven 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:00.739
 that's why it stays that way then this 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:03.559
 It is our imitation of Mars line 

00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:07.249
 when it is dry, it is transparent 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:09.949
 frost from where this same one is taken 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:13.159
 texture and it dried up that I needed 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.589
 the glass that I made take it out with this 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:18.080
 gadget 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:20.179
 and get the letters I'm going to throw 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.080
 to the reserved to highlight although the 

00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:25.849
 applies is applied with three-dimensional 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.189
 three-dimensional remember is a product 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.540
 what author and sail we go well 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:33.330
 up to the edges 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.100
 the auto product levels that's why it's 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.800
 so good to do everything 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.630
 glass invitation in short 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.470
 we are making an invitation 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.390
 in vitro we are going to make a little bit and 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.320
 Lets put 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.720
 the frost 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:53.230
 here we put less because as we have 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.990
 So I did not want wet will take 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.240
 up there spectacular and I'm going 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.060
 arranging so that it is stuck is 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.120
 three-dimensional is a varnish in 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:07.360
 definitive also because for example I 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:10.210
 I finished the flower by giving him a hand 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.460
 three-dimensional here we will see the flower 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.980
 because it's great how it was with a 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.150
 first three-dimensional hand like 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:21.930
 April shine that gives the flower 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.930
 spectacular I loved it 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.770
 yes 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.770
 The technique 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:53.490
 I loved this monitor manufactures the 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.370
 most complete line of products for 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.220

 standing out for its excellent relationship 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.180
 price-quality order products 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.070
