more<00:02:13.580> for<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.450> point<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.080> Janowicz<00:02:15.769> he<00:02:16.130> he

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
more for the point and Janowicz he he

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.120 
more for the point and Janowicz he he
goes<00:02:17.150> most<00:02:17.810> of<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.050> times<00:02:18.260> he<00:02:18.500> wants<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:18.890> make

a<00:02:22.880> completely<00:02:23.269> different<00:02:23.480> match<00:02:23.810> but<00:02:24.170> i<00:02:25.070> think

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
a completely different match but i think

a completely different match but i think
either<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:28.070> them<00:02:28.220> is<00:02:28.340> going<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.579> be<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:29.209> nice

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
either of them is going to be a nice

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.930 
either of them is going to be a nice
