when<00:01:41.330> we<00:01:41.420> make<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:41.720> shell<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.229> there's<00:01:42.470> no

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
when we make the shell so there's no

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.980 
when we make the shell so there's no
there's<00:01:43.430> no<00:01:43.550> inner<00:01:43.880> tension<00:01:44.360> that's<00:01:44.540> put<00:01:44.840> on
