composers had written Mickey Mouse many

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.560 
composers had written Mickey Mouse many
hundreds<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.070> years<00:02:11.160> ago<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:12.090> know<00:02:12.150> maybe<00:02:12.390> up

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
hundreds of years ago you know maybe up

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.630 
hundreds of years ago you know maybe up
to<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.780> present<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.350> wanted<00:02:13.829> for<00:02:13.920> example<00:02:14.340> if

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
to the present I wanted for example if

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.910 
to the present I wanted for example if
Johann<00:02:15.329> Sebastian<00:02:15.510> Bach<00:02:15.930> or<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.470> would<00:02:16.829> it

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
Johann Sebastian Bach or it would it

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:41.920 
Johann Sebastian Bach or it would it
sounds<00:02:17.190> something<00:02:17.400> like<00:02:17.549> this

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:56.220 

you

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230

or<00:02:57.610> Vulcan<00:02:58.610> Amadeus<00:02:59.120> Mozart

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.180 

and<00:03:42.730> this<00:03:43.720> last<00:03:44.050> one<00:03:44.230> probably<00:03:44.680> needs<00:03:45.010> no

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
and this last one probably needs no

00:03:45.190 --> 00:04:01.110 
and this last one probably needs no
