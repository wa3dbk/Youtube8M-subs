00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.350
 what we are going to do now this famous percent in goods 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:11.940
 panel of this type the one that has two great-granddaughters standing 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:15.629
 let's put this Friday 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:17.650
 in two steps 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.739
 the ere that is basically 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:21.099
 the first thing is 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.890
 open the eyes of a person we throw at the edge of the evening 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.819
 Wolf 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.720
 let's adopt the agreement 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.220
 Dollars 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.340
 and continues with a profile 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.830
 I like this way more want any other to put it because 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.530
 alonso much more 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.810
 let's see a scare 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.310
 for the Israelis 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.830
 to read well as I call phosphate all your funds 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.290
 we started 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.140
 leaving little 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.140
 only for 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.130
 we are going to manage borderlands 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.930
 with a losing edge 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.430
 for him 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.140
 let's start to twist 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.380
 l 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.720
 fair 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.170
 where we have this brand 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.770
 I see where dumb 10 barbosa sew the first cause 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.760
 hayden 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.790
 and this we are going to do 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.820
 we can take with the electoral pil and is all the seam or lose 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.500
 it is far the best place to 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.310
 the ere 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.670
 the works the truth 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.580
 I go I think it's putting everything in the first set 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.820
 has its benefits 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.220
 because we make sure that mediator thrives 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.130
 i stretch from the web 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.860
 but yes and they feel like others are 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.640
 and impossible Jorge Noguera 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.390
 / his wife 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.680
 to begin 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.680
 simply by finishing 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.079
 a little 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.079
 profile 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.959
 despite the marker 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.129
 I notice that I have to defend 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.309
 now 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:27.239
 I have to go assuring him 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.099
 of thin g Ã¡lvaro 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.459
 due to the rupture 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.659
 is not to say to delibes 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.659
 Cecilio 10 weeks 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.159
 that the blockade of goods is done 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.399
 We can not lose 

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:47.399
 and I tel we are checking 2012 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.799
 italy and to those who make sure that in the armchair they were bovo just 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.689
 s this double cd tenerife 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.319
 when we got to know the truth 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:15.249
 we cut the 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.979
 here we have 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.599
 now let's do is 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.179
 We are gonna give 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:25.189
 of mud 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:26.069
 on Friday 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.959
 so he has added 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.619
 and later 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:33.449
 let's take all this 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:34.779
 do what 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:36.899
 We are going to double on Friday 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:38.079
 i 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.439
 we have to make sure that 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.559
 this next consul 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:46.559
 with the vice-governor 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:49.669
 arrive on Friday 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.589
 charge 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:57.369
 the luck I answer valparaiso to be surpassed by the iess 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:02.069
 over 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.479
 let's achieve it 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.479
 above the arch 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.209
 so it does not look 

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:17.639
 so 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.309
 just wait 

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:22.049
 that is not the best 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.049
 that's why it was translated into ferrer 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.950
 products one subject's real name the other 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.580
 We are going to weigh or be 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.749
 remarked 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:37.069
 and let's go 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:38.419
 aware 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:39.930
 I achieve it 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.400
 account access from outside 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.059
 the Cordovan 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:48.229
 a ball to the goal post 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.229
 I want to show things 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.349
 this posture 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.349
 that is to say the closest to the moment 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.210
 / ap the state 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.740
 could against the athletic 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.029
 and now 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:10.580
 I have to go 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.580
 fernando lopez and 10 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.550
 the jury of the prizes 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:31.460
 finished 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.279
 we'll see 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:35.309
 this August 10 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:37.080
 the cirque du soleil 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.949
 loneliness that the patient 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:41.770
 much better 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.610
 now 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:43.790
 but I liked it 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.870
 by the following 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.310
 as we have known it first on Friday arancibia 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:51.949
 in a radio interview 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.279
 take out valters we have 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:57.309
 the tour results in when we double 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:06:00.809
 and injured the edge of the ten with the solar 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:04.439
 that we have below ng 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.259
 the members of the psoe 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:09.289
 and what happens what 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.020
 when we pass when answering 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.020
 from infocampo ariza 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.000
 for sanz to saw lamp 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.240
 outstanding 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.240
 we have quite the most regular 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.259
 and from behind 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:31.229
 they also exploded a lot better 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:32.430
 here 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.880
 if the humor posture comes out a little 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.610
 although for me it is necessary to follow the steps 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.900
 efe 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.589
 it's a little more work 

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:47.910
 I think so 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:48.530
 what the fuck
