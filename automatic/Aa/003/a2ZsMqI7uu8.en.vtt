I<00:00:41.790> really<00:00:42.790> think<00:00:43.060> it<00:00:43.210> at<00:00:43.570> this<00:00:43.780> point<00:00:43.989> I<00:00:44.170> well

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
I really think it at this point I well

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.460 
I really think it at this point I well
maybe<00:00:44.770> the<00:00:44.980> judges<00:00:45.370> wanted<00:00:46.360> to<00:00:46.510> seven<00:00:46.900> I<00:00:47.050> think

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
maybe the judges wanted to seven I think

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.220 
maybe the judges wanted to seven I think
at<00:00:47.590> this<00:00:47.770> point<00:00:47.920> I<00:00:48.489> think<00:00:49.330> either<00:00:49.690> is<00:00:49.840> fine<00:00:49.960> I

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
at this point I think either is fine I

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.500 
at this point I think either is fine I
think<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:50.920> six<00:00:51.220> is<00:00:51.400> fine<00:00:51.640> I<00:00:51.670> think<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.150> seven

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
think the six is fine I think the seven

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.479 
think the six is fine I think the seven
is<00:00:52.629> fine<00:00:52.840> after<00:00:53.320> seeing<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:53.860> footage<00:00:54.070> where

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
is fine after seeing the footage where

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.189 
is fine after seeing the footage where
it's<00:00:54.610> pretty<00:00:54.850> much<00:00:55.120> right<00:00:55.300> in<00:00:55.330> between<00:00:55.540> I<00:00:55.989> mean

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
it's pretty much right in between I mean

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.460 
it's pretty much right in between I mean
we've<00:00:56.530> got<00:00:57.000> Sophie<00:00:58.000> still<00:00:58.540> on<00:00:58.720> top<00:00:58.989> and<00:00:59.320> she

we've got Sophie still on top and she

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.350 
we've got Sophie still on top and she
did<00:00:59.650> the<00:00:59.800> six<00:01:00.129> and<00:01:00.460> then<00:01:00.550> I've<00:01:00.670> got<00:01:00.910> Sydney

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:22.680 
point I think that you know they just
want<00:01:10.780> to<00:01:10.930> see<00:01:11.050> it<00:01:11.140> done<00:01:11.290> well

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
knock one down and really thinking about

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:43.880

a<00:02:04.560> little<00:02:04.740> bit<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:06.780> know<00:02:06.870> maybe<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.410> little

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
a little bit you know maybe a little

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.499 
a little bit you know maybe a little
hunched<00:02:08.190> over<00:02:08.310> lets<00:02:08.729> his<00:02:08.850> legs<00:02:09.060> slide<00:02:09.270> back<00:02:09.479> a
