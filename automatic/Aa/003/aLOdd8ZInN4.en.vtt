really do anything right like true

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.700 
really do anything right like true
miracles<00:01:59.750> but<00:01:59.990> he<00:02:00.110> probably<00:02:00.290> did<00:02:00.470> a<00:02:00.500> lot<00:02:00.680> of

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
miracles but he probably did a lot of

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.500 
miracles but he probably did a lot of
great<00:02:00.950> things<00:02:00.980> it's<00:02:01.580> like<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.120> who<00:02:02.390> do<00:02:02.450> you

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510
