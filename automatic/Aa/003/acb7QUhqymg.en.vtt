00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the Hindoo but I don't think it's

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.969 
the Hindoo but I don't think it's
particularly<00:01:11.400> shimmery<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.420> did<00:01:13.350> use<00:01:13.950> a

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979

think this was $28 but I could be wrong
it<00:01:54.600> might<00:01:54.720> have<00:01:54.840> gone<00:01:54.990> up<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.290> 29<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.219> got<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.610> at

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
it might have gone up to 29 I got it at

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.810 
it might have gone up to 29 I got it at
Ulta<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:58.259> had<00:01:58.500> nine<00:01:58.710> dollars<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.189> points<00:01:59.579> so

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
Ulta and I had nine dollars in points so

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.170 
Ulta and I had nine dollars in points so
that's<00:02:00.689> how<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:00.990> went<00:02:01.850> so<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.880> definitely

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
that's how that went so I definitely

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.510 
that's how that went so I definitely
recommend<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:04.200> really<00:02:04.799> really<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.280> this

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520

my<00:02:06.479> doubt<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.290> downsides<00:02:07.920> with<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.280> for<00:02:08.489> me

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
my doubt the downsides with this for me

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.020 
my doubt the downsides with this for me
I<00:02:08.849> don't<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.440> packaging<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.160> would<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.670> so

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
I don't like the packaging I would so so

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.530 
I don't like the packaging I would so so
so

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
so

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.289 
so
prefer<00:02:12.810> like<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.469> small<00:02:13.860> compact<00:02:14.549> or<00:02:15.000> something

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
prefer like a small compact or something

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.990 
prefer like a small compact or something
I<00:02:15.480> can't<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.409> know<00:02:16.500> for<00:02:16.739> my<00:02:16.950> kid<00:02:17.250> it's<00:02:17.670> it's

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
I can't you know for my kid it's it's

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.729 
I can't you know for my kid it's it's
just<00:02:18.329> stupid<00:02:18.689> it<00:02:18.840> takes<00:02:19.019> up<00:02:19.200> about<00:02:19.290> as<00:02:19.590> much

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
just stupid it takes up about as much

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.699 
just stupid it takes up about as much
space<00:02:19.980> as<00:02:20.040> two<00:02:20.579> or<00:02:20.760> three<00:02:21.060> blushes<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.870> that's

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
space as two or three blushes and that's

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.890 
space as two or three blushes and that's
a<00:02:22.950> downside<00:02:23.430> I'm<00:02:23.760> sure<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.689> could<00:02:24.870> probably

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
a downside I'm sure you could probably

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.309 
a downside I'm sure you could probably
do<00:02:25.709> pot<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.189> fairly<00:02:26.640> simply<00:02:27.060> but<00:02:27.900> I'm<00:02:28.049> not

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
do pot this fairly simply but I'm not

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.170 
do pot this fairly simply but I'm not
I'm<00:02:28.680> not<00:02:28.859> a<00:02:28.890> deep<00:02:29.159> Potter<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.700> just<00:02:29.939> don't

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
I'm not a deep Potter I just don't

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.649 
I'm not a deep Potter I just don't
really<00:02:30.359> do<00:02:30.629> that<00:02:31.579> I'm<00:02:32.579> not<00:02:32.790> gonna<00:02:33.030> head<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.359> I
