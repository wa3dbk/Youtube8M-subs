00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.170
 lehmanns the world shows you together 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.910
 with carola tree where he fears the dogs 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.290
 and how best you can do that 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.290
 building trust in your companion 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.900
 Customers can be created by them 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.609
 not socialized in detail are that 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.460
 they grew up bad that they are 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.720
 maybe from the wrong breeder or 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.310
 loser come 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.439
 there are already the first fears 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:34.399
 So arise there are many dogs 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:37.260
 The fear is to warn against cars before 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:41.989
 Menschenaufläufe So there are the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:45.059
 different problems fear 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.500
 does not necessarily turn into aggression 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.329
 There are also many dogs around 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.489
 just pull back so they flee 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.550
 Not every dog ​​who is afraid becomes 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.899
 better, however, a dog in the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.070
 the tight-knit is more likely to tend 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.430
 attack as one of the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.519
 escape options has the first 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.409
 symptoms of anxiety 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.240
 they can just be the body language 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.700
 if i can read my well if i am 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.740
 knows in the ever smaller is Johann 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.460
 merges and no longer 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.950
 relaxed then I should call that as 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.880
 Dog owners can recognize everything because 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.320
 really the and the body language the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.119
 main steps to trust 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.270
 building up is just your own 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.650
 do not deliver body language to the moon 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.320
 that is when my dog ​​is facing something 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.299
 I'm scared and I shove those in 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.619
 this situation always pure and 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.540
 do not protect him either 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.270
 then i can not trust 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.799
 build up so that's really only if 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.820
 I help him to master the situation 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.939
 So I can kind of like my dog 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.259
 I used pointing to distance 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.170
 take contact 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.350
 that I do not necessarily care 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.380
 a meadow where everything is run down 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.329
 let and release the so to speak 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.260
 but that i really do it 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.790
 first off 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.670
 wages and if I then maybe one 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.950
 We also have two dogs with them 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.230
 can go for a walk together where 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.180
 they carefully first time in years 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.540
 can contact us carefully 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.640
 can 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.420
 then I can do that gradually 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.400
 expand to other areas 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.730
 depending on the first time how old the dog it 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.440
 he came here as the fear looks 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.050
 then of course as well 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.090
 dog owner if i have my dog the 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.830
 noticed the necessary security then give 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.110
 That may be relatively fast though 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.260
 it always depends on how strong that is 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.520
 is pronounced 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:50.160
 it will probably be a little longer 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.820
 last than when puppy and of course 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.370
 the belly 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.250
 how do I deal with it myself as 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.170
 I can go through there again 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.290
 body language through my own 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.820
 body language and also by breathing technique 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.000
 Can I help my dog again? 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.440
 even if he is older but often 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.260
 Of course, that's it 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.650
 only and as they already are called 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.720
 that's what made that happen again 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.700
 It's a little bit harder 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.560
 if you are a scared and or 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.730
 have problems with your want 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.190
 Do you like to try them ? 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.720
 meditation off or 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.120
 Relaxation techniques tell me 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.260
 also like with the self experience 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.120
 already done 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.200
 otherwise they are always with me 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.200
 welcome
