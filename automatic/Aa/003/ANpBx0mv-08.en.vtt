from<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:31.119> actual<00:00:31.510> story<00:00:31.840> itself<00:00:32.349> which<00:00:32.680> is

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
from the actual story itself which is

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.710 
from the actual story itself which is
good<00:00:33.430> because<00:00:33.610> you<00:00:33.940> know<00:00:34.059> the<00:00:34.269> storing<00:00:34.600> the

art kind of go together so that would

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.610

Batman and Robin and their relationship
at<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:16.030> moment<00:01:16.359> which<00:01:17.259> is<00:01:17.310> strange<00:01:18.310> you<00:01:18.609> know

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
at the moment which is strange you know

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.840 
at the moment which is strange you know
Robin<00:01:19.240> is<00:01:19.509> still<00:01:20.170> used<00:01:20.500> to<00:01:20.710> killing<00:01:20.979> people

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
Robin is still used to killing people

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.719 
Robin is still used to killing people
and<00:01:22.380> Batman<00:01:23.380> obviously<00:01:23.920> he<00:01:24.100> doesn't<00:01:24.460> kill

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
and Batman obviously he doesn't kill

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.910 
and Batman obviously he doesn't kill
that's<00:01:25.060> what<00:01:25.270> he<00:01:26.259> does<00:01:27.539> and<00:01:28.539> so<00:01:29.289> basically<00:01:29.740> you

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
that's what he does and so basically you

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.080 
that's what he does and so basically you
know<00:01:30.009> they're<00:01:30.429> going<00:01:30.640> through<00:01:30.729> some<00:01:30.909> stuff

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
know they're going through some stuff

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.010 
know they're going through some stuff
and<00:01:31.390> what<00:01:31.990> happens<00:01:32.320> is<00:01:32.560> this<00:01:33.280> other<00:01:33.670> I<00:01:34.119> guess

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
and what happens is this other I guess

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.209 
and what happens is this other I guess
you<00:01:35.259> can<00:01:35.409> call<00:01:35.560> him<00:01:35.619> a<00:01:35.710> vigilante<00:01:37.079> villain

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
you can call him a vigilante villain

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.669 
you can call him a vigilante villain

want to you know it's just how it is and

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.460 
want to you know it's just how it is and
it's<00:03:11.319> just<00:03:11.590> it's<00:03:11.739> a<00:03:11.799> really<00:03:11.829> good<00:03:12.129> story<00:03:12.430> you

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
it's just it's a really good story you

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.050 
it's just it's a really good story you
know<00:03:14.470> on<00:03:14.799> top<00:03:15.069> of<00:03:15.190> all<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:15.370> happening

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
know on top of all that happening

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.869 
know on top of all that happening
Damian<00:03:16.540> doesn't<00:03:17.409> really<00:03:17.709> trust<00:03:18.010> his<00:03:18.340> dad<00:03:18.669> all

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
Damian doesn't really trust his dad all

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.270 
Damian doesn't really trust his dad all
that<00:03:19.120> much<00:03:19.359> because<00:03:19.599> he<00:03:20.590> doesn't<00:03:20.859> tell<00:03:21.129> him

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
that much because he doesn't tell him

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.400 
that much because he doesn't tell him
everything<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.209> I<00:03:23.049> believe<00:03:23.290> there's

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
everything and I believe there's

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.830 
everything and I believe there's
actually<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:23.709> part<00:03:23.949> where<00:03:24.099> he's<00:03:24.280> asking<00:03:24.840> Bruce

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
actually a part where he's asking Bruce

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.180 
actually a part where he's asking Bruce
about<00:03:26.910> Morgan<00:03:27.910> nobody<00:03:28.599> and<00:03:29.319> he<00:03:29.829> doesn't<00:03:29.980> want

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
about Morgan nobody and he doesn't want

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.909 
about Morgan nobody and he doesn't want
to<00:03:30.220> tell<00:03:30.430> him<00:03:30.669> and<00:03:30.849> it<00:03:31.750> kind<00:03:32.169> of<00:03:32.230> pisses<00:03:32.440> Damian

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
to tell him and it kind of pisses Damian

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.229 
to tell him and it kind of pisses Damian
off<00:03:33.040> because<00:03:33.190> it's<00:03:33.340> like<00:03:33.459> you<00:03:33.579> don't<00:03:33.730> trust<00:03:33.970> me

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
off because it's like you don't trust me

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.150 
off because it's like you don't trust me
and<00:03:34.269> then<00:03:34.629> I<00:03:34.900> think<00:03:35.440> starts<00:03:35.650> telling<00:03:35.949> him<00:03:36.069> to

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
and then I think starts telling him to

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.339 
and then I think starts telling him to
like<00:03:36.310> stay<00:03:36.609> you<00:03:37.000> know<00:03:37.150> out<00:03:37.629> of<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.079> streets

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
like stay you know out of the streets

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.699 
like stay you know out of the streets
until<00:03:39.150> he<00:03:40.150> takes<00:03:40.389> care<00:03:40.599> of<00:03:40.660> him<00:03:40.989> which

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
until he takes care of him which

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.710 
until he takes care of him which
obviously<00:03:41.910> Damian<00:03:42.910> doesn't<00:03:43.180> listen<00:03:43.419> cuz<00:03:43.599> he's

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
obviously Damian doesn't listen cuz he's

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.180 
obviously Damian doesn't listen cuz he's
Damian<00:03:44.139> and<00:03:45.299> it<00:03:46.299> it<00:03:46.780> gets<00:03:47.079> crazy<00:03:47.379> from<00:03:47.650> there

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
Damian and it it gets crazy from there

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.099 
Damian and it it gets crazy from there
I<00:03:48.220> don't<00:03:48.849> like<00:03:49.090> spoiling<00:03:49.569> things<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:49.959> I'm<00:03:50.019> not

where you gotta get the next volume to
conclude<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.650> story<00:04:17.919> cuz<00:04:18.190> story<00:04:18.760> for<00:04:19.000> this

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
conclude the story cuz story for this

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.819 
conclude the story cuz story for this
one<00:04:19.359> pretty<00:04:19.510> much<00:04:19.599> ends<00:04:20.049> in<00:04:20.169> this<00:04:20.320> one<00:04:20.560> so

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
one pretty much ends in this one so

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.959 
one pretty much ends in this one so
that's<00:04:21.039> other<00:04:21.459> good<00:04:22.000> thing<00:04:23.520> is<00:04:24.520> it<00:04:24.760> a<00:04:24.820> good

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:24.969 
that's other good thing is it a good

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:25.709 
that's other good thing is it a good
jump<00:04:25.150> be<00:04:25.240> on<00:04:25.360> point

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:25.719 
jump be on point

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:28.030 
jump be on point
I<00:04:25.810> wouldn't<00:04:26.289> know<00:04:26.409> but<00:04:27.219> I<00:04:27.460> guess

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
I wouldn't know but I guess

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.170 
I wouldn't know but I guess
because<00:04:28.220> I<00:04:28.310> haven't<00:04:28.460> really<00:04:28.640> read<00:04:28.850> anything

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
because I haven't really read anything

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.290 
because I haven't really read anything
from<00:04:29.570> Damien<00:04:29.870> up<00:04:30.230> until<00:04:30.530> this<00:04:30.800> point<00:04:34.210> I'm<00:04:35.210> sure

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
from Damien up until this point I'm sure

something ends up in the comic book
world<00:05:19.820> I<00:05:20.090> guess<00:05:20.480> you<00:05:20.600> could<00:05:20.720> say<00:05:20.750> like<00:05:20.960> in<00:05:21.110> the

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
world I guess you could say like in the

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.510 
world I guess you could say like in the
story<00:05:21.410> you<00:05:21.500> can<00:05:21.650> kind<00:05:21.860> of<00:05:21.950> see<00:05:22.190> where<00:05:22.400> it's

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
story you can kind of see where it's

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.430 
story you can kind of see where it's
going<00:05:22.700> but<00:05:23.450> you're<00:05:23.600> not<00:05:23.690> sure<00:05:24.050> at<00:05:24.200> some<00:05:24.230> point

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
going but you're not sure at some point

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.500 
going but you're not sure at some point
so<00:05:24.920> the<00:05:25.100> story<00:05:25.340> is<00:05:25.550> really<00:05:25.790> good<00:05:26.060> in<00:05:26.180> that<00:05:26.300> way
