00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
development by H Porter so a lot of

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:37.550

people<00:02:36.480> probably<00:02:36.959> read<00:02:37.109> this<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.409> thought

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
people probably read this and thought

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.020 
people probably read this and thought
well<00:02:37.739> second<00:02:38.099> generation<00:02:38.549> maybe<00:02:38.700> they<00:02:38.909> mean

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
well second generation maybe they mean

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.119 
well second generation maybe they mean
an<00:02:39.180> upgraded<00:02:39.659> version<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.349> Raygun

an upgraded version of the Raygun

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.470 
an upgraded version of the Raygun
you<00:02:41.430> know<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.670> Raygun<00:02:41.969> when<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.239> pack<00:02:42.450> a

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
you know the Raygun when you pack a

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.759 
you know the Raygun when you pack a
punch<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:43.049> and<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.439> know<00:02:43.530> that's<00:02:43.709> something

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
punch it and you know that's something

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.170 
punch it and you know that's something
that<00:02:44.159> I<00:02:44.219> was<00:02:44.340> looking<00:02:44.519> into<00:02:44.760> as<00:02:44.879> well<00:02:45.000> because

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
that I was looking into as well because

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.240 
that I was looking into as well because
I<00:02:45.239> want<00:02:45.389> to<00:02:45.450> know<00:02:45.569> well<00:02:45.810> if<00:02:46.319> it<00:02:46.469> says<00:02:46.680> this<00:02:46.920> it

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
I want to know well if it says this it

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.360 
I want to know well if it says this it
mentions<00:02:47.849> a<00:02:47.969> second<00:02:48.329> generation<00:02:48.480> Raygun<00:02:49.370> then

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
mentions a second generation Raygun then

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.979 
mentions a second generation Raygun then
is<00:02:50.579> there<00:02:50.730> gonna<00:02:50.819> be<00:02:50.909> second<00:02:51.450> generation

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
is there gonna be second generation

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.289 
is there gonna be second generation
Wunderwaffe<00:02:52.530> dg2<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.519> I<00:02:53.609> saw<00:02:53.819> that<00:02:53.970> one<00:02:54.150> and

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
Wunderwaffe dg2 and I saw that one and

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.210 
Wunderwaffe dg2 and I saw that one and
it<00:02:54.359> said<00:02:54.569> you<00:02:54.900> know<00:02:55.019> second<00:02:55.379> generation<00:02:55.799> DG<00:02:56.189> 3

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
it said you know second generation DG 3

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.520 
it said you know second generation DG 3
but<00:02:56.669> VG<00:02:57.329> 3<00:02:57.480> is<00:02:57.659> obviously<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.200> pack-a-punch

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
but VG 3 is obviously the pack-a-punch

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.080 
but VG 3 is obviously the pack-a-punch
version<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.069> a<00:02:59.129> lot<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.370> people<00:02:59.549> probably<00:02:59.700> read

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
version so a lot of people probably read

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.369 
version so a lot of people probably read
this<00:03:00.239> far<00:03:00.389> more<00:03:00.569> like<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.840> second<00:03:01.230> generation

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
this far more like a second generation

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.740 
this far more like a second generation
probably<00:03:02.340> leans<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.939> pack<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.150> bunch<00:03:03.389> but<00:03:03.540> no

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
probably leans the pack a bunch but no

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.720 
probably leans the pack a bunch but no
if<00:03:03.989> you<00:03:04.349> read<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.590> little<00:03:04.799> bit<00:03:04.980> further<00:03:05.250> down<00:03:05.340> it

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.399 
when you use the Raygun it kind of has
that<00:03:17.700> Splash<00:03:18.239> Damage<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:18.780> hits<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.049> back<00:03:19.230> if

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
that Splash Damage that hits you back if

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:20.809 
that Splash Damage that hits you back if
you're<00:03:19.530> aiming<00:03:19.859> too<00:03:20.010> close<00:03:20.219> to<00:03:20.400> yourself<00:03:20.519> you

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
you're aiming too close to yourself you

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.490 
you're aiming too close to yourself you
aim<00:03:20.969> at<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.209> ground<00:03:21.419> or<00:03:21.569> something<00:03:21.629> and<00:03:22.409> you

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
aim at the ground or something and you

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.709 
aim at the ground or something and you
end<00:03:22.680> up<00:03:22.889> sometimes<00:03:23.669> even<00:03:24.090> going<00:03:24.329> down<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:24.689> a

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:24.719 
end up sometimes even going down so a

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:25.819 
end up sometimes even going down so a
lot<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:24.930> people<00:03:25.139> when<00:03:25.230> they<00:03:25.260> get<00:03:25.409> the<00:03:25.530> Raygun

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
lot of people when they get the Raygun

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.349 
lot of people when they get the Raygun
they<00:03:26.010> don't<00:03:26.250> necessarily<00:03:26.400> want<00:03:26.819> to<00:03:27.060> use<00:03:27.209> it

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
they don't necessarily want to use it

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:28.580 
they don't necessarily want to use it
because<00:03:27.419> they<00:03:27.690> know<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:27.870> when<00:03:28.319> they<00:03:28.440> get

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
because they know that when they get

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.050 
because they know that when they get
into<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:28.799> bind<00:03:29.129> they<00:03:29.250> might<00:03:29.489> accidentally

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
into a bind they might accidentally

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.449 
into a bind they might accidentally
screw<00:03:30.299> themselves<00:03:30.690> over<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:30.900> go<00:03:31.199> down<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:31.979> the

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
screw themselves over and go down so the

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.909 
screw themselves over and go down so the
important<00:03:32.819> thing<00:03:32.879> it<00:03:33.510> reduces<00:03:34.229> excessive

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
important thing it reduces excessive

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.710 
important thing it reduces excessive
peripheral<00:03:35.489> damage<00:03:35.849> what<00:03:36.090> is<00:03:36.209> one<00:03:36.419> thing<00:03:36.690> that

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
peripheral damage what is one thing that

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.479 
peripheral damage what is one thing that
the<00:03:36.900> ray<00:03:37.049> gun<00:03:37.290> mark<00:03:37.530> 2<00:03:37.739> has<00:03:38.010> that's<00:03:38.340> different

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
the ray gun mark 2 has that's different

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.729 
the ray gun mark 2 has that's different
from<00:03:38.909> the<00:03:39.000> original<00:03:39.180> ray<00:03:39.510> gun<00:03:39.750> is<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.470> fact

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
from the original ray gun is the fact

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.490 
from the original ray gun is the fact
that<00:03:40.859> you<00:03:41.040> don't<00:03:41.310> get<00:03:41.459> any<00:03:41.699> splash<00:03:42.180> damage<00:03:42.569> so

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
that you don't get any splash damage so

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.289 
that you don't get any splash damage so
this<00:03:43.739> is<00:03:43.919> this<00:03:44.459> is<00:03:44.609> I<00:03:44.669> feel<00:03:44.699> really<00:03:45.120> awesome
