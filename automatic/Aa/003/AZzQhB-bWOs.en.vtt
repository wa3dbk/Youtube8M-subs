you<00:04:33.199> know<00:04:33.229> think<00:04:33.530> thankfully<00:04:34.430> they<00:04:34.550> thought

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
you know think thankfully they thought

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:37.330 
you know think thankfully they thought
they<00:04:35.180> actually<00:04:35.599> modified<00:04:36.169> this<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:37.009> hand

circuit<00:04:37.940> hold<00:04:38.509> the<00:04:38.960> sword<00:04:39.580> also<00:04:40.599> also<00:04:41.599> one

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
circuit hold the sword also also one

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.010

so<00:04:46.479> you<00:04:47.479> know<00:04:47.569> it<00:04:47.720> depends<00:04:48.139> if<00:04:48.259> you<00:04:48.349> like<00:04:48.530> the

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
so you know it depends if you like the
