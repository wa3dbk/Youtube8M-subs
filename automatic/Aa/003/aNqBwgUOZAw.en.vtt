00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.550

 we're going to warm it up so it can paint 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.739
 the oil and then we will strain it in 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.460
 a couple of minutes already the oil and asia the 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.989
 seed I already paint and we're going to strain it 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.690
 let's put directly here in 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.770
 our sheet that we already have hot 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.770
 over medium heat 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.490

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.040
 we're going to sauté it a bit 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.920
 axis gets a bit transparent already 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.420

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.570

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.270
 here we will also smile a 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.780
 but here we can go 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.479
 suffering also the squash that 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.940
 We have half a teaspoon of achiote in 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.830
 powder 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:04.490
 here we take the flavor also 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.040
 and we are going to put a teaspoon of 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.100
 turmeric or turmeric as you 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.990
 know in powder this also gives you a 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:18.750
 good color and gives a good flavor 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.750
 he can not omit if he can not find it 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.980
 and ready 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.310
 we already get the scent of all this and 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.940
 let's put half a cup of tomato 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.940
 chopped 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.450
 a little bit of salt 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.160
 tomato 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.030
 d 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.360
 chopped red pepper too 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.920
 but this is going to suffer 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.800
 three minutes 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.560
 you can see that it is tender in tomato and 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.040
 here in the middle we're going to put the two rice 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.579
 cups rice 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.579
 White 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.560
 we are going to mix it well that it penetrates 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.560
 all rice granites with color 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.040
 and all these flavors that like in a 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.500
 minute too 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.989
 and here about a minute more already in 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.319
 all the granites were penetrated from the 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.140
 flavors and color and we're going to put 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.650
 four cups 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.750
 chicken broth chicken broth can 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.480
 buy and so or if you have it reserved 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.760
 If it does not have salt, you have to 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.770
 put a teaspoon of salt it and 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.130
 has salt so we 're not going to put 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.130
 more salt 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.800
 here we mix it carefully 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:54.280
 the rice is no longer that being 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.790
 beating so much nothing else that it penetrates 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.730
 well the broth 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.219
 scraping down also with care to 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.140
 that the broth also cleans the base and 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:09.150
 bring all that flavor that was 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.550
 caramelized down at the bottom of the 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.700
 cooking pot 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:18.470
 and this now we are going to bring it to the boil 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.850
 and until it goes a little bit higher 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.950
 temperature in the case of wearing it 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.200
 first to the boil 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.920
 let's take it once it breaks well 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.810
 in the bor we are not going we will lower the 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.810
 temperature on low heat 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.410
 and we are going to cover it 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.720
 and we're going to let it simmer for 20 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.490
 minutes or until the water is consumed 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.500
 you have to be careful not to pass 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.320
 just do not burn yourself once you get 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.970
 consumes water that is no longer water and 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.460
 we are going to completely remove it from 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.460
 extinguish fire and let stand for 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.010
 about 15 more minutes when I said of him 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.520
 I want to clarify that when I said a 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.860
 teaspoon of salt in the consommé is al 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.020
 taste can put you more the case is that 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.780
 You can try the consume before 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.560
 put it to the rice so that it is of salt 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.680
 to your course here you already have 20 minutes to 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.840
 slow fire has already consumed the water no longer 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.440
 you see little bombs from nowhere 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.260
 now let's put out the fire if it's a 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.780
 electric stove like this one has to 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.720
 remove it from where we had it because the 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.560
 surface continues hot nothing else what 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.250
 let's go 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.800
 and we're going to let him rest about 15 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.850
 minutes and will already be after 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.860
 15 minutes already our rice is 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:49.120
 perfect as you can see here with a 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.740
 fork what carefully we're going 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.650
 separating so you see 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.139
 how rich is direct 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.509
 he is not dejected and nothing is perfect 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:02.090
 with the amount of water that we put 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:07.030

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.030
