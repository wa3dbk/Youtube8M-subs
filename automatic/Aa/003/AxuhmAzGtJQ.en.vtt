 known as golden bay 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.519
 said airport was built in only three months and started to operate without 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.529
 no radar control is on February 23, 2008 date when it landed 

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:00.760
 the first aircraft 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.289
 a dense kraft kinder of 90 

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:07.309

 troops of the local police force 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:26.139
 the Argentine air force approved the operation of the airport 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.330
 but is unable to guarantee its control 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.500
 because it does not have radars in the area and could land or take off any 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.110
 type of aircraft without being registered 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.280
 in an airport like that you can take and bring from Argentine territory 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.840
 any type of material or personnel allowing up to the possibility of 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.840
 arrival and clandestine takeoff of civil aircraft as military 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.840
 of any origin 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.159
 without being controlled by anyone 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:56.330
 spokesmen said they will only be used to make eight flights 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.479
 annual 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.710
 the Argentine government according to it was known not know 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.110
 with certainty who is the owner but the air force authorized its construction 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.559
 and gave him life if on 

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:10.589
 So far it is not known what is the utility that 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:15.069
 the airport or if the flights are national or international from where 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:16.969
 they proceed and where they are going 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:21.519
 does not pass any type of customs controls and the media of 

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:25.359
 land of fire assure that no immigration control is carried out 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.729
 nevertheless it is known 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.100
 flights from the runway to the Falkland Islands where they would travel 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:37.099
 foreign entrepreneurs in the midst of the political tension that exists between the 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.839
 Argentine government and the United Kingdom for the sovereignty of Malvinas those flights 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:45.849
 they go against the restrictions that the Argentine government itself determined 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.980
 on the relationship with the disputed islands 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.680
 the government knows the danger of having an airport 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.850
 such characteristics in the heart of patagonia but nothing for 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:57.759
 avoid it 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:00.949
 and on the contrary authorizes its operation without the slightest 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:02.080
 control 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.930
 the foreignization of Argentine lands 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.629
 with the complicity of the politicians of turn 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:11.779
 may drag Argentina to lose control of its sovereignty if it 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:15.069
 continues to allow acts like this to continue to happen
