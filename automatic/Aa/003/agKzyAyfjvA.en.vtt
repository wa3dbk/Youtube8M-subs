00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.890 
she's spending Christmas in the hospital
anyway<00:05:08.440> so<00:05:09.070> yeah<00:05:09.669> now<00:05:10.360> they<00:05:10.540> know<00:05:10.660> what's

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
anyway so yeah now they know what's

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.480 
anyway so yeah now they know what's
wrong<00:05:11.080> with<00:05:11.139> her<00:05:11.440> she's<00:05:11.650> just<00:05:11.740> a<00:05:12.070> heroin
