00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.760 

you<00:00:15.030> know<00:00:15.150> I've<00:00:15.240> got<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.420> replicator<00:00:15.990> 2x<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.740> I

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
you know I've got a replicator 2x and I

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.560 
you know I've got a replicator 2x and I
could<00:00:17.070> not<00:00:17.310> be<00:00:17.490> happier<00:00:17.940> with<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.300> printer

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
could not be happier with the printer

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.359 
could not be happier with the printer
itself<00:00:18.720> but<00:00:19.260> what<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.560> think<00:00:19.680> could<00:00:20.160> use<00:00:20.340> a

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
itself but what I think could use a

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.939 
itself but what I think could use a
little<00:00:20.670> bit<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.789> improvement<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.650> finish

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
little bit of improvement is to finish

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.009 
little bit of improvement is to finish
if<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.550> look<00:00:23.789> closely<00:00:24.150> at<00:00:24.630> any<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.960> your

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
if you look closely at any of your

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.720 
if you look closely at any of your
printouts<00:00:25.470> you'll<00:00:26.130> see<00:00:26.279> these<00:00:26.400> little<00:00:26.609> lines

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
printouts you'll see these little lines

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.269 
printouts you'll see these little lines
and<00:00:27.240> that's<00:00:27.300> just<00:00:27.630> an<00:00:28.140> artifact<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.130> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
and that's just an artifact of the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.250 
and that's just an artifact of the
printer<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> extruder<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.449> those<00:00:31.019> are<00:00:31.170> the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
printer the extruder and those are the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.659 
printer the extruder and those are the
widths<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.650> bead<00:00:31.920> there's<00:00:32.250> not<00:00:32.399> really<00:00:32.579> a

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
widths of the bead there's not really a

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.459 
widths of the bead there's not really a
lot<00:00:32.730> we<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.600> can<00:00:33.750> do<00:00:33.899> about<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.320> terms

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
lot we can we can do about it in terms

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.920 
lot we can we can do about it in terms
of<00:00:34.649> improving<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.010> printer<00:00:35.399> every<00:00:36.090> side

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
of improving the printer every side

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.660 
of improving the printer every side
looks<00:00:37.350> like<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.739> except<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.309> course<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
looks like that except of course the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.100 
looks like that except of course the
bottom<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.540> part<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.780> sits

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
bottom this is the part that sits

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.680 
bottom this is the part that sits
siccola<00:00:40.410> against<00:00:40.860> well<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.640> have<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> glass<00:00:42.210> work

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
siccola against well I have a glass work

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.900 
siccola against well I have a glass work
surface<00:00:43.140> or<00:00:43.350> platter<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:44.550> perfectly

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
surface or platter and so it's perfectly

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.090 
surface or platter and so it's perfectly
smooth<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.390> wish<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.079> rest<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.829> would<00:00:47.039> come

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
smooth I wish the rest of it would come

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.790 
smooth I wish the rest of it would come
out<00:00:47.340> something<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.530> again<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> got<00:00:49.739> a

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
out something like that again I got a

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.650 
out something like that again I got a
soap<00:00:50.039> dish<00:00:50.250> here<00:00:50.460> same<00:00:50.730> kind<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.030> artifacts<00:00:51.480> in

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
soap dish here same kind of artifacts in

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.450 
soap dish here same kind of artifacts in
fact<00:00:51.870> if<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.110> look<00:00:52.289> there's<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.070> side<00:00:53.250> that

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
fact if you look there's the side that

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.970 
fact if you look there's the side that
was<00:00:53.640> against<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> glass<00:00:54.239> platter<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.260> then

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
was against the glass platter and then

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.340 
was against the glass platter and then
the<00:00:56.340> top<00:00:56.820> side<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.420> even<00:00:57.539> see<00:00:57.809> some<00:00:58.020> small

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the top side you can even see some small

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.700 
the top side you can even see some small
defects<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.100> wish<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.760> this<00:00:59.910> was<00:01:00.260> a<00:01:01.260> little

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
defects I wish that this was a little

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.959 
defects I wish that this was a little
bit<00:01:01.800> better<00:01:01.920> finish<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.430> I'm<00:01:02.489> sure<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.820> do

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
bit better finish and I'm sure you do

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.880 
bit better finish and I'm sure you do
too<00:01:03.000> now<00:01:03.690> there's<00:01:04.170> guys<00:01:04.350> out<00:01:04.530> there<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:04.860> you

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
too now there's guys out there so you

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.230 
too now there's guys out there so you
can<00:01:05.070> take<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> paint<00:01:05.519> brush<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:05.909> paint

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
can take a paint brush and you can paint

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.450 
can take a paint brush and you can paint
acetone<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.200> I've<00:01:07.530> tried<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
acetone and and I've tried it the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.590 
acetone and and I've tried it the
problem<00:01:08.760> with<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.240> don't<00:01:09.330> put<00:01:09.510> that

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
problem with that is you don't put that

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.750 
problem with that is you don't put that
on<00:01:09.659> very<00:01:09.930> evenly<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.619> kind<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.430> places

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
on very evenly it kind of the places

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.280 
on very evenly it kind of the places
where<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.090> put<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.390> too<00:01:12.540> thick<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.960> melts

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
where you put it on too thick it melts

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.530 
where you put it on too thick it melts
it<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.530> over<00:01:13.770> over<00:01:14.250> solidifies<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
it and over over solidifies and the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.060 
it and over over solidifies and the
other<00:01:15.689> parts<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.290> doesn't<00:01:16.590> quite<00:01:16.680> get<00:01:16.950> it

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
other parts it just doesn't quite get it

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.100 
other parts it just doesn't quite get it
as<00:01:17.159> smooth<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.759> another<00:01:18.330> part<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.810> to

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
as smooth is another part this is to

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.740 
as smooth is another part this is to
hold<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.560> different<00:01:20.040> sized<00:01:20.189> spool<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.720> I

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
hold a different sized spool on so I

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.899 
hold a different sized spool on so I
decided<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.229> run<00:01:22.380> some<00:01:22.590> tests<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.189> looked<00:01:23.820> on

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
decided to run some tests I looked on

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.940 
decided to run some tests I looked on
the<00:01:23.939> internet<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.330> there's<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.590> some<00:01:25.590> guys<00:01:25.770> who

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
the internet and there's a some guys who

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.499 
the internet and there's a some guys who
came<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.250> with<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.400> really<00:01:26.610> unique<00:01:26.970> idea<00:01:27.150> they

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
came up with a really unique idea they

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.510 
came up with a really unique idea they
took<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.689> coffee<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.530> they<00:01:29.130> put<00:01:29.369> some

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
took a coffee can and they put some

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.960 
took a coffee can and they put some
acetone<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:31.290> they<00:01:31.409> put<00:01:31.650> a

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
acetone in it and then they put a

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.840 
acetone in it and then they put a
basically<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.060> candle<00:01:33.600> kind<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> fondue

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
basically a candle kind of like a fondue

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.090 
basically a candle kind of like a fondue
acetone<00:01:35.850> found<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.270> int<00:01:36.689> they<00:01:37.590> lit<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.950> on

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
acetone found you int they lit that on

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.310 
acetone found you int they lit that on
fire<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.729> unfortunately<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.900> results<00:01:40.229> were

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
fire and unfortunately the results were

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.010 
fire and unfortunately the results were
pretty<00:01:40.530> good<00:01:40.680> until<00:01:41.520> well<00:01:42.270> until<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> fire

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
pretty good until well until the fire

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.410 
pretty good until well until the fire
and<00:01:43.350> then<00:01:43.530> they<00:01:43.680> burn<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.040> garage<00:01:44.250> down<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.119> I

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
and then they burn the garage down so I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.120 
and then they burn the garage down so I
like<00:01:45.810> their<00:01:46.049> idea<00:01:46.350> about<00:01:46.590> smoothing<00:01:46.920> their

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
like their idea about smoothing their

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.190 
like their idea about smoothing their
parts<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.670> didn't<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.390> fire<00:01:48.600> idea<00:01:48.990> so

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
parts I didn't like the fire idea so

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.920 
parts I didn't like the fire idea so
much<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:50.100> I've<00:01:50.399> kind<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.149> improved<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.810> their

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
much so I've kind of improved on their

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.600 
much so I've kind of improved on their
idea<00:01:52.229> try<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.530> make<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> little<00:01:52.950> bit<00:01:53.159> safer

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
idea try to make it a little bit safer

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.880 
idea try to make it a little bit safer
and<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.869> experiment<00:01:55.409> we're<00:01:55.619> going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.799> be

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
and in this experiment we're going to be

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.679 
and in this experiment we're going to be
using<00:01:56.189> these<00:01:56.310> little<00:01:56.520> test<00:01:56.939> strips<00:01:57.299> these<00:01:57.509> are

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
using these little test strips these are

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.420 
using these little test strips these are
just<00:01:57.810> little<00:01:57.990> 4<00:01:58.350> inch<00:01:58.380> long<00:01:58.710> strips<00:01:59.100> that's

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
just little 4 inch long strips that's

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.639 
just little 4 inch long strips that's
the<00:01:59.579> bottom<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.090> then<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.899> top<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.439> can<00:02:01.469> see

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the bottom and then the top you can see

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.340 
the bottom and then the top you can see
we'll<00:02:02.070> keep<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.340> one<00:02:02.549> as<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> control<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.420> get

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
we'll keep this one as a control I get

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.280 
we'll keep this one as a control I get
it<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.500> focus<00:02:05.540> you<00:02:06.540> can<00:02:06.570> see<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.079> there<00:02:07.200> are

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
it to focus you can see that there are

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.320 
it to focus you can see that there are
some<00:02:07.469> pretty<00:02:07.710> significant<00:02:08.520> artifacts<00:02:09.000> from

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
some pretty significant artifacts from

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.570 
some pretty significant artifacts from
the<00:02:09.599> printing<00:02:09.959> process<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:11.039> let's<00:02:11.250> see<00:02:11.400> what

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
the printing process so let's see what

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.690 
the printing process so let's see what
we<00:02:11.730> can<00:02:11.940> do<00:02:12.090> with<00:02:12.360> this

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
we can do with this

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.360 
we can do with this
with<00:02:13.300> this<00:02:13.420> acetone<00:02:14.020> bath<00:02:14.290> let's<00:02:14.980> take<00:02:15.129> a<00:02:15.160> look

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
with this acetone bath let's take a look

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.350 
with this acetone bath let's take a look
at<00:02:15.459> what<00:02:15.610> we<00:02:15.730> come<00:02:15.879> up<00:02:16.000> with<00:02:17.879> okay<00:02:18.879> after<00:02:19.120> those

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
at what we come up with okay after those

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.759 
at what we come up with okay after those
two<00:02:19.510> chuckleheads<00:02:19.720> burned<00:02:20.349> down<00:02:20.530> their

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
two chuckleheads burned down their

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.020 
two chuckleheads burned down their
garage<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.040> didn't<00:02:21.459> want<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.670> go<00:02:21.760> through<00:02:21.879> that

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
garage I didn't want to go through that

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.820 
garage I didn't want to go through that
again<00:02:22.180> so<00:02:22.510> what<00:02:22.660> I've<00:02:22.780> come<00:02:22.930> up<00:02:23.080> with<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.530> I

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
again so what I've come up with is I

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.470 
again so what I've come up with is I
bought<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.099> wok<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.760> bought<00:02:25.150> this<00:02:25.269> one<00:02:25.420> a

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
bought a wok I bought this one a

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.710 
bought a wok I bought this one a
Salvation<00:02:25.989> Army<00:02:26.260> for<00:02:26.440> $7.99<00:02:27.510> we're<00:02:28.510> not<00:02:28.599> going

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
Salvation Army for $7.99 we're not going

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.150 
Salvation Army for $7.99 we're not going
to<00:02:28.750> use<00:02:28.930> this<00:02:29.080> top<00:02:29.349> because<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:29.709> can't<00:02:29.980> see

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
to use this top because you can't see

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.800 
to use this top because you can't see
through<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.459> you<00:02:30.730> could<00:02:31.209> probably<00:02:31.390> use<00:02:31.599> any

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
through it you could probably use any

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.070 
through it you could probably use any
kind<00:02:32.110> of<00:02:32.290> crock-pot<00:02:33.480> electric<00:02:34.480> frying<00:02:34.720> fan

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
kind of crock-pot electric frying fan

flames<00:02:37.720> at<00:02:38.080> all<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:39.400> other<00:02:39.519> thing<00:02:39.700> that's

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
flames at all the other thing that's

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.160 
flames at all the other thing that's
inside<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.180> here<00:02:40.420> you'll<00:02:40.599> notice<00:02:40.780> this<00:02:41.019> is

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
inside of here you'll notice this is

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.839 
inside of here you'll notice this is
normally<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.680> steamer<00:02:42.069> tray<00:02:42.400> it's<00:02:42.580> usually

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
normally the steamer tray it's usually

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.180 
normally the steamer tray it's usually
installed<00:02:43.209> like<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.690> but<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.470> don't<00:02:44.860> want

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
installed like that but I don't want

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.770 
installed like that but I don't want
this<00:02:45.459> is<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.640> low<00:02:45.849> area<00:02:46.030> I<00:02:46.269> don't<00:02:46.390> want<00:02:46.660> the

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
this is a low area I don't want the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.449 
this is a low area I don't want the
acetone<00:02:47.200> condensing<00:02:47.860> in<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.069> bottom<00:02:48.340> of

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
acetone condensing in the bottom of

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.100 
acetone condensing in the bottom of
there<00:02:48.640> so<00:02:49.269> I'm<00:02:49.360> going<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.540> turn<00:02:49.660> it<00:02:49.780> upside

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
there so I'm going to turn it upside

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.979 
there so I'm going to turn it upside
down<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.739> other<00:02:50.890> advantage<00:02:51.340> is<00:02:52.209> that<00:02:52.269> it<00:02:52.569> is

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
down the other advantage is that it is

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.509 
down the other advantage is that it is
covered<00:02:53.319> with<00:02:53.349> Teflon<00:02:53.799> so<00:02:53.950> our<00:02:54.040> parts<00:02:54.310> don't

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
covered with Teflon so our parts don't

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.640 
covered with Teflon so our parts don't
want<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.030> stick<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.269> it<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.690> then<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.349> string

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
want to stick to it and then the string

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.740 
want to stick to it and then the string
is<00:02:56.829> simply<00:02:57.130> so<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:57.340> can<00:02:57.549> easily<00:02:58.209> lift<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.480> part

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
is simply so I can easily lift the part

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.589 
is simply so I can easily lift the part
out<00:02:58.930> without<00:02:59.140> burning<00:02:59.920> my<00:03:00.220> hands<00:03:00.610> okay<00:03:01.299> what

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
out without burning my hands okay what

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.089 
out without burning my hands okay what
are<00:03:01.660> we<00:03:01.750> going<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:01.900> use<00:03:02.110> well<00:03:04.440> we<00:03:05.440> need<00:03:05.590> 20<00:03:05.980> to

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
are we going to use well we need 20 to

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.430 
are we going to use well we need 20 to
25<00:03:06.549> CCS<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.180> acetone<00:03:07.599> this<00:03:07.810> is<00:03:07.930> already<00:03:08.200> turned

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
25 CCS of acetone this is already turned

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.220 
25 CCS of acetone this is already turned
on<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.739> lowest<00:03:09.160> setting<00:03:09.579> acetone<00:03:10.269> boils<00:03:11.079> at

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
on the lowest setting acetone boils at

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.500 
on the lowest setting acetone boils at
133<00:03:11.920> degrees<00:03:12.010> so<00:03:12.730> we<00:03:12.880> don't<00:03:13.060> need<00:03:13.180> a<00:03:13.239> lot<00:03:13.450> of

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
133 degrees so we don't need a lot of

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.020 
133 degrees so we don't need a lot of
heat<00:03:13.780> we're<00:03:14.290> going<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.470> take<00:03:14.620> our<00:03:14.769> 20<00:03:15.010> or<00:03:15.099> 25

our<00:03:25.060> part<00:03:25.500> set<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.590> on<00:03:26.709> top<00:03:26.739> of<00:03:26.920> there<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.450> then

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
our part set it on top of there and then

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.180 
our part set it on top of there and then
again<00:03:29.139> I'm<00:03:29.260> going<00:03:29.350> to<00:03:29.440> take<00:03:29.560> a<00:03:29.590> piece<00:03:29.829> of<00:03:29.859> glass

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
again I'm going to take a piece of glass

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.400 
again I'm going to take a piece of glass
I<00:03:30.430> bought<00:03:30.639> this<00:03:30.819> at<00:03:31.060> Salvation<00:03:31.569> Army<00:03:31.810> also<00:03:32.019> for

I bought this at Salvation Army also for

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.039 
I bought this at Salvation Army also for
$7.99<00:03:32.709> they're<00:03:33.639> having<00:03:33.819> a<00:03:33.880> $7.99<00:03:34.269> sale<00:03:34.780> and

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.650 
$7.99 they're having a $7.99 sale and
then<00:03:35.410> start<00:03:35.709> our<00:03:35.799> timer<00:03:36.359> we're<00:03:37.359> going<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.569> give

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
then start our timer we're going to give

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.300 
then start our timer we're going to give
this<00:03:37.750> thing<00:03:37.900> about<00:03:38.079> 30<00:03:38.380> seconds<00:03:38.950> cooking

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
this thing about 30 seconds cooking

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.020 
this thing about 30 seconds cooking
inside<00:03:39.579> of<00:03:39.730> there

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
inside of there

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.580 
inside of there
and<00:03:40.209> basically<00:03:40.359> what's<00:03:40.810> happening<00:03:41.230> is<00:03:41.350> the

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
and basically what's happening is the

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.229 
and basically what's happening is the
acetone<00:03:42.010> is<00:03:42.160> vaporizing<00:03:42.790> is<00:03:42.910> forming<00:03:43.180> a

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
acetone is vaporizing is forming a

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.000 
acetone is vaporizing is forming a
little<00:03:43.359> cloud<00:03:43.660> inside<00:03:44.019> of<00:03:44.200> there<00:03:44.350> and<00:03:44.470> our

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
little cloud inside of there and our

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.500 
little cloud inside of there and our
part<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:47.609> acetone<00:03:48.609> is<00:03:48.760> condensing<00:03:49.329> on

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
part the the acetone is condensing on

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.539 
part the the acetone is condensing on
our<00:03:49.660> part<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.109> all<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:50.380> nooks<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.459> crannies

our part and all the nooks and crannies
of<00:03:51.970> little<00:03:52.269> crevices<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:52.840> it's<00:03:53.380> condensing

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
of little crevices and it's condensing

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.550 
of little crevices and it's condensing
evenly<00:03:54.730> all<00:03:54.940> over<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.690> entire<00:03:55.780> part<00:03:56.349> not<00:03:56.500> just

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
evenly all over the entire part not just

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.770 
evenly all over the entire part not just
concentrating<00:03:57.519> in<00:03:57.609> one<00:03:57.790> or<00:03:58.030> two<00:03:58.450> particular

concentrating in one or two particular

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.500 
concentrating in one or two particular
areas<00:03:59.250> so<00:04:00.250> it<00:04:00.370> should<00:04:00.579> be<00:04:00.760> a<00:04:00.790> pretty<00:04:01.209> nice

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510

shiny so let me turn everything off and
we'll<00:04:17.709> compare<00:04:18.039> it<00:04:18.190> to<00:04:18.370> our<00:04:18.549> our<00:04:19.680> standard

original part is on the right and of
course<00:04:26.950> the<00:04:27.160> one<00:04:27.400> that<00:04:27.550> we<00:04:27.670> just<00:04:27.700> took<00:04:28.690> out<00:04:28.900> of

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
course the one that we just took out of

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.040 
course the one that we just took out of
the<00:04:29.110> steaming<00:04:29.770> bath<00:04:30.100> of<00:04:30.340> acetone<00:04:30.850> that<00:04:31.060> came

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
the steaming bath of acetone that came

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.600 
the steaming bath of acetone that came
out<00:04:32.200> I<00:04:32.320> got<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:32.530> say<00:04:32.680> it<00:04:32.800> came<00:04:32.950> off<00:04:33.130> pretty<00:04:33.400> nice

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
out I got to say it came off pretty nice

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.510 
out I got to say it came off pretty nice
it's<00:04:33.970> even<00:04:34.570> all<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:35.080> way<00:04:35.110> around<00:04:35.290> nice<00:04:36.250> and

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
it's even all the way around nice and

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.050 
it's even all the way around nice and
shiny

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
shiny

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.850 
shiny
it's<00:04:37.240> almost<00:04:37.630> comparable<00:04:38.020> to<00:04:38.320> what<00:04:38.500> used<00:04:38.740> to

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
it's almost comparable to what used to

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.760 
it's almost comparable to what used to
lay<00:04:38.980> on<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.220> platter<00:04:39.960> but<00:04:40.960> you<00:04:41.200> can<00:04:41.380> still<00:04:41.560> see

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
lay on the platter but you can still see

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.590 
lay on the platter but you can still see
some<00:04:41.800> remnants<00:04:42.430> there<00:04:42.700> although<00:04:43.060> it's<00:04:43.360> much

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
some remnants there although it's much

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.560 
some remnants there although it's much
nicer<00:04:44.320> than<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.770> original<00:04:45.430> part<00:04:45.640> I'm

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
nicer than the original part I'm

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.270 
nicer than the original part I'm
thinking<00:04:47.050> if<00:04:47.200> we<00:04:47.230> give<00:04:47.470> it<00:04:47.560> a<00:04:47.620> little<00:04:47.650> bit<00:04:48.070> more

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
thinking if we give it a little bit more

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.540 
thinking if we give it a little bit more
time<00:04:48.610> now<00:04:49.090> I've<00:04:49.720> calculated<00:04:50.140> it<00:04:50.550> you'll

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
time now I've calculated it you'll

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.830 
time now I've calculated it you'll
notice<00:04:51.850> that<00:04:51.970> at<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.270> end<00:04:52.450> all<00:04:52.690> of<00:04:52.720> our

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
notice that at the end all of our

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.470 
notice that at the end all of our
acetone<00:04:53.290> was<00:04:53.530> gone<00:04:53.740> if<00:04:54.010> we<00:04:54.100> use<00:04:54.220> 20<00:04:54.520> to<00:04:54.640> 25<00:04:55.030> CCS

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
acetone was gone if we use 20 to 25 CCS

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.390 
acetone was gone if we use 20 to 25 CCS
so<00:04:56.230> now<00:04:56.290> I'm<00:04:56.380> going<00:04:56.470> to<00:04:56.530> try<00:04:56.680> to<00:04:56.740> give<00:04:56.920> it<00:04:56.950> one

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
so now I'm going to try to give it one

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.150 
so now I'm going to try to give it one
minute<00:04:57.670> and<00:04:58.150> in<00:04:58.300> order<00:04:58.570> to<00:04:58.800> give<00:04:59.800> it<00:04:59.830> enough

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
minute and in order to give it enough

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.280 
minute and in order to give it enough
acetone<00:05:01.000> for<00:05:01.180> a<00:05:01.210> minute<00:05:01.450> I'm<00:05:01.930> going<00:05:02.080> to<00:05:02.170> need

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
acetone for a minute I'm going to need

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.460 
acetone for a minute I'm going to need
about<00:05:02.410> 35<00:05:03.330> CCS<00:05:04.330> so<00:05:04.930> let's<00:05:05.080> go<00:05:05.200> ahead<00:05:05.260> and<00:05:05.350> hook

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
about 35 CCS so let's go ahead and hook

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.340 
about 35 CCS so let's go ahead and hook
that<00:05:05.620> up<00:05:05.680> and<00:05:06.040> we'll<00:05:06.130> try<00:05:06.220> another<00:05:06.340> part<00:05:07.350> okay

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
that up and we'll try another part okay

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.810 
that up and we'll try another part okay
same<00:05:08.590> setup<00:05:08.830> as<00:05:08.950> before<00:05:09.010> we<00:05:09.400> got<00:05:09.520> our<00:05:09.610> part

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
same setup as before we got our part

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.090 
same setup as before we got our part
pre-positioned<00:05:10.210> I've<00:05:10.630> got<00:05:10.780> 35<00:05:11.200> CCS<00:05:11.770> measured

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.100 
pre-positioned I've got 35 CCS measured
out<00:05:12.220> of<00:05:12.310> this<00:05:12.460> syringe<00:05:12.730> we're<00:05:13.720> simply<00:05:13.990> going

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
out of this syringe we're simply going

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:20.030 
out of this syringe we're simply going
to<00:05:14.170> check<00:05:14.410> that<00:05:14.590> in<00:05:14.710> there<00:05:14.920> put<00:05:17.730> our<00:05:18.730> top<00:05:18.910> on

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
to check that in there put our top on

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.040 
to check that in there put our top on
start<00:05:21.040> our<00:05:21.160> timer<00:05:21.720> we're<00:05:22.720> going<00:05:22.840> to<00:05:22.900> give<00:05:23.020> it

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
start our timer we're going to give it

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:32.480 
start our timer we're going to give it
one<00:05:23.140> minute

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.550 

okay<00:05:33.180> I<00:05:33.210> don't<00:05:33.419> know<00:05:33.660> if<00:05:33.750> you<00:05:33.870> can<00:05:34.020> quite<00:05:34.169> make

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
okay I don't know if you can quite make

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.700 
okay I don't know if you can quite make
this<00:05:34.740> out<00:05:34.979> but<00:05:35.310> there's<00:05:35.910> a<00:05:36.150> cloud<00:05:36.750> you<00:05:37.199> can<00:05:37.319> see

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
this out but there's a cloud you can see

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.260 
this out but there's a cloud you can see
it<00:05:37.830> inside<00:05:37.979> of<00:05:38.220> there<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:38.580> now<00:05:38.699> it's<00:05:38.850> starting

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
it inside of there and now it's starting

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.870 
it inside of there and now it's starting
to<00:05:39.389> fog<00:05:39.690> up<00:05:39.900> on<00:05:40.110> the<00:05:40.229> inside<00:05:40.530> as<00:05:40.800> it<00:05:41.190> condenses

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
to fog up on the inside as it condenses

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.680 
to fog up on the inside as it condenses
on<00:05:42.060> the<00:05:42.180> glass<00:05:43.460> so<00:05:44.460> we've<00:05:44.610> got<00:05:44.729> a<00:05:44.759> nice<00:05:45.090> thick

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
on the glass so we've got a nice thick

00:05:45.690 --> 00:06:06.280 
on the glass so we've got a nice thick
acetone<00:05:46.530> cloud<00:05:46.889> on<00:05:47.130> the<00:05:47.160> inside<00:05:47.520> of<00:05:47.639> there

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.290 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.410 

the<00:06:06.800> thing<00:06:06.980> I<00:06:07.040> don't<00:06:07.130> like<00:06:07.220> about<00:06:07.340> this<00:06:07.730> is<00:06:07.790> now

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:08.420 
the thing I don't like about this is now

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.150 
the thing I don't like about this is now
that<00:06:08.480> it's<00:06:08.720> condensing<00:06:09.170> is<00:06:09.260> starting<00:06:09.710> to<00:06:09.830> drip

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
that it's condensing is starting to drip

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.030 
that it's condensing is starting to drip
off<00:06:10.430> of<00:06:10.670> the<00:06:10.820> top<00:06:11.090> if<00:06:11.420> it<00:06:11.960> drips<00:06:12.230> onto<00:06:12.470> our<00:06:12.740> part

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.040 
off of the top if it drips onto our part

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.500 
off of the top if it drips onto our part
that's<00:06:13.340> going<00:06:13.460> to<00:06:13.520> give<00:06:13.700> us<00:06:13.730> an<00:06:13.940> extra<00:06:14.240> thick

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
that's going to give us an extra thick

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.110 
that's going to give us an extra thick
layer<00:06:14.750> of<00:06:14.780> acetone<00:06:15.530> and<00:06:15.800> which<00:06:16.580> night<00:06:16.790> might

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
layer of acetone and which night might

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.960 
layer of acetone and which night might
not<00:06:17.300> work<00:06:17.450> out<00:06:17.630> in<00:06:17.780> our<00:06:17.870> favor<00:06:21.730> okay<00:06:22.730> there<00:06:22.880> we

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:22.970 
not work out in our favor okay there we

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.630 
not work out in our favor okay there we
go<00:06:23.090> one<00:06:23.270> minute<00:06:23.420> remove<00:06:23.930> our<00:06:24.050> lid<00:06:24.490> take<00:06:25.490> our

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.640 
go one minute remove our lid take our

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:32.010 
go one minute remove our lid take our
part<00:06:25.850> out

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.170 

okay<00:06:33.020> let's<00:06:33.260> compare<00:06:33.680> them<00:06:33.980> the<00:06:34.190> unfinished

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
okay let's compare them the unfinished

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.060 
okay let's compare them the unfinished
part<00:06:35.480> is<00:06:35.570> on<00:06:35.660> the<00:06:35.780> left<00:06:35.990> the<00:06:36.290> one<00:06:36.380> they<00:06:36.650> got<00:06:36.770> 30

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
part is on the left the one they got 30

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.070 
part is on the left the one they got 30
seconds<00:06:37.520> is<00:06:37.610> in<00:06:37.730> the<00:06:37.820> center<00:06:38.180> and<00:06:38.330> the<00:06:38.870> one

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
seconds is in the center and the one

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.860 
seconds is in the center and the one
minute<00:06:39.440> is<00:06:39.560> on<00:06:39.770> the<00:06:39.920> right<00:06:40.190> I<00:06:40.520> do<00:06:41.330> notice<00:06:41.690> a

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
minute is on the right I do notice a

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.690 
minute is on the right I do notice a
little<00:06:42.110> bit<00:06:42.230> more<00:06:42.500> erosion<00:06:43.130> on<00:06:43.250> the<00:06:43.280> detail

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
little bit more erosion on the detail

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.800 
little bit more erosion on the detail
not<00:06:44.060> a<00:06:44.120> lot<00:06:44.480> and<00:06:44.840> I<00:06:45.320> have<00:06:45.470> to<00:06:45.620> say<00:06:45.770> I'm<00:06:45.920> not

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:46.810 
not a lot and I have to say I'm not

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.880 
not a lot and I have to say I'm not
convinced<00:06:47.810> that<00:06:47.840> the<00:06:48.050> additional<00:06:48.380> 30<00:06:48.560> seconds

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
convinced that the additional 30 seconds

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.220 
convinced that the additional 30 seconds
made<00:06:49.130> any<00:06:49.310> difference<00:06:49.700> I<00:06:49.880> think<00:06:50.360> 30<00:06:50.840> seconds

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.230 
made any difference I think 30 seconds

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.480 
made any difference I think 30 seconds
is<00:06:51.350> the<00:06:51.380> way<00:06:51.590> to<00:06:51.650> go<00:06:51.920> for<00:06:52.160> a<00:06:52.190> couple<00:06:52.370> reasons

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
is the way to go for a couple reasons

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.340 
is the way to go for a couple reasons
one<00:06:52.940> the<00:06:53.120> finish<00:06:53.360> is<00:06:53.480> almost<00:06:53.660> identical<00:06:54.200> and

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.350 
one the finish is almost identical and

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.040 
one the finish is almost identical and
number<00:06:55.100> two<00:06:55.310> on<00:06:55.580> the<00:06:56.150> park<00:06:56.420> that<00:06:56.540> we<00:06:56.690> left<00:06:56.900> in

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
number two on the park that we left in

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.960 
number two on the park that we left in
for<00:06:57.230> a<00:06:57.290> minute<00:06:57.470> there<00:06:57.740> was<00:06:57.860> some<00:06:58.040> condensation

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:58.970 
for a minute there was some condensation

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.210 
for a minute there was some condensation
of<00:06:59.090> the<00:06:59.150> acetone<00:06:59.780> on<00:06:59.960> the<00:07:00.140> bottom<00:07:00.560> of<00:07:00.740> the<00:07:00.950> part

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.220 
of the acetone on the bottom of the part

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.030 
of the acetone on the bottom of the part
and<00:07:01.520> so<00:07:02.360> that<00:07:02.720> caused<00:07:03.080> some<00:07:03.320> erosion<00:07:03.620> there

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:04.040 
and so that caused some erosion there

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.940 
and so that caused some erosion there
and<00:07:04.250> it<00:07:04.420> practically<00:07:05.420> started<00:07:05.750> melting<00:07:06.050> the

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:06.950 
and it practically started melting the

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.810 
and it practically started melting the
ABS<00:07:07.490> so<00:07:07.850> 30<00:07:08.750> seconds<00:07:09.320> is<00:07:09.470> the<00:07:09.500> way<00:07:09.740> to<00:07:09.800> go<00:07:10.100> so

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:10.820 
ABS so 30 seconds is the way to go so

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.700 
ABS so 30 seconds is the way to go so
let's<00:07:10.850> now<00:07:11.270> move<00:07:11.540> up<00:07:11.780> to<00:07:11.930> something<00:07:12.080> this<00:07:12.470> took

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710 
let's now move up to something this took

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.970 
let's now move up to something this took
five<00:07:13.490> and<00:07:13.670> a<00:07:13.700> half<00:07:13.760> hours<00:07:13.970> to<00:07:14.360> print<00:07:14.830> now<00:07:15.830> I'm

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:15.980 
five and a half hours to print now I'm

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.290 
five and a half hours to print now I'm
ready<00:07:16.160> to<00:07:16.340> take<00:07:16.520> the<00:07:16.670> risk<00:07:16.820> let's<00:07:17.120> go<00:07:17.240> ahead

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300 
ready to take the risk let's go ahead

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.870 
ready to take the risk let's go ahead
and<00:07:17.510> put<00:07:17.690> this<00:07:17.900> soap<00:07:18.740> dish<00:07:19.010> inside<00:07:19.580> of<00:07:19.760> the

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:19.880 
and put this soap dish inside of the

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.000 
and put this soap dish inside of the
acetone<00:07:20.360> bath<00:07:20.540> give<00:07:21.080> it<00:07:21.200> 30<00:07:21.440> seconds

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.010 
acetone bath give it 30 seconds

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.920 
acetone bath give it 30 seconds
and<00:07:22.100> by<00:07:22.730> the<00:07:22.790> way<00:07:22.880> I<00:07:23.000> have<00:07:23.270> a<00:07:23.300> couple<00:07:23.660> of<00:07:23.780> them

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:23.930 
and by the way I have a couple of them

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.750 
and by the way I have a couple of them
and<00:07:24.110> we'll<00:07:24.800> be<00:07:24.920> able<00:07:24.980> to<00:07:25.100> compare<00:07:25.460> the<00:07:25.640> before

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:25.760 
and we'll be able to compare the before

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:41.200 
and we'll be able to compare the before
and<00:07:26.150> the<00:07:26.240> after

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.210 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.659 

what<00:07:42.210> a<00:07:42.419> wonderful<00:07:43.169> difference<00:07:43.500> at

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:43.669 
what a wonderful difference at

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:46.430 
what a wonderful difference at
thirty-second<00:07:44.699> acetone<00:07:45.300> steam<00:07:45.690> bath<00:07:46.080> makes

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 
thirty-second acetone steam bath makes
