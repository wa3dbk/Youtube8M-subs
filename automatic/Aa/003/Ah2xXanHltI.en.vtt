the<00:01:56.310> right<00:01:56.340> shade<00:01:56.759> what<00:01:57.060> was<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.299> thinking

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
the right shade what was I thinking

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.520 
the right shade what was I thinking
looking<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.579> far<00:01:59.820> okay<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.240> what<00:02:01.079> half<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.409> my

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
looking so far okay so what half of my

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.160 
looking so far okay so what half of my
face<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.829> done<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:03.149> definitely<00:02:03.899> goes<00:02:04.259> on

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
face is done it definitely goes on

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.150 
face is done it definitely goes on
rather<00:02:05.380> nicely<00:02:06.030> no<00:02:07.030> streaking<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:08.649> definitely

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
rather nicely no streaking it definitely

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.910 
rather nicely no streaking it definitely
seems<00:02:09.640> like<00:02:10.060> it<00:02:10.360> has<00:02:10.569> a<00:02:10.810> medium<00:02:11.170> coverage<00:02:11.770> I

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
seems like it has a medium coverage I

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.760 
seems like it has a medium coverage I
can<00:02:12.099> still<00:02:12.370> see<00:02:12.730> my<00:02:13.660> beauty<00:02:14.020> marks<00:02:14.349> peeking

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
can still see my beauty marks peeking

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.010 
can still see my beauty marks peeking
through<00:02:14.800> not<00:02:15.580> necessarily<00:02:16.239> to<00:02:16.569> Matt<00:02:16.810> if

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
through not necessarily to Matt if

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.630 
through not necessarily to Matt if
anything<00:02:17.410> I<00:02:17.500> would<00:02:17.560> say<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.069> has<00:02:18.250> like<00:02:18.610> a

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
anything I would say that it has like a

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.520 
anything I would say that it has like a
demi<00:02:19.060> matte<00:02:19.390> finish<00:02:19.780> just<00:02:19.989> because<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.290> still

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
demi matte finish just because I still

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.900 
demi matte finish just because I still
see<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.800> little<00:02:21.099> bit<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.280> shine<00:02:21.459> peeking

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
see a little bit of shine peeking

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.170 
see a little bit of shine peeking
through<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.560> dry<00:02:23.560> super-quick<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.880> then<00:02:25.030> as

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
through a dry super-quick and then as

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.840 
through a dry super-quick and then as
far<00:02:25.450> as<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.750> pores<00:02:26.050> not<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.280> bad<00:02:27.550> it's

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
far as the pores not that bad it's

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.900 
far as the pores not that bad it's
actually<00:02:28.290> very<00:02:29.290> porous<00:02:29.890> on<00:02:30.069> my<00:02:30.190> nose<00:02:30.400> oh<00:02:30.670> hey

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
actually very porous on my nose oh hey

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.880 
actually very porous on my nose oh hey
so<00:02:31.660> here's<00:02:31.900> one<00:02:32.110> light<00:02:32.260> layer<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.650> light

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
so here's one light layer of light

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.530 
so here's one light layer of light
evenly<00:02:33.220> throughout<00:02:33.489> my<00:02:33.640> face<00:02:33.940> this<00:02:34.269> side

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
evenly throughout my face this side

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.210 
evenly throughout my face this side
remember<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.140> foundation<00:02:35.650> in<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.950> primer

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
remember is the foundation in the primer

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.440 
remember is the foundation in the primer
and<00:02:36.489> then<00:02:36.580> this<00:02:36.790> side<00:02:37.000> is<00:02:37.150> just<00:02:37.180> the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
and then this side is just the

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.660 
and then this side is just the
foundation<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.200> surprisingly<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:39.400> actually

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
foundation and surprisingly I actually

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.030 
foundation and surprisingly I actually
think<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.540> prefer<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.170> foundation<00:02:41.800> or<00:02:41.920> you

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
think I prefer the foundation or you

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.460 
think I prefer the foundation or you
could<00:02:42.220> do<00:02:42.489> without<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:43.120> primer<00:02:43.450> with<00:02:44.290> this

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
could do without the primer with this

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.590 
could do without the primer with this
foundation<00:02:44.650> just<00:02:45.190> because<00:02:45.580> on<00:02:46.000> this<00:02:46.540> side

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
foundation just because on this side

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.960 
foundation just because on this side
especially<00:02:47.260> around<00:02:47.650> my<00:02:47.890> chin<00:02:48.280> area<00:02:48.519> it's

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
especially around my chin area it's

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.270 
especially around my chin area it's
created<00:02:49.660> some<00:02:49.810> sort<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.319> like<00:02:50.530> lines<00:02:50.920> or

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
created some sort of like lines or

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.340 
created some sort of like lines or
textures<00:02:51.790> on<00:02:51.970> my<00:02:52.090> chin<00:02:52.480> that<00:02:52.510> I've<00:02:52.810> never<00:02:53.019> seen

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
textures on my chin that I've never seen

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.580 
textures on my chin that I've never seen
before<00:02:53.530> with<00:02:53.950> foundation<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:55.209> primer<00:02:55.480> oh<00:02:55.900> no

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
before with foundation the primer oh no

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.900 
before with foundation the primer oh no
now<00:02:56.769> as<00:02:56.830> far<00:02:56.980> as<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.160> can<00:02:57.250> see<00:02:57.430> like<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.610> did<00:02:57.760> pick

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
now as far as I can see like I did pick

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.280 
now as far as I can see like I did pick
up<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.120> shade<00:02:58.360> medium<00:02:58.660> there's<00:02:59.049> a<00:02:59.080> toss-up

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
up the shade medium there's a toss-up

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.590 
up the shade medium there's a toss-up
between<00:02:59.440> medium<00:03:00.250> or<00:03:00.370> medium<00:03:00.700> deep<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:01.180> don't

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
between medium or medium deep I don't

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.699 
between medium or medium deep I don't
know<00:03:01.720> maybe<00:03:02.049> I<00:03:02.230> should<00:03:02.410> have<00:03:02.440> gotten<00:03:02.650> the

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
know maybe I should have gotten the

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.289 
know maybe I should have gotten the
medium<00:03:03.069> deep<00:03:03.340> because<00:03:03.580> clearly<00:03:04.060> I'm<00:03:04.269> having

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
medium deep because clearly I'm having

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.110 
medium deep because clearly I'm having
trouble<00:03:04.959> picking<00:03:05.620> up<00:03:05.920> my<00:03:06.280> shade<00:03:06.700> right<00:03:06.910> now

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
trouble picking up my shade right now

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.810 
trouble picking up my shade right now
but<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.810> don't<00:03:08.440> know<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.709> really<00:03:08.799> like<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.549> fact

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
but I don't know I really like the fact

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.640 
but I don't know I really like the fact
that<00:03:09.970> it<00:03:10.269> comes<00:03:10.570> in<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.870> squeezy<00:03:11.200> tube

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
that it comes in a squeezy tube

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.220 
that it comes in a squeezy tube
basically<00:03:12.160> this<00:03:12.760> is<00:03:12.880> supposed<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.269> be<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.750> full

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
basically this is supposed to be a full

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.470 
basically this is supposed to be a full
coverage<00:03:14.560> high<00:03:15.010> resistant<00:03:15.640> undetectable

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
coverage high resistant undetectable

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.960 
coverage high resistant undetectable
finish<00:03:16.930> it's<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.320> very<00:03:17.530> thin<00:03:17.920> consistency<00:03:18.190> this

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
finish it's a very thin consistency this

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.190 
finish it's a very thin consistency this
is<00:03:19.239> rather<00:03:19.780> light<00:03:21.030> but<00:03:22.030> maybe<00:03:22.359> what<00:03:23.079> the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
is rather light but maybe what the

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.380 
is rather light but maybe what the
powder<00:03:23.410> will<00:03:23.799> kind<00:03:24.070> of<00:03:24.190> offset<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:24.970> balance

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
powder will kind of offset and balance

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.380 
powder will kind of offset and balance
itself<00:03:25.720> out<00:03:26.130> it<00:03:27.130> definitely<00:03:27.700> is<00:03:27.850> doing<00:03:28.269> an

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
itself out it definitely is doing an

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.120 
itself out it definitely is doing an
amazing<00:03:28.810> job<00:03:29.109> covering<00:03:29.980> up<00:03:30.130> my<00:03:30.160> dark<00:03:30.640> circles

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
amazing job covering up my dark circles

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.940 
amazing job covering up my dark circles

I'm actually quite curious to see what

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.849 
I'm actually quite curious to see what
shade<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.549> medium<00:03:36.940> deep<00:03:37.209> looks<00:03:37.510> like<00:03:37.750> oh<00:03:38.079> yeah

barely<00:06:32.919> have<00:06:33.189> eyebrows<00:06:33.610> if<00:06:33.849> anything<00:06:34.360> this

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:34.509 
barely have eyebrows if anything this

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:36.360 
barely have eyebrows if anything this
would<00:06:34.689> probably<00:06:34.840> be<00:06:35.080> best<00:06:35.650> for<00:06:35.949> those<00:06:36.129> who

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
would probably be best for those who

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.640 
would probably be best for those who
have<00:06:36.550> thicker<00:06:36.909> eyebrows<00:06:37.389> longer<00:06:38.050> eyebrows<00:06:38.379> if

have thicker eyebrows longer eyebrows if

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.290 
have thicker eyebrows longer eyebrows if
you<00:06:38.800> suffer<00:06:39.189> from<00:06:39.219> like<00:06:39.580> one<00:06:39.819> or<00:06:39.939> two<00:06:39.969> gray

you suffer from like one or two gray

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.839 
you suffer from like one or two gray
hairs<00:06:40.599> then<00:06:41.259> maybe<00:06:41.800> this<00:06:42.490> would<00:06:42.669> make<00:06:42.819> a

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:42.849 
hairs then maybe this would make a

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.839 
hairs then maybe this would make a
difference<00:06:43.360> but<00:06:43.539> I<00:06:43.719> don't<00:06:43.900> see<00:06:44.289> any<00:06:44.849> sculpting

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:45.849 
difference but I don't see any sculpting

Maybelline fit me the first powder and
from<00:06:54.520> what<00:06:54.639> I<00:06:54.669> can<00:06:54.759> remember<00:06:54.969> and<00:06:55.389> had<00:06:55.659> more<00:06:56.050> of

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340 
a dewy texture it has like little fine

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.730 
a dewy texture it has like little fine
flecks<00:07:00.879> of<00:07:01.090> glitter<00:07:01.389> in<00:07:01.539> there<00:07:01.900> maybe<00:07:02.500> that's

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740 
flecks of glitter in there maybe that's

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.170 
flecks of glitter in there maybe that's
probably<00:07:03.009> why<00:07:03.189> I'd<00:07:03.370> never<00:07:03.580> purchased<00:07:04.090> it

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.180
