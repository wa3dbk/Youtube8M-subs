showing and blowing my new design of
train<00:00:11.160> horns<00:00:13.160> this<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.370> slightly<00:00:15.269> different

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
new design this is a brand new design a

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.759 
new design this is a brand new design a
little<00:00:23.580> more<00:00:23.699> compact<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.689> little<00:00:25.320> easier<00:00:25.619> to

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
little more compact a little easier to

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.160 
little more compact a little easier to
build<00:00:25.920> less<00:00:26.910> parts<00:00:27.359> that's<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.960> good<00:00:28.109> thing

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
build less parts that's the good thing

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.500 
build less parts that's the good thing
is<00:00:28.500> there's<00:00:28.680> less<00:00:28.859> parts<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.369> buy<00:00:29.519> and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
is there's less parts to buy and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.229 
is there's less parts to buy and
hopefully<00:00:30.929> easier<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.710> find<00:00:31.949> parts<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.610> few

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
hopefully easier to find parts a few

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.420 
hopefully easier to find parts a few
people<00:00:33.570> had<00:00:33.809> emailed<00:00:34.230> me<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.829> said<00:00:35.280> that

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
people had emailed me and said that

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.040 
people had emailed me and said that
they're<00:00:35.579> having<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.940> hard<00:00:36.120> time<00:00:36.180> finding<00:00:36.630> some

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
they're having a hard time finding some

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.920 
they're having a hard time finding some
of<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.200> other<00:00:37.350> fittings<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.010> had<00:00:38.690> so<00:00:39.690> this

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
of the other fittings that I had so this

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.139 
of the other fittings that I had so this
is<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> little<00:00:40.710> bit<00:00:40.829> easier<00:00:40.860> design<00:00:41.520> hopefully

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
is a little bit easier design hopefully

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.170 
is a little bit easier design hopefully
easier<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.600> find<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.930> parts<00:00:43.230> also<00:00:43.940> this<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.149> a

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
easier to find the parts also this is a

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.290 
easier to find the parts also this is a
five<00:00:46.170> Bell<00:00:46.500> design<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:47.820> made<00:00:48.030> and

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
five Bell design that I just made and

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.450 
five Bell design that I just made and
this<00:00:48.570> one<00:00:48.750> I'm<00:00:48.930> going<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.140> lay<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.100> my<00:00:50.280> golf

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
this one I'm going to lay on my golf

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.380 
this one I'm going to lay on my golf
cart<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.840> will<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:52.079> mine<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:53.090> had<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> chance

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
cart so this will be mine I had a chance

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.900 
cart so this will be mine I had a chance
to<00:00:54.570> try<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.809> out<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.440> half<00:00:56.309> inch<00:00:56.550> air<00:00:56.730> or

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
to try it out on the half inch air or

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.270 
to try it out on the half inch air or
the<00:00:57.120> five-eighths<00:00:57.690> inch<00:00:57.899> air<00:00:58.079> line<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.620> we'll

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the five-eighths inch air line but we'll

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.670 
the five-eighths inch air line but we'll
give<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.640> try<00:00:59.820> here<00:01:00.149> after<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.780> get<00:01:01.020> shot<00:01:01.469> to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
give it a try here after I get shot to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.850 
give it a try here after I get shot to
these<00:01:01.859> three<00:01:02.699> Bell<00:01:03.090> horns<00:01:03.480> blowing<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.140> we'll

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
these three Bell horns blowing and we'll

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.460 
these three Bell horns blowing and we'll
see<00:01:05.040> how<00:01:05.159> they<00:01:05.339> sound

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470

on the changes that I've made what I've
done<00:01:20.660> is<00:01:20.900> I've<00:01:21.110> used<00:01:21.350> different<00:01:23.260> reducer

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
done is I've used different reducer

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.920 
done is I've used different reducer
fittings<00:01:24.640> it's<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.730> slightly<00:01:26.150> more<00:01:26.420> compact

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
fittings it's a slightly more compact

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.510 
fittings it's a slightly more compact
reducer<00:01:27.500> fitting<00:01:27.800> in<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.040> back<00:01:28.250> on<00:01:28.580> this<00:01:29.480> one

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
reducer fitting in the back on this one

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.730 
reducer fitting in the back on this one
also<00:01:31.520> on<00:01:31.670> this<00:01:32.000> three<00:01:32.780> Bell<00:01:32.960> one<00:01:33.200> that<00:01:33.440> I<00:01:33.470> just

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
also on this three Bell one that I just

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.100 
also on this three Bell one that I just
built<00:01:33.980> I'm<00:01:34.790> using<00:01:35.150> air<00:01:35.480> lines<00:01:36.310> that<00:01:37.310> go<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:37.520> the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
built I'm using air lines that go to the

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.170 
built I'm using air lines that go to the
bells<00:01:39.110> themselves<00:01:39.860> or<00:01:40.250> to<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.610> horn<00:01:40.790> bodies

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
bells themselves or to the horn bodies

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.220 
bells themselves or to the horn bodies
so<00:01:42.110> I<00:01:42.500> have<00:01:43.070> a<00:01:43.100> common<00:01:43.910> manifold<00:01:44.540> back<00:01:44.780> here

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
so I have a common manifold back here

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.220 
so I have a common manifold back here
and<00:01:45.700> they<00:01:46.700> just<00:01:46.910> have<00:01:47.120> barbed<00:01:47.510> nipples<00:01:47.990> that

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
and they just have barbed nipples that

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.110 
and they just have barbed nipples that
stick<00:01:48.470> out<00:01:48.620> their<00:01:48.950> nylon<00:01:49.160> barbed<00:01:49.670> nipples

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
stick out their nylon barbed nipples

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.990 
stick out their nylon barbed nipples
that<00:01:50.270> stick<00:01:50.510> out<00:01:50.630> I<00:01:51.280> drilled<00:01:52.280> holes<00:01:52.340> into<00:01:52.760> that

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
that stick out I drilled holes into that

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.240 
that stick out I drilled holes into that
half-inch<00:01:53.720> pipe<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.350> just<00:01:54.590> threaded<00:01:54.979> a<00:01:55.070> man

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
half-inch pipe and just threaded a man

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.700 
half-inch pipe and just threaded a man
put<00:01:55.670> good<00:01:55.970> mono<00:01:56.330> silicone<00:01:56.870> on<00:01:57.200> them<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:57.530> that

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
put good mono silicone on them so that

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.880 
put good mono silicone on them so that
they'd<00:01:58.360> stay<00:01:59.360> put<00:01:59.660> and<00:01:59.810> not<00:01:59.900> leak<00:02:00.260> and<00:02:00.560> then

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
they'd stay put and not leak and then

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.330 
they'd stay put and not leak and then
just<00:02:01.130> run<00:02:01.360> plastic<00:02:02.360> air<00:02:02.570> lines<00:02:02.920> up<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.250> the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
just run plastic air lines up to the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.700 
just run plastic air lines up to the
horns<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:05.600> got<00:02:05.750> another<00:02:05.870> barbed<00:02:06.320> nipple

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
horns and you got another barbed nipple

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.600 
horns and you got another barbed nipple
up<00:02:06.830> there<00:02:07.070> that<00:02:07.910> they<00:02:08.090> connect<00:02:08.420> into<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:09.610> that

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
up there that they connect into and that

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.410 
up there that they connect into and that
takes<00:02:10.940> place<00:02:11.240> of<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.750> three-eighths<00:02:12.380> inch

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
takes place of the three-eighths inch

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.630 
takes place of the three-eighths inch
steel<00:02:14.420> lines<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.930> used<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.260> have<00:02:15.350> steel<00:02:16.280> pipe

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
steel lines I used to have steel pipe

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.520 
steel lines I used to have steel pipe
sticking<00:02:17.000> out<00:02:17.330> that<00:02:17.720> threaded<00:02:18.050> into<00:02:18.290> there

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
sticking out that threaded into there

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.050 
sticking out that threaded into there
and<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:18.920> takes<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.310> place<00:02:19.550> of<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.820> steel

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
and that takes the place of the steel

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.990 
and that takes the place of the steel
pipe<00:02:20.500> but<00:02:21.500> then<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:21.860> lose<00:02:22.070> your<00:02:22.250> mount<00:02:22.580> so

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
pipe but then you lose your mount so

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.040 
pipe but then you lose your mount so
what<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.209> did<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.660> I<00:02:24.160> took<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.220> metal<00:02:25.610> mount<00:02:26.050> on

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
what I did is I took the metal mount on

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.210 
what I did is I took the metal mount on
the<00:02:27.709> backside<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.610> horn<00:02:29.180> body<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.870> those

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
the backside of the horn body and those

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.530 
the backside of the horn body and those
hold<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.340> horn

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.500 

he's<00:02:38.080> here<00:02:38.409> just<00:02:38.440> l-brackets<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.670> they're

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
he's here just l-brackets and they're

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.500 
he's here just l-brackets and they're
mounted<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.080> a<00:02:41.110> angle<00:02:41.830> aluminum<00:02:42.670> bracket<00:02:43.420> that

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
mounted to a angle aluminum bracket that

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.259 
mounted to a angle aluminum bracket that
I<00:02:43.569> had<00:02:43.810> on<00:02:43.959> my<00:02:44.080> golf<00:02:44.290> cart<00:02:44.530> already<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:46.180> have

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
I had on my golf cart already that have

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.809 
I had on my golf cart already that have
been<00:02:46.420> mounting<00:02:46.750> everything<00:02:47.200> on<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:51.220> used

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
been mounting everything on and I used

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.910 
been mounting everything on and I used
the<00:02:51.940> same<00:02:52.090> error<00:02:52.360> system<00:02:52.599> that<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.500> had<00:02:53.739> been

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
the same error system that I had been

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.160 
the same error system that I had been
using<00:02:54.099> these<00:02:54.519> are<00:02:54.730> two<00:02:55.060> five<00:02:55.299> gallon<00:02:55.330> tanks

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
using these are two five gallon tanks

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.220 
using these are two five gallon tanks
connected<00:02:56.950> together<00:02:57.280> with<00:02:57.640> t<00:02:57.879> fittings<00:02:58.269> holes

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
connected together with t fittings holes

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
connected together with t fittings holes
in<00:02:59.470> between<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.940> mean<00:03:01.720> 5/8<00:03:02.440> inch<00:03:02.650> holes<00:03:02.890> runs

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
in between and mean 5/8 inch holes runs

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.149 
in between and mean 5/8 inch holes runs
up<00:03:04.200> goes<00:03:05.200> up<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.590> my<00:03:05.769> half-inch<00:03:06.549> ball<00:03:06.760> valve

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
up goes up to my half-inch ball valve

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.500 
up goes up to my half-inch ball valve
then<00:03:09.159> there's<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.430> half<00:03:09.640> inch<00:03:09.879> threaded<00:03:10.239> pipe

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
then there's a half inch threaded pipe

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.220 
then there's a half inch threaded pipe
into<00:03:11.200> that<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:12.190> has<00:03:12.340> nipples<00:03:13.120> with<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.569> air

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
into that that has nipples with the air

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.349 
into that that has nipples with the air
lines<00:03:14.530> coming<00:03:14.799> out<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.099> that<00:03:15.190> manifold<00:03:15.760> and

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
lines coming out of that manifold and

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.940 
lines coming out of that manifold and
just<00:03:17.019> goes<00:03:17.170> up<00:03:17.349> to<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.530> horns<00:03:19.620> like<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.769> say

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
just goes up to the horns like I say

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.690 
just goes up to the horns like I say
this<00:03:21.160> is<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.340> little<00:03:22.150> easier<00:03:22.269> to<00:03:22.510> build<00:03:22.690> design

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
this is a little easier to build design

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
this is a little easier to build design
if<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:24.849> look<00:03:25.239> on<00:03:25.420> eBay<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:26.799> you<00:03:26.950> look<00:03:27.129> under

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
if you look on eBay and you look under

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.150 
if you look on eBay and you look under
locomotive<00:03:28.720> horns<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.319> easiest<00:03:29.680> way<00:03:29.829> to<00:03:29.859> find

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
locomotive horns the easiest way to find

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.789 
locomotive horns the easiest way to find
it<00:03:30.430> also<00:03:31.239> under<00:03:31.660> train<00:03:31.930> horns<00:03:32.379> you<00:03:32.470> can<00:03:32.680> look

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
it also under train horns you can look

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.589 
it also under train horns you can look
under<00:03:32.950> train<00:03:33.310> horns<00:03:33.670> and<00:03:33.849> you'll<00:03:34.000> find<00:03:34.299> my

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
under train horns and you'll find my

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.170 
under train horns and you'll find my
plans<00:03:35.349> that<00:03:35.650> I'm<00:03:35.829> going<00:03:36.489> to<00:03:36.549> be<00:03:36.640> selling<00:03:37.030> on

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
plans that I'm going to be selling on

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.080 
plans that I'm going to be selling on
eBay<00:03:37.930> for<00:03:37.959> this<00:03:38.379> design<00:03:38.970> hopefully<00:03:39.970> this

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
eBay for this design hopefully this

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.270 
eBay for this design hopefully this
would<00:03:40.209> be<00:03:40.329> my<00:03:40.480> last<00:03:40.660> design<00:03:40.959> change<00:03:41.500> but<00:03:42.250> I

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
would be my last design change but I

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.729 
would be my last design change but I
think<00:03:42.370> it's<00:03:42.700> a<00:03:42.790> better<00:03:42.970> change<00:03:43.359> the<00:03:44.290> horns

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
think it's a better change the horns

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.259 
think it's a better change the horns
still<00:03:45.010> sound<00:03:45.280> really<00:03:45.609> nice<00:03:45.760> they've<00:03:46.090> got<00:03:46.239> a

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
still sound really nice they've got a

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.530 
still sound really nice they've got a
good<00:03:46.510> loud<00:03:46.720> tone<00:03:47.139> to<00:03:47.410> them<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:48.329> they<00:03:49.329> work

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
good loud tone to them and they work

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.589 
good loud tone to them and they work
real<00:03:49.750> well<00:03:50.790> here's<00:03:51.790> a<00:03:51.849> little<00:03:52.090> better<00:03:52.239> look<00:03:52.450> at

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
real well here's a little better look at

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:59.009 
real well here's a little better look at
the<00:03:52.769> five<00:03:53.769> bail<00:03:57.090> now<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.150> five<00:03:58.359> bail<00:03:58.630> I<00:03:58.660> have

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
the five bail now the five bail I have

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.289 
the five bail now the five bail I have
hooked<00:03:59.200> up<00:03:59.410> with<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.680> steel<00:03:59.919> lines<00:04:00.220> flip<00:04:01.150> them

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
hooked up with the steel lines flip them

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.979 
hooked up with the steel lines flip them
around<00:04:01.329> here<00:04:01.750> for<00:04:01.959> you

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
around here for you

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.020 
around here for you
these<00:04:04.989> are<00:04:05.169> hooked<00:04:05.349> up<00:04:05.500> with<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:05.680> steel<00:04:06.030> 1/2

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
these are hooked up with a steel 1/2

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.390 
these are hooked up with a steel 1/2
inch<00:04:07.329> line<00:04:07.569> on<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:07.870> bottom<00:04:08.200> half<00:04:08.829> inch<00:04:09.099> tees

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
inch line on the bottom half inch tees

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.140 
inch line on the bottom half inch tees
and<00:04:09.700> then<00:04:10.389> it<00:04:10.540> goes<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:10.930> a<00:04:10.959> 3/8<00:04:11.500> inch<00:04:12.120> into<00:04:13.120> the

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
and then it goes to a 3/8 inch into the

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.640 
and then it goes to a 3/8 inch into the
bottom<00:04:13.569> and<00:04:13.660> it's<00:04:13.810> threaded<00:04:14.169> right<00:04:14.290> into<00:04:14.560> the

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
bottom and it's threaded right into the

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.129 
bottom and it's threaded right into the
bottom<00:04:14.950> of<00:04:15.069> the<00:04:15.570> horn<00:04:16.570> body<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:18.450> on<00:04:19.450> these<00:04:19.720> I

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
bottom of the horn body and on these I

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.990 
bottom of the horn body and on these I
wanted<00:04:20.799> to<00:04:20.859> cut<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.190> ear<00:04:21.340> down<00:04:21.639> just<00:04:21.880> a<00:04:21.970> little

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
wanted to cut the ear down just a little

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.350 
wanted to cut the ear down just a little
bit

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
bit

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.779 
bit
they<00:04:23.320> don't<00:04:23.500> need<00:04:23.620> three-eighths<00:04:24.340> inch<00:04:24.520> line

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
they don't need three-eighths inch line

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.320 
they don't need three-eighths inch line
for<00:04:25.060> one<00:04:25.210> horn<00:04:25.539> so<00:04:25.900> I<00:04:25.930> put<00:04:26.770> a<00:04:27.330> three-eighths

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
for one horn so I put a three-eighths

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.450 
for one horn so I put a three-eighths
inch<00:04:28.630> would<00:04:29.289> plug<00:04:29.590> in<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:29.889> bottom<00:04:30.010> of<00:04:30.310> them

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
inch would plug in the bottom of them

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.820 
inch would plug in the bottom of them
it's<00:04:30.970> about<00:04:31.120> that<00:04:31.419> long<00:04:31.479> and<00:04:31.900> then<00:04:32.500> I<00:04:32.530> just

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
it's about that long and then I just

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.129 
it's about that long and then I just
took<00:04:32.950> a<00:04:33.010> quarter<00:04:33.460> inch<00:04:33.870> drill<00:04:34.870> bit<00:04:34.930> and

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
took a quarter inch drill bit and
