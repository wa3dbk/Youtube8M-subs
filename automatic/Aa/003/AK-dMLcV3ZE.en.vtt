00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
changed that much i don't think so i

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.220 
changed that much i don't think so i
kind<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.300> think<00:00:33.420> that's<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.750> good<00:00:33.930> rule<00:00:34.170> of

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
kind of think that's a good rule of

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.110 
kind of think that's a good rule of
thumb<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.680> just<00:00:34.860> full<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.489> what<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.760> think<00:00:35.969> and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
thumb is just full of what you think and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.090 
thumb is just full of what you think and
then<00:00:36.239> hopefully<00:00:36.660> will<00:00:36.930> join<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.680> like<00:00:37.920> it

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
then hopefully will join in and like it

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.040 
then hopefully will join in and like it
also<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.520> i<00:00:38.550> think<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.910> way<00:00:39.120> rather<00:00:39.719> trying

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
also and i think that way rather trying

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.260 
also and i think that way rather trying
to<00:00:40.140> fix<00:00:40.379> something<00:00:40.530> on<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.399> mere<00:00:41.610> certain<00:00:42.059> sort

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
to fix something on a mere certain sort

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.299 
to fix something on a mere certain sort
of<00:00:42.329> people<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:43.020> just<00:00:43.050> can't<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.710> be<00:00:43.890> what

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
of people you just can't have to be what

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.860 
of people you just can't have to be what
you<00:00:44.430> listen<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.000> yourself<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.510> that's<00:00:45.600> all<00:00:45.780> i

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
you listen to yourself and that's all i

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.479 
you listen to yourself and that's all i
ever<00:00:45.960> do<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.350> i<00:00:46.559> hope<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.039> comes<00:00:47.340> across

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
ever do and i hope that comes across

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.130 
ever do and i hope that comes across
because<00:00:47.850> i<00:00:47.910> think<00:00:48.120> that's<00:00:48.300> what<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.780> Muppets

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
because i think that's what the Muppets

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.840 
because i think that's what the Muppets
to<00:00:49.289> me<00:00:49.410> are<00:00:49.559> about<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.039> idea<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.670> being

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
to me are about that idea of like being

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.670 
to me are about that idea of like being
tricked<00:00:50.969> yourself<00:00:51.120> i<00:00:51.449> guess<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.809> some<00:00:51.930> ways<00:00:51.989> so

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
tricked yourself i guess in some ways so

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.740 
tricked yourself i guess in some ways so
it<00:00:53.250> kind<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.520> falls<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.120> itself<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.660> and

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
it kind of falls in itself like that and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.450 
it kind of falls in itself like that and
i'm<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.350> pleased<00:00:55.620> with<00:00:55.649> how<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.920> turns<00:00:56.219> out

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
i'm really pleased with how it turns out

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.099 
i'm really pleased with how it turns out
cuz<00:00:56.640> i<00:00:56.670> feel<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.030> feels<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.329> has<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.510> heart

even<00:01:18.630> while<00:01:18.750> making<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> last<00:01:19.170> one<00:01:19.350> between<00:01:19.500> x

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
even while making the last one between x

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.289 
even while making the last one between x
plus<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:19.920> doing<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.130> one<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> idea

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
plus we doing this one and like the idea

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.940 
plus we doing this one and like the idea
of<00:01:21.360> starting<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:22.080> move<00:01:22.320> these<00:01:22.470> seconds

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
of starting this move these seconds

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.530
