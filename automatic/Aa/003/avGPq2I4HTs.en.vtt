and if you there's a quick look at our
six<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:58.010> a<00:00:58.100> half<00:00:58.129> gallons<00:00:58.760> of<00:00:58.879> sap<00:00:59.120> that<00:00:59.510> was

six and a half gallons of sap that was
boiled<00:01:00.379> down<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:02.769> to<00:01:03.769> filter<00:01:04.010> it<00:01:04.250> we're<00:01:04.489> going

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
boiled down and to filter it we're going

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.550 
boiled down and to filter it we're going
to<00:01:04.670> use<00:01:04.850> a<00:01:04.879> couple<00:01:05.330> of<00:01:05.659> different<00:01:06.170> items<00:01:08.560> some

strainer

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.520 
strainer
I<00:01:20.740> poured<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.800> boil<00:01:22.070> down<00:01:22.250> sap<00:01:22.640> into<00:01:23.360> the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
I poured the boil down sap into the

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.660 
I poured the boil down sap into the
coffee<00:01:24.530> filter<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:24.979> we'll<00:01:25.190> just<00:01:25.340> give<00:01:25.490> that<00:01:25.640> a

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
coffee filter and we'll just give that a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.020 
coffee filter and we'll just give that a
couple<00:01:25.880> minutes<00:01:26.090> to<00:01:26.390> strain<00:01:26.690> through<00:01:28.030> the

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
couple minutes to strain through the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.930 
couple minutes to strain through the
last<00:01:29.210> step<00:01:29.479> is<00:01:29.690> to<00:01:30.020> boil<00:01:30.259> the<00:01:30.500> SAP<00:01:30.729> until<00:01:31.729> it

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
last step is to boil the SAP until it

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.790 
last step is to boil the SAP until it
reaches<00:01:32.649> 220<00:01:33.649> degrees<00:01:34.009> and<00:01:35.000> then<00:01:35.570> we<00:01:35.780> pour<00:01:36.590> it

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
reaches 220 degrees and then we pour it

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.550 
reaches 220 degrees and then we pour it
into<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.130> bottle
