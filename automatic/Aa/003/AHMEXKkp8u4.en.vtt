I'll<00:04:39.700> go<00:04:39.790> to<00:04:39.850> add<00:04:40.290> mesh<00:04:42.360> monkey<00:04:44.190> sigh<00:04:45.190> of<00:04:45.250> a

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
I'll go to add mesh monkey sigh of a

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.400 
I'll go to add mesh monkey sigh of a
monkey<00:04:45.670> that<00:04:45.850> I<00:04:46.030> just<00:04:46.270> selected<00:04:46.690> which<00:04:47.170> was

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
monkey that I just selected which was

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.540 
monkey that I just selected which was
created<00:04:48.420> by<00:04:49.420> where<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:49.750> 3d<00:04:50.050> cursor<00:04:50.200> was<00:04:50.620> the

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
created by where the 3d cursor was the

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.960 
created by where the 3d cursor was the
3d<00:04:51.910> cursor<00:04:52.060> actually<00:04:53.100> was<00:04:54.100> right<00:04:54.730> in<00:04:54.850> the

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
3d cursor actually was right in the

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.000 
3d cursor actually was right in the
middle<00:04:55.120> of<00:04:55.300> it<00:04:56.640> so<00:04:57.640> when<00:04:57.790> i<00:04:57.820> zoom<00:04:57.880> in<00:04:58.330> and<00:04:59.010> press

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
middle of it so when i zoom in and press

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.970 
middle of it so when i zoom in and press
shift<00:05:00.370> and<00:05:00.670> move<00:05:01.170> it<00:05:02.170> over<00:05:02.260> just<00:05:02.650> a<00:05:02.740> little<00:05:02.770> bit

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
shift and move it over just a little bit

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.910 
shift and move it over just a little bit
and<00:05:03.340> zoom<00:05:04.000> in<00:05:04.120> further<00:05:04.330> you'll<00:05:05.320> see<00:05:05.560> that<00:05:05.740> that

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
and zoom in further you'll see that that

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.650 
and zoom in further you'll see that that
little<00:05:06.070> 3d<00:05:06.490> cursor<00:05:06.670> is<00:05:07.030> right<00:05:07.240> in<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.510> middle

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
little 3d cursor is right in the middle

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.340 
little 3d cursor is right in the middle
of<00:05:07.750> the<00:05:07.810> monkey<00:05:09.660> also<00:05:10.660> you<00:05:10.720> notice<00:05:10.930> that<00:05:11.230> this

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
of the monkey also you notice that this

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.960 
of the monkey also you notice that this
object<00:05:11.590> looks<00:05:12.040> different<00:05:12.460> when<00:05:12.670> we<00:05:12.820> had

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
object looks different when we had

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.680 
object looks different when we had
selected<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.600> cube<00:05:14.230> from<00:05:14.440> before<00:05:15.450> we<00:05:16.450> had<00:05:16.660> a

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
selected the cube from before we had a

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.110 
selected the cube from before we had a
pink<00:05:17.050> box<00:05:17.590> around<00:05:18.040> it<00:05:18.310> which<00:05:18.700> meant<00:05:18.970> it<00:05:19.060> was

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
pink box around it which meant it was

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.650 
pink box around it which meant it was
selected<00:05:19.660> now<00:05:20.440> we<00:05:20.980> have<00:05:21.160> these<00:05:21.310> little<00:05:21.660> yellow

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
selected now we have these little yellow

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.110 
selected now we have these little yellow
dots<00:05:23.020> that<00:05:23.290> are<00:05:23.350> vertices

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
dots that are vertices

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.050 
dots that are vertices
and<00:05:25.740> we<00:05:26.740> have<00:05:26.860> the<00:05:27.010> edges<00:05:27.400> that<00:05:27.610> are<00:05:27.669> yellow

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
and we have the edges that are yellow

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.969 
and we have the edges that are yellow
and<00:05:28.090> everything's<00:05:28.570> pretty<00:05:28.870> much<00:05:28.960> yellow<00:05:29.410> what

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
and everything's pretty much yellow what

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.280 
and everything's pretty much yellow what
that<00:05:30.130> means<00:05:30.430> is<00:05:30.639> we're<00:05:30.790> in<00:05:30.880> edit<00:05:31.180> mode<00:05:31.290> meaning

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
that means is we're in edit mode meaning

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.770 
that means is we're in edit mode meaning
we<00:05:32.710> could<00:05:32.889> go<00:05:33.040> in<00:05:33.250> and<00:05:33.460> move<00:05:34.000> vertices<00:05:34.479> around

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
we could go in and move vertices around

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.409 
we could go in and move vertices around
and<00:05:35.080> change<00:05:35.470> the<00:05:35.620> shape<00:05:35.770> of<00:05:35.979> our<00:05:36.070> object<00:05:36.520> we

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
and change the shape of our object we

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:38.580 
and change the shape of our object we
don't<00:05:37.479> want<00:05:37.660> to<00:05:37.720> do<00:05:37.840> that<00:05:37.870> right<00:05:38.050> now<00:05:38.199> that's<00:05:38.530> a

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
don't want to do that right now that's a

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.810 
don't want to do that right now that's a
little<00:05:38.770> bit<00:05:38.860> outside<00:05:38.979> of<00:05:39.220> the<00:05:39.370> scope<00:05:39.550> of<00:05:39.699> this

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
little bit outside of the scope of this

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.629 
little bit outside of the scope of this
lesson<00:05:40.060> what<00:05:41.050> I<00:05:41.080> do<00:05:41.199> want<00:05:41.470> to<00:05:41.620> do<00:05:41.800> is<00:05:42.160> show<00:05:42.580> you

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
lesson what I do want to do is show you

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.140 
lesson what I do want to do is show you
this<00:05:43.090> item<00:05:43.540> in<00:05:43.660> object<00:05:44.080> mode<00:05:44.729> which<00:05:45.729> is<00:05:45.970> what

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
this item in object mode which is what

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.180 
this item in object mode which is what
it<00:05:46.300> is<00:05:46.330> when<00:05:46.720> it<00:05:46.810> has<00:05:46.960> that<00:05:47.199> pink<00:05:47.470> line<00:05:48.010> all

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
it is when it has that pink line all

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.100 
it is when it has that pink line all
around<00:05:48.250> it<00:05:48.699> I'm<00:05:49.270> going<00:05:49.540> to<00:05:49.600> go<00:05:49.690> ahead<00:05:49.750> and<00:05:50.050> hit

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
around it I'm going to go ahead and hit

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.780 
around it I'm going to go ahead and hit
the<00:05:50.290> tab<00:05:50.530> key<00:05:52.590> so<00:05:53.590> now<00:05:53.770> you<00:05:53.830> can<00:05:54.040> see<00:05:54.280> it's<00:05:54.490> just

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
the tab key so now you can see it's just

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.330 
the tab key so now you can see it's just
selected<00:05:55.660> but<00:05:56.080> I<00:05:56.110> can't<00:05:56.229> change<00:05:56.530> anything<00:05:57.010> of

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
selected but I can't change anything of

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.909 
selected but I can't change anything of
it<00:05:57.460> because<00:05:57.550> it's<00:05:57.760> not<00:05:57.880> in<00:05:58.030> the<00:05:58.150> edit<00:05:58.389> mode<00:05:58.600> I

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
it because it's not in the edit mode I

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:05.710 
it because it's not in the edit mode I
can<00:05:59.919> move<00:06:00.370> it<00:06:01.350> by<00:06:02.350> selecting<00:06:02.530> these<00:06:02.919> arrows

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.780 

but<00:06:06.290> that's<00:06:06.470> about<00:06:06.710> all<00:06:06.770> I<00:06:06.950> can<00:06:07.040> do<00:06:07.340> I'll<00:06:07.640> go

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:07.790 
but that's about all I can do I'll go

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.210 
but that's about all I can do I'll go
ahead<00:06:07.880> and<00:06:07.970> escape<00:06:08.590> so<00:06:09.590> it<00:06:09.680> goes<00:06:09.860> right<00:06:10.040> back

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
ahead and escape so it goes right back

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.010 
ahead and escape so it goes right back
to<00:06:10.280> the<00:06:10.520> same<00:06:10.550> spot<00:06:10.910> it<00:06:11.150> was<00:06:11.300> before<00:06:12.700> okay

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
to the same spot it was before okay

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.610 
to the same spot it was before okay
so<00:06:15.650> that<00:06:15.800> was<00:06:15.949> a<00:06:15.979> brief<00:06:17.139> introduction<00:06:18.139> and

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
so that was a brief introduction and

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.729 
so that was a brief introduction and
thanks<00:06:19.520> a<00:06:19.610> lot
