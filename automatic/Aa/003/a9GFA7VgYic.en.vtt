00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.440
 technically skilled the day 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.590
 so today we will talk a little about what I did for five months in 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.370
 November 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.370
 moto-net com is the site 

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:14.229
 the community but especially 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.779
 so it's good to know michel hunault and he says 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.220
 so imagine a 3008 engine 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:25.749
 he approved the abolition 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.599
 is not a very fluctuating situation 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.599
 no special provision a bit like a crankshaft 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.280
 click here 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.150
 these particular provisions makes it special to your stats as 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.900
 reinforcement 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.410
 grocer 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.480
 the group is doing very well but he is being pursued 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.700
 and again that the time to take the traits 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.190
 it's very short 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.660
 beaurainville switching real bullets launched even faster 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.660
 what classic system of the automobile the piston pibrac 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.810
 for the system 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.380
 a little handicapped 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.460
 at the mo5 level pretty much like that 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.940
 I want because I have not had the right to redo exactly like this year 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.940
 besides we can not instructions any of this because 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.310
 according to the amendment the express the world 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.150
 not publish photos 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
 so he too 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.530
 how it works 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.020
 so a slide and so 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.050
 see 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.050
 a lumberjack that allow delicate to rub 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.460
 why the engine here so less 3 or 4 June that I believe is that the shots from 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.890
 joy are where 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.820
 the pirates are mounted in triangle 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.230
 the sector never acquired at a standstill it pushes everything goes to the bottom of 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.660
 wire rack 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.310
 the problem in a normal engine with a crankshaft is that when one is at 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.980
 dead point 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.980
 the other two pushing 60 degrees 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.320
 two fights 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.160
 a graffiti artist what is it 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.990
 in the meantime they have to make him climb for frau 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.210
 Eric Lapointe is being jerked the engine 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.380
 worked in fits and starts 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.380
 can you head to the chopping block that is made of the previous where the engine 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.910
 he did not come back but he believes 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.570
 I accept jerks with this system 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.719
 it is to show that the syrup especially to the parents 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.879
 the application made 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.869
 technology what to say 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:18.869
 dexia 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:21.189
 the six workers a game 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.900
 so it's not exactly 60 degrees of young people we're going to say we're nagging 41 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.169
 degrees of play 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:30.209
 and say that during that time while this engine the latter cited 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.050
 below 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.699
 in position for death 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:34.269
 I mean a people 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.269
 continued to push very neatly the operation 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:41.010
 he stops at every surfer showing himself very early 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.799
 I am wholeheartedly 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.949
 he adds that the engine is modified 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:48.949
 I think this world against 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:53.229
 to go on a normal diet 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:58.809
 if you want to laugh no landmark a new contract another 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:02.039
 it is aberrant of thumb when it is necessary for him to stalled others 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.039
 continue I do not speak only 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.829
 this system that is part of the game are tropics 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:14.559
 it's a bit like the same system that I did not have the right to come back from 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:16.189
 copy the system 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:18.509
 even though I made some pictures 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:21.909
 we simply have economic dum tek bullets 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.449
 more deaths than you can hear 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.579
 and the race only because the males are hard to pass 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.579
 because I was open school I did not change by drilling 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.759
 it's a little all alone 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.749
 but there is not a second account 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:44.749
 we have so many themes that with its magnitude against the other engine 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:48.849
 and the case only due to others 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.079
 because precisely an inscription 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.079
 at the level of a break 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.029
 why then and for this extraordinary counter that it works 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:02.979
 for once 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.329
 it breaks down to use 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.599
 and that without modification 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.749
 so I locked myself up with a prototype prototype for a month with Iran 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.729
 a kamako world switch 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.769
 surely the same music I listened differently to be able to 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.530
 put pictures and constructions 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.499
 we were at that of an engine 

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:24.569
 I copied not on the photos are more held by their gesture the voting rights 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:25.639
 to do 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.639
 stÃ©phane the instruction 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.709
 so for the power that it progresses as we say
