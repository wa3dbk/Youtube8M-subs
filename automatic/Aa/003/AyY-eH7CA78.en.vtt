00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.230 
your Ferro rod in and I just really like
the<00:01:10.090> Kydex<00:01:10.299> thought<00:01:10.659> is<00:01:10.840> I<00:01:10.869> mean<00:01:11.530> it<00:01:11.619> really

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
the Kydex thought is I mean it really

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.920

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.060 
show you that better
I<00:01:13.960> really<00:01:14.440> like<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.710> Codex<00:01:15.100> it<00:01:15.250> really<00:01:17.070> flips

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
I really like the Codex it really flips

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.520 
I really like the Codex it really flips
in<00:01:18.220> tight<00:01:18.550> and<00:01:18.970> this<00:01:19.060> thing<00:01:19.300> is<00:01:19.420> not<00:01:19.690> coming

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
in tight and this thing is not coming

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.890 
in tight and this thing is not coming
out<00:01:20.650> here<00:01:20.890> I<00:01:21.240> mean<00:01:22.240> I<00:01:22.330> don't<00:01:22.480> think<00:01:22.659> you<00:01:22.750> could

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
out here I mean I don't think you could

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.649 
out here I mean I don't think you could
sling<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:23.260> out<00:01:23.320> if<00:01:23.470> you<00:01:23.530> tried<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:25.360> other<00:01:25.510> one

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
sling it out if you tried the other one

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:26.790 
sling it out if you tried the other one
you<00:01:25.750> can<00:01:25.780> drop<00:01:26.110> it<00:01:26.200> a<00:01:26.229> couple<00:01:26.409> of<00:01:26.500> times<00:01:26.650> it

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
you can drop it a couple of times it

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.250 
you can drop it a couple of times it
fall<00:01:26.979> out<00:01:27.010> so<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:28.540> pretty<00:01:28.690> tight<00:01:28.930> but<00:01:29.140> it

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
fall out so it's pretty tight but it

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.930 
fall out so it's pretty tight but it
does<00:01:29.380> fit<00:01:29.590> well<00:01:29.740> you<00:01:30.250> got<00:01:30.400> any<00:01:30.520> experience
