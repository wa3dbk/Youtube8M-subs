00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.449 
in there now what's going to happen is
these<00:02:19.080> seeds<00:02:19.410> are<00:02:19.500> going<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.800> ferment<00:02:20.069> in<00:02:20.280> here

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
these seeds are going to ferment in here

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.910 
these seeds are going to ferment in here
and<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.790> fermentation<00:02:21.209> process<00:02:21.599> will<00:02:22.590> if<00:02:22.800> I

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
and the fermentation process will if I

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.800 
and the fermentation process will if I
can<00:02:23.099> grab<00:02:23.310> one<00:02:23.340> out<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.790> show<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.690> the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
can grab one out to show you so the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.540 
can grab one out to show you so the
fermentation<00:02:25.140> process<00:02:25.440> breaks<00:02:26.099> down<00:02:26.340> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
fermentation process breaks down the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.949 
fermentation process breaks down the
little<00:02:26.700> gel<00:02:26.970> sack<00:02:27.180> around<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.630> outside<00:02:27.930> of

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
little gel sack around the outside of

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.839 
little gel sack around the outside of
the<00:02:28.140> seed<00:02:28.349> leaving<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.069> with<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> nice<00:02:29.459> clean

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
the seed leaving you with a nice clean

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.670 
the seed leaving you with a nice clean
looking<00:02:30.209> seed<00:02:30.540> pretty<00:02:31.080> much<00:02:31.230> warlock<00:02:31.530> has

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
looking seed pretty much warlock has

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.500 
looking seed pretty much warlock has
just<00:02:31.890> come<00:02:32.040> out<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.340> commercial<00:02:32.580> packet<00:02:33.090> so

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
just come out of a commercial packet so

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.970 
just come out of a commercial packet so
these<00:02:33.720> seeds<00:02:34.050> here<00:02:34.319> there's<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.650> fair<00:02:34.800> bit<00:02:34.950> of

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
these seeds here there's a fair bit of

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.530 
these seeds here there's a fair bit of
liquid<00:02:35.220> in<00:02:35.459> there<00:02:35.610> but<00:02:35.790> what<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:35.970> might<00:02:36.209> do<00:02:36.390> is

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
liquid in there but what I might do is

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.210 
liquid in there but what I might do is
just<00:02:36.569> add<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> little<00:02:37.260> bit<00:02:37.380> more<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.040> will

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
just add a little bit more and that will

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.680 
just add a little bit more and that will
just<00:02:38.400> stop<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.700> seeds<00:02:38.940> from<00:02:39.090> drying<00:02:39.420> out<00:02:39.630> and

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
just stop the seeds from drying out and

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.720 
just stop the seeds from drying out and
keep<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.110> fermentation<00:02:40.319> process<00:02:40.830> humming

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
keep the fermentation process humming

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.880 
keep the fermentation process humming
along<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.510> what<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:42.810> like<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.230> do<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.500> just<00:02:43.680> put<00:02:43.860> a

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
along so what I like to do is just put a

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.860 
along so what I like to do is just put a
lid<00:02:44.040> on<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.489> because<00:02:45.209> it's<00:02:45.480> going<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:45.780> the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
lid on it and because it's going in the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.120 
lid on it and because it's going in the
kitchen<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.230> will<00:02:46.410> just<00:02:46.560> stop<00:02:46.709> any<00:02:46.860> foul

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
kitchen that will just stop any foul

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.190 
kitchen that will just stop any foul
odors<00:02:47.519> they<00:02:48.180> don't<00:02:48.390> really<00:02:48.540> smell<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:49.019> much

sitting<00:02:54.209> for<00:02:54.299> two<00:02:54.540> or<00:02:54.630> three<00:02:54.840> days<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.170> becomes

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
sitting for two or three days it becomes

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.900 
sitting for two or three days it becomes
fairly<00:02:55.650> obvious<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.250> they've<00:02:56.400> started<00:02:56.640> to

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
fairly obvious that they've started to

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.309 
fairly obvious that they've started to
ferment<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.390> end<00:02:57.540> up<00:02:57.630> with<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.810> white<00:02:58.019> layer

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
ferment you end up with a white layer

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.199 
ferment you end up with a white layer
over<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.739> top<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.280> seeds<00:02:59.519> and<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.880> liquid

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
over the top of the seeds and the liquid

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.059 
over the top of the seeds and the liquid
and<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.930> pretty<00:03:01.170> much<00:03:01.319> will<00:03:01.470> shows<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.920> that

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
and that pretty much will shows you that

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.100 
and that pretty much will shows you that
there's<00:03:02.280> an<00:03:02.430> active<00:03:02.580> colony<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.330> yeast<00:03:03.930> and

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
there's an active colony of yeast and

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.600 
there's an active colony of yeast and
bacteria<00:03:04.590> in<00:03:04.709> there<00:03:04.860> breaking<00:03:05.160> down<00:03:05.430> those

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
bacteria in there breaking down those

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.250 
bacteria in there breaking down those
gel<00:03:05.880> sacks<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.450> when<00:03:06.599> it<00:03:06.690> comes<00:03:06.870> time<00:03:07.080> to

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
gel sacks so when it comes time to

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.870 
gel sacks so when it comes time to
collect<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.620> seed<00:03:07.860> it's<00:03:08.099> very<00:03:08.340> easy<00:03:08.580> all<00:03:08.790> you

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
collect the seed it's very easy all you

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.430 
collect the seed it's very easy all you
need<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.299> do<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.510> add<00:03:09.660> some<00:03:09.690> extra<00:03:10.140> water<00:03:10.290> to

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
need to do is add some extra water to

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.229 
need to do is add some extra water to
the<00:03:10.650> jar<00:03:10.890> give<00:03:11.489> it<00:03:11.580> a<00:03:11.640> bit<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.880> swish<00:03:12.120> around

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
the jar give it a bit of a swish around

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.850 
the jar give it a bit of a swish around
break<00:03:12.630> up<00:03:12.780> all<00:03:12.900> that<00:03:13.019> mold<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.590> get<00:03:13.680> the

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
break up all that mold and get the

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.830 
break up all that mold and get the
little<00:03:14.250> bits<00:03:14.519> of<00:03:14.640> pulp<00:03:14.910> floating<00:03:15.360> around<00:03:15.450> and

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
little bits of pulp floating around and

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.630 
little bits of pulp floating around and
then<00:03:16.230> pour<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.650> off<00:03:16.799> you'll<00:03:17.069> find<00:03:17.310> all<00:03:17.489> the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
then pour it off you'll find all the

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.220 
then pour it off you'll find all the
good<00:03:17.790> viable<00:03:18.120> seeds<00:03:18.540> will<00:03:18.750> sink<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:19.140> the

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
good viable seeds will sink to the

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.720 
good viable seeds will sink to the
bottom<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.040> just<00:03:20.190> repeat<00:03:20.519> that<00:03:20.549> process

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
bottom and you just repeat that process

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.210 
bottom and you just repeat that process
three<00:03:21.329> or<00:03:21.450> four<00:03:21.630> times<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.950> pretty<00:03:23.130> much

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
three or four times and that pretty much

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.220 
three or four times and that pretty much
will<00:03:23.519> takes<00:03:23.760> all<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.180> crud<00:03:24.510> out<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.959> jar

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
will takes all the crud out of the jar

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.229 
will takes all the crud out of the jar
then<00:03:25.680> all<00:03:25.829> I<00:03:25.859> do<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.310> put<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.519> sit<00:03:26.760> over<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.120> end

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
then all I do is put a sit over the end

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.819 
then all I do is put a sit over the end
of<00:03:27.359> its<00:03:27.510> train<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.989> rest<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.350> liquid<00:03:28.709> out

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
of its train the rest of the liquid out

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.890 
of its train the rest of the liquid out
and<00:03:29.069> then<00:03:29.609> scoop<00:03:30.120> out<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.299> seeds<00:03:30.420> with<00:03:30.780> my

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
and then scoop out the seeds with my

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.960 
and then scoop out the seeds with my
fingers<00:03:31.290> put<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.799> on<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:32.100> little<00:03:32.280> plate<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.730> dry

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
fingers put it on a little plate to dry

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.000 
fingers put it on a little plate to dry
and<00:03:33.239> there<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.690> go<00:03:33.840> so<00:03:34.500> these<00:03:34.650> are<00:03:34.829> some<00:03:34.980> of

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
and there you go so these are some of

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.620 
and there you go so these are some of
the<00:03:35.100> brain<00:03:35.310> tomato<00:03:35.640> seeds<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.150> just<00:03:36.359> saw<00:03:36.480> me

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
the brain tomato seeds you just saw me

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.630 
the brain tomato seeds you just saw me
clean<00:03:36.930> out<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.410> jar<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.190> these<00:03:38.430> are<00:03:38.579> the

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
clean out of the jar and these are the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.370 
clean out of the jar and these are the
ones<00:03:38.819> from<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.209> photo<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:39.900> posted<00:03:40.260> on

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
ones from the photo that I posted on

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.530 
ones from the photo that I posted on
Instagram<00:03:40.410> pretty<00:03:41.370> much<00:03:41.519> more<00:03:41.700> dry<00:03:41.940> now<00:03:42.180> so

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
Instagram pretty much more dry now so

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.660 
Instagram pretty much more dry now so
when<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.780> comes<00:03:42.959> time<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.260> store<00:03:44.220> these<00:03:44.430> little

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
when it comes time to store these little

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.160 
when it comes time to store these little
guys<00:03:44.819> what<00:03:45.150> I<00:03:45.180> like<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.569> do<00:03:45.690> is<00:03:45.810> put<00:03:45.959> them<00:03:46.049> in

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
guys what I like to do is put them in

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.080 
guys what I like to do is put them in
little<00:03:46.350> ziplock<00:03:46.739> baggies<00:03:47.100> as<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.760> can<00:03:47.910> see

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
little ziplock baggies as you can see

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.660 
little ziplock baggies as you can see
their<00:03:48.329> brain<00:03:48.630> tomato<00:03:49.049> collected<00:03:49.709> June<00:03:49.920> 2015

their brain tomato collected June 2015

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.970 
their brain tomato collected June 2015
lets<00:03:51.600> people<00:03:51.780> know<00:03:52.079> who<00:03:52.290> received<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.739> seeds

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
lets people know who received the seeds

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.340 
lets people know who received the seeds
how<00:03:53.190> old<00:03:53.430> they<00:03:53.579> are<00:03:53.609> just<00:03:54.359> grab<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.540> few<00:03:54.810> seeds

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
how old they are just grab a few seeds

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.170 
how old they are just grab a few seeds
I<00:03:55.500> don't<00:03:56.069> really<00:03:56.160> count<00:03:56.430> them<00:03:56.639> out<00:03:56.760> just<00:03:57.030> a

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
I don't really count them out just a

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.660 
I don't really count them out just a
pinch<00:03:57.780> full<00:03:58.019> and<00:03:58.650> they<00:03:58.769> go<00:03:58.920> in<00:03:59.069> the<00:03:59.160> baggie<00:03:59.340> and

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
pinch full and they go in the baggie and

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.129 
pinch full and they go in the baggie and
they'll<00:04:00.000> go<00:04:00.120> off<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.420> their<00:04:00.569> new<00:04:00.720> home<00:04:00.900> soon

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
they'll go off to their new home soon

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.530 
they'll go off to their new home soon
enough<00:04:01.440> so<00:04:01.680> that's<00:04:02.250> pretty<00:04:02.549> much<00:04:02.639> all<00:04:02.970> there

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
enough so that's pretty much all there

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.539 
enough so that's pretty much all there
is<00:04:03.600> to<00:04:03.750> collecting<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:04.739> saving<00:04:05.069> these<00:04:05.190> tomato

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
is to collecting and saving these tomato

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.610 
is to collecting and saving these tomato
seeds<00:04:05.940> so<00:04:06.540> there<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:06.810> go<00:04:06.959> I<00:04:06.989> hope<00:04:07.200> that<00:04:07.380> helps

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
seeds so there you go I hope that helps

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.140 
seeds so there you go I hope that helps
the<00:04:07.709> folks<00:04:07.950> out<00:04:08.160> who<00:04:08.370> were<00:04:08.489> interested<00:04:09.030> in

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.599 
seeing how I saved these seeds now just
quickly<00:04:12.600> to<00:04:12.959> when<00:04:13.380> you're<00:04:13.620> saving<00:04:13.889> seeds<00:04:14.340> it

quickly to when you're saving seeds it

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.550 
quickly to when you're saving seeds it
does<00:04:14.819> pay<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.150> only<00:04:15.630> say<00:04:15.930> from<00:04:15.989> heirloom

is a maybe a fast producer and the
second<00:04:59.760> one<00:04:59.880> because<00:05:00.210> it'll<00:05:00.419> give<00:05:00.630> consistent

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
second one because it'll give consistent

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.530 
second one because it'll give consistent
size<00:05:01.860> fruit<00:05:02.280> they<00:05:02.730> cross<00:05:03.030> them<00:05:03.240> they<00:05:03.360> get<00:05:03.480> a

size fruit they cross them they get a

other<00:05:06.000> things<00:05:06.330> are<00:05:06.480> sacrifice<00:05:06.990> like<00:05:07.440> flavor

just bring you down here and show you
where<00:05:51.630> it's<00:05:51.840> growing<00:05:52.200> from<00:05:52.530> it's<00:05:53.400> growing<00:05:53.850> out

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
where it's growing from it's growing out

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.090 
where it's growing from it's growing out
of<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:54.270> pavers<00:05:54.780> believe<00:05:55.560> it<00:05:55.680> or<00:05:55.770> not<00:05:55.890> there's

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
of the pavers believe it or not there's

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.529 
of the pavers believe it or not there's
a<00:05:56.160> couple<00:05:56.190> of<00:05:56.460> papers<00:05:56.850> it's<00:05:57.000> just<00:05:57.210> growing<00:05:57.390> out

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
a couple of papers it's just growing out

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:59.630 
a couple of papers it's just growing out
of<00:05:57.570> a<00:05:57.720> crack<00:05:58.350> there<00:05:58.380> I<00:05:58.770> actually<00:05:59.160> think<00:05:59.490> it

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
of a crack there I actually think it

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.860 
of a crack there I actually think it
might<00:05:59.760> be<00:05:59.789> two<00:06:00.030> plants<00:06:00.270> there's<00:06:00.539> one<00:06:00.660> there

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
might be two plants there's one there

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.830 
might be two plants there's one there
and<00:06:01.050> one<00:06:01.110> there<00:06:02.010> so<00:06:02.220> all<00:06:03.120> this<00:06:03.360> fruit<00:06:03.630> is

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
and one there so all this fruit is

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.409 
and one there so all this fruit is
coming<00:06:04.110> from<00:06:04.169> those<00:06:04.350> two<00:06:05.039> plants<00:06:05.280> so<00:06:06.150> I

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
coming from those two plants so I

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:07.850 
coming from those two plants so I
correct<00:06:06.780> myself

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
correct myself

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.010 
correct myself
