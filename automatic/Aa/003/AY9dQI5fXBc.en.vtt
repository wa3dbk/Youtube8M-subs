was discovered is derived from something

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.700 
was discovered is derived from something
called<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:30.090> mother<00:00:30.390> virus<00:00:30.929> now<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.260> mother

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
called the mother virus now the mother

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.130 
called the mother virus now the mother
virus<00:00:32.250> was<00:00:32.579> discovered<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.390> an<00:00:33.510> oversized

virus was discovered in an oversized
queen<00:00:34.620> ant<00:00:35.390> but<00:00:36.829> about<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.070> big<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.430> an<00:00:38.520> egg

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.729 
queen ant but about that big of an egg
that's<00:00:39.270> probably<00:00:39.629> just<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.930> outside<00:00:40.410> that's

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
that's probably just the outside that's

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.630 
that's probably just the outside that's
pretty<00:00:41.070> scary

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
pretty scary

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.299 
pretty scary
however<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.899> ant<00:00:43.200> was<00:00:43.649> discovered<00:00:44.160> in

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
however this ant was discovered in

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.170 
however this ant was discovered in
Africa<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.809> either<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.530> 40s<00:00:47.100> or<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.370> 60s<00:00:48.059> I

don't<00:00:48.390> remember<00:00:48.570> which<00:00:49.280> but<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.550> game

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
don't remember which but in the game

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.330 
don't remember which but in the game
that's<00:00:51.360> where<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:51.930> discovered<00:00:52.440> later<00:00:53.070> on

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
that's where it was discovered later on

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.029 
that's where it was discovered later on
they<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:53.850> they<00:00:54.180> injected<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.960> mother<00:00:55.440> virus

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
they just they injected the mother virus

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.790 
they just they injected the mother virus
or<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.480> progenitor<00:00:57.480> virus<00:00:57.660> whichever<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.680> was

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
or the progenitor virus whichever it was

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.670 
or the progenitor virus whichever it was
called<00:00:59.100> into<00:00:59.699> a<00:01:00.539> young<00:01:00.750> test<00:01:01.109> subject<00:01:01.500> named

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
called into a young test subject named

Lisa<00:01:02.010> Trevor<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.640> where<00:01:02.940> they<00:01:03.059> derives

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
Lisa Trevor this is where they derives

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.119 
Lisa Trevor this is where they derives
the<00:01:03.629> t-virus<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.439> therefore<00:01:04.799> that's<00:01:04.979> where

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
the t-virus and therefore that's where

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.070 
the t-virus and therefore that's where
the<00:01:05.220> drug<00:01:05.430> derived<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.299> rest<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.630> viruses

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the drug derived the rest of the viruses

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.990 
the drug derived the rest of the viruses
in<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> game<00:01:07.439> with<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.770> exception<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.369> los

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
in the game with the exception of los

in the game with the exception of los
profetas

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
profetas

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.600 
profetas
now<00:01:11.330> it<00:01:12.330> makes<00:01:13.170> perfect<00:01:13.920> sense<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.430> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
now it makes perfect sense that a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.399 
now it makes perfect sense that a
Resident<00:01:14.970> Evil<00:01:15.180> game<00:01:15.360> would<00:01:15.570> eventually<00:01:15.930> show

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
Resident Evil game would eventually show

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.560 
Resident Evil game would eventually show
up<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.770> Africa<00:01:17.490> then<00:01:17.700> because<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.330> where

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
up in Africa then because that is where

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.350 
up in Africa then because that is where
the<00:01:18.810> virus<00:01:19.159> essentially<00:01:20.159> came<00:01:20.549> from<00:01:21.830> also

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
the virus essentially came from also

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.820 
the virus essentially came from also
Chris<00:01:24.360> Redfield<00:01:24.810> being<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> lead<00:01:25.350> character

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
Chris Redfield being the lead character

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.320 
Chris Redfield being the lead character
and<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.979> also<00:01:26.220> makes<00:01:26.580> sense<00:01:26.850> because<00:01:27.030> not<00:01:27.299> only

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
and it also makes sense because not only

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.600 
and it also makes sense because not only
was<00:01:27.720> he<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.259> lead<00:01:28.590> male<00:01:28.860> character<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
was he the lead male character in the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.850 
was he the lead male character in the
original<00:01:30.270> game<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.439> first<00:01:31.710> one

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
original game that is the first one

original game that is the first one
before<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.430> an<00:01:32.579> evil<00:01:32.850> zero<00:01:33.030> came<00:01:33.390> out<00:01:33.979> but<00:01:34.979> his

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
before is an evil zero came out but his

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259

Veronica code Veronica is the game that

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.249 
Veronica code Veronica is the game that
revealed<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.250> proof<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.600> virus<00:01:42.960> came

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
revealed the proof that the virus came

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.340 
revealed the proof that the virus came
from<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.829> ant<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.369> found<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.909> Africa<00:01:45.479> which<00:01:46.320> is

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
from the ant I found in Africa which is

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.889 
from the ant I found in Africa which is
also<00:01:47.009> incidentally<00:01:47.670> why<00:01:47.880> Alexia's<00:01:48.479> favorite

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
also incidentally why Alexia's favorite

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.920 
also incidentally why Alexia's favorite
relatives<00:01:49.320> are<00:01:49.500> ants<00:01:51.229> anyways<00:01:53.390> this<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.689> why

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
relatives are ants anyways this is why

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.100 
relatives are ants anyways this is why
the<00:01:54.990> game<00:01:55.350> makes<00:01:55.649> sense<00:01:56.299> this<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.509> why<00:01:57.689> it's<00:01:57.930> in

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
the game makes sense this is why it's in

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.109 
the game makes sense this is why it's in
Africa<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.070> fact<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.520> Chris<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.939> there

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
Africa and the fact that Chris is there

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.789 
Africa and the fact that Chris is there
makes<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.570> lot<00:02:00.719> more<00:02:00.750> sense<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.590> top<00:02:01.770> of

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
makes a lot more sense and on top of

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.789 
makes a lot more sense and on top of
that<00:02:02.090> that<00:02:03.090> characters<00:02:03.659> been<00:02:03.840> seen<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.409> two
