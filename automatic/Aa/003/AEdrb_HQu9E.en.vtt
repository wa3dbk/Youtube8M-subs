00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.049
 welcome to the matiz 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.420
 Studying music today is little more 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.190
 woodwind clarinet in front 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.490
 While I've ever played saxophone 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.470
 are so many would have worked 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.260
 I have three of the trumpet myself 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.180
 valves everything on more than 3 flaps 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.930
 is a bit suspicious but I'm looking 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.190
 I'll do it myself 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.260
 yes, I'm here with Herr Bus now 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.500
 arc they we will now no metal 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.090
 bring a little taster lesson 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.980
 Now I have to do the thing 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.160
 Three share it assemble yes exactly 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.090
 now just take it then you can 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.480
 We also about the sound production 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.040
 I'll take his mouth 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.040
 the incisors are on top of it 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.890
 the hot air on the map is coming 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.290
 the sound came off by doing this 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.420
 Wooden board will take that up 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.760
 mounted on the property however 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.130
 we have to get it wet first 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.790
 means I'm going to pretend so easy 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.740
 sucked and from all sides so 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.210
 and then we put that with the flat one 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.210
 side do not taste that 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.520
 push the tip of the tongue on top of it 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.010
 actually put that would be but now 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.940
 again a topic what you 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:43.090
 plays here rather in the object 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.090
 but it sounds like it's sorting 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.150
 a 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.310
 Of course, I'm interested in what I 've got 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.150
 I made myself very well so for 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.170
 a first already that is not 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.760
 Of course, that's my first 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.290
 hour all my ducky dirt plays 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.850
 maybe with the adult 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.770
 make it easier than with one 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.600
 little child where you catch but I am 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.030
 content of myself as a trumpeter 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.260
 where say so three valves are honest enough 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.150
 said with the whole flaps 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.830
 that's not my thing to say to me 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.500
 have that synonymous with the saxophone 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.270
 I'll stick with it 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.100
 I would say three valves 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.319
 see us when it's called martins again 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.319
 music lesson with the trumpet
