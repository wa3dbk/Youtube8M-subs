really<00:00:02.610> tough<00:00:02.850> nothing<00:00:03.389> works<00:00:03.629> on<00:00:03.750> ham<00:00:03.840> except

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
really tough nothing works on ham except

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.099 
really tough nothing works on ham except
for<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.380> big<00:00:04.589> name<00:00:04.770> and<00:00:05.540> evening<00:00:06.540> it<00:00:06.600> does<00:00:06.810> just

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
for a big name and evening it does just

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.120 
for a big name and evening it does just
a<00:00:07.200> little<00:00:07.440> bit<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.589> damage

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
a little bit of damage

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.959 
a little bit of damage
swords<00:00:08.880> barely<00:00:09.300> do<00:00:09.420> anything<00:00:09.660> absolutely<00:00:10.969> see

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
swords barely do anything absolutely see

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.150 
swords barely do anything absolutely see
only<00:00:12.420> 20<00:00:12.990> damage<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.500> he<00:00:13.620> actually<00:00:13.799> can

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
only 20 damage and he actually can

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.079 
only 20 damage and he actually can
damage<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.549> quite<00:00:14.759> easily

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
damage you quite easily

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.370 
damage you quite easily
so<00:00:15.660> basically<00:00:16.170> dodge<00:00:16.730> dodge<00:00:17.900> fire<00:00:19.789> dodge

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
so basically dodge dodge fire dodge

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.880 
so basically dodge dodge fire dodge
dodge<00:00:22.460> wait<00:00:23.460> for<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.910> recharge<00:00:24.769> helps<00:00:25.769> to

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
dodge wait for it to recharge helps to

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.470 
dodge wait for it to recharge helps to
have<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.070> lot<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.369> stamina<00:00:26.580> regeneration<00:00:26.820> and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
have a lot of stamina regeneration and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.429 
have a lot of stamina regeneration and
fire<00:00:28.760> hundred<00:00:29.760> damage<00:00:30.140> it<00:00:31.140> will<00:00:31.260> probably

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
fire hundred damage it will probably

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.400 
fire hundred damage it will probably
take<00:00:31.679> maybe<00:00:32.009> 11<00:00:32.399> or<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.700> or<00:00:32.880> cause<00:00:33.090> hits<00:00:33.420> before

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
take maybe 11 or so or cause hits before

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.040 
take maybe 11 or so or cause hits before
he<00:00:34.649> goes<00:00:34.770> down<00:00:35.010> but<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.670> have<00:00:36.540> not<00:00:36.690> found<00:00:36.899> an

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
he goes down but I have not found an

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.690 
he goes down but I have not found an
easier<00:00:37.320> way<00:00:37.440> yet<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.829> can<00:00:37.950> also<00:00:38.129> use<00:00:38.460> your

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
easier way yet you can also use your

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.479 
easier way yet you can also use your
Quinn<00:00:39.260> although<00:00:40.260> he<00:00:40.829> doesn't<00:00:41.129> really<00:00:41.250> get

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
Quinn although he doesn't really get

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.710 

this<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.280> not<00:01:29.580> it<00:01:29.760> this<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.150> not<00:01:30.330> just<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.540> bear

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
this is not it this is not just a bear

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.969

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
and surprisingly nothing works there I

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.620 
and surprisingly nothing works there I
mean<00:01:35.680> no<00:01:35.829> sword<00:01:36.100> works<00:01:36.310> again<00:01:36.610> it<00:01:37.299> helps<00:01:37.450> to

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
mean no sword works again it helps to

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.380 
mean no sword works again it helps to
have<00:01:38.159> come<00:01:39.159> up<00:01:39.280> with<00:01:39.310> a<00:01:39.430> range<00:01:39.670> weapon<00:01:40.030> why<00:01:40.329> is

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
have come up with a range weapon why is

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.090 
have come up with a range weapon why is
this<00:01:40.719> point<00:01:41.049> in<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.229> game<00:01:41.259> it<00:01:41.560> might<00:01:41.679> easier

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
this point in the game it might easier

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.660 
this point in the game it might easier
like<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:42.909> bomb<00:01:43.210> or<00:01:43.420> something<00:01:43.630> or<00:01:43.929> a<00:01:44.740> crossbow

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
like a bomb or something or a crossbow

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.940 
like a bomb or something or a crossbow
but<00:01:45.700> if<00:01:46.119> you're<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.420> if<00:01:47.079> you<00:01:47.170> still<00:01:47.409> do<00:01:47.829> like

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
but if you're and if you still do like

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.850 
but if you're and if you still do like
myself<00:01:48.929> if<00:01:49.929> you're<00:01:50.110> still<00:01:50.380> in<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.560> beginning

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
myself if you're still in the beginning

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.499 
myself if you're still in the beginning
of<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.009> game<00:01:51.159> there's<00:01:51.909> really<00:01:52.119> nothing<00:01:52.450> else

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
of the game there's really nothing else

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.590 
of the game there's really nothing else
you<00:01:52.630> can<00:01:52.780> do<00:01:52.899> just<00:01:53.229> basically<00:01:53.590> dodge<00:01:54.009> him<00:01:54.280> and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
you can do just basically dodge him and

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.590 
you can do just basically dodge him and
Piggy<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:56.969> Don<00:01:57.969> Jim<00:01:59.729> done<00:02:00.729> Jim<00:02:00.939> some<00:02:01.179> more<00:02:01.360> and

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
Piggy and Don Jim done Jim some more and

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.980 
Piggy and Don Jim done Jim some more and
eat<00:02:02.020> me<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:04.090> basically<00:02:04.329> this<00:02:04.689> is<00:02:04.750> really

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
eat me so basically this is really

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.149 
eat me so basically this is really
nothing<00:02:05.110> else<00:02:05.349> you<00:02:05.439> can<00:02:05.530> do<00:02:05.679> blocks<00:02:05.979> don't

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
nothing else you can do blocks don't

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.180 
nothing else you can do blocks don't
work<00:02:06.490> nothing<00:02:06.640> else<00:02:06.880> works

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.950 

and<00:02:11.850> sometimes<00:02:12.180> if<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.360> like<00:02:12.600> you'll<00:02:12.810> set

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
and sometimes if you like you'll set

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.660 
and sometimes if you like you'll set
them<00:02:13.050> on<00:02:13.110> fire<00:02:13.320> you<00:02:13.830> have<00:02:13.860> extra<00:02:14.250> seconds<00:02:14.580> to

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
them on fire you have extra seconds to

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.120 
them on fire you have extra seconds to
