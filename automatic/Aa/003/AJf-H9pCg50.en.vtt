punch ankle but we do have to cut up in
there<00:01:26.100> that's<00:01:26.369> gonna<00:01:26.580> eliminate<00:01:26.820> maybe<00:01:27.630> 70<00:01:28.080> 75

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
there that's gonna eliminate maybe 70 75

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.910 
there that's gonna eliminate maybe 70 75
percent<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.340> need<00:01:29.520> for<00:01:29.549> pre<00:01:30.030> punch<00:01:30.270> ankles

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920

also we have the hooks that are set back

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.480 
also we have the hooks that are set back
usually<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> hooks<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.079> case<00:01:37.320> before<00:01:37.560> or

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
usually the hooks on this case before or

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.370 
usually the hooks on this case before or
up<00:01:38.610> here<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.329> them<00:01:39.509> set<00:01:39.750> back<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.140> such<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
up here we have them set back in such a

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.830 
up here we have them set back in such a
way<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.310> works<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.640> De<00:01:41.850> Niro<00:01:42.030> ankles<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
way that it works for De Niro ankles and

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.420 
way that it works for De Niro ankles and
also<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.290> works<00:01:43.439> for<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.770> wider<00:01:43.950> ankles

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
also it works for the wider ankles

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.249 
also it works for the wider ankles
because<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.000> know<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.509> skating<00:01:45.930> there's<00:01:46.200> a

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259

lot of kids that have skinny ankles so

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.480 
lot of kids that have skinny ankles so
they<00:01:48.720> need<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.079> security<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.189> wrap<00:01:50.340> from

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
they need that security of the wrap from

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.969 
they need that security of the wrap from
there<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.909> for<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.570> wider<00:01:51.720> ankles<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.710> still

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
there and for the wider ankles you still

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.580 
there and for the wider ankles you still
have<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.340> material<00:01:53.909> coming<00:01:54.329> around<00:01:54.659> here<00:01:54.960> to

give<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.100> extra<00:01:56.219> wrap<00:01:56.689> we<00:01:57.689> also<00:01:57.840> have

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
give you that extra wrap we also have

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.380 
give you that extra wrap we also have
the<00:01:58.439> softer<00:01:58.890> top<00:01:59.130> lines<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.850> teeth<00:02:00.090> as<00:02:00.270> you

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the softer top lines the teeth as you

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.450 
the softer top lines the teeth as you
can<00:02:00.570> see<00:02:00.750> there<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.170> helps<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.130> lock<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
can see there that helps to lock the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.670 
can see there that helps to lock the
tongue<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:02.820> place<00:02:03.090> better<00:02:03.750> over<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.469> top<00:02:04.649> of

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
tongue in place better over the top of

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.170 
tongue in place better over the top of
the<00:02:04.950> foot<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.250> give<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.520> better<00:02:05.670> wrap<00:02:05.969> over

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
the foot to give you a better wrap over

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.619 
the foot to give you a better wrap over
the<00:02:06.299> top<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.869> foot<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.350> we<00:02:07.710> also<00:02:07.860> added

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
the top of the foot and we also added

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.010 
the top of the foot and we also added
stitching<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.750> here<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:10.920> not

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
stitching in here it's it's just not

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.690 
stitching in here it's it's just not
it's<00:02:13.020> more<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.470> lock<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.830> reinforcements<00:02:14.580> in

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
it's more to lock the reinforcements in

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.090 
it's more to lock the reinforcements in
there<00:02:14.850> because<00:02:15.360> sometimes<00:02:15.930> at<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:16.800> level

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
there because sometimes at this level

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.040 
there because sometimes at this level
especially<00:02:17.460> it's<00:02:17.970> an<00:02:18.090> intermediate<00:02:18.390> level

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
especially it's an intermediate level

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.960 
especially it's an intermediate level
and<00:02:19.110> sometimes<00:02:19.380> people<00:02:19.740> get<00:02:20.010> over<00:02:20.640> fitted

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
and sometimes people get over fitted

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.360 
and sometimes people get over fitted
because<00:02:21.060> you're<00:02:21.390> looking<00:02:21.540> at<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> younger

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
because you're looking at a younger

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.590 
because you're looking at a younger
person<00:02:23.370> that's<00:02:23.580> just<00:02:23.670> getting<00:02:24.120> into<00:02:24.330> skating

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
person that's just getting into skating

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.600 
person that's just getting into skating
and<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:25.020> lot<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.410> times<00:02:25.710> people<00:02:25.950> want<00:02:26.250> growth

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
and a lot of times people want growth

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.480 
and a lot of times people want growth
room<00:02:26.850> especially<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.630> level<00:02:27.900> here<00:02:28.490> while

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
room especially in that level here while

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.850 
room especially in that level here while
stitching<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.350> reinforcements<00:02:31.350> down<00:02:31.680> in

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
stitching the reinforcements down in

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.860 
stitching the reinforcements down in
there<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.580> actually<00:02:32.700> helps<00:02:33.270> even<00:02:33.540> if<00:02:33.660> they<00:02:33.810> do

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
there it actually helps even if they do

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.690 
there it actually helps even if they do
have<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.170> little<00:02:34.380> growth<00:02:34.680> room<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.280> avoid<00:02:35.550> the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
have a little growth room to avoid the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.490 
have a little growth room to avoid the
breakage<00:02:36.120> in<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.450> skate<00:02:36.720> because<00:02:37.080> what

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
breakage in the skate because what

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.890 
breakage in the skate because what
happens<00:02:37.830> when<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.100> give<00:02:38.610> growth<00:02:38.880> room<00:02:39.120> and

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
happens when you give growth room and

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.180 
happens when you give growth room and
actually<00:02:40.290> you're<00:02:40.410> actually<00:02:40.800> fitting<00:02:41.070> the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
actually you're actually fitting the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.530 
actually you're actually fitting the
skates<00:02:41.430> bigger<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:41.940> there's<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.210> little<00:02:42.450> bit

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
skates bigger so there's a little bit

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.720 
skates bigger so there's a little bit
more<00:02:42.720> room<00:02:42.900> for<00:02:42.960> play<00:02:43.380> in<00:02:43.530> there<00:02:43.680> which<00:02:44.280> causes

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
more room for play in there which causes

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.170 
more room for play in there which causes
breakdown<00:02:45.180> we<00:02:45.750> also<00:02:45.870> have<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:47.160> boot<00:02:47.430> that

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
breakdown we also have on that boot that

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.690 
breakdown we also have on that boot that
we<00:02:48.360> have<00:02:48.510> in<00:02:48.660> our<00:02:49.050> entire<00:02:49.410> leather<00:02:49.950> line<00:02:50.250> we<00:02:50.550> do

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
we have in our entire leather line we do

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.270 
we have in our entire leather line we do
have<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.090> layered<00:02:51.300> cork<00:02:51.690> outsole<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.560> what

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
have the layered cork outsole and what

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.980 
have the layered cork outsole and what
we<00:02:53.430> use<00:02:53.580> for<00:02:53.610> layered<00:02:54.090> cork<00:02:54.390> as<00:02:54.570> well<00:02:54.720> is

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
we use for layered cork as well is

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.920 
we use for layered cork as well is
actually<00:02:55.560> an<00:02:55.820> extruded<00:02:56.820> cork<00:02:57.570> that's

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
actually an extruded cork that's

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.500 
actually an extruded cork that's
extruded<00:02:58.380> with<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.860> v8<00:02:59.070> so<00:02:59.850> not<00:03:00.030> only<00:03:00.150> it's

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
extruded with a v8 so not only it's

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.440 
extruded with a v8 so not only it's
lighter<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.800> also<00:03:02.010> acts<00:03:02.490> as<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:03.000> shock<00:03:03.390> absorber

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
lighter it also acts as a shock absorber

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.900 
lighter it also acts as a shock absorber
if<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.470> notice<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.950> way<00:03:05.100> that<00:03:05.130> it's<00:03:05.580> layered

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
if you notice the way that it's layered

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.530 
if you notice the way that it's layered
is<00:03:06.570> leather<00:03:07.310> cork<00:03:08.310> leather<00:03:08.820> cork<00:03:09.270> leather

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
is leather cork leather cork leather

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.520 
is leather cork leather cork leather
cork<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:10.290> leather<00:03:11.190> so<00:03:12.060> what<00:03:12.240> it<00:03:12.360> does<00:03:12.510> is<00:03:12.780> take

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
cork and leather so what it does is take

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.080 
cork and leather so what it does is take
some<00:03:13.740> of<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:13.950> landing<00:03:14.370> shock<00:03:14.580> that<00:03:14.820> you<00:03:14.970> used

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
some of the landing shock that you used

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.000 
some of the landing shock that you used
to<00:03:15.240> normally<00:03:15.870> have<00:03:16.080> with<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.380> harder<00:03:16.739> leather

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
to normally have with the harder leather

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.220 
to normally have with the harder leather
it<00:03:17.519> takes<00:03:17.820> some<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.209> landing<00:03:18.690> shock<00:03:18.930> away

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
it takes some of that landing shock away

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.940 
it takes some of that landing shock away
because<00:03:20.100> eva<00:03:20.489> is<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.730> natural<00:03:21.410> shock<00:03:22.410> absorbent

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
because eva is a natural shock absorbent

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.710 
because eva is a natural shock absorbent
and<00:03:23.070> its<00:03:23.220> own<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:23.850> between<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.360> Evie<00:03:24.690> a

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
and its own so between the Evie a

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.570 
and its own so between the Evie a
extruded<00:03:25.290> Evie<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.860> cork<00:03:26.100> that's<00:03:26.280> in

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
extruded Evie and the cork that's in

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.580 
extruded Evie and the cork that's in
there<00:03:26.820> it<00:03:27.330> actually<00:03:27.480> absorbed<00:03:28.230> some<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.500> the

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
there it actually absorbed some of the

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.320 
there it actually absorbed some of the
shock<00:03:28.890> as<00:03:29.100> well<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.550> which<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:29.880> great<00:03:30.150> and

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
shock as well so which is a great and

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.990 
shock as well so which is a great and
that<00:03:30.630> is<00:03:30.780> actually<00:03:30.959> on<00:03:31.860> our<00:03:32.040> entire<00:03:32.459> entire
