00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
this generation yeah just in fact this

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.569 
this generation yeah just in fact this
is<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> classic<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.439> Rails<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.070> helicopter

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
is the classic on Rails and helicopter

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.400 
is the classic on Rails and helicopter
shooting<00:00:32.910> at<00:00:33.030> people<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.510> you've<00:00:34.260> probably

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
shooting at people but you've probably

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.370 
shooting at people but you've probably
done<00:00:34.680> several<00:00:34.920> times<00:00:35.040> already<00:00:35.540> but<00:00:36.540> those<00:00:37.230> are

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
done several times already but those are

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.170 
done several times already but those are
through<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.590> well<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.430> mechanics<00:00:38.820> themselves

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
through it well the mechanics themselves

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.030 
through it well the mechanics themselves
are<00:00:39.239> actually<00:00:39.480> really<00:00:39.600> good<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.739> lot<00:00:40.890> like

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
are actually really good it's a lot like

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.740 
are actually really good it's a lot like
buffer<00:00:41.370> than<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.579> sense<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.940> think<00:00:41.969> they're

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
buffer than that sense I think they're

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.450 
buffer than that sense I think they're
obviously<00:00:42.989> using<00:00:43.230> what<00:00:43.469> use<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> lot<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
obviously using what use a lot of the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.670 
obviously using what use a lot of the
same<00:00:45.390> engine<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.809> assume<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.230> lot<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.469> lights

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
same engine to assume a lot of lights

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.700 
same engine to assume a lot of lights
tied<00:00:46.920> into<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.539> but<00:00:48.539> yet<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:49.200> part<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.530> really

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
tied into it but yet that part is really

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.130 
tied into it but yet that part is really
really<00:00:51.620> then<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.710> get<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:52.920> latest<00:00:53.219> there

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
really then you get this latest there

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.959 
really then you get this latest there
there<00:00:55.140> are<00:00:55.170> interesting<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.489> bit<00:00:56.670> you

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
there are interesting it's this bit you

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.029

with infinite grenades and infinite ammo
and<00:01:02.430> you're<00:01:03.120> invulnerable<00:01:04.100> he<00:01:05.100> only<00:01:05.250> lost<00:01:05.489> for

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
and you're invulnerable he only lost for

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.260 
and you're invulnerable he only lost for
a<00:01:06.090> few<00:01:06.360> minutes<00:01:06.510> but<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.680> lot<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.890> fun<00:01:08.270> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
a few minutes but it's a lot of fun the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.149 
a few minutes but it's a lot of fun the

problem is then does the same pit later
on<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.960> has<00:01:13.290> less<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.530> an<00:01:13.799> impact<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.610> same

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
on and it has less of an impact the same

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.649
