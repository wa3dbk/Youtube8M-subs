those who have dedicated themselves to
an<00:03:26.630> intense<00:03:27.049> spiritual<00:03:27.799> life<00:03:28.120> but<00:03:29.120> perhaps

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
an intense spiritual life but perhaps

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.990 
an intense spiritual life but perhaps
that's<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.959> point<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:31.190> it<00:03:31.340> should<00:03:31.519> remain<00:03:31.940> a

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
that's the point that it should remain a

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.900 
that's the point that it should remain a
mystery<00:03:32.600> for<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:33.530> truly<00:03:33.950> understand<00:03:34.519> such<00:03:34.880> a

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
mystery for to truly understand such a

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.710 
mystery for to truly understand such a
life<00:03:35.299> one<00:03:36.049> must<00:03:36.079> live<00:03:36.620> it<00:03:36.819> but<00:03:37.819> regardless<00:03:38.030> of

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
life one must live it but regardless of

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.140 
life one must live it but regardless of
the<00:03:38.840> path<00:03:39.049> one<00:03:39.410> takes<00:03:39.799> it<00:03:40.130> is<00:03:40.609> not<00:03:40.819> so<00:03:41.120> much

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
the path one takes it is not so much

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.660 
the path one takes it is not so much
about<00:03:41.569> how<00:03:41.989> one<00:03:42.350> follows<00:03:42.799> the<00:03:43.010> teachings<00:03:43.190> of
