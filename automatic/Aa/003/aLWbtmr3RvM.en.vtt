famous green vertical bar right over

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.330 
famous green vertical bar right over
there<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.930> no<00:00:54.930> matter<00:00:55.079> what<00:00:55.379> input<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.949> set<00:00:56.219> it

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
there and no matter what input I set it

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.319 
there and no matter what input I set it
on<00:00:56.510> cable<00:00:57.739> HDMI<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:59.039> two<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.940> know<00:01:00.059> whatever

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
on cable HDMI one two you know whatever

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.990 
on cable HDMI one two you know whatever
it's<00:01:01.020> always<00:01:01.260> there<00:01:01.620> still<00:01:01.949> after<00:01:02.670> doing<00:01:02.879> some

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
it's always there still after doing some

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.820 
it's always there still after doing some
research<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.809> found<00:01:03.840> out<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.650> probably

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
research I found out that it's probably

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.310 
research I found out that it's probably
my<00:01:05.790> logic<00:01:06.270> board<00:01:06.540> because<00:01:06.869> it's<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.140> vertical

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
my logic board because it's a vertical

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.219 
my logic board because it's a vertical
colored<00:01:07.979> line<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.299> black<00:01:09.630> line<00:01:09.960> it

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
colored line if it's a black line it

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.700 
colored line if it's a black line it
might<00:01:10.439> be<00:01:10.850> one<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> connector<00:01:12.720> ribbons<00:01:13.170> up

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
might be one of the connector ribbons up

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.039 
might be one of the connector ribbons up
on<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> top<00:01:14.220> or<00:01:14.460> bottom<00:01:14.490> here<00:01:15.240> but<00:01:15.780> I'm<00:01:15.900> gonna

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
on the top or bottom here but I'm gonna

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.719 
on the top or bottom here but I'm gonna
go<00:01:16.140> ahead<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.380> pull<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.650> apart<00:01:16.830> here<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
go ahead and pull this apart here and

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.249 
go ahead and pull this apart here and
work<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.180> I'm<00:01:18.659> actually<00:01:18.840> gonna<00:01:19.080> make

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
work on it I'm actually gonna make

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.380 
work on it I'm actually gonna make
another<00:01:19.500> video<00:01:19.740> about<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.400> making<00:01:21.180> sure<00:01:21.360> I

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
another video about that making sure I

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.450 
another video about that making sure I
can<00:01:21.570> fix<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.900> first<00:01:22.229> before<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.770> go<00:01:23.220> ahead<00:01:23.340> and

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
can fix this first before I go ahead and

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.969 
can fix this first before I go ahead and
do<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.759> but<00:01:23.939> I'm<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.030> letting<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.509> know

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
do that but I'm just letting you know

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.929 
do that but I'm just letting you know
what's<00:01:25.979> going<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.250> with<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.759> is

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
what's going on with this this is

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.460 
what's going on with this this is
actually<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.270> 2012<00:01:28.110> model<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.520> what<00:01:30.470> 2014

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
actually a 2012 model and it's what 2014

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.010 
actually a 2012 model and it's what 2014
now<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.159> probably<00:01:32.579> two<00:01:33.360> years<00:01:33.390> old<00:01:33.810> if

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
now so it's probably two years old if

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.310 
now so it's probably two years old if
that<00:01:34.490> depends<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.610> what<00:01:35.850> time<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> year<00:01:36.990> it

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
that depends on what time of the year it

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.590 
that depends on what time of the year it
was<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.680> made<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.670> two<00:01:38.850> year<00:01:39.030> old<00:01:39.060> television

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
was I made but a two year old television

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.190 
was I made but a two year old television
shouldn't<00:01:39.960> do<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:41.420> now<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.479> reason<00:01:42.780> why

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
shouldn't do this so now the reason why

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.990 
shouldn't do this so now the reason why
and<00:01:43.590> check<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.860> out<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.610> actually<00:01:44.790> found

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
and check this out so I actually found

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.230 
and check this out so I actually found
this<00:01:45.720> TV<00:01:46.350> last<00:01:46.890> night<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.729> reason<00:01:47.880> why<00:01:48.180> is

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
this TV last night the reason why is

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.780 
this TV last night the reason why is
people<00:01:48.780> don't<00:01:48.930> want<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.380> viewing<00:01:49.790> this

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
people don't want to be viewing this

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.270 
people don't want to be viewing this
green<00:01:51.060> bar<00:01:51.329> now<00:01:51.540> if<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.750> play<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.049> movie<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.890> will

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
green bar now if I play a movie it will

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.950

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
through the green bar but of course

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.340 
through the green bar but of course
that's<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.180> pain<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.509> butt<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.750> watch<00:01:58.110> that

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that's a pain in the butt to watch that

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.649 
that's a pain in the butt to watch that
on<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> black<00:01:58.890> screen<00:01:59.189> looks<00:01:59.520> terrible<00:01:59.969> but

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
on a black screen looks terrible but

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.999 
on a black screen looks terrible but
when<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:00.990> color<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.409> looks<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.649> little<00:02:01.770> bit

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
when it's color it looks a little bit

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.889 
when it's color it looks a little bit
better<00:02:02.159> maybe<00:02:02.700> I'll<00:02:02.939> fire<00:02:03.210> up<00:02:03.240> my<00:02:03.479> DVD<00:02:03.869> player

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
better maybe I'll fire up my DVD player

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.139 
better maybe I'll fire up my DVD player
and<00:02:04.259> we'll<00:02:04.350> check<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.619> out<00:02:04.799> but<00:02:05.159> anyway<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.090> I

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
and we'll check that out but anyway so I

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.900 
and we'll check that out but anyway so I
found<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.659> TV<00:02:07.020> I'm<00:02:07.259> gonna<00:02:07.380> fix<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.429> we're

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
found this TV I'm gonna fix it and we're

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.100 
found this TV I'm gonna fix it and we're
gonna<00:02:09.030> get<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.360> up<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.660> running<00:02:09.810> it's

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
gonna get this up and running it's

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.900 
gonna get this up and running it's
probably<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.500> loose<00:02:10.770> solder<00:02:11.129> connection<00:02:11.790> is

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
probably a loose solder connection is

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.260 
probably a loose solder connection is
