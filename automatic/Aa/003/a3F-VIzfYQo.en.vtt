00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:13.639
 yes I think it was an important match 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.600
 for the hobby because it takes a lot 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:20.930
 time wishing that moment 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.390
 and is that better than in the last one that 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.050
 is going to play in san mamÃ©s not already I had 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.320
 he had told me he had already 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.829
 commented 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.140
 that he was not going to be in the in the eleven 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.400
 and as I say obviously to me I do not 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.230
 like to be on the bench but 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.530
 as well as regarding the decision and 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.300
 support the team in any way that could 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.440
 being outside and if it was my turn to enter 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.660
 when 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.510
 I was also trying to do 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:57.870
 the difference if the team 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.940
 is in a very good dynamic I think that 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.570
 we are taking parties forward that 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.890
 others we have last season 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.810
 we used to lose I think 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.690
 now my decision has more arguments 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.520
 I'm going to say it was good and what 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.990
 I do not regret at any time I have 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.760
 done but now 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.820
 there is base 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.430
 a backup to be able to say what is not 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.710
 I was wrong and I chose 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.380
 in good shape because he believed in the team 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.020
 and that he thought we could go up 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.180
 and I think although we can give even more 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.870
 I believe that 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.830
 It would be nice because 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.360
 it will be a process an evolution that I am 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.390
 living here that would be good because 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.230
 I arrived with the team to fight the 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.180
 salvation that the next season 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.600
 half table up that the next 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.430
 I can say and I think that 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.430
 it's a process that I would like to be
