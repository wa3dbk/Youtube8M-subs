00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.990
 released another patch for world of tanks 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.210
 this is patch number 092 so 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.990
 let's start the review of mods and everything that I need 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.699
 there is an assembly 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.090
 let's start with the first one that goes with me 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.830
 my multipack and this is the scope and my first 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.320
 favorite sight with which i play it 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.270
 sight jimbo this sight into the eggs 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.610
 is one of the best and comfortable 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.250
 sights for here it does not have intrusive 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.989
 lines of stripes of any animation so on 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.250
 which fills in unnecessary information 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.989
 the whole screen does not interfere with play it just 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.420
 sight which shows the distance to 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.850
 target reload your weapon that in 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.539
 principle missing head and how are you 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.000
 noticed 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.120
 It is clearly visible on the ground, that's why 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.370

 jova knows him all well 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.409

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.720
 extra lines easy and convenient 3 sight 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.630

 tanks on which you aim for 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.880
 novices it will be convenient at the same time 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.180
 will distract from what is happening in battle 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.600
 as long as you read what 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.970
 info tanks written in sight 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.549

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.410
 but with great options and this display 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.669

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.180
 the next one is my xvm config in which 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.940
 you can see the following start with 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.860
 mini cards in the mini card have a pointer 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.229

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.870

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.360
 let's say no shot goes there smart 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.430
 range of view it changes depending on 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.789

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.789

 that is, in combat if previously tanker 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.690
 who is responsible for reviewing the circle 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.210
 automatically change if you have 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.220

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.479
 the distance the pipe sees 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.370
 Your review circle is blue on my 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.320
 minimap 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.349

 color efficiency my efficiency is displayed 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:46.590
 efficiency duel if we hit 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.039

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.130
 value 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.800
 and this is a display of a chance to win later 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.300
 opposite each player there 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.810
 four-digit efficiency in total 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.810
 player wins are played for player in 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.690
 thousands and the winning percentage is exactly that 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.169
 tank on which man plays the log 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:10.229

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.919
