best outfield in the country that's our

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.839 
best outfield in the country that's our
goal<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.150> what<00:00:27.840> we<00:00:27.930> work<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> lot<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.340> our

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
goal and what we work on a lot is is our

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.999 
goal and what we work on a lot is is our
angles<00:00:30.210> we<00:00:30.539> want<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.990> know<00:00:31.080> take<00:00:31.349> take<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
angles we want to you know take take the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.610 
angles we want to you know take take the
best<00:00:32.130> angle<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> ball<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.149> our<00:00:33.750> first

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
best angle to the ball and our first

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
best angle to the ball and our first
step<00:00:34.800> our<00:00:35.010> first<00:00:35.219> step<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> most

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
step our first step is the most

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.250 
step our first step is the most
important<00:00:36.149> step<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.870> has<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.230> be

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
important step and so that has to be

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.410 
important step and so that has to be
something<00:00:37.590> where<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.430> has<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.640> be<00:00:38.850> explosive

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
something where it has to be explosive

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.850 
something where it has to be explosive
and<00:00:39.629> we<00:00:39.870> don't<00:00:40.110> want<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.260> float<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.649> ball

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
and we don't want to float to the ball

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.990 
and we don't want to float to the ball
we<00:00:41.010> want<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.250> get<00:00:41.340> behind<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.850> come

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
we want to get behind it and come

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.139 
we want to get behind it and come
through<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.930> make<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.530> good

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
through on it so we can make that good

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.510 
through on it so we can make that good

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
person who's an athlete I'm gonna hit

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.520 
person who's an athlete I'm gonna hit
baseballs<00:01:33.180> for<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> little<00:01:33.600> bit<00:01:33.689> because

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
baseballs for a little bit because

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.050 
baseballs for a little bit because
they're<00:01:34.829> smaller<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.520> they're<00:01:35.729> harder<00:01:36.030> to

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
they're smaller and they're harder to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.359 
they're smaller and they're harder to
see<00:01:36.299> baseballs<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.799> concentrate

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
see baseballs so you have to concentrate
