and<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.439> another<00:00:22.650> video<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.400> talked<00:00:23.670> about

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
and so in another video I talked about

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.089 
and so in another video I talked about
you<00:00:24.990> know<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> setting<00:00:25.470> up<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.710> broadband

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
you know a setting up to broadband

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.910 
you know a setting up to broadband
connecting<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.760> using<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.510> y-you<00:00:28.439> know<00:00:28.529> an

internet cable direct from your router

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.990 
internet cable direct from your router
which<00:00:31.170> should<00:00:31.289> always<00:00:31.470> be<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:32.160> best<00:00:32.309> way<00:00:32.610> and

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
which should always be the best way and

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.819 
which should always be the best way and
you<00:00:33.270> get<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> best<00:00:33.690> most<00:00:33.870> reliable<00:00:34.410> signal

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
you get the best most reliable signal

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.370 
you get the best most reliable signal
and<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.880> should<00:00:36.090> have<00:00:36.270> at<00:00:36.390> least<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.960> 2

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
and you should have at least a to 2

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.700 
and you should have at least a to 2
megabyte<00:00:37.829> download<00:00:38.790> speed<00:00:39.420> for<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.559> work

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
megabyte download speed for this to work

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.090 
megabyte download speed for this to work
anywhere<00:00:41.219> reasonably<00:00:42.030> reliably<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.100> another

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
anywhere reasonably reliably and another

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.229 
anywhere reasonably reliably and another
way<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.309> could<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.879> if<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.120> not

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
way you could do it if it's not

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.940 
way you could do it if it's not
convenient<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.809> run<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> cable<00:00:46.379> direct<00:00:46.770> from

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
convenient to run a cable direct from

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.979 
convenient to run a cable direct from
your<00:00:47.100> ruler<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.610> back<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.329> humans<00:00:48.750> box

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
your ruler to the back of the humans box

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.020 
your ruler to the back of the humans box
is<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.739> use<00:00:49.860> something<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.280> home<00:00:50.670> clocks

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
is to use something like home clocks

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.410 
is to use something like home clocks
which<00:00:51.660> you've<00:00:51.870> won<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.649> actual<00:00:53.399> rotor<00:00:53.610> connect

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
which you've won in actual rotor connect

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.600 
which you've won in actual rotor connect
an<00:00:54.719> ethernet<00:00:54.930> cable<00:00:55.410> into<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.219> then

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
an ethernet cable into it and then

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.990 
an ethernet cable into it and then
another<00:00:57.090> home<00:00:57.420> plug<00:00:57.780> at<00:00:58.260> your<00:00:58.649> hue<00:00:59.460> max<00:00:59.699> box

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
another home plug at your hue max box

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.770 
another home plug at your hue max box
and<00:01:00.300> actually<00:01:01.260> I'm<00:01:01.969> running<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.300> near<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
and actually I'm running a near the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.929 
and actually I'm running a near the
cable<00:01:04.110> out<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.680> directly<00:01:05.430> into<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> back

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
cable out of that directly into the back

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.179 
cable out of that directly into the back
of<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.240> humans<00:01:06.630> box<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.409> what<00:01:07.650> happens<00:01:08.010> then

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
of the humans box and what happens then

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.580 
of the humans box and what happens then
is<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.970> broadband<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.840> transmitted<00:01:10.439> over

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
is the broadband is transmitted over

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.770 
is the broadband is transmitted over
your<00:01:10.890> electrical<00:01:11.460> wires<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> house<00:01:12.210> and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
your electrical wires in the house and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.480 
your electrical wires in the house and
so<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.290> should<00:01:13.439> happen<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.710> run<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.100> cable

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
so it's a should happen to run the cable

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.370 
so it's a should happen to run the cable
so<00:01:14.729> obviously<00:01:15.000> running<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.720> cable<00:01:15.930> directly

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
so obviously running a cable directly

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.249 
so obviously running a cable directly
would<00:01:16.710> be<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> lot<00:01:17.009> cheaper<00:01:17.040> port<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.259> home

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
would be a lot cheaper port and home

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.440 
would be a lot cheaper port and home
plugs<00:01:19.560> are<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:19.920> far<00:01:20.430> more<00:01:20.460> easier<00:01:21.060> set<00:01:21.330> up

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
plugs are just far more easier set up

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.510 
plugs are just far more easier set up
and<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:21.750> not<00:01:21.900> always<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.799> know<00:01:22.950> practical

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
and it's not always you know practical

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.640 
and it's not always you know practical
for<00:01:23.670> people<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.509> run<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> cable<00:01:25.020> depending<00:01:25.560> on

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
for people to run a cable depending on

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.050 
for people to run a cable depending on
the<00:01:25.740> situation<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.369> their<00:01:26.490> house<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:26.850> home

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
know is I played around a bit with this

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.460 
know is I played around a bit with this
now<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.130> when<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.520> set<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.850> up<00:01:39.030> using<00:01:39.210> an<00:01:39.900> an<00:01:40.259> art

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
now and when I set it up using an an art

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.140

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
nourished Paul Scott which is what a lot

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.240 
nourished Paul Scott which is what a lot
of<00:01:42.180> people<00:01:42.390> probably<00:01:42.720> would<00:01:43.110> at<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.829> moment

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250
