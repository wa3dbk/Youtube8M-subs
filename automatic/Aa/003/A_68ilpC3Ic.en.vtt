00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 Nine people here lose of paradox 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.319
 gaming today for the second part of how 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.570
 I make coins quickly 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.110
 this part is for advanced 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.839
 you already have about 10 to 20,000 coins 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:23.970
 we would need to search for formation now 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:26.070
 with the top price 1800 well then 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.240
 we are looking for the positions 4 4 2 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.040
 4 3 3 and 4 1 2 1 2 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:36.649
 Here we already have the first and there 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:41.180
 we will of course equal 1000 first 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:43.950
 year 1803 1700 muster 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.500
 Here again a 42 exhibition where we 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.980
 of course, also offer it again 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.219
 become 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.059
 at 442 you can go to 1800 at 433 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:58.710
 to 2600 and at 4 1 2 1 2 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.930
 to 4,800 but how much is number 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.460
 everything is worth writing 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.000
 Here you can see that I already 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.619
 Some got the circa first 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.080
 ten minutes passed and I have 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.420
 seven exhibitions or yes seven 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.729
 get statements if I am correct 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.960
 count 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.080
 This we put this time on the exchange 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.640
 Of course we hope that we will 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.799
 The first time they sell it 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.500
 last 433 lineup and then you can 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.180
 We commit to the exchange you see 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.570
 I already have four here 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:39.869
 lineup sells that from earlier 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:42.869
 were three are still in the run so page 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.710
 2 many two sentences of the prince as 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:51.329
 starting price for 2200 and as immediate purchase 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:55.369
 for 2300 then we do one 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.369
 profit of 400 million 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:06.200
 now 433 we can for 3300 and 3400 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.039
 use 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.069
 in my opinion, they still bring 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.220
 more money because you get them for 2500 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:19.890
 can be a lot of 2 again for 2200 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:25.950
 reinsetzen and 2000 immediately purchase price 1 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:28.110
 42 again for 2200 and 2300 again and 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.100
 we hope so that we all 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:36.780
 sold get here one more time 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:39.650
 I do not offer such a 2300 and 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:45.269
 so that two exhibitions 433 again 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:48.480
 3300 3400 continue to offer and still 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:52.170
 a lot of doubt 2200 start price and 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.799
 immediately purchase price 2300 well then we see 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.510
 easy again when I sold all 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.510

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.080
