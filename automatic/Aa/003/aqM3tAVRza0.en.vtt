potential that the mass whore had and of

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.590 
potential that the mass whore had and of
course<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.429> Flower<00:02:10.640> Show<00:02:10.670> has<00:02:11.030> been<00:02:11.060> famous

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
but on bank is something particularly

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.690 
but on bank is something particularly
special<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:15.260> could<00:02:15.800> be<00:02:15.950> special<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.490> more

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
think it is just this time period in

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.519 
think it is just this time period in
time<00:05:15.629> frame<00:05:16.020> that<00:05:16.289> a<00:05:17.009> new<00:05:17.340> generation<00:05:17.939> of

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:18.529 
time frame that a new generation of

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:22.519 
time frame that a new generation of
excitement<00:05:19.529> and<00:05:19.740> enthusiasm<00:05:20.300> can<00:05:21.300> focus<00:05:22.020> on
