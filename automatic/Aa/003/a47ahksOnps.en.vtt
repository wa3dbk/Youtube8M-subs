00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.770
 yes hello people to the school comes 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.199
 a new minecraft playstation 3 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.210
 double jan in today's media on one 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.620
 funny dealer portal glitsch and indeed 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.739
 It looks like this you can do this 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.320
 complete portal which is activated on 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.579
 limit a tour 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.409
 how the whole looks like the whole 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.850
 I'll show you now and 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.699
 although we need for the whole 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.610
 activate the end of the eyes around the portal 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.040
 So twelve pieces and nine changed and 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.330
 logically, therefore, allows the end 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.560
 portal a the end portal frame so 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.700
 then we feel the whole middle 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.810
 these changes like me now 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.660
 would not do so is completely none 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.670
 What direction this sound show 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.570
 So we just had to fill the whole thing 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.720
 still disable this one portal 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.220
 and it definitely works and it has 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.899
 works like you see the steam 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:35.310
 we can go up now 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:37.170
 frame remove moment so and so too 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.729
 remove all thrones except one 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.710
 moment that is a bit straddled 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.390
 Rademann sometimes even meets the drones 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.240
 not you look like the front here 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.119
 to discover a topic in it 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.159
 we used the back yet and the whole 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.200
 it so all this portal is still out 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.250
 Active only here on this tour 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.810
 that means limited if now 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.420
 some player says hey cool reminds 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.540
 calm because I will be out of time 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.000
 teleported and the whole thing just happens 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.560
 if you touch them if you have a few 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.360
 millimeter next to the chest then runs 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.619
 the whole thing does not happen and yes 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.110
 then wonders why suddenly on 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.970
 unfortunately the end has to die then unfortunately 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.140
 if he does not have stuff with or 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.530
 fighting each other kites 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.430
 So as I said rest nine pieces change 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.900
 the end of a party framework of the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.250
 worked creatively as well as one 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.820
 survival mode but only survival mode 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.959
 I think it's a bit hard 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.700
 and yes what was it with the 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.650
 tutorial I hope you enjoyed it 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.400
 and see you in the next video 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.400
