00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello friends welcome to the first video 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.000
 of filling the saga akatsuki verses and 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.790
 bucay but before he runs out 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.070
 let me explain why I cataloged it 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.570
 as a filling, as many believe it is 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.000
 because it will not take part in the history of 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.770
 the saga but this is false since every 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.750
 result influence the history of 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.130
 the ninja pirate war however I do 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.930
 I call stuffing because it does not matter 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.850
 result of these verses none of the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.800
 opponents can add points in favor 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.779
 of any organization because you 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.609
 you will ask and well the answer is 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.890
 simple none of those who participate in 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.079
 the stuffing are part of akatsuki ni of 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.520
 chichi buccal the fill room is born 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.170
 because the perfect opportunity 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.030
 to face other characters that 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.530
 we always wanted to see in good action 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.510
 friends understanding of this let's start with 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.469
 the presentation of characters in this 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.760
 occasion the confrontation is 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.649
 starred by two groups of 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.480
 individuals that were cloned to be 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.219
 used as weapons I mean the sexes 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.379
 naruto targets of the pacifists of 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.969
 one piece we analyze the white sexes 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.920
 first of all although the facts 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.360
 whites are a formidable force there are 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.219
 that need the ability of a 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.539
 individual especially the white sexes 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.730
 they do not have many differences with 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.979
 with respect to the original or in appearance in 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.510
 disabilities its size of a meter with 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.580
 seventy seven centimeters 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.500
 has a force and speed lower than 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.690
 of elite ninja have not proven to be very 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.490
 smart however they know how to run 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.320
 plans on perfection and act on 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.060
 team to face a threat in the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.830
 Special powers section each set 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.870
 Your target has a domain level 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.300
 basic six elements ground water 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.740
 fire lightning wind and wood although the 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.390
 most of these elements have not been 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.040
 seen in the series if you should take 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.140
 into account as they have been confirmed by 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.520
 the same masashi kishimoto the sexes 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.320
 whites can travel underground to 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.660
 great characteristic speeds 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.670
 such as the original sex 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.010
 Once a sex individually is not 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.410
 such an awesome threat believe me that 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.330
 when they are in groups if you are as 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.030
 its danger is that there are thousands 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.590
 things that should not deviate so for 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.870
 this confrontation we can see in 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.670
 action to 10,000 of them now imagine 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.220
 a basic level water attack and 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.570
 then think of the x 1000 and you'll have 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.400
 unity of how powerful this is 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.770
 army now let's see in the squad a 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.990
 pacifist let's analyze first one 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.369
 unit these machines were built 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.080
 by the best scientist in the world 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.390
 one piece which creates technology 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.370
 advanced for 500 years physically are 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.770
 equal to kuma which was the model 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.110
 Original your height is 6 meters 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.850
 9 centimeters their bodies are made 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.740
 of a material harder than steel there is 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.110
 who think they are fallen x 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.670
 but this has never been confirmed to 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.380
 despite its great size the pacifists 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.180
 They have proven to be extremely fast 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.310
 they can also make big jumps 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.200
 speed and, if that was not enough, its strength 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.880
 physical is monstrous in the section of 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.800
 special powers the pacifists of 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.450
 difference from kuma in that they do not possess the 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.580
 power of the nick and unite me not me so 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.320
 which can not repel attacks and use 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.120
 wind techniques another power that does not 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.860
 they possess unlike the original is the 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.170
 ability to be transported in a 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.850
 instantaneous however if you can throw 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.770
 rays of light from both your mouth and 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.870
 his hands said attacks are huge 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.730
 destructive power and cause explosions 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.990
 massive to the past impact of 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.360
 Required meeting of three pirates 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.160
 elites and even the union of supernovas 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.170
 more your crews to be able 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.270
 defeat after much effort to a 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.310
 single pacifist unit being met 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.380
 another from the squad the pacifists know 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.960
 act like a team taking a bath 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.040
 light rays to your opponents for this 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.510
 grieving because the number of 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.580
 pacifists has not been confirmed 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.470
 We will use an estimate which is based 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.020
 in several images of the sea war 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.040
 report and this one of 100 pacifists what 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.439
 it means that 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.480
 the army is you overcoming one 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.099
 good friends open the polls if 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.500
 you think the winner deserves to be the 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.390
 army sex writes army set 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.760
 happened from your arguments why 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.799
 how would you win if you think the winner 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.379
 it deserves to be the pacifist squad 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.599
 write pacifist squad followed by 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.370
 your arguments but if you think that the 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.319
 result deserves to be a draw 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.599
 write a tie followed by your arguments 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.609
 the results will be presented in the 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.709
 next video of the saga before leaving 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.139
