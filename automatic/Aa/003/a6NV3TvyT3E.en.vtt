00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.740
 what do you think and half says something that I 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.690
 I think that that will make you feel is 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.230
 because today you brought some ideas 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.839
 excellent and I went on spear the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.839
 your little star toy for pretty 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.880
 Y 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:31.000
 seven bottles of pet white glue 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:34.129
 newspaper masking tape paints brushes 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.140
 cardboard and scissors 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.530
 is that I was reading something super 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.100
 interesting about the guide and about 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.600
 the university university guide that 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.519
 I was reading to see account, not because 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.040
 notice that you could find the ranking of 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.899
 the top 100 universities at the level 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.250
 national and that also separates 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.079
 15 races with more demand in the 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.790
 present as the time, no, well, to me 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.920
 It seemed incredible because that is a 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.409
 guide is to guide the boys to the 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.509
 girl to the young sada to the mothers 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.309
 no longer but for the elderly like you 

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:05.900
 also if you want to be studying another 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.750
 career I know it's changing career 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.619
 you can find in orienting origins of 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.710
 word or guidance counseling 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.640
 that you know where to move from 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.180
 universities and everything and you 're missing 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.340
 which is from the editors of selections and 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.640
 It is not that like to forget 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:31.880
 of purchase in closed premises 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:34.190
 in service since the birds already tested 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.409
 already you were for her the compassion heard by 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.720
 her but leaving here then 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.490
 we are going to talk to the 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.960
 I did something that maybe in 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.970
 this time if you're going to feel very 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.630
 proud of me is fine because not only 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.090
 I took away the neighbor things 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.680
 bad but see that also the very 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.680
 I leave you pigs 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:04.160

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.300
 brew here is where you say about the 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.300

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.980

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.790
 let's make a 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.420
 or you will see it you will see our seven 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.940
 bottles 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.519
 we are going to use these lands to 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.240
 distinguish which goes in the center and 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:03:00.220
 all the others go around around 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:03.420
 so we do it on the floor if you want 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.420
 go to the floor 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.840

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.840
