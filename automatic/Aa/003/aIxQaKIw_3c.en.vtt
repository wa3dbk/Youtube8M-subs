work for you it's probably gonna be down
here<00:00:27.340> somewhere<00:00:27.579> so<00:00:28.090> just<00:00:28.239> put<00:00:28.390> it<00:00:28.450> on<00:00:28.540> any

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
here somewhere so just put it on any

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.350 
here somewhere so just put it on any
keyed<00:00:28.989> like<00:00:29.290> and<00:00:29.470> then<00:00:29.559> you<00:00:29.619> can<00:00:29.770> use<00:00:29.919> it<00:00:30.360> also

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
keyed like and then you can use it also

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.780 
keyed like and then you can use it also
if<00:00:31.570> you're<00:00:31.750> below<00:00:31.899> level<00:00:32.470> 60<00:00:33.220> I<00:00:33.250> think<00:00:33.550> it<00:00:33.640> is

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
if you're below level 60 I think it is

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.150 
if you're below level 60 I think it is
then<00:00:34.420> you'll<00:00:34.630> have<00:00:34.690> the<00:00:35.200> little<00:00:35.380> icon<00:00:35.890> over

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
then you'll have the little icon over

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.040 
then you'll have the little icon over
here<00:00:36.190> but<00:00:36.850> if<00:00:36.940> you're<00:00:37.060> above<00:00:37.300> level<00:00:37.480> 60<00:00:37.930> you
