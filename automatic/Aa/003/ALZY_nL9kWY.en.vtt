end portion now this race I highly

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.190

recommend<00:00:47.100> using<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.399> Sanchez<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.090> batty<00:00:48.780> or<00:00:49.140> a

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
recommend using a Sanchez a batty or a

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.889 
recommend using a Sanchez a batty or a
carbon<00:00:50.010> RS<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.149> don't<00:00:51.210> recommend<00:00:51.629> using

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
carbon RS and I don't recommend using

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.810 
carbon RS and I don't recommend using
the<00:00:52.079> bike<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.530> am<00:00:52.649> curling<00:00:52.890> using<00:00:53.340> because

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
the bike that I am curling using because

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.670 
the bike that I am curling using because
one<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.270> extremely<00:00:54.809> slow<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.350> harder<00:00:55.590> to

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
one is extremely slow and it's harder to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.350 
one is extremely slow and it's harder to
the<00:00:55.800> end<00:00:55.949> part<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.399> because<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.059> just

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the end part and because the just

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.630 
the end part and because the just
control<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.170> traction<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.859> bike<00:00:59.070> isn't

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
hill you see the finish line across the

hill you see the finish line across the
way<00:02:36.900> on<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.140> island<00:02:37.500> well<00:02:38.040> guess<00:02:38.250> what<00:02:38.430> guys

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
way on that island well guess what guys

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.339 
way on that island well guess what guys
you<00:02:38.580> have<00:02:38.849> to<00:02:38.940> use<00:02:39.090> these<00:02:39.329> ramps<00:02:39.750> but<00:02:40.200> these

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
you have to use these ramps but these

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.479 
you have to use these ramps but these
ramps<00:02:40.620> are<00:02:40.739> pretty<00:02:41.010> tricky<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.370> use

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
ramps are pretty tricky to use

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.710 
ramps are pretty tricky to use
especially<00:02:42.030> if<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.150> don't<00:02:42.269> line<00:02:42.450> up<00:02:42.480> your

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720

especially if you don't line up your
bike<00:02:42.900> once<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.620> drop<00:02:43.890> off<00:02:44.069> this<00:02:44.250> hill<00:02:44.489> but

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
bike once you drop off this hill but

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.670 
bike once you drop off this hill but
what<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.510> need<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.750> be<00:02:45.870> aware<00:02:46.079> of<00:02:46.140> is<00:02:46.379> number

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
what you need to be aware of is number

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.160 
what you need to be aware of is number
one<00:02:46.860> your<00:02:47.069> speed<00:02:47.459> your<00:02:48.150> control<00:02:48.629> of<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.870> bike

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
one your speed your control of the bike

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.949 
one your speed your control of the bike
and<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.920> waves<00:02:50.250> in<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:50.700> ocean<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.629> waves<00:02:51.840> in

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
and the waves in the ocean the waves in

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.569 
and the waves in the ocean the waves in
the<00:02:52.049> ocean<00:02:52.109> can<00:02:52.560> actually<00:02:52.950> throw<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.280> off

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
the ocean can actually throw you off

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.430 
the ocean can actually throw you off
these<00:02:53.879> ramps<00:02:54.329> so<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:54.780> need<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:54.959> be<00:02:55.019> very<00:02:55.319> aware

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
these ramps so you need to be very aware

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.410 
these ramps so you need to be very aware
like<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:55.799> big<00:02:56.040> wave<00:02:56.190> coming<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:56.849> can<00:02:57.299> actually

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
like that big wave coming I can actually

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.150 
like that big wave coming I can actually
be<00:02:57.599> thrown<00:02:57.900> off<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.319> ramp<00:02:58.530> if<00:02:58.709> I<00:02:58.829> don't<00:02:58.980> get<00:02:59.099> on

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
be thrown off the ramp if I don't get on

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.250 
be thrown off the ramp if I don't get on
to<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.430> ramp<00:02:59.640> there<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.359> go<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.540> see<00:03:00.599> see<00:03:01.170> how

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
to a ramp there you go you see see how

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.500 
to a ramp there you go you see see how
much<00:03:01.379> though<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.799> ramps<00:03:02.340> move<00:03:02.579> now<00:03:03.150> it's<00:03:03.329> not

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510
