little tougher to catch anything but we

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:27.760 
little tougher to catch anything but we
here<00:01:21.550> there<00:01:22.550> we<00:01:22.610> go<00:01:25.420> we<00:01:26.420> had<00:01:26.570> our<00:01:26.720> first<00:01:26.930> hookup

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.740 
I believe we are now hung up cuz
whatever<00:01:31.130> it<00:01:31.280> was<00:01:31.460> did<00:01:31.759> did<00:01:32.210> take<00:01:32.450> a<00:01:32.479> nice

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
whatever it was did did take a nice

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:50.990 
whatever it was did did take a nice
little<00:01:33.050> pull<00:01:45.850> free<00:01:46.850> himself

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.070 

believe<00:02:26.090> we<00:02:26.270> had<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.480> log<00:02:26.750> come<00:02:27.140> by<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:28.900> come<00:02:29.900> by

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
believe we had a log come by and come by

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.550 
believe we had a log come by and come by
and<00:02:30.140> take<00:02:30.410> it<00:02:30.590> for<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:30.800> ride<00:02:32.140> which<00:02:33.140> happens

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
and take it for a ride which happens

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.280 
and take it for a ride which happens
