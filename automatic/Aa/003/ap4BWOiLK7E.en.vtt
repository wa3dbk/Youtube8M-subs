00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:31.039
 this basic schematic drawing the rotary engine llonto 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.190
 ahead 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.190
 we will analyze it to make sure 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.970
 by the expansion of the gases that yes to everything and continued during the 360 ​​degrees 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.150
 every turn 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.100
 then a design 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.990
 that does not require rings with special seals as well as 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.010
 differences in respect to all other known systems 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.030
 I seal these based on Jesus Christ and of Euros 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.100
 but based on systems 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.980
 of course 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.920
 I have 25 years 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.970
 Cordoba will be made 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.050
 although his children 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.330
 to achieve this moment 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.690
 what I intend is to make it very clear and precise in an easy way 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.240
 that will grow 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.240
 the dictionary feels motor 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.010
 but the low fuel consumption 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.070
 what is the function of the combustion engine in two cars 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.840
 only 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.640
 first rotary movement 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.640
 to make movies 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.590
 the usual system 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.010
 home 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.830
 it requires too much 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.830
 the mechanisms 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.330
 besides burns 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.800
 because 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.090
 the system 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.090
 for lighting your pockets 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:13.179
 this engine 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:16.399
 so known if used or will go 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:19.399
 does not need as many components 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:22.609
 at present 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:23.949
 this is the whim 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:25.699
 if they are used 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.709
 very varied types of engines 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.709
 the best eight will have to be replaced 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:39.119
 let's remember how the piston engine works 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.769
 imagine a gunman in an annular chamber 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:53.930
 in the facts 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.250
 this function will continue can be easily achieved in this way 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:09.580
 then two systems placed in a single message 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.360
 provides us with the best combustion engine 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.179
 physics 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.179
 like all science with technological applications 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.569
 I never felt good 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:26.400
 ahead 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.579
 you wait 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:28.860
 that not far away 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.430
 I'll show you something some old
