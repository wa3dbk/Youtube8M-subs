00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 I know you? 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Yes, I Am The Other Dimension 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Which would explain your incredible charm 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 And you too my dear 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 So I and would you be exactly the same? 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 I think so 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Do You Want A Plum Pudding? 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Blah, it's disgusting! 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Is It Just A Test And The Crunchy? 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Uh, I'm Greedy! Me too! 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Save Things? Yes, Every Coin! 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 You Can't Know Who Conquers The Planet! 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 I Never Have Company 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 And I Live For The Phobia 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 But not because of the distributors! 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 And finally here 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Someone identical to me 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 The right friend for me is me! 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 I looked Taller! 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 I'm a bit humped! 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 I Miss An Eye But O Am I wrong? 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 The Preserved! 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Ah, you know I can't help but notice that the stubble machine passes over the blindfold! 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 So? 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Anything 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 The Lamas is Absurd Yes, because it spits the Egip! 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 No, I said Lorenzo O Sure! Making Meap! 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Now I know everything about you and you know everything about me 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 And I Discovered That You Are 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 The Friend I Want 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 The right friend for me is me! 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Now there you are 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 And We Will Form A Well-said Duo! 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 If Double Doom 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 On TV Tomorrow! 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 What does it mean? Do We Make A Television Program Together? 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Oh No, but it seemed to me that ... I want to say we could, we should! 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Maybe We Are Not Exactly THE SAME! 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 It could be our luck! You Make The Grumpy!
