sounds like a lot of buckets to me it
would<00:00:18.779> be<00:00:19.020> but<00:00:19.439> I'm<00:00:19.529> actually<00:00:19.650> gonna<00:00:19.890> use<00:00:19.980> a

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
would be but I'm actually gonna use a

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.920 
would be but I'm actually gonna use a
transfer<00:00:20.700> pump<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.210> make<00:00:21.360> the<00:00:21.480> job<00:00:21.660> much

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
grade the power of this pump will

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.050 
grade the power of this pump will
actually<00:01:06.330> force<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.899> kink<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.850> what<00:01:08.940> we'll

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
actually force it to kink so what we'll

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.630 
actually force it to kink so what we'll
do<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.300> we'll<00:01:09.420> hook<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.560> our<00:01:10.710> nice

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
do is we'll hook on to our nice

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.440 
do is we'll hook on to our nice
convenient<00:01:12.210> breasts<00:01:12.600> couplings<00:01:13.560> here<00:01:14.450> there

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
convenient breasts couplings here there

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.359 
convenient breasts couplings here there
and<00:01:15.659> then<00:01:16.229> we'll<00:01:16.409> also<00:01:16.560> hook<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:17.070> our

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
and then we'll also hook on our

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.580 
and then we'll also hook on our
discharge<00:01:17.729> hose<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:18.930> we<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.260> pump<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
discharge hose so that we can pump the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.410 
discharge hose so that we can pump the
water<00:01:19.740> wherever<00:01:20.100> wherever<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.060> find<00:01:21.119> a

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420

water wherever wherever we can find a
spot<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.630> put<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:23.840> next<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.320> need<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.860> hook<00:01:26.159> up

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
spot to put it next I need to hook up

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.580 
spot to put it next I need to hook up
our<00:01:26.640> hose<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.540> actual<00:01:27.780> water<00:01:28.020> heater<00:01:28.259> and

it<00:02:03.479> does<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.780> allows<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.200> pump<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.649> actually

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
it does it allows the pump to actually

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.859 
it does it allows the pump to actually
start<00:02:05.189> pumping<00:02:05.520> much<00:02:05.880> faster<00:02:06.390> by<00:02:06.600> having

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
start pumping much faster by having

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.169 
start pumping much faster by having
water<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.619> system<00:02:07.979> that's<00:02:08.910> what<00:02:09.090> we're

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
water in the system that's what we're

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.640 
water in the system that's what we're
gonna<00:02:09.269> do<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.979> take<00:02:11.250> some<00:02:11.519> water<00:02:11.970> and

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
gonna do is just take some water and

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:20.759 
gonna do is just take some water and
pour<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.709> into<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.610> actual<00:02:15.000> port

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.929 

you<00:02:21.769> can<00:02:21.890> see<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.129> takes<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.400> good<00:02:22.579> amount<00:02:22.640> of

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
you can see it takes a good amount of

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.550 
you can see it takes a good amount of
water<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.569> what<00:02:23.719> this<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:23.989> gonna<00:02:24.079> allow<00:02:24.379> you

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
water and what this is gonna allow you

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.789 
water and what this is gonna allow you
to<00:02:24.769> do<00:02:24.920> is<00:02:25.459> pump<00:02:25.819> faster<00:02:26.329> and<00:02:26.569> not<00:02:27.349> wear<00:02:27.650> out

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
to do is pump faster and not wear out

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.559 
to do is pump faster and not wear out
the<00:02:28.040> actual<00:02:28.609> motor<00:02:28.819> so<00:02:28.999> extend<00:02:29.329> the<00:02:29.420> life

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
the actual motor so extend the life

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:30.910 
the actual motor so extend the life
because<00:02:29.900> you're<00:02:29.989> keeping<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.349> pump<00:02:30.530> nice<00:02:30.709> and

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
because you're keeping the pump nice and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.170 
because you're keeping the pump nice and
cool<00:02:33.489> what<00:02:34.489> you<00:02:34.579> want<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.760> do<00:02:34.819> is<00:02:34.939> you<00:02:34.999> want<00:02:35.150> to

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
cool what you want to do is you want to

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.440 
cool what you want to do is you want to
fill<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.569> right<00:02:36.849> up<00:02:37.849> to<00:02:37.879> the<00:02:38.090> point<00:02:38.299> that<00:02:38.359> you

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
fill it right up to the point that you

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.190 
fill it right up to the point that you
can<00:02:38.540> actually<00:02:38.569> see<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.019> water<00:02:39.170> coming<00:02:39.590> out

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
can actually see the water coming out

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.349 
can actually see the water coming out
all<00:02:42.200> right<00:02:42.650> there<00:02:42.920> we<00:02:43.040> go<00:02:43.219> and<00:02:43.849> then<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:44.180> want

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
all right there we go and then you want

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.140 
all right there we go and then you want
to<00:02:44.420> make<00:02:44.540> sure<00:02:45.549> don't<00:02:46.549> you<00:02:46.669> have<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.819> wrench<00:02:47.060> to

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
to make sure don't you have a wrench to

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.970 
to make sure don't you have a wrench to
put<00:02:47.599> the<00:02:47.750> priming<00:02:48.230> port<00:02:48.439> back<00:02:48.590> on<00:02:48.769> nice<00:02:48.950> and

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
put the priming port back on nice and

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.309 
put the priming port back on nice and
tight<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:53.239> you're<00:02:53.359> getting<00:02:53.540> very<00:02:53.689> close<00:02:53.810> to

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
tight and you're getting very close to

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.050 
tight and you're getting very close to
taking<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:54.769> job<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.310> would<00:02:55.400> have<00:02:55.519> taken<00:02:55.730> many

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
taking a job that would have taken many

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.449 
taking a job that would have taken many
many<00:02:56.209> buckets<00:02:56.780> as<00:02:56.959> you<00:02:57.079> said<00:02:57.319> to<00:02:58.099> being<00:02:58.340> done

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
many buckets as you said to being done

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.520 
many buckets as you said to being done
very<00:02:58.519> quickly<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.329> efficiently<00:02:59.510> using<00:02:59.959> our

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
very quickly and efficiently using our

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.739 
very quickly and efficiently using our
pump
