you can see how little text to the page
there<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.729> imagine<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.450> could<00:01:18.509> read<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.900> in

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
there is I imagine I could read this in

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.800 
there is I imagine I could read this in
an<00:01:19.350> afternoon<00:01:19.650> really<00:01:20.070> easily<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.729> even<00:01:21.600> with

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
an afternoon really easily and even with

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.670 
an afternoon really easily and even with
the<00:01:22.049> text<00:01:22.439> being<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.220> large<00:01:23.520> as<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the text being as large as it is and the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.530 
the text being as large as it is and the
margins<00:01:26.040> being<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.520> why<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:27.030> less<00:01:27.330> than<00:01:27.360> a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
margins being so why it's less than a

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.719 
margins being so why it's less than a
hundred<00:01:27.780> pages<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.500> am<00:01:29.159> excited<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.610> read
