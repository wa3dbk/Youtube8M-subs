00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
he just frames the discussion of

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.460 
he just frames the discussion of
nutrition<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.180> genes<00:00:45.450> as<00:00:45.720> hope<00:00:45.990> versus

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
nutrition and genes as hope versus

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.830 
nutrition and genes as hope versus
despair<00:00:46.500> if<00:00:47.460> you're<00:00:48.180> if<00:00:48.360> our<00:00:48.510> health<00:00:48.720> is

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
despair if you're if our health is

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.540 
despair if you're if our health is
primarily<00:00:49.170> due<00:00:49.470> to<00:00:49.500> genes<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.070> there's<00:00:50.250> still

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
primarily due to genes and there's still

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.040 
primarily due to genes and there's still
a<00:00:50.610> lot<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.760> people<00:00:50.910> who<00:00:51.120> believe<00:00:51.150> that<00:00:51.420> we're

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
a lot of people who believe that we're

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.420 
a lot of people who believe that we're
helpless<00:00:52.380> victims<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.950> there's<00:00:53.100> really<00:00:53.250> no

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
helpless victims and there's really no

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.400 
helpless victims and there's really no
point<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.820> trying<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> be<00:00:54.360> healthy<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:55.170> if<00:00:55.290> our

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
point in trying to be healthy but if our

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.410 
point in trying to be healthy but if our
habits<00:00:55.800> play<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> larger<00:00:56.490> role<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:56.910> can<00:00:57.090> control

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
habits play a larger role we can control

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.510 
habits play a larger role we can control
our<00:00:57.690> health<00:00:57.720> future<00:00:58.350> now<00:00:59.010> there's<00:00:59.400> no

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
our health future now there's no

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.980 
our health future now there's no
question<00:00:59.640> that<00:01:00.000> there<00:01:00.150> are<00:01:00.270> some<00:01:00.450> conditions

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:00.990 
question that there are some conditions

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.080 
question that there are some conditions
for<00:01:01.079> which<00:01:01.320> nutrition<00:01:01.860> is<00:01:02.040> not<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.550> pure<00:01:02.880> a

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
for which nutrition is not a pure a

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.969 
for which nutrition is not a pure a
broken<00:01:03.510> arm<00:01:03.600> for<00:01:03.900> example<00:01:03.930> but<00:01:04.799> there<00:01:04.949> are

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
broken arm for example but there are

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.620 
broken arm for example but there are
many<00:01:05.220> more<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.460> diabetes<00:01:06.150> for<00:01:06.570> which

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
many more like diabetes for which

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.840 
many more like diabetes for which
nutrition<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.470> best<00:01:07.860> way<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.100> prevent<00:01:08.520> and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
nutrition is the best way to prevent and

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.029 
nutrition is the best way to prevent and
actually<00:01:09.270> treat<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.689> disease<00:01:10.049> now<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
actually treat the disease now the

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:12.770 
actually treat the disease now the
reason<00:01:11.490> Campbell<00:01:11.819> states<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.210> most<00:01:12.420> people

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
reason Campbell states that most people

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.419 
reason Campbell states that most people
believe<00:01:12.810> what<00:01:13.319> scientists<00:01:13.890> tell<00:01:14.069> us<00:01:14.219> about

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
believe what scientists tell us about

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:16.760 
believe what scientists tell us about
genetics<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:14.999> disease<00:01:15.329> and<00:01:15.899> the<00:01:16.380> reason<00:01:16.679> why

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
genetics and disease and the reason why

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.590 
genetics and disease and the reason why
they<00:01:16.920> had<00:01:17.039> we<00:01:17.249> agree<00:01:17.579> to<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.850> many<00:01:18.060> drugs<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
they had we agree to so many drugs and

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.690 
they had we agree to so many drugs and
procedures<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.319> that<00:01:19.350> most<00:01:19.679> people<00:01:20.069> don't

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
procedures is that most people don't

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.489 
procedures is that most people don't
understand<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.359> origin<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.929> disease<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:22.499 
understand the origin of disease and

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.440 
understand the origin of disease and
gosh<00:01:22.679> how<00:01:22.859> could<00:01:23.009> they<00:01:23.159> expect<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.759> be<00:01:23.850> that

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
gosh how could they expect to be that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.849 
gosh how could they expect to be that
understand<00:01:24.929> it<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.139> mean<00:01:25.319> they're<00:01:25.469> plumbers

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
understand it I mean they're plumbers

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:27.559 
understand it I mean they're plumbers
and<00:01:26.039> accountants<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.609> lawyers<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.210> other

and accountants of lawyers and other

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:29.690 
and accountants of lawyers and other
occupations<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:29.069> they<00:01:29.159> also<00:01:29.310> don't

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700

appreciate her understand the body's

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:33.230 
appreciate her understand the body's
self-healing<00:01:31.770> capacity<00:01:32.639> I<00:01:32.670> mean<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:32.969> you<00:01:33.060> get

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
self-healing capacity I mean if you get

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.730 
self-healing capacity I mean if you get
a<00:01:33.270> cold<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.780> don't<00:01:33.960> do<00:01:34.109> anything<00:01:34.350> in

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
a cold and you don't do anything in

the research community Campbell says is
trapped<00:05:03.750> in<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.020> paradigm<00:05:04.409> that<00:05:04.440> chemicals

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:05.009 
trapped in the paradigm that chemicals

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.610 
trapped in the paradigm that chemicals
cause<00:05:05.220> cancer<00:05:05.819> and<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.870> one<00:05:07.169> of<00:05:07.319> the<00:05:07.380> things

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
cause cancer and and one of the things

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.379 
cause cancer and and one of the things
that<00:05:07.770> keeps<00:05:08.039> people<00:05:08.310> trapped<00:05:08.819> there<00:05:09.060> is<00:05:09.240> the

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
that keeps people trapped there is the

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.200 
that keeps people trapped there is the
idea<00:05:09.750> that<00:05:09.979> if<00:05:10.979> we<00:05:11.190> talk<00:05:11.370> about<00:05:11.520> nutrition<00:05:11.819> and

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
idea that if we talk about nutrition and

idea that if we talk about nutrition and
lifestyle<00:05:12.690> as<00:05:12.990> being<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:13.680> cause<00:05:13.860> of<00:05:13.889> cancer

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
to something I said earlier that

to something I said earlier that
Campbell<00:05:53.310> talks<00:05:53.550> about<00:05:53.789> in<00:05:53.909> the<00:05:54.000> book<00:05:54.150> these

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
Campbell talks about in the book these

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.809 
Campbell talks about in the book these
are<00:05:55.199> the<00:05:55.289> types<00:05:55.500> of<00:05:55.710> studies<00:05:56.039> they<00:05:56.580> get

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:56.819 
are the types of studies they get

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:00.769 
are the types of studies they get
