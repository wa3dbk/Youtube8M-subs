00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
look at the Snowman here we're moving

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.700 
look at the Snowman here we're moving
from<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.790> 2d<00:00:15.150> world<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.809> previous<00:00:16.139> lessons

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
from a 2d world in the previous lessons

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.810 
from a 2d world in the previous lessons
to<00:00:17.070> 3d<00:00:17.940> world<00:00:18.590> this<00:00:19.590> num<00:00:19.920> 1<00:00:20.100> appears<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.670> be

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
to 3d world this num 1 appears to be

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.550 
to 3d world this num 1 appears to be
three-dimensional<00:00:21.270> even<00:00:22.199> though<00:00:22.350> it's

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
three-dimensional even though it's

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.720 
three-dimensional even though it's
projected<00:00:23.250> onto<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.670> flat<00:00:24.060> surface<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:25.400> if<00:00:26.400> you

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
projected onto a flat surface and if you

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.339 
projected onto a flat surface and if you
look<00:00:27.029> at<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.630> has<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.789> texture<00:00:29.900> that<00:00:30.900> appears

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
look at it it has a texture that appears

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.040 
look at it it has a texture that appears
on<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.679> surface<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.399> has<00:00:32.430> shadows<00:00:33.420> which<00:00:33.840> is

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
on the surface it has shadows which is

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.270 
on the surface it has shadows which is
what<00:00:34.290> helps<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.770> give<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.100> its<00:00:35.329> 3d<00:00:36.329> look<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.280> in

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
what helps to give it its 3d look and in

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.490 
what helps to give it its 3d look and in
fact<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.879> graphic<00:00:39.329> system<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:40.140> you're

coordinate system you can go back to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.950 
coordinate system you can go back to
Wikipedia<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.000> look<00:01:27.000> at<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.360> additional

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
Wikipedia and look at the additional

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.920 
Wikipedia and look at the additional
material<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.950> z-axis<00:01:29.220> under<00:01:30.150> Cartesian

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
material on the z-axis under Cartesian

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.920 
material on the z-axis under Cartesian
coordinates<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:34.009> one<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.310> things<00:01:35.579> that

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
coordinates and one of the things that

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.899 
coordinates and one of the things that
you<00:01:36.930> can<00:01:37.140> experiment<00:01:37.619> with<00:01:37.890> if<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.490> look<00:01:38.700> at

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
you can experiment with if you look at

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.370 
you can experiment with if you look at
the<00:01:39.150> draw<00:01:39.509> text<00:01:40.250> program<00:01:41.329> if<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.630> switch<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the draw text program if you switch the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.289 
the draw text program if you switch the
lines<00:01:43.649> around<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:44.670> interchange

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
lines around and it just interchange

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.039 
lines around and it just interchange
them<00:01:45.570> you'll<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.310> that<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:48.049> resulting

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
them you'll see that the resulting

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.289 
them you'll see that the resulting
figure<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.740> different<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.729> reason<00:01:51.090> is

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
figure is different and the reason is

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.249 
figure is different and the reason is
that<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.720> figures<00:01:52.140> are<00:01:52.409> drawn<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:53.100> Z<00:01:53.610> order

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
that the figures are drawn in Z order

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.969 
that the figures are drawn in Z order
from<00:01:55.259> back<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.040> front<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.380> if<00:01:58.710> you

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
from back to front so that if you

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.700 
from back to front so that if you
interchange<00:01:59.490> two<00:02:00.090> lines<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.780> may<00:02:00.990> cause<00:02:01.259> one

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
interchange two lines you may cause one

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.889 
interchange two lines you may cause one
figure<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.250> go<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.729> front<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.240> one<00:02:03.540> figure

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
figure to go to the front and one figure

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.770 
figure to go to the front and one figure
to<00:02:04.079> go<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.560> back<00:02:05.000> this<00:02:06.000> ordering<00:02:06.450> is

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
to go to the back this ordering is

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.180 
to go to the back this ordering is
important<00:02:07.469> because<00:02:07.829> if<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.550> have<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:10.129> say<00:02:11.129> an

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
important because if you have a say an

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.400 
important because if you have a say an
attack<00:02:11.640> element<00:02:12.239> in<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.540> scene<00:02:12.870> that

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
attack element in a scene that

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.690 
attack element in a scene that
is<00:02:14.060> coming<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.210> as<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> threat<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:17.160> has<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.670> be

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
is coming on as a threat it has to be

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.080 
is coming on as a threat it has to be
drawn<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.990> it's<00:02:19.170> not<00:02:19.410> obscured<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.400> the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
drawn so that it's not obscured in the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.790
