00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.910
 Hello everyone, it was cancer and today I wanted 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.700
 would talk 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.610
 again about almost 20 thing is he already 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.980
 coming out soon and in connection with this arise 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.199
 questions that require answers 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.779
 Naturally the first question is equipment 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.490
 is it worth it to buy what to do with it 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.100
 sell or good stuff and so on 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.750
 right now everything is in order so 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.220
 for a start I would like to tell you about 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.369
 that information recently arrived for me 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.920
 what people are currently buying 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.780
 gear there for 5 billion over 2 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.980
 billion and the like huge 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.190
 about the amount 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.500
 I came to the conclusion that all the best 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.870
 clothes that I needed to sell I 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.879
 sold them because firstly i 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.550
 bought by and somehow better than these 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.640
 several times that is, they had 260 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.829
 Dexterity and vitality 80 I bought them for 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.960
 one and a half billion then I sold them 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.590
 just for 500 million 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.270
 respectively, the difference is three times arno and 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.680
 I decided to sell such things 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.899
 because then before the patch and not 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.110
 generally depreciate to kopecks and how 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.460
 those i will lose finances mean 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.530
 the next moment is a weapon again 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.430
 equipment went down just terribly I 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.900
 bought as won kimlo u for 800 or 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.970
 200 billion I do not remember and I sold it 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.979
 just for only 400 this again 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.189
 with great difficulty these two daggers 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.310
 which I have now I bought them in total 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.590
 for 1 million gold and as soon as 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.020
 I immediately laid them out and took them away 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.329
 Now you can buy at auction very 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.970
 good things once laid out 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.610
 guided by the date they not then 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.009
 calculations see tribute there to be 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.350
 one day and 12 hours take away immediately 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.229
 if the thing is good and cheap even 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.829
 no doubt I had a friend 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.450
 amulet shoulder pads and gloves helmet also 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.340
 I had it now could not sell 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.439
 because when you bought it for 70 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.450
 million now for that amount of it 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.340
 I can not sell and sell it for 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.409
 cheaper just do not see the point so I 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.450
 he left the rest of the outfit 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.369
 which I had and I sold it and 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.709
 re-bought a new but slightly cheaper 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.879
 An example of this belt, I bought only 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.850
 for only 5 million 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:17.550
 him again someone lay out 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.440
 then we can say out of ignorance and 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.570
 I bought it right away I bought it 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.730
 again, be guided by this ring 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.110
 here it is again bought file and again 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.630
 someone did not know what is 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.150
 and I'll quickly acquired all 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.070
 ok means next moment if u 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.870
 you have some good tempering 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.180
 which is just awesome 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.880
 big money i recommend this to you all 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.590
 sell but this is again my opinion and 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.300
 you can not like him to pay 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.190
 attention method though asked 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.870
 upload more and more often videos with 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.300
 my opinion I do not know someone can be 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.270
 he really appreciates me though 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.210
 I doubt in general there see what 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:59.100
 piece patch release date as far as i'm concerned 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:04.290
 known she will mean at 8 means 19 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:06.950
 March because I think if 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.990
 auction closing will occur on Tuesday 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.770
 March 18, then on Wednesday comes a new patch 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:18.000
 Why did I decide to release the patch first ? 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.459
 always happens on Wednesday so this is 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.280
 logical well at least in my opinion 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.220
 if March 18, close the auction means 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.550
 Chekhov 19 well, how could this be exactly 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.600
 logically shorter auction means I think 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.510
 partially closed on it will remain 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.970
 to sections such as selling every kind 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.239
 reagent stones and other crap which 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.300
 she doesn't need to buy her 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:48.030
 for some very big money means 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.100
 next time again sell 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.370
 its very good things to 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.550
 then do not get into a loss and get 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.550
 some cheap nutcracker which 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.580
 really good there let's say on 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:05.070
 half a time worse than yours any there 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.930
 and you can into it 50 here in this 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:11.349
 equipment I can pull the top ten 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.549
 That is, guided by this if 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.280
 there will be some more 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:18.699
 and the changes that come to my mind 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.600
 I decided to share with you then I immediately them 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.280
 lay out in general 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.280
 all the best and still
