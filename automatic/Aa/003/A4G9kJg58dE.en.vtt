this<00:00:02.730> is<00:00:02.879> our<00:00:03.060> earth<00:00:03.210> tone<00:00:03.510> flute<00:00:03.750> in<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.020> key

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
this is our earth tone flute in the key

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.190 
this is our earth tone flute in the key
of<00:00:04.259> F<00:00:04.500> sharp<00:00:04.950> minor<00:00:05.250> and<00:00:05.580> it's<00:00:06.540> tuned<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:07.109> the

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
of F sharp minor and it's tuned to the

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.879 
of F sharp minor and it's tuned to the
frequency<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.830> 432<00:00:09.139> the<00:00:10.139> difference<00:00:10.530> between

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
frequency of 432 the difference between

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.060 
frequency of 432 the difference between
the<00:00:11.010> frequencies<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.759> 440<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.719> 432<00:00:13.440> are<00:00:13.679> very

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
the frequencies of 440 and 432 are very

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.289 
the frequencies of 440 and 432 are very
subtle<00:00:14.400> especially<00:00:14.910> when<00:00:15.000> they're<00:00:15.089> played

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
subtle especially when they're played

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.390 
subtle especially when they're played
side<00:00:15.540> by<00:00:15.750> side<00:00:16.020> but<00:00:16.260> really<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.740> about<00:00:16.980> feeling

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
side by side but really is about feeling

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.179 
side by side but really is about feeling
we<00:00:18.359> describe<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.350> go<00:00:19.470> into<00:00:19.529> more<00:00:19.830> detail

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
we describe that and go into more detail

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.070 
we describe that and go into more detail
on<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.490> video<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:21.000> introduces<00:00:21.119> our<00:00:21.750> throne

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
on the video that introduces our throne

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.769 
on the video that introduces our throne
flutes<00:00:22.430> we<00:00:23.430> make<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.789> out<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:23.939> aromatic<00:00:24.570> cedar

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
flutes we make it out of aromatic cedar

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.320 
flutes we make it out of aromatic cedar
which<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.800> really<00:00:26.220> nice<00:00:26.550> tone<00:00:26.939> or<00:00:27.119> woods

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the low notes it is a six hole flute we

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.479 
the low notes it is a six hole flute we
put<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> cover<00:00:36.410> on<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.680> third<00:00:38.040> hole<00:00:38.250> from<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
put a cover on the third hole from the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.760 
put a cover on the third hole from the
top<00:00:38.760> just<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.780> make<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.200> little<00:00:40.320> easier<00:00:40.680> to

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
top just to make it a little easier to

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.260 
top just to make it a little easier to
play<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.340> makes<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.640> look<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.969> five

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270
