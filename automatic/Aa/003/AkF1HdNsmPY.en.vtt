taking a combat and and we've kind of

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.770 
taking a combat and and we've kind of
moved<00:00:47.160> away<00:00:47.370> from<00:00:47.789> her<00:00:47.940> guns<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.450> little<00:00:48.539> bit

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
moved away from her guns a little bit

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.819 
moved away from her guns a little bit
and<00:00:48.989> instead<00:00:49.170> we've<00:00:49.530> moved<00:00:49.739> more<00:00:49.980> into<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:51.829> more

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
and instead we've moved more into a more

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.330 
and instead we've moved more into a more
of<00:00:53.420> an<00:00:54.420> arena<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:55.020> can<00:00:55.140> crank<00:00:55.530> up<00:00:55.710> her<00:00:55.829> speed<00:00:56.129> we

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
of an arena we can crank up her speed we

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.900 
of an arena we can crank up her speed we
can<00:00:56.489> make<00:00:56.670> her<00:00:56.820> much<00:00:57.210> much<00:00:57.449> faster<00:00:58.910> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
can make her much much faster the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.270 
can make her much much faster the
environments<00:01:00.449> are<00:01:00.539> huge<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.710> environments

environments are huge the environments

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.830 
environments are huge the environments
are<00:01:02.370> very<00:01:02.640> dangerous

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
are very dangerous

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.680 
are very dangerous
environments<00:01:04.410> are<00:01:04.559> alive<00:01:05.120> the<00:01:06.120> environments

are<00:01:06.840> vibrant<00:01:07.910> some<00:01:08.910> of<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.090> most<00:01:09.300> successful

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
are vibrant some of the most successful

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.800 
are vibrant some of the most successful
spaces<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.850> tomb<00:01:11.850> raider<00:01:11.880> underworld<00:01:12.600> with

big<00:01:13.170> cabinets<00:01:13.830> underworld<00:01:14.460> spaces<00:01:15.770> we're

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
big cabinets underworld spaces we're

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.380 
big cabinets underworld spaces we're
taking<00:01:17.190> those<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.670> bringing<00:01:17.970> them<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
taking those and bringing them to the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.270 
taking those and bringing them to the
next<00:01:18.600> level<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.530> when<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.800> player<00:01:20.010> walks

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
next level so that when the player walks

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.460 
next level so that when the player walks
into<00:01:20.550> a<00:01:20.729> room<00:01:20.880> they<00:01:21.210> they're<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.050> jaw

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
into a room they they're just jaw

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.650 
into a room they they're just jaw
dropped<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.340> environments<00:01:23.850> themselves<00:01:24.390> are

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
dropped the environments themselves are

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.680 
dropped the environments themselves are
more<00:01:25.170> dangerous<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:27.000> traps<00:01:27.360> are<00:01:27.540> more

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
more dangerous the traps are more

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.960 
more dangerous the traps are more
dangerous<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:29.280> whole<00:01:29.460> thing<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.820> just

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
dangerous and the whole thing is just

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.600 
dangerous and the whole thing is just
grittier

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
grittier

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.210 
grittier
there's<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.510> lot<00:01:32.660> more<00:01:32.840> physics<00:01:33.560> based<00:01:33.740> a<00:01:34.070> lot

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
there's a lot more physics based a lot

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.650 
there's a lot more physics based a lot
more<00:01:34.460> I<00:01:34.790> guess<00:01:35.390> you<00:01:35.480> can<00:01:35.630> say<00:01:36.130> moving<00:01:37.130> pieces

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
more I guess you can say moving pieces

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.400 
more I guess you can say moving pieces
so<00:01:38.660> the<00:01:39.200> world<00:01:39.680> feels<00:01:39.950> a<00:01:40.100> lot<00:01:40.220> more<00:01:40.280> alive<00:01:40.790> and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
so the world feels a lot more alive and

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.470 
so the world feels a lot more alive and
definitely<00:01:42.410> a<00:01:42.740> lot<00:01:42.980> bigger<00:01:43.280> because<00:01:43.520> the

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
definitely a lot bigger because the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.140 
definitely a lot bigger because the
doppelganger<00:01:44.960> can<00:01:45.230> move<00:01:45.770> quicker<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.700> jump

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
doppelganger can move quicker and jump

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.780 
doppelganger can move quicker and jump
higher<00:01:47.330> jump<00:01:47.360> farther<00:01:48.080> so<00:01:48.890> when<00:01:49.550> you<00:01:49.640> actually

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
higher jump farther so when you actually

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.390 
higher jump farther so when you actually
go<00:01:50.120> into<00:01:50.360> these<00:01:50.570> levels<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:51.890> walk<00:01:52.070> into

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
go into these levels and you walk into

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.000 
go into these levels and you walk into
it<00:01:52.520> as<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:53.090> player<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:54.350> actually<00:01:54.680> see<00:01:54.890> this

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
it as a player you actually see this

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.830 
it as a player you actually see this
grad<00:01:55.340> scale<00:01:57.670> lots<00:01:58.670> of<00:01:58.790> stuff<00:01:59.030> going<00:01:59.300> on

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
grad scale lots of stuff going on

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.280 
grad scale lots of stuff going on
motion<00:02:00.440> everywhere<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:02.390> just<00:02:02.420> feels<00:02:03.200> so

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
motion everywhere it just feels so

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.740 
motion everywhere it just feels so
exciting
