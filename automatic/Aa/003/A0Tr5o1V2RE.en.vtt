00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
called broker I don't really know it's

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.330 
called broker I don't really know it's
down<00:01:13.780> here<00:01:13.810> in<00:01:14.260> this<00:01:14.380> little<00:01:14.560> corner<00:01:14.800> you<00:01:15.160> see

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
down here in this little corner you see

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.160 
down here in this little corner you see
where<00:01:15.760> it's<00:01:15.970> like<00:01:16.240> colors<00:01:16.630> a<00:01:16.720> little<00:01:16.840> cross

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
where it's like colors a little cross

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.150 
where it's like colors a little cross
thing<00:01:17.440> what's<00:01:17.680> basically<00:01:17.830> at<00:01:18.070> this

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
thing what's basically at this

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.450 
thing what's basically at this
playground<00:01:18.700> um<00:01:18.910> and<00:01:19.890> right<00:01:20.890> there<00:01:21.100> okay<00:01:21.250> so<00:01:21.400> i

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
playground um and right there okay so i

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.270 
playground um and right there okay so i
can<00:01:21.580> close<00:01:21.729> out<00:01:21.850> of<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.000> probe<00:01:22.150> now<00:01:22.780> I

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
can close out of the probe now I

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.469 
can close out of the probe now I
basically<00:01:24.280> you<00:01:24.490> can<00:01:24.640> just<00:01:24.790> drive<00:01:24.910> up<00:01:25.150> and<00:01:25.330> go

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
basically you can just drive up and go

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.749 
basically you can just drive up and go
up<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.740> swing<00:01:26.740> sets<00:01:26.979> once<00:01:27.160> you<00:01:27.250> decide<00:01:27.520> to<00:01:27.640> get

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
up the swing sets once you decide to get

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.400 
up the swing sets once you decide to get
over<00:01:27.850> there<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:29.110> to<00:01:29.229> spawn<00:01:29.470> it<00:01:29.590> nevermind

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
over there like to spawn it nevermind

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.300 
over there like to spawn it nevermind
basically<00:01:32.410> we're<00:01:32.590> yeah<00:01:32.770> we're<00:01:32.920> using<00:01:33.040> cheat

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
basically we're yeah we're using cheat

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.040 
basically we're yeah we're using cheat
codes<00:01:33.340> but<00:01:33.820> that's<00:01:34.030> because<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.600> fact<00:01:34.780> that<00:01:34.930> I

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
codes but that's because the fact that I

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.540 
codes but that's because the fact that I
really<00:01:35.560> don't<00:01:35.710> care<00:01:35.770> this<00:01:35.920> isn't<00:01:36.160> exactly<00:01:36.430> a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
really don't care this isn't exactly a

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.130 
really don't care this isn't exactly a
walkthrough<00:01:36.970> and<00:01:37.060> holding<00:01:37.420> my<00:01:37.540> second<00:01:37.990> beam

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
walkthrough and holding my second beam

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.180 
walkthrough and holding my second beam
two<00:01:38.290> legs<00:01:38.530> ugh<00:01:38.860> i<00:01:39.930> can't<00:01:40.930> watch<00:01:41.680> live<00:01:41.920> or

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
two legs ugh i can't watch live or

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.050 
two legs ugh i can't watch live or
anything<00:01:42.460> oh<00:01:43.440> Jesus<00:01:44.440> Zach<00:01:44.910> basically<00:01:45.910> see

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
anything oh Jesus Zach basically see

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.800 
anything oh Jesus Zach basically see
these<00:01:46.179> two<00:01:46.330> swing<00:01:46.569> sets<00:01:46.810> here<00:01:47.429> dot<00:01:48.429> you<00:01:49.300> drive

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
these two swing sets here dot you drive

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.630 
these two swing sets here dot you drive
into<00:01:49.960> them<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.470> tag<00:01:50.710> just<00:01:50.860> kind<00:01:51.069> of<00:01:51.130> what<00:01:51.460> you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
into them and tag just kind of what you

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.969 
into them and tag just kind of what you
push<00:01:51.850> against<00:01:52.149> them<00:01:52.390> and<00:01:52.569> get<00:01:53.380> mixers<00:01:53.649> I<00:01:53.800> going

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
push against them and get mixers I going

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.919 
push against them and get mixers I going
to<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.190> car<00:01:54.369> when<00:01:55.149> you<00:01:55.240> push<00:01:55.390> against<00:01:55.810> um

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
to the car when you push against um

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.690 
to the car when you push against um
you'll<00:01:56.440> get<00:01:56.619> flung<00:01:57.039> after<00:01:57.429> a<00:01:57.460> little<00:01:57.580> while

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
you'll get flung after a little while

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.690 
you'll get flung after a little while
and<00:01:58.270> once<00:01:58.750> you<00:01:58.840> get<00:01:58.960> flan<00:01:59.170> you<00:01:59.380> fly<00:01:59.710> you<00:02:00.550> from

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
and once you get flan you fly you from

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.320 
and once you get flan you fly you from
fly<00:02:01.000> fly<00:02:01.210> flown<00:02:02.550> anyway<00:02:03.550> you<00:02:03.610> do<00:02:04.030> either<00:02:04.210> or

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
fly fly flown anyway you do either or

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.410 
fly fly flown anyway you do either or
swing<00:02:04.750> set<00:02:04.960> doesn't<00:02:05.200> really<00:02:05.410> matter<00:02:05.619> which<00:02:06.420> as

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
swing set doesn't really matter which as

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.669 
swing set doesn't really matter which as
you<00:02:07.660> can<00:02:07.690> see<00:02:07.780> that<00:02:08.020> it<00:02:08.140> just<00:02:08.319> kind<00:02:08.470> of<00:02:08.530> threw

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
you can see that it just kind of threw

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.770 
you can see that it just kind of threw
them<00:02:08.800> a<00:02:08.830> little<00:02:08.950> bit<00:02:09.160> uh<00:02:09.340> if<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.330> get<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.600> just

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
them a little bit uh if you get it just

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.330 
them a little bit uh if you get it just
