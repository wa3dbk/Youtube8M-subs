 the bike is a boy ruler 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.550
 commander 3 629 ie wheels which 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:27.500
 new ones chained in general is already pretty 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.500

 technology safe is it confused and funny 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.700
 rear feathers to reduce vibration and 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.379
 to increase horizontal stiffness 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.430
 plus the formation should which too 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.129
 give with a certain stiffness 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.070
 certain vibration damping invertible 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.640
 attention upper tube flattened lower

 Yes, the brand is also a chip conan dale not

 make such a frame almost like carbon 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.509
 and they look from afar watching of course 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:23.970
 if you look closer you can see what it is 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:28.850

 steering column samba 1 8 good durable 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.560
 holding a fork 100 millimeters proper 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.200
 here is a meeting of 100 millimeters 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.140
 see this let's say what about 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.130
 forks disto and leather fork 100 dimensional 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.600
 firm sunlu pupsy model 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.299
 simply and securely opened the number 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.450
 fork with spring adjustment in both 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.180
 legs here can be built softer harder 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.690
 make a brake 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.260
 there 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:08.520
 wire good reliable hydraulics for 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:12.160
 a little money just push 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.840
 contact as he worked the field of vision 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.230
 switches hit right away 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.880
 the transmission here is worth a bred noise 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.650
 shimano

 switch front switch 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.520
 natural mode is a normal practice 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.300
 when the front switch is set 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.830

 high-speed with anti-corrosion coating 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:06.450
 shiny chrome chain chain also 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:12.130
 sits already good quality kmc 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:16.090
 from 8 good reliable ar1a also arose 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.040
 processing is still a nice piece of cinema led

 everywhere there are elements such 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.560
 red red 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.120
 red design, even in reply cables 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.680
 and not all of them are made 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.959
 red and only one cable is 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.830
 so as not to overdo it let's say well 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:41.700
