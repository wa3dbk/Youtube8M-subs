00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.190 
reaching down in between to get the
algae<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.459> me<00:02:15.670> mo<00:02:16.360> crab<00:02:16.569> is<00:02:16.750> nothing<00:02:17.050> that<00:02:17.080> I

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
algae so to me mo crab is nothing that I

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.059 
algae so to me mo crab is nothing that I
have<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.530> worry<00:02:17.769> about<00:02:18.480> he<00:02:19.480> just<00:02:19.920> does<00:02:20.920> this

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
have to worry about he just does this

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.380 
have to worry about he just does this
thing<00:02:21.310> picking<00:02:21.910> on<00:02:22.030> algae<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:23.260> it's<00:02:24.120> all<00:02:25.120> I've

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
thing picking on algae and it's all I've

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.100 
thing picking on algae and it's all I've
ever<00:02:25.420> seen<00:02:25.870> one<00:02:26.080> pic<00:02:26.290> on<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.900> corals<00:02:29.290> are

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
ever seen one pic on and the corals are

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.680 
ever seen one pic on and the corals are
just<00:02:32.110> fine

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.200 

and<00:02:35.230> growing<00:02:35.710> so<00:02:36.430> anyway<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.590> think<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:39.610> I

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
and growing so anyway I think and I

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.970 
and growing so anyway I think and I
recommend<00:02:40.510> them<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:41.350> may<00:02:41.500> hear<00:02:41.680> otherwise

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
recommend them you may hear otherwise

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.520 
recommend them you may hear otherwise
when<00:02:42.640> it<00:02:42.760> comes<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.120> crabs<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.780> certainly

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
when it comes to crabs and certainly

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.970 
when it comes to crabs and certainly
some<00:02:44.770> crabs<00:02:45.070> you<00:02:45.340> don't<00:02:45.520> want<00:02:45.670> your<00:02:45.760> reef<00:02:45.910> tank

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
some crabs you don't want your reef tank

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.260 
some crabs you don't want your reef tank
you<00:02:47.980> know<00:02:48.070> we<00:02:48.190> don't<00:02:48.310> want<00:02:48.490> a<00:02:48.520> gorilla<00:02:48.850> crab<00:02:49.090> in

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
you know we don't want a gorilla crab in

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.450 
you know we don't want a gorilla crab in
your<00:02:49.390> reef<00:02:49.540> tank<00:02:49.780> because<00:02:50.200> he<00:02:50.950> is<00:02:51.100> going<00:02:51.340> to

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
your reef tank because he is going to

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.270 
your reef tank because he is going to
tear<00:02:51.640> things<00:02:51.850> up<00:02:52.060> he's<00:02:52.300> going<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.510> try<00:02:52.690> and

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
tear things up he's going to try and

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.710 
tear things up he's going to try and
attack<00:02:54.280> your<00:02:54.550> snails<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.330> things<00:02:55.540> like<00:02:55.660> that

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
attack your snails and things like that

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.590 
attack your snails and things like that
so<00:02:55.900> it's<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.710> matter<00:02:56.860> of<00:02:56.980> knowing<00:02:57.270> what<00:02:58.270> crabs

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
so it's a matter of knowing what crabs

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.360 
so it's a matter of knowing what crabs
you<00:02:58.780> can<00:02:59.050> and<00:02:59.350> what<00:02:59.470> perhaps<00:02:59.620> you<00:02:59.830> can't<00:03:00.100> put

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
you can and what perhaps you can't put

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.310 
you can and what perhaps you can't put
it<00:03:00.460> your<00:03:00.550> tank<00:03:00.820> it's<00:03:01.690> not<00:03:01.810> a<00:03:01.870> matter<00:03:01.990> of<00:03:02.230> just

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
it your tank it's not a matter of just

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.040 
it your tank it's not a matter of just
not<00:03:03.070> having<00:03:03.370> any<00:03:03.580> and<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:03.970> think<00:03:04.180> that's<00:03:04.390> a<00:03:04.690> big

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
not having any and I think that's a big

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.310 
not having any and I think that's a big
part<00:03:05.080> of<00:03:05.350> it<00:03:05.470> so<00:03:06.250> enjoy<00:03:06.400> them<00:03:06.990> if<00:03:07.990> you<00:03:08.170> have

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
part of it so enjoy them if you have

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.670 
part of it so enjoy them if you have
them<00:03:08.380> they<00:03:09.250> run<00:03:09.490> about<00:03:09.670> eight<00:03:10.510> dollars<00:03:10.930> each

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
them they run about eight dollars each

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.400 
them they run about eight dollars each
usually<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.580> as<00:03:13.420> with<00:03:13.600> all<00:03:13.810> in<00:03:13.990> vertebrates

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
usually and as with all in vertebrates

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.600 
usually and as with all in vertebrates
they<00:03:14.590> require<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:16.350> slower<00:03:17.350> drip<00:03:17.800> acclamation

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
they require a slower drip acclamation

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.940 
they require a slower drip acclamation
although<00:03:19.390> I<00:03:19.450> have<00:03:19.750> found<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:20.140> crabs<00:03:20.590> are<00:03:20.920> a

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
although I have found that crabs are a

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.110 
although I have found that crabs are a
bit<00:03:21.220> more<00:03:21.430> tolerant<00:03:22.000> than<00:03:22.620> other<00:03:24.120> creatures

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
bit more tolerant than other creatures

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.440 
bit more tolerant than other creatures
are<00:03:25.390> in<00:03:26.320> terms<00:03:26.620> of<00:03:27.030> slightly<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.330> know<00:03:28.420> a

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
are in terms of slightly you know a

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.650 
are in terms of slightly you know a
slightly<00:03:28.720> quicker<00:03:29.910> acclamation<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.270> that's

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
slightly quicker acclamation and that's

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.730 
slightly quicker acclamation and that's
it<00:03:32.790> thanks<00:03:33.790> for<00:03:33.820> watching<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.420> I'll<00:03:34.680> talk<00:03:35.680> to

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
it thanks for watching and I'll talk to

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.340 
it thanks for watching and I'll talk to
