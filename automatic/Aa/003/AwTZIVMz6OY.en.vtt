00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.719 
I grabbed a heat gun here and using that
and<00:01:36.470> it<00:01:37.470> was<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> little<00:01:37.920> bit<00:01:38.040> better<00:01:38.159> using

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and it was a little bit better using

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.910 
and it was a little bit better using
that<00:01:38.909> what<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.540> ended<00:01:39.750> up<00:01:39.869> doing<00:01:39.930> as<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.799> can

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
that what I ended up doing as you can

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.649 
that what I ended up doing as you can
see<00:01:41.100> I've<00:01:41.250> got<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.970> battle<00:01:42.299> off

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
see I've got it just to battle off

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.770 
see I've got it just to battle off
I<00:01:42.689> used<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.799> heat<00:01:43.979> gun<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.610> one<00:01:44.820> edge<00:01:45.060> so

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
I used the heat gun on the one edge so

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.480 
I used the heat gun on the one edge so
that<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.020> could<00:01:46.290> get<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.710> start<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.130> come<00:01:47.310> up

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
that I could get it to start to come up

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.990 
that I could get it to start to come up
here<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.200> once<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.350> got<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.829> kind<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.790> went

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
here and once I got that I kind of went

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.999 
here and once I got that I kind of went
around<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.390> other<00:01:51.420> edges<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.229> tried<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.619> you

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
around the other edges and tried to you

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.440 
around the other edges and tried to you
know<00:01:53.070> stick<00:01:53.310> screwdrivers<00:01:54.030> under<00:01:54.299> there

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
know stick screwdrivers under there

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.999 
know stick screwdrivers under there
start<00:01:54.869> prying<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.439> up<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.030> after<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.299> I

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
start prying it up and after that I

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.380 
start prying it up and after that I
actually<00:01:59.009> took<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.579> house<00:01:59.790> put<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.270> in

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
actually took it in the house put it in

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.929 
actually took it in the house put it in
the<00:02:00.509> oven<00:02:00.689> again<00:02:01.130> that<00:02:02.130> really<00:02:02.490> didn't<00:02:02.790> help

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
the oven again that really didn't help

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.840 
the oven again that really didn't help
to<00:02:03.299> help<00:02:03.570> me<00:02:03.719> pull<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.290> off<00:02:04.560> but<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.399> did<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:05.820> is

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
to help me pull it off but it did do is

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.520 
to help me pull it off but it did do is
I<00:02:06.030> think<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.329> preheated<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.049> whole<00:02:07.200> entire

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
I think it preheated the whole entire

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.529 
I think it preheated the whole entire
thing<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.250> made<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.459> easier<00:02:09.119> for<00:02:09.179> me<00:02:09.360> to

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
thing so it made it easier for me to

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.199 
thing so it made it easier for me to
heat<00:02:09.720> more<00:02:09.929> evenly<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.879> suggest<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.970> minute

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
heat more evenly and suggest a minute

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.559 
heat more evenly and suggest a minute
ago<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.420> was<00:02:12.660> able<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.959> grab<00:02:13.260> the

gonna get ready to do that one so you
can<00:02:59.919> just<00:03:00.129> see<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.400> difference<00:03:00.790> there<00:03:01.000> and

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:01.199 
can just see the difference there and

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.449 
can just see the difference there and
you<00:03:02.199> know<00:03:02.290> in<00:03:02.500> different<00:03:02.620> Lighting's<00:03:03.250> and

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
you know in different Lighting's and

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.309 
you know in different Lighting's and
different<00:03:03.790> angles<00:03:03.909> it<00:03:04.510> looks<00:03:04.750> better<00:03:04.959> or

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
different angles it looks better or

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.709 
different angles it looks better or
looks<00:03:05.560> worse<00:03:05.939> but<00:03:06.939> I'm<00:03:07.090> looking<00:03:07.389> forward<00:03:07.689> to

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:07.719 
looks worse but I'm looking forward to

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:08.970 
looks worse but I'm looking forward to
it<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:07.959> think<00:03:08.019> it's<00:03:08.290> gonna<00:03:08.409> look<00:03:08.590> good<00:03:08.739> on<00:03:08.859> the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
it I think it's gonna look good on the

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.589 
it I think it's gonna look good on the
truck<00:03:09.189> I'm<00:03:09.400> gonna<00:03:09.730> go<00:03:09.879> ahead<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.120> mount<00:03:10.299> this

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
truck I'm gonna go ahead and mount this

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.740 
turned out for the amount of work that
it<00:03:29.680> took<00:03:29.829> definitely<00:03:30.819> worth<00:03:30.970> doing<00:03:31.239> it<00:03:31.540> as

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
it took definitely worth doing it as

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.379

opposed<00:03:32.079> to<00:03:32.109> spending<00:03:33.099> the<00:03:33.340> 80<00:03:33.489> bucks<00:03:33.819> on<00:03:34.000> ebay

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
opposed to spending the 80 bucks on ebay

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.009 
opposed to spending the 80 bucks on ebay
for<00:03:34.620> for<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.709> exact<00:03:35.979> same<00:03:36.189> thing<00:03:36.519> and<00:03:36.790> I

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
for for the exact same thing and I

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.330 
for for the exact same thing and I
decided<00:03:38.019> to<00:03:38.139> mention<00:03:38.470> I<00:03:38.560> did<00:03:38.739> mention<00:03:39.099> it

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
decided to mention I did mention it

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.039 
decided to mention I did mention it
while<00:03:39.489> I<00:03:39.519> was<00:03:39.819> doing<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.239> but<00:03:40.870> I<00:03:40.930> actually

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
while I was doing it but I actually

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.629 
while I was doing it but I actually
painted<00:03:41.470> them<00:03:41.560> black<00:03:41.590> with<00:03:41.919> Plasti<00:03:42.370> Dip<00:03:42.400> I

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
painted them black with Plasti Dip I

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:43.830 
painted them black with Plasti Dip I
didn't<00:03:42.819> want<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.030> say<00:03:43.150> anything<00:03:43.180> at<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.629> time

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
didn't want to say anything at the time

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.360 
didn't want to say anything at the time
because<00:03:44.019> I<00:03:44.139> wasn't<00:03:44.739> certain<00:03:45.069> that<00:03:45.129> it<00:03:45.280> was

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
because I wasn't certain that it was

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.499 
because I wasn't certain that it was
going<00:03:45.519> to<00:03:45.579> turn<00:03:45.699> out<00:03:45.759> well<00:03:46.090> but<00:03:46.209> actually

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:46.509 
going to turn out well but actually

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:47.699 
going to turn out well but actually
turned<00:03:46.659> out<00:03:46.780> really<00:03:47.019> good

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
turned out really good

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.259 
turned out really good
I<00:03:47.769> just<00:03:48.250> gotta<00:03:48.430> be<00:03:48.489> a<00:03:48.519> little<00:03:48.549> careful<00:03:48.849> when

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
I just gotta be a little careful when

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.259 
I just gotta be a little careful when
you're<00:03:49.419> removing<00:03:49.599> tape<00:03:50.199> from<00:03:50.470> around<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:51.269> the

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
you're removing tape from around the the

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.539 
you're removing tape from around the the
lenses<00:03:52.659> because<00:03:53.439> what<00:03:53.680> happened<00:03:54.069> is<00:03:54.189> the

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
lenses because what happened is the

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:55.949 
lenses because what happened is the
place<00:03:54.790> to<00:03:54.939> dip<00:03:55.060> will<00:03:55.209> start<00:03:55.419> to<00:03:55.509> come<00:03:55.629> up<00:03:55.689> with

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
place to dip will start to come up with

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.719 
place to dip will start to come up with
it<00:03:56.169> so<00:03:56.379> you<00:03:56.439> go<00:03:56.769> around<00:03:56.859> with<00:03:57.219> a<00:03:57.250> razor<00:03:57.519> blade

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:57.729

or<00:03:57.849> something<00:03:58.359> because<00:03:58.449> otherwise<00:03:58.769> once<00:03:59.769> a

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
or something because otherwise once a

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.520 
or something because otherwise once a
place<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:00.549> dip<00:04:00.699> starts<00:04:01.000> to<00:04:01.120> peel<00:04:01.269> then<00:04:01.569> and<00:04:02.439> you

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
place to dip starts to peel then and you

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.559 
place to dip starts to peel then and you
have<00:04:02.680> all<00:04:02.829> kinds<00:04:03.129> of<00:04:03.159> trouble<00:04:03.519> but<00:04:04.449> that's

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
have all kinds of trouble but that's

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:05.759
