let's get going okay the fourth mode is
called<00:00:34.530> Lydian<00:00:34.949> and<00:00:35.220> it's<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.300> major<00:00:36.480> sounding

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
called Lydian and it's a major sounding

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:39.770 
called Lydian and it's a major sounding
mode<00:00:37.280> but<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.489> interesting<00:00:38.730> thing<00:00:39.150> with<00:00:39.510> it's

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
just like the major scale only it has a

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.319 
just like the major scale only it has a
raised<00:00:42.149> fourth<00:00:42.600> note<00:00:43.460> almost<00:00:44.460> every<00:00:44.760> mode<00:00:44.969> has

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
raised fourth note almost every mode has

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.750 
raised fourth note almost every mode has
a<00:00:45.750> perfect<00:00:46.410> fourth<00:00:46.710> which<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.550> fourth

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
a perfect fourth which is the fourth

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.090 
a perfect fourth which is the fourth
nose<00:00:48.030> straight<00:00:48.420> below<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.930> root<00:00:49.140> but<00:00:49.980> this

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
nose straight below the root but this

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.560 
nose straight below the root but this
one<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.550> know<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.760> gives<00:00:50.879> an<00:00:51.120> interesting

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570
