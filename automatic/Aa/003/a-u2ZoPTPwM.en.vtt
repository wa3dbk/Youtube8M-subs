00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
life visit almost everything I was

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.380 
life visit almost everything I was
brought<00:00:19.109> up<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.380> believe<00:00:19.789> turns<00:00:20.789> out<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.240> be

brought up to believe turns out to be
untrue<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:22.939> think<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.090> key<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.420> any<00:00:24.869> progress

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
untrue I think the key to any progress

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.210 
untrue I think the key to any progress
is<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.180> ask<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.570> question<00:00:27.599> why<00:00:28.260> all<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.949> time

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
is to ask the question why all the time

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.060 
is to ask the question why all the time
and<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:30.539> course<00:00:30.570> questions<00:00:30.990> can<00:00:31.500> get<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.859> into

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
and of course questions can get you into

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.770 
and of course questions can get you into
a<00:00:32.160> lot<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.460> trouble<00:00:33.290> as<00:00:34.290> an<00:00:34.559> individual<00:00:35.780> you

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
a lot of trouble as an individual you

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.990 
a lot of trouble as an individual you
have<00:00:36.809> had<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.649> very<00:00:37.710> limited<00:00:38.610> set<00:00:38.879> of

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
have had a very limited set of
