00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.940
 follow if I'm here to answer 

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.940
 some of the most common concerns 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.759
 I get asked the question social networks 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.429
 of loving tells me döring speak please 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.219
 of treatments to lose weight from 15 to 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:19.189
 20 pounds that do not need surgeries 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.380
 good to see you I'll tell you something there 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.230
 many aesthetic treatments that go 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.470
 to help reduce 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.480
 this means that you are going to lose weight in 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.070
 localized areas like for example 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.530
 abdomen hips arms thighs but already 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.410
 when talking reduction is not of 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.410
 Weight loss is already undergoing a 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.720
 food program which I 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.180
 I recommend that it be gradual I am not 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.890
 favor of fast diets those diets 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.650
 they promise you in a week in two 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.760
 weeks you are going to lower all this weight not 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.010
 you agree with them because 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.739
 normally the rebound effect is worse the 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.590
 rebound effect when you download 15 a month 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.539
 you go up 30 are the most appropriate is that 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.300
 consult with a nutritionist or 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:08.330
 nutritionist this you orient you helps you 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.210
 Take a balanced diet where little to 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.700
 little go down gradually what 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.120
 adequate is supposed to be a pound 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.130
 weekly 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.770
 this would be pretty good because 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.260
 let's think that in 1520 weeks this 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.780
 you can achieve it you will be achieving in 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.580
 your goal is a few months but 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.890
 you are going to achieve your final goal which is 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.500
 be thin if what you want is 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.900
 reduce measures or areas where you have 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.790
 rollitos that you want to lose weight there yes you 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.700
 I recommend aesthetic treatments like 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.460
 the ultrasonic hidrolipoclasia that is 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.070
 of last mesotherapy cavitation 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.200
 the radiofrequency for what it is 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.620
 tone and many others but now 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.210
 you know go to a professional who helps you and 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.510
 take it soft 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.390
 here I have a question from yokai that 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.330
 by the way I fall and send a greeting 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.310
 to his mom yajaira who has written to me 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.259
 several times döring tells me please my 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.690
 Mom admires you thank you very much 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.819
 a kiss and a greeting for you I cairo 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.100
 and he asks me if it's true that the 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.800
 Onion is good for good hair 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.069
 I kylie look at the onion is very famous 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.140
 use it inside the shampoo chop it in 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.630
 bits and use it in the shampoo and it 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.350
 says that for hair growth 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.150
 is very good please write me the 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.850
 girls who have tried it on 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.130
 I am really without I know I am sincere never 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.530
 I have tried but I have many testimonies 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.269
 of clients and friends who tell me that if 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.430
 they have really tried it and that works 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.400
 does not leave a bad smell on the hair because the 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.840
 shampoo neutralizes the smell so the 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.880
 who have tried it, write to us at 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.250
 networks and tell us if it's true that 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.680
 it works and you do not and you do not lose anything 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.080
 check and taste some onions with the 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.940
 in your field and wash regularly 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.340
 after you tell how it went 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.540
 and finally I have a question from 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.130
 a thousand two days she tells me hello 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.920
 of onís I love your makeup what 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.540
 you use in the program thank you very much 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.420
 he says he already wants advice or a 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.150
 counseling because your niece is 15 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.940
 years and she wants to know what the 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.030
 quinceanera dresses that she 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.100
 I should bring the party will be formal in 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.380
 a club but she does not know they're 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.270
 taking girls in this time is 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.290
 super excited wants it to look 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.690
 lovely look here my advice goes 15 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.410
 years unlike many years ago 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.790
 they are not with those stunning dresses 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.600
 big guys and that's not taking 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.580
 now it takes more a simple style a 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.740
 much simpler style where 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.720
 really highlight the natural beauty of 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.430
 the girl if I recommend you 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.230
 definitely the dress is special 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.600
 because always the little friends to be 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.060
 watching and saying who the dress is if 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.400
 they have the opportunity 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.930
 that he is a much better designer 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.569
 because so apart from that we're going to be 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.420
 stimulating Dominican fashion too 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.950
 will stand out in case they do not have 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.260
 the opportunity to pay a designer 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.690
 Dominican because it tries that the dress is 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.480
 simple but have some detail 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.150
 striking it is good to determine what color 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.739
 it's good for her that's good that 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.540
 can talk to a stylist or 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.090
 maybe even in some store the 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.880
 can help you look at various shades 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.460
 of colors those that highlight your face 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.880
 that is the right color takes 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.889
 makeup but not too much because 15 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.310
 years is an age where the girl is already 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.590
 from being a girl to a teenager and 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.070
 You can highlight your eyes with a little 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.810
 of mascara what is a bit of blogs a 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.570
 pink lipstick will come very 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.120
 nice hair suggest you is not 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.160
 very loaded take it the most natural 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.620
 possible if you want to give it as a kind 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.060
 of waves that are being used a lot and gives 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.560
 like this look or a little messy 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.650
 try the same 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.330
 and modern do not do a pick up too 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.919
 the particular to quinceañeras I do not 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.620
 I like it because I see it a little more 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.600
 formal a little more as an adult like that 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.720

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.160
