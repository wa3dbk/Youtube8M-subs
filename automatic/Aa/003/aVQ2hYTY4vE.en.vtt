 a mask of aguiar give that if 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.810
 but our revenue had 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.690
 a spoon of olive oil remembering that he

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.750
 cream in plastic pot on spoon 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.730
 of plastics in shade, right? 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.000
