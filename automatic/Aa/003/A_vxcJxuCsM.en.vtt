00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
going to put it a bit um just for a

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
using a kabuki brush kind of makes it

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.420 
using a kabuki brush kind of makes it
look<00:04:18.590> more<00:04:18.799> natural<00:04:19.040> because<00:04:20.139> super<00:04:21.139> fast
