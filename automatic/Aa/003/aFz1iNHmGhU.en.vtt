I'm<00:00:17.520> bringing<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.910> weapon<00:00:18.270> comparison

I'm bringing you a weapon comparison

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.010 
I'm bringing you a weapon comparison
between<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.470> SKS<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.460> m4<00:00:20.670> 17<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.660> I

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
between the SKS and the m4 17 and I

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.240 
between the SKS and the m4 17 and I
really<00:00:22.320> like<00:00:22.500> both<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.800> them

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
really like both of them

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.710 
really like both of them
now<00:00:23.400> usually<00:00:23.550> treat<00:00:23.970> them<00:00:24.119> more<00:00:24.269> like<00:00:24.449> assault

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
now usually treat them more like assault

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.019 
now usually treat them more like assault
rifles<00:00:25.230> instead<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.710> sniper<00:00:25.980> rifles<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.849> I

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
rifles instead of sniper rifles and I

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.759 
rifles instead of sniper rifles and I
can<00:00:27.180> say<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.480> really<00:00:27.660> works<00:00:27.990> better<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.439> way

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
can say it really works better that way

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.830 
can say it really works better that way

vertical recoil this case has point 55

than<00:01:01.859> double<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.640> means<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.180> SKS<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.840> better

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
than double that means the SKS is better

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.109

recoil pattern shows that the SKS is

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.330 
recoil pattern shows that the SKS is

assault rifles start to struggle you can

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.010 
assault rifles start to struggle you can
also<00:04:31.009> put<00:04:31.280> a<00:04:31.310> laser<00:04:31.610> sight<00:04:31.909> and<00:04:32.300> make<00:04:32.810> it<00:04:32.930> a

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
also put a laser sight and make it a

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.260 
also put a laser sight and make it a

follow-up<00:04:35.779> shots<00:04:36.080> and<00:04:36.379> the<00:04:36.529> forgive<00:04:36.889> is

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
follow-up shots and the forgive is

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.279 
follow-up shots and the forgive is
useless<00:04:37.430> to<00:04:37.610> it<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:38.090> flash<00:04:38.360> suppressor<00:04:38.509> along

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
with the suppressed perk are really

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.029 
with the suppressed perk are really
useful<00:04:41.479> because<00:04:41.810> your<00:04:42.169> enemy<00:04:42.560> is<00:04:42.620> suppressed

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
useful because your enemy is suppressed

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.890 
useful because your enemy is suppressed
and<00:04:43.219> can't<00:04:43.490> spot<00:04:43.819> you<00:04:43.969> because<00:04:44.270> of<00:04:44.419> the<00:04:44.569> hidden

muzzle flash the heavy barrel is also

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:49.149 
muzzle flash the heavy barrel is also
really<00:04:47.330> good<00:04:47.479> for<00:04:47.539> keeping<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.259> SKS<00:04:48.650> accurate

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
demands it the m4 17 is really great too

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.010 
demands it the m4 17 is really great too
again<00:04:55.279> don't<00:04:55.610> use<00:04:55.759> the<00:04:55.879> foregrip<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.840> laser

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
again don't use the foregrip the laser

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.839 
again don't use the foregrip the laser

sight makes it a shotgun in close
quarters<00:04:59.360> it's<00:04:59.900> better<00:05:00.110> to<00:05:00.319> use<00:05:00.349> a<00:05:00.500> scope

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889
