I had more hours in the day a lot of
them<00:05:09.950> would<00:05:10.100> certainly<00:05:10.370> go<00:05:10.520> into<00:05:10.700> making

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
them would certainly go into making

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.640 
them would certainly go into making
videos<00:05:11.270> but<00:05:11.810> it's<00:05:11.870> sometimes<00:05:12.410> it's<00:05:12.590> just

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
videos but it's sometimes it's just

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.440
