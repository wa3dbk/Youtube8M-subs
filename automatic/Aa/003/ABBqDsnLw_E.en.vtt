00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.340
 hello guys with you yawn 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:21.519
 today i want to talk 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.720
 Chinese assembly type 58 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:28.240
 here it is a complete analogue of our t-34 85 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.929
 famous winner of the second world 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:37.120
 war and in the rat want to describe what it is 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:40.900
 man i decided to rock st china up decided 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.910
 121 roll three 140 I am here 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.650
 I am thinking of holding another contest 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.910
 so business so watch out for the video and 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.410
 further you will be aware of all the latest 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:59.020
 events on my channel here are the main ones 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:02.680
 differences according to the machine between the USSR and 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:09.040
 China is that China has a little more 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:13.570
 750r points of strength there for 737 a little 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.910
 less here in terms of the review our Chinese 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.100
 turned out to be sighted but 100 will deliver that floor 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.650
 the tower we got the author Ilyich windows of the tower 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.640
 he gives us a 10 meter view from us 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:32.340
 it turns out 360 t-34 85 there was a prize 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:37.360
 This goes 350 review and the main chip 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.110
 chip even the difference is also between 3485 this 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.830
 58 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:48.400
 this tool from that porn a little weaker 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:54.850
 loses damage 160 and penetration of 128 topics 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:58.060
 most in the USSR 3 4 5 144 penetration and 180 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.700
 damage there is a breakthrough difference small but 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.240
 This level is pretty essential. 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.960
 affects 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.349
 it's tangible on the game but we have here 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.049
 a little higher rate of fire here and how 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.430
 you see the map we have behind the lake fields 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.519
 pass one of 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.709
 well my favorite map i don't kill love 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.739
 this card here is almost balanced 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.920
 balancing believe up to that place on 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.700
 the map is probably the most such 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.750
 unbalanced place all the rest 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.109
 normal direction 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:35.290
 I decide here to break in initially 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:38.450
 here seeing that there is no artillery it is very 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.000
 good position if apply was 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.189
 let's say there is a stronger tower it would be 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.239
 generally more fun booking us too 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:53.480
 345 no different there 45 forehead and turret 90 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.829
 but we even have a mask pierced here. 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:01.159
 how to tank well, does not work 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:04.819
 in general, here is such a car on the dynamics 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:08.810
 By the way, I can also say that the difference 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.489
 there is something there all 455 one all four 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.120
 ride another 55 this this 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:17.829
 the best case from a roller coaster yes and but the main 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:23.359
 The difference is of course the color of China and the USSR 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:26.000
 voice boys here you see 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:28.489
 here I drove the central position took 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.120
 under my cover quite a lot 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:35.389
 on damazhili allies and doev principle 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.699
 got a good shot right here i drove around 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:40.489
 Pushkin and but they will control me very much 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:43.569
 cruel and of course go to the su-100u 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.310
 which for 390 but somehow you don't want and 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:50.750
 then I stayed shot here neatly 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.819
 attracts takin remains the hulk and and 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.159
 I understand that you need to take him to go 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.340
 help our in to 360 people because 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:01.970
 that flank almost broke through us believed 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.109
 lanes on the cee'd bridge right here i'm trying 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.379
 neatly bead 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:08.269
 pick up ilk this but from i don't know maybe 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.699
 be him not with the internet any camp 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.489
 well, in general, then feed me shoot and 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:18.199
 I have 4 without any problems 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:21.769
 Fraga I rush to the base because I think 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:25.100
 Now the seizure will often begin 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:28.920
 the situation happens that you are going 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.420
 good fight kids drischa everything else 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.420
 then in the end just by capturing 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.850
 loses here t34 again did not go on 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.030
 capture I thought was scared 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.850
 the bridge decided to go to the rear of our ally 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.120
 but there at2 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:49.530
 he ran at-2 as we know such 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.570
 I don't know anything about speed 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.830
 seconds is easy as she is generally very 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.460
 fast-fire but she's no problem 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.030
 takes and then the class gets on 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.690
 capture 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.690
 I have three subcaliber left I already 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.880
 almost captured her here he is 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.420
 problem with two shots can pick up 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:13.110
 here I am with a pinwheel podkaliberom class 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:15.390
 we set fire certainly became unfortunate not about 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.640
 he didnâ€™t become very much without a fire extinguisher 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.980
 the guy died is just starting to end 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.960
 go I already run out under clovers 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:27.960
 I'm shooting but wbl send a shell higher and 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:33.060
 accordingly, I do not break it here 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:37.380
 the knights will fly away and take him back to me already 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:40.050
 frags and left alone with the camp 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:45.150
 the strongest mage is not Jackson just a simplification 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:47.490
 the room is also generally alone 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:51.660
 jackson he glowed last time on 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:56.040
 the glacier is there on the detour that's all there 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:59.280
 write in the chat m3 does it write give war 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.229
 All Sarah here is our apt-2. 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.130
 one of the trance at capturing placed there as 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:07.440
 there is no such radio 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:10.430
 ally in his lo and behold 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.390
 rockets writes that jackson was on g9 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.660
 glowed there last time 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:18.650
 But the campaign is well , it actually passes 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:22.140
 if I am not mistaken, it is prohibited by the rules 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:25.229
 give allies location here 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:28.070
 but can ban well in general at all 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:28.070
 couples nesus 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:36.800
 and jackson kills one first and 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:40.130
 what remains is shock and early screams again 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.260
 give the warrior me already thought the warrior as 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.570
 would warrior it is nice but here 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.340
 the same thing Vnukovo just his 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.060
 take to eat honestly not particularly 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.060
 got upset 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:54.230
 Well, so it happened look 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:57.140
 city results and so battle results 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.960
 as we see through the stock we had four 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:02.270
 thousand three hundred twenty two experiences 4422 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:07.660
 such a combination of fun all three thousand 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.660
 silver medal master basic caliber 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:22.460
 inflicted 2860 damage and did not shine on 447 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.230
