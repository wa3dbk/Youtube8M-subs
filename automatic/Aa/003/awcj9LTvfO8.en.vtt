 muscle building of relaxation and this amount of a little bit of 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.030
 time

 a real report in front of the om 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.520
 this port of 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.520
 a competition that brought me to fitness 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.070
 judo competitors for 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.240
 I had a selection championship of France 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.910
 present in china without basketball where I do a sport and turin swimming I 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.910
 past lifeguards and I have always been linked to the sport 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.670
 and it brought me little by little to become aware Tunisian body 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.760
 to avallon of a muscular strength building activity 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.710
 of stretching it makes me realize that every activity that on judo golf 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.540
 the surf needed this complementarity 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.240
 with muscle building the street fishing and we still have plenty 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.380
 other disciplines that I could weight afterwards 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.790

 because there is really a real connection 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.590
 in my experience I would not have been in the sport since I was little 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.110
 my job 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.300

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.609
 in this project that I spent in France chanting north 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:14.880

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:18.729
 two proposed 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.859
 of meditation 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:25.230
 of relaxation it's going to be really an evolutionary digest 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.540
 really turned to self on his conscience on a way of thinking 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.199
 positive ramoin wellness interior 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:36.059
 that people at home can do regularly every day and

 really become aware of the importance of this work on their lives 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:40.839
 daily 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:43.699

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:47.189
 the french golf champion or india 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:49.099
 of bernard thevenet 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.099
 world championships or games 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.749
 the butcher the baker% 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:57.879
 the month 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.759
 18% 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:03.729
 the director would be behind that he is concerned also by this kind of 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:05.219

 who have the showcase 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.359
 but for me the businessman 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.879
 of the everyday man 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:22.930
