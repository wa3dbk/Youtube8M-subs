one shot grenade launcher as a matter of
fact<00:02:23.230> this<00:02:23.440> is<00:02:23.500> often<00:02:23.890> confused<00:02:24.700> with

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
fact this is often confused with

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.760 
fact this is often confused with
bazookas<00:02:27.420> m80<00:02:28.420> launcher<00:02:29.110> which<00:02:29.410> is<00:02:29.560> very

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
bazookas m80 launcher which is very

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
bazookas m80 launcher which is very
similar<00:02:30.160> but<00:02:30.940> slightly<00:02:31.510> different<00:02:35.670> he<00:02:36.670> also

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
similar but slightly different he also

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:49.710 
similar but slightly different he also
comes<00:02:37.210> with<00:02:37.390> an<00:02:38.200> m16<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:46.260> very<00:02:47.260> nice<00:02:47.500> sculpt<00:02:48.720> and

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
comes with an m16 a very nice sculpt and

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.900 
comes with an m16 a very nice sculpt and
with<00:02:50.380> a<00:02:50.410> nice<00:02:50.650> little<00:02:50.800> strap<00:02:51.190> on<00:02:51.459> here<00:02:51.700> which

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
with a nice little strap on here which

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.630 
with a nice little strap on here which
is<00:02:52.150> different<00:02:52.840> from<00:02:53.020> 1982<00:02:53.590> grunts<00:02:54.070> rifle<00:02:54.490> as<00:02:54.580> a

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
is different from 1982 grunts rifle as a

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.250 
is different from 1982 grunts rifle as a
matter<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:54.820> fact<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:55.630> would<00:02:55.750> think<00:02:55.990> that<00:02:56.020> this

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
matter of fact you would think that this

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.220 
matter of fact you would think that this
would<00:02:56.500> just<00:02:56.530> be<00:02:56.830> a<00:02:57.420> complete<00:02:58.420> remould<00:02:59.020> of

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
would just be a complete remould of

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.170 
would just be a complete remould of
grunts<00:02:59.740> rifle<00:03:00.100> just<00:03:00.280> with<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.610> strap<00:03:00.820> on<00:03:01.060> it

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
grunts rifle just with the strap on it

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.090 
grunts rifle just with the strap on it
but<00:03:01.360> no<00:03:01.510> this<00:03:01.720> is<00:03:01.780> actually<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.410> completely

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
but no this is actually a completely

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.510 
but no this is actually a completely
different<00:03:03.330> sculpt<00:03:04.530> although<00:03:05.530> very<00:03:05.920> equal<00:03:06.430> in

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
different sculpt although very equal in

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.330 
different sculpt although very equal in
size<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:08.110> be<00:03:08.200> quite<00:03:08.440> honest<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.800> think<00:03:08.980> this<00:03:09.160> is

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
size to be quite honest I think this is

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.449 
size to be quite honest I think this is
actually<00:03:09.550> the<00:03:10.000> definitive<00:03:10.500> m16<00:03:11.500> from<00:03:12.310> the

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
actually the definitive m16 from the

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:21.450 
actually the definitive m16 from the
vintage<00:03:12.610> line

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:29.520 

and<00:03:22.460> he<00:03:22.819> also<00:03:22.970> comes<00:03:23.480> with<00:03:23.569> a<00:03:26.110> backpack<00:03:28.209> which

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
and he also comes with a backpack which

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.190 
and he also comes with a backpack which
is<00:03:30.530> very<00:03:30.920> unusual<00:03:31.240> you're<00:03:32.240> not<00:03:32.390> in<00:03:32.600> his<00:03:32.750> tank

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
is very unusual you're not in his tank

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.250 
is very unusual you're not in his tank
unlike<00:03:33.980> anything<00:03:34.310> else<00:03:34.640> on<00:03:34.940> his<00:03:35.120> on<00:03:35.900> his<00:03:36.050> body

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
unlike anything else on his on his body

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.520 
unlike anything else on his on his body
I<00:03:36.440> think<00:03:36.740> it<00:03:36.860> was<00:03:36.980> originally<00:03:37.670> meant<00:03:38.209> to<00:03:38.530> evoke

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
I think it was originally meant to evoke

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.610 
I think it was originally meant to evoke
the<00:03:39.770> slightly<00:03:40.340> lighter<00:03:40.760> green<00:03:41.209> of<00:03:41.780> his

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
the slightly lighter green of his

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.910 
the slightly lighter green of his
webbing<00:03:42.890> but<00:03:43.220> it's<00:03:43.459> really<00:03:44.270> tan<00:03:44.630> it<00:03:45.620> almost

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
webbing but it's really tan it almost

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.610 
webbing but it's really tan it almost
looks<00:03:46.130> like<00:03:46.220> an<00:03:46.459> accessory<00:03:46.820> pack

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
looks like an accessory pack

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.260 
looks like an accessory pack
battle<00:03:49.069> gear<00:03:49.220> accessory<00:03:49.700> pack<00:03:49.910> or<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.090> issue

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
battle gear accessory pack or the issue

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:57.400 
battle gear accessory pack or the issue
but<00:03:50.569> it<00:03:51.230> isn't<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:56.450> finally<00:03:56.810> he<00:03:56.959> comes<00:03:57.170> with<00:03:57.290> a

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
but it isn't and finally he comes with a

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:06.809 
but it isn't and finally he comes with a
removable<00:03:57.709> helmet

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.360 

it's<00:04:06.909> a<00:04:06.999> nice<00:04:07.150> pasgt<00:04:07.840> style<00:04:08.709> helmet<00:04:09.129> with

grunt actually kind of retires

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.490 
grunt actually kind of retires
eventually<00:04:41.169> so<00:04:41.919> there<00:04:42.220> is<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.610> slight<00:04:42.970> overlap

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500

eventually so there is a slight overlap
before<00:04:44.500> he<00:04:44.650> actually<00:04:44.830> takes<00:04:45.160> over<00:04:45.520> grunts

looks<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:05.009> theory<00:05:05.279> is<00:05:05.520> is<00:05:05.819> that<00:05:05.999> Hasbro

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:06.719 
looks the theory is is that Hasbro

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:09.199 
looks the theory is is that Hasbro
putted<00:05:07.259> a<00:05:07.289> lot<00:05:07.499> more<00:05:07.740> punchy<00:05:08.459> color<00:05:08.789> and

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:09.209 
putted a lot more punchy color and

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:11.119 
putted a lot more punchy color and
costume<00:05:10.020> like<00:05:10.169> sculpts<00:05:10.709> to<00:05:10.830> give<00:05:10.979> them

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:11.129 
costume like sculpts to give them

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:13.609 
costume like sculpts to give them
individual<00:05:11.969> personalities<00:05:12.779> there<00:05:13.529> were

00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:13.619 
individual personalities there were

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:15.559 
individual personalities there were
after<00:05:14.039> all<00:05:14.159> characters<00:05:14.879> why<00:05:15.059> not<00:05:15.270> just

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:15.569 
after all characters why not just

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.739 
after all characters why not just
faceless<00:05:16.319> soldiers<00:05:17.240> Hasbro<00:05:18.240> must<00:05:18.599> have

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:18.749 
faceless soldiers Hasbro must have

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:21.079 
faceless soldiers Hasbro must have
