00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.240 
metal in real life so we're gonna take
that<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:24.440> we're<00:03:24.739> going<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:24.980> use<00:03:25.220> some

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
that and we're going to use some

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.490 
that and we're going to use some
dimensionals<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.269> pop<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.570> right<00:03:27.080> on<00:03:27.260> top

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
dimensionals and pop that right on top

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.710 
dimensionals and pop that right on top
of<00:03:27.530> my<00:03:27.800> card<00:03:28.070> so<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.430> bigger<00:03:28.640> one<00:03:28.940> I'm

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
of my card so the bigger one I'm

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.270 
of my card so the bigger one I'm
actually<00:03:29.810> going<00:03:30.080> to<00:03:30.170> probably<00:03:30.410> put<00:03:30.709> three<00:03:31.160> of

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
actually going to probably put three of

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.900 
actually going to probably put three of
them<00:03:31.430> back<00:03:31.640> there<00:03:33.100> just<00:03:34.100> take<00:03:34.310> their<00:03:34.489> covers

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
them back there just take their covers

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.120 
them back there just take their covers
off<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:35.390> then<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.050> smaller<00:03:36.410> one<00:03:36.739> I<00:03:36.950> actually

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
off and then the smaller one I actually

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.340 
off and then the smaller one I actually
wanted<00:03:37.610> to<00:03:37.760> pop<00:03:38.000> up<00:03:38.269> a<00:03:38.510> little<00:03:38.959> bit<00:03:39.110> higher

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
wanted to pop up a little bit higher

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.990 
wanted to pop up a little bit higher
than<00:03:39.380> normal<00:03:39.860> so<00:03:40.220> I'm<00:03:40.310> going<00:03:40.489> to<00:03:40.519> take<00:03:40.730> two

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
than normal so I'm going to take two

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.990 
than normal so I'm going to take two
dimensionals<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:41.989> put<00:03:42.920> take<00:03:43.459> that<00:03:43.640> cover<00:03:43.910> off

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
dimensionals and put take that cover off

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.030 
dimensionals and put take that cover off
and<00:03:44.180> then<00:03:44.570> put<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.870> second<00:03:45.260> one<00:03:45.380> right<00:03:45.410> on<00:03:45.799> top

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
and then put the second one right on top

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.160 
and then put the second one right on top
just<00:03:47.030> so<00:03:47.120> that<00:03:47.269> it<00:03:47.360> has<00:03:47.480> a<00:03:47.510> little<00:03:47.780> bit<00:03:47.989> more

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
just so that it has a little bit more

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
just so that it has a little bit more
height<00:03:48.410> on<00:03:48.590> my<00:03:48.739> card<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:51.769> want<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.010> offset

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
height on my card and I want to offset

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.710 
height on my card and I want to offset
that<00:03:53.049> a<00:03:54.049> little<00:03:54.440> bit<00:03:54.530> so<00:03:55.310> my<00:03:55.670> last<00:03:55.940> step<00:03:56.360> is<00:03:56.570> I'm

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
that a little bit so my last step is I'm

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.750 
that a little bit so my last step is I'm
gonna<00:03:56.870> take<00:03:57.080> my<00:03:57.260> around<00:03:57.650> or<00:03:57.830> a<00:03:57.920> stamp<00:03:58.280> set<00:03:58.610> and

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
gonna take my around or a stamp set and

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.970 
gonna take my around or a stamp set and
this<00:03:58.970> is<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.269> little<00:03:59.420> snowflake<00:04:00.110> and<00:04:00.320> i'm

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
this is the little snowflake and i'm

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.300 
this is the little snowflake and i'm
using<00:04:01.459> my<00:04:01.510> coastal<00:04:02.510> cabana<00:04:02.810> ink<00:04:03.110> and<00:04:03.350> i'm<00:04:04.040> just

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
using my coastal cabana ink and i'm just

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.979 
using my coastal cabana ink and i'm just
going<00:04:04.640> to<00:04:04.700> stamp<00:04:05.060> that<00:04:05.299> on<00:04:05.480> some<00:04:05.660> scrap<00:04:05.959> paper

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
going to stamp that on some scrap paper

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.310 
going to stamp that on some scrap paper
and<00:04:06.970> punch<00:04:07.970> that<00:04:08.060> radio<00:04:08.570> with<00:04:08.780> my<00:04:08.959> seven

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
and punch that radio with my seven

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.130 
and punch that radio with my seven
eighths<00:04:09.580> scallop<00:04:10.580> circle<00:04:10.910> punch<00:04:11.150> that's<00:04:12.019> a

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
eighths scallop circle punch that's a

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.830 
eighths scallop circle punch that's a
mouthful<00:04:12.560> so<00:04:13.030> now<00:04:14.030> we're<00:04:14.239> going<00:04:14.330> to<00:04:14.390> take<00:04:14.600> a

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
mouthful so now we're going to take a

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.900 
mouthful so now we're going to take a
dimensional<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:15.830> put<00:04:16.010> that<00:04:16.190> on<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.549> back<00:04:16.669> as

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
dimensional and put that on the back as

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.909 
dimensional and put that on the back as
well<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.840> we're<00:04:17.930> going<00:04:18.049> to<00:04:18.109> put<00:04:18.260> that<00:04:18.470> right

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
well and we're going to put that right

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.840 
well and we're going to put that right
in<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.400> middle<00:04:19.700> and

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
in the middle and

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.610 
in the middle and
of<00:04:20.940> course<00:04:21.209> all<00:04:21.480> cards<00:04:22.020> need<00:04:22.200> a<00:04:22.230> little<00:04:22.500> bit

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
of course all cards need a little bit

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.350 
of course all cards need a little bit
more<00:04:22.770> bling<00:04:22.920> blings<00:04:23.250> so<00:04:23.640> we<00:04:23.850> are<00:04:23.970> going<00:04:24.270> to

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
more bling blings so we are going to

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.140 
more bling blings so we are going to
take<00:04:24.510> some<00:04:24.660> rhinestones<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:25.740> I<00:04:26.670> want<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:26.970> big

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
take some rhinestones and I want the big

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.630 
take some rhinestones and I want the big
one<00:04:27.180> actually<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:27.930> place<00:04:28.200> that<00:04:28.470> right<00:04:29.130> in<00:04:29.400> the

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
one actually and place that right in the

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.100 
one actually and place that right in the
middle<00:04:29.970> what<00:04:30.270> do<00:04:30.330> you<00:04:30.420> think<00:04:30.690> isn't<00:04:31.080> that

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
middle what do you think isn't that

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.530
