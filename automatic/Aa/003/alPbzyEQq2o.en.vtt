00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 summer sun is very high it is very bright 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.220
 she bakes and burns our eyes 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.440
 accordingly need glasses but true without 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.440
 the sun also needs glasses but only 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.750
 some of us do n't care what 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.300
 what others need to know from what should 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.240
 lenses made of glass or of 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.740
 plastic my name is timur and today we 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.740
 deal with this problem 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.040
 points are all different from 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.750
 sun and normal run out 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.330
 play the same sun protection 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.970
 ordinary but with plastic and glass 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.100
 lenses and the most common question 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.680
 and the very first one that is set when 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:56.920
 buying new glasses 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:59.140
 Department's mirror but fun and Th 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.290
 this glass or plastic and glasses 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.110
 plastic but nifiga se so cool 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.000
 the plastic is very and glass is actually 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.250
 more than 90 percent of modern points 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.200
 It is made of plastic and it is connected 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.780
 so that the plastic is firstly easier and 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.450
 secondly softer than glass such glasses 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.820
 As a rule, they have light and thin frames 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.280
 also light almost imperceptible on face 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.590
 wearing such glasses is comfortable they are not 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.390
 leave traces on the nose of such 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.640
 red unpleasant when you wear debt 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.190
 glasses and so if you want to wear 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.789
 everyday glasses constantly and do not want 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.060
 feel 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.500
 choose the extra weight on your face 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.240
 plastic on the other hand if it comes 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.189
 about glasses with diopters here higher 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.860
 look at the glass as would 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.720
 cool and quality was not your plastic 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.930
 solar refractive index 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.320
 he is much lower than normal 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.479
 glass glasses it means at least 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.640
 what if you have the same diopter 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.259
 which is plastic and that the glass is 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.810
 plastic glasses will 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.960
 thicker well, that is, here they will be 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.909
 more visible on the face and they of course 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.070
 will be lighter than glass but still 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.679
 the lenses will be more plain if i 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.360
 you there view -20 or plus 20 then 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.700
 choose glass directly 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.070
 glasses because in such glasses lenses 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.890
 will be much thinner than plastic 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.150
 plastic -20 this is a titova lens 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.660
 through the thickness and introduce you to 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.590
 eyes 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.000
 two plastic glasses 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.220
 probably it is not very comfortable glass it 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.230
 very durable and dense material which 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.750
 may be scratched only more dense 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.170
 minerals such as diamond or for example 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.830
 Amethyst is more simply glass less 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.630
 subject to mechanical damage 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.300
 exactly scratch than plastic glasses 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.550
 and at best you can scratch them 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.050
 keeping us here is such a tistig and here 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.690
 so scrape the glass 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.550
 and plastic glasses can be scratched than 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.130
 anything but it only if it â€™s about 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.110
 scratches and if for example hit with a hammer 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.120
 plastic glasses of course may not 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.120
 stand on the glass instantly 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.890
 broken into a thousand small pieces 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.590
 and god forbid it happens when glasses 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.360
 will be on your head well, you never know there 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.400
 door knocked hanging something in the head 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.130
 will arrive when you have glass glasses 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.720
 Glasses break instantly and your face 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.150
 decorated with small 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.820
 small Komi glass balls 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.190
 Stasik you and glasses this will not happen 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.530
 that is to put it simply, they are safer 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.140
 and in such emergency situations when 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.310
 Angola that arrives or for example 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.310
 so here is so much action 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.130
 Well 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.170
 in the USA for example for this reason 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.580
 the glass glasses is banned from it 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.250
 sold only in exceptional cases 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.660
 medically another minus 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.180
 glass glasses is the difficulty 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.340
 fabrication and in the glass material itself 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.260
 it is at least harder to paint than 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.120
 plastic if you choose among 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.980
 plastic glasses you can easily find 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.010
 a variety of blue and red and green 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.410
 yellow and purple and pink and others 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.560
 acid colors because plastic is simpler 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.560
 paint and the shape is much easier for him 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.110
 give different exotic glass 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.180
 Glasses of course also color but as a rule 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.590
 found mostly either transparent 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.080
 either dark dark 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.600
 black so if you need youth 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.220
 cool glasses yes it's plastic but also badges 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.410
 you need not only to show off 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.690
 in the summer on the beach you will be interested 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.730
 learn and about the protective properties of the most 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.959
 main plus benefit of glass glasses 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.180
 own grief why are they still 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.900
 immerse releasing this infrared 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.850
 radiation 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.680
 glass lenses allow you to absorb 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.140
 most of this spectrum thereby 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.810
 protecting your eyes then bringing something even 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.000
 about the darkest plastic glasses that 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.910
 protect only you from visible solar 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.040
 rays and from infrared they are not at all 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.990
 but they protect in principle all the differences 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.150
 between glass and plastic lenses 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.430
 if i choose among the dear 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.240
 quality points I get all the same 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.190
 on the glass 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.350
 at least because in a year such 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.479
 I will have points like new and on them 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.190
 most likely will not be for what is not 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.830
 I can say these plastic 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.040
 the glasses I bought last week 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.560
 they are of course light they are cheap they are for you 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.450
 colored but they are all scratched 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.700
 Well , do not forget about 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.890
 infrared radiation is all the same 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.660
 harmful but if glasses are needed in just for 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.910
 order to look stylish and cool 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.800
 you probably still need t-shirts 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:20.129
 or for example mugs 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.569
 and sweatshirts but unusual symbols 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:23.819
 a comparison of which you can now 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:26.430
 buy in unlimited quantities in 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:28.110
 official store comparison is there 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.599
 everyone starts magnets ending 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.580
 a variety of sweatshirts should be there for now 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:34.500
 still few prints because i don't know 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.599
 what do you like what do you like 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.340
 so looking forward to your 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.830
 wishes in the comments for this release 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.229
 right here below my name is Timur and you 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.729

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:48.530
 forget and then shop there very very 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.530
 many interesting t-shirt mugs
