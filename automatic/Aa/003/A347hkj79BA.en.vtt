00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.480
 hello again how are you good and 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.699
 I'm around here for good I had a 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.709
 bunch of enamels in boxes as you like 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:16.539
 of you and good to measure super 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.070
 difficult to be looking for enamels to 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.990
 know what I want to put in the caps 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.960
 because a vienna corn glaze and 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.980
 enamels for more summer and I think that such 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.930
 and how do I have it now that I 'm going to 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.039
 teaching is one made of enamel that 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.900
 made me my husband there was only one girl 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.699
 foreign against the channel over here 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.890
 down and good and I think he did it more 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.600
 great in a way but good I have 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.269
 done in way with my measures so that 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.350
 I am occupied by the place that wants to occupy me and 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.999
 well I think that 's a way 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.199
 practice of having it portion of some 

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:42.789
 idea although I took it from this girl 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.829
 but well I'm going to put the channel to 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.050
 let him know that I have taken this girl and 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.789
 well then through my followed if you 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.229
 You want me to teach it, well, things like that 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.839
 also some idea if you have not 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:54.339
 seen is organized and well then well 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.019
 So I think it is super good 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.960
 very organized so you can see the 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.940
 Enamels do not dry quickly and good 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.170
 I think it's a practical way too 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.510
 to organize it and to have them well 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.060
 hung and well then if you want to know 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.280
 the furniture that my husband tells me 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.690
 so stay with me that I teach it good 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.500
 because the furniture is this 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.470
 as you see 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.970
 I woke up so you can see it 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.760
 measurements you see here I still stayed a 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.980
 little bit 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.440
 my husband what he did to me was that he made me 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.840
 I did not make me all the same shelves 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.130
 made the shelves for the glazes more 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.480
 smaller little ones so that for 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.000
 those of kiko more chiquititos so that not 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.740
 there was a lot of room for the fingers in 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.780
 same but for those of saint air that 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.920
 are higher and those of sea flower that are 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.670
 also going down with minor made a 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.270
 little bit taller 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:48.070
 is worth the space a little bit bigger 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:49.720
 has a good 12345678 shelves and the 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.860
 wide I do not know I'll put all the 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.120
 measurements if you want in the box 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.770
 information in case you have 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:59.710
 thought to do or not then well and well 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.510
 you see there is a way and the truth 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.740
 which then mixes a bit because it's 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.250
 nailing my nails and I have not put 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.290
 each in its place but good has been 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.330
 a way to organize them well to have 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.820
 there all the beige colors there in here 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.590
 I have the treatments here I have the 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.990
 treatments more than anything and good those 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.290
 two mixed that are ice that 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.970
 they are my little girl who rush and good 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.590
 Here it is what to train them in English and 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.379
 here the defects of s 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.470
 Kiko is what SofÃ­a gave me then 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:32.739
 brazil beauty is that I love these 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.500
 enamels of this brand and crazy are super 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.879
 super yours but this is enamel 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.190
 true if you have not tried it if you are 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.870
 thinking about buying a thread you know of 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.900
 Brazil is 10 to buy honest 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.730
 because they last a lot and good and they 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.120
 they apply great and I love these 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.599
 enamel meters a lot 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.830
 and these are from this enamel that we 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.810
 never teach because good to the 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.930
 opportunity this enamels the brand of 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.720
 the island that is of the good magnetic 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.060
 tell you that this brand is great for 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.280
 the magnetic ones good for the others not 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.549
 I know because I have not tried it and I have not 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.159
 seen but for the magnetic is super 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.709
 super reliable you know that if I 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:16.230
 you still had the magnetic enamels 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.690
 buff that I did not leave or one and this is 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.980
 that we go to the first sale has the 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.660
 mother is very comfortable because she has the most 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.640
 from here you go wrong is here has the 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.140
 magnet here and then it does not have to be 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.940
 speaking the enamel are you what are you 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.350
 you can make the enamel and it comes out perfect 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.760
 what happens that is a very 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.510
 complete with what I do not like much 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.670
 truth is there and well then nothing here 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.220
 I have what is one that I do not like either 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.200
 a lot because it 's the brush is that it's 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.209
 huge 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.040
 and well, the scar is also 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.599
 here these are also from brasilia 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.180
 beauty and I also like it a lot but 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.220
 the colors the truth that does not make me 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.690
 grace we had cured and this little yellow 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.050
 not to be for decoration I do not 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.720
 you see 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.910
 and these harvest amounts avoids that good 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.640
 what tamara advised me 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.780
 because the glazes lasted for a long time 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.770
 I tried it once the truth that 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.890
 always then as I say 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.970
 I used this one has the rough 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.800
 Chinales husked and I like 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.220
 a lot more so it's for you to eat 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.810
 So you advised me this one, buy yourself 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.150
 this also if you have a chance 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.530
 because it is that you love the channel 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.780
 of tamara if you do not know it also use the 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.300
 information box and well then nothing 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.520
 more the glazes these of risquet 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.830
 they are also super super let me 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.210
 they love it very much this is the base and 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.980
 strengthening that you see how I have it 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.360
 I felt sorry 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.230
 although here I can get it in 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.660
 Portugal 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.180
 and well here I have also then 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.650
 that are my I like a lot for the 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.760
 product I like a lot because the brush is 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.530
 that I do not know why the nation the brush 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.000
 so tiny for which we have the 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.220
 close friendship I really that 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.840
 some brushes that are very wide 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.130
 It costs a job and also I am very 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.170
 fiddler with the nails is that in the 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.850
 moment that saved me once I get a 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.080
 little bit he already takes it from me but I am a 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.420
 Fussy as it is something a little bit already 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.330
 I took off all the nail and start again 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.510
 and well, nothing else, this was the 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.860
 enamel 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.640
 This was the piece of furniture I wanted to show you 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.060
 you see there is from the other airs I have 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.060
 dressing table 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.430
 and well, there 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.310
 you see there I have another kitten that if anything 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.020
 with focused that is maybe I see that 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.030
 it takes more power to this boy but 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.710
 well for the moment with this I need another 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.790
 damn up with if they give me me 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.600
 I buy more of the evil is that is that I 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.600
 love that my downfall 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.669
