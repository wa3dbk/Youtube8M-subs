810 processor runs quite hot and have
been<00:02:21.410> problems<00:02:21.800> with<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.160> I<00:02:23.120> hope<00:02:23.660> this<00:02:23.810> isn't

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
been problems with it I hope this isn't

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.080 
been problems with it I hope this isn't
the<00:02:24.140> case<00:02:24.410> because<00:02:24.650> this<00:02:25.310> is<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.459> very<00:02:25.760> very

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
the case because this is a very very

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.789 
the case because this is a very very
much<00:02:26.299> an<00:02:26.480> anticipated<00:02:27.170> device<00:02:27.440> that<00:02:27.709> we're

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
much an anticipated device that we're

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.039 
much an anticipated device that we're
all<00:02:27.890> hoping<00:02:28.340> will<00:02:29.000> revolutionize<00:02:29.840> arm<00:02:30.650> mobile

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
all hoping will revolutionize arm mobile

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.839 
all hoping will revolutionize arm mobile
devices<00:02:33.049> and<00:02:33.650> enable<00:02:34.069> them<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.220> be<00:02:34.400> powerful

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
devices and enable them to be powerful

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.280 
devices and enable them to be powerful
enough<00:02:34.880> to<00:02:35.060> do<00:02:35.299> pretty<00:02:35.569> much<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.810> jobs<00:02:36.140> we

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
enough to do pretty much the jobs we

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.870 
enough to do pretty much the jobs we
expect<00:02:36.620> our<00:02:36.739> desktop<00:02:37.130> computers<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.730> do

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
expect our desktop computers to do

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
expect our desktop computers to do
however<00:02:39.730> there<00:02:40.730> are<00:02:40.819> issues<00:02:41.180> with<00:02:41.390> this<00:02:41.480> it's

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
however there are issues with this it's

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.160 
however there are issues with this it's
apparently<00:02:42.440> prone<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.280> overheating<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.840> it

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
apparently prone to overheating so it

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.089 
apparently prone to overheating so it
also<00:02:45.290> comes<00:02:45.620> with<00:02:45.709> this<00:02:45.860> nice-looking

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.650 
note all the apps onto it to show you
how<00:03:49.130> it<00:03:49.250> works<00:03:49.489> but<00:03:49.970> we'll<00:03:50.120> see<00:03:50.269> what<00:03:50.359> it's<00:03:50.540> got

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
how it works but we'll see what it's got

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.080 
how it works but we'll see what it's got
bundled<00:03:51.109> with<00:03:51.230> it<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:51.609> I'll<00:03:52.609> show<00:03:52.849> you<00:03:52.940> what

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
bundled with it and I'll show you what

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.449 
bundled with it and I'll show you what
it<00:03:53.209> can<00:03:53.359> do<00:03:53.480> so<00:03:54.049> this<00:03:54.410> is<00:03:54.470> not<00:03:54.889> going<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.280> be

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
it can do so this is not going to be

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.550 
it can do so this is not going to be
quite<00:03:56.389> the<00:03:56.569> same<00:03:56.780> as<00:03:56.959> any<00:03:57.139> of<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.349> devices

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
quite the same as any of the devices

currently<00:03:57.950> on<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.280> market<00:03:58.450> it's<00:03:59.450> probably

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
currently on the market it's probably

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.240 
currently on the market it's probably
the<00:03:59.989> most<00:04:00.109> important<00:04:00.650> device<00:04:00.889> I've<00:04:01.099> ever

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
the most important device I've ever

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.740 
the most important device I've ever
reviewed<00:04:01.639> because<00:04:01.819> it<00:04:02.060> represents<00:04:02.599> the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.640 
octa-core like this one and
in<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.270> next<00:04:12.420> two<00:04:12.660> years<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:13.320> they're<00:04:13.530> going

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
in the next two years and they're going

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.200 
in the next two years and they're going
to<00:04:13.740> be<00:04:13.860> able<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.100> address<00:04:14.400> more<00:04:14.610> RAM<00:04:14.850> and<00:04:15.090> do

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
to be able to address more RAM and do

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.090 
to be able to address more RAM and do
more<00:04:15.420> of<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.690> jobs<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:16.170> are<00:04:16.530> desktop

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
more of the jobs that are desktop

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.920 
more of the jobs that are desktop
computers<00:04:17.730> do<00:04:17.940> so<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:19.620> distinction<00:04:20.489> between

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
computers do so the distinction between

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.750 
computers do so the distinction between
Intel<00:04:21.930> computers<00:04:22.500> running<00:04:22.890> Windows<00:04:23.340> and

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
Intel computers running Windows and

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.330 
Intel computers running Windows and
mobile<00:04:24.690> devices<00:04:25.110> such<00:04:25.320> as<00:04:25.500> this<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.980> later

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
mobile devices such as this and later

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.640 
mobile devices such as this and later
generations<00:04:26.910> of<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.150> iPad<00:04:27.570> are<00:04:28.020> all<00:04:28.290> going<00:04:28.530> to

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
generations of the iPad are all going to

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.040 
generations of the iPad are all going to
be<00:04:28.820> much<00:04:29.820> cursor<00:04:30.330> there<00:04:30.510> they're<00:04:30.720> going<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:30.930> be

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
be much cursor there they're going to be

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.680 
be much cursor there they're going to be
blurs<00:04:31.710> between<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.520> abilities<00:04:33.420> of<00:04:33.450> these

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
blurs between the abilities of these

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.810 
blurs between the abilities of these
devices<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.290> what<00:04:34.500> they<00:04:34.680> represent<00:04:35.340> what

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
devices and what they represent what

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.120 
devices and what they represent what
they<00:04:35.940> stand<00:04:36.120> for<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:36.420> what<00:04:36.540> they<00:04:36.720> can<00:04:36.900> do

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
they stand for and what they can do

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.770 
they stand for and what they can do
right<00:04:38.130> so<00:04:38.460> let's<00:04:38.970> get<00:04:39.120> on<00:04:39.240> and<00:04:39.270> have<00:04:39.510> a<00:04:39.540> look<00:04:39.600> at

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
right so let's get on and have a look at

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.990 
right so let's get on and have a look at
this<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.230> see<00:04:40.740> if<00:04:40.830> we<00:04:40.980> can<00:04:41.130> get<00:04:41.280> any<00:04:41.490> apps<00:04:41.700> onto

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
this and see if we can get any apps onto

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.780 
this and see if we can get any apps onto
here<00:04:42.270> so<00:04:42.510> we<00:04:42.630> have<00:04:42.840> a<00:04:43.050> wide<00:04:43.980> range<00:04:44.010> of<00:04:44.490> apps

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
here so we have a wide range of apps

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:45.920 
here so we have a wide range of apps
already<00:04:45.090> on<00:04:45.450> here

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
already on here

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.840 
already on here
and<00:04:46.740> many<00:04:46.919> of<00:04:47.010> these<00:04:47.100> I've<00:04:47.280> never<00:04:47.490> seen<00:04:47.730> before

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
and many of these I've never seen before

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.900 
and many of these I've never seen before
and<00:04:48.180> they<00:04:48.240> probably<00:04:48.419> relate<00:04:48.750> specifically<00:04:49.470> to

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
and they probably relate specifically to

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.630 
and they probably relate specifically to
this<00:04:50.930> device<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.830> this<00:04:53.040> yes<00:04:53.310> I'm<00:04:53.460> about

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
this device and this yes I'm about

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.530 
this device and this yes I'm about
64-bit<00:04:54.600> tester<00:04:55.050> here<00:04:56.060> so<00:04:57.060> this<00:04:57.210> is<00:04:57.360> not<00:04:57.390> a

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
64-bit tester here so this is not a

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.000 
64-bit tester here so this is not a
commercial<00:04:57.930> product<00:04:58.470> it's<00:04:58.680> very<00:04:58.860> much<00:04:58.980> a

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
commercial product it's very much a

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.800 
commercial product it's very much a
testbed

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
testbed

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.960 
testbed
it<00:05:00.810> doesn't<00:05:01.290> feel<00:05:01.560> completely<00:05:02.220> finished<00:05:02.730> it's

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
it doesn't feel completely finished it's

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.240 
it doesn't feel completely finished it's
not<00:05:03.120> badly<00:05:03.600> made<00:05:03.810> but<00:05:04.200> so<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.620> screen<00:05:04.919> sticks

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
not badly made but so the screen sticks

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.310 
not badly made but so the screen sticks
out<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.430> bit<00:05:05.550> at<00:05:05.760> the<00:05:05.850> bottom<00:05:06.180> here<00:05:06.480> it's<00:05:07.110> a<00:05:07.169> bit

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
out a bit at the bottom here it's a bit

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.320 
out a bit at the bottom here it's a bit
wobbly<00:05:07.530> there<00:05:07.680> as<00:05:08.070> you<00:05:08.580> can<00:05:08.730> see<00:05:09.000> it's<00:05:09.150> not

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
wobbly there as you can see it's not

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.510 
wobbly there as you can see it's not
