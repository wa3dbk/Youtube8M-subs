don't<00:00:32.160> appreciate<00:00:32.250> just<00:00:32.790> what<00:00:32.910> goes<00:00:33.060> on<00:00:33.240> in

and<00:00:35.219> actually<00:00:35.399> coaching<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:35.910> probably<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
and actually coaching is probably the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.520 
and actually coaching is probably the
last<00:00:36.420> thing<00:00:36.600> from<00:00:36.690> your<00:00:36.840> mind<00:00:36.899> at<00:00:37.170> those<00:00:37.290> times

practice<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:37.950> can<00:02:38.099> run<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.400> track<00:02:38.640> and

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
practice and you can run the track and

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.220 
practice and you can run the track and
you<00:02:38.910> can<00:02:39.060> do<00:02:39.180> all<00:02:39.299> that<00:02:39.450> but<00:02:39.629> there<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:39.900> nothing

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
you can do all that but there is nothing

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.630 
you can do all that but there is nothing
like<00:02:40.349> getting<00:02:40.410> out<00:02:40.769> and<00:02:40.950> playing<00:02:41.190> some<00:02:41.370> games

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
like getting out and playing some games

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.330 
like getting out and playing some games
and<00:02:42.269> what<00:02:42.599> we<00:02:42.690> call<00:02:42.870> game<00:02:43.079> shape<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.860> think

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
and what we call game shape and I think

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.890 
and what we call game shape and I think
it<00:02:44.400> would<00:02:44.459> be<00:02:44.610> be<00:02:45.030> good<00:02:45.209> you<00:02:45.450> know<00:02:45.540> be<00:02:45.690> good<00:02:45.810> to

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
it would be be good you know be good to

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.300 
it would be be good you know be good to
mix<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.200> lines<00:02:46.379> that<00:02:46.590> makes<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.860> guys<00:02:47.010> around

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
mix the lines that makes the guys around

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.009 
mix the lines that makes the guys around
and<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:47.730> it's<00:02:48.450> obviously<00:02:48.720> going<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.959> be

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
and and it's obviously going to be

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.390

camp you've been through height of them

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.220 
camp you've been through height of them
already<00:03:02.670> with<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:02.910> Sheffield<00:03:03.269> steel<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.690> this

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
already with the Sheffield steel is this

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.869 
already with the Sheffield steel is this
one<00:03:04.379> any<00:03:04.530> different<00:03:05.510> in<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:07.319> some<00:03:07.530> ways

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
one any different in in some ways

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:12.020 
one any different in in some ways
possibly<00:03:08.879> I<00:03:09.150> mean<00:03:09.329> we've<00:03:10.290> got<00:03:10.500> some<00:03:11.489> new<00:03:11.609> faces

possibly I mean we've got some new faces

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.710 
possibly I mean we've got some new faces
in<00:03:12.060> again<00:03:12.450> but<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:13.579> think<00:03:14.579> it's<00:03:14.730> it's<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:15.299> the

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
in again but I think it's it's just the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.630 
in again but I think it's it's just the
anticipation<00:03:15.959> for<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.680> for<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.430> upcoming

anticipation for the for the upcoming

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.420 
anticipation for the for the upcoming
seasons<00:03:18.150> possibly<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:19.099> greater<00:03:20.099> than<00:03:20.310> it

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
seasons possibly that greater than it

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.819 
seasons possibly that greater than it
has<00:03:20.579> been<00:03:20.849> even<00:03:21.060> in<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.269> past<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:22.049> also

time<00:04:13.199> and<00:04:13.530> not<00:04:14.209> rolling<00:04:15.209> six<00:04:15.599> defenseman<00:04:16.139> at

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
time and not rolling six defenseman at

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.900 
time and not rolling six defenseman at
least<00:04:16.590> for<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.799> start<00:04:17.099> here<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.609> and

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
least for the start here and and

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.460 
least for the start here and and
perceivably<00:04:18.840> for<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.109> year<00:04:19.199> that'd<00:04:19.349> be

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
perceivably for the year that'd be

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.039 
perceivably for the year that'd be
brilliant<00:04:20.010> I<00:04:20.370> mean<00:04:20.579> that's<00:04:21.389> sort<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.660> returned

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
brilliant I mean that's sort of returned

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.750 
brilliant I mean that's sort of returned
to<00:04:22.260> North<00:04:22.440> American<00:04:22.919> days<00:04:23.099> where<00:04:23.520> and

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
to North American days where and

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.659 
to North American days where and
hopefully<00:04:24.330> with<00:04:25.020> extra<00:04:25.349> bodies<00:04:25.650> we<00:04:25.800> can<00:04:25.919> play

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
hopefully with extra bodies we can play

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.910 
hopefully with extra bodies we can play
that<00:04:26.820> much<00:04:27.030> harder<00:04:27.390> and<00:04:27.570> not

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
that much harder and not

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.890 
that much harder and not
more<00:04:28.160> physical<00:04:28.640> throughout<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.270> season<00:04:29.630> so

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
more physical throughout the season so

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.860 
more physical throughout the season so
that's<00:04:30.770> definitely<00:04:31.400> one<00:04:31.610> aspect<00:04:32.120> of<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:32.390> but<00:04:32.540> I

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
that's definitely one aspect of it but I

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.810 
that's definitely one aspect of it but I
guess<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.230> other<00:04:33.320> is<00:04:33.590> like<00:04:33.890> you<00:04:34.010> say<00:04:34.190> a<00:04:34.220> bit<00:04:34.700> of

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
guess the other is like you say a bit of

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.330 
guess the other is like you say a bit of
maybe<00:04:35.120> a<00:04:35.210> bit<00:04:35.540> more<00:04:35.570> quality<00:04:36.140> I<00:04:36.560> think<00:04:37.250> we've

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
maybe a bit more quality I think we've

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.300 
maybe a bit more quality I think we've
made<00:04:37.520> some<00:04:37.580> improvements<00:04:38.330> on<00:04:38.450> last<00:04:38.870> year

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
made some improvements on last year

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.920 
made some improvements on last year
although<00:04:40.310> we<00:04:41.090> haven't<00:04:41.240> been<00:04:41.420> on<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.600> ice<00:04:41.690> yet

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
although we haven't been on the ice yet

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.320 
although we haven't been on the ice yet
together<00:04:42.110> so<00:04:42.680> it's<00:04:43.010> always<00:04:43.220> interesting<00:04:44.120> to

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
together so it's always interesting to

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.420 
together so it's always interesting to
see<00:04:44.390> how<00:04:44.660> guys'll<00:04:45.080> gel<00:04:45.350> but<00:04:46.040> we<00:04:46.160> do<00:04:46.250> have<00:04:46.400> I

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
see how guys'll gel but we do have I

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.790 
see how guys'll gel but we do have I
think<00:04:46.760> just<00:04:47.180> from<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:47.840> few<00:04:47.990> days<00:04:48.140> and<00:04:48.530> a

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
think just from the few days and a

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.050 
think just from the few days and a
little<00:04:48.980> bit<00:04:49.100> of<00:04:49.190> time<00:04:49.310> spent<00:04:49.640> with<00:04:49.700> them<00:04:49.910> so

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
little bit of time spent with them so

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.330 
little bit of time spent with them so
far<00:04:50.090> I<00:04:50.360> think<00:04:50.590> we've<00:04:51.590> got<00:04:51.740> some<00:04:51.890> quality

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
far I think we've got some quality

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.300 
far I think we've got some quality
people<00:04:52.520> so<00:04:53.060> and<00:04:53.660> some<00:04:54.020> talented<00:04:54.920> players<00:04:55.130> from

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
people so and some talented players from

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.340 
people so and some talented players from
what<00:04:55.400> I<00:04:55.430> hear<00:04:55.610> so<00:04:55.880> it<00:04:56.000> should<00:04:56.210> be<00:04:56.240> should<00:04:57.200> be<00:04:57.260> a

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
what I hear so it should be should be a

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.890 
what I hear so it should be should be a
good<00:04:57.500> mix<00:04:57.970> neither<00:04:58.970> play<00:04:59.180> did<00:04:59.390> explain<00:04:59.750> the

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
good mix neither play did explain the

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.540 
good mix neither play did explain the
big<00:05:00.050> difference<00:05:00.350> between<00:05:00.410> having<00:05:00.800> five<00:05:01.160> and

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
big difference between having five and

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.820 
big difference between having five and
six<00:05:01.850> defenseman<00:05:02.420> in<00:05:02.600> a<00:05:02.900> game<00:05:03.080> situation<00:05:03.320> and

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
six defenseman in a game situation and

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.320 
six defenseman in a game situation and
what<00:05:03.920> they<00:05:04.040> actually<00:05:04.190> physical<00:05:05.000> difference

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
what they actually physical difference

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.960 
what they actually physical difference
is<00:05:05.480> in<00:05:05.600> that<00:05:06.160> there's<00:05:07.160> numerous<00:05:07.580> differences

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
is in that there's numerous differences

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.540 
is in that there's numerous differences
one<00:05:08.270> of<00:05:08.390> them<00:05:08.590> just<00:05:09.590> from<00:05:09.740> a<00:05:09.830> comfort<00:05:10.220> sort<00:05:10.490> of

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
one of them just from a comfort sort of

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.830 
one of them just from a comfort sort of
standpoint<00:05:10.850> is<00:05:11.210> playing<00:05:11.450> with<00:05:11.600> the<00:05:11.660> same

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
standpoint is playing with the same

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.320 
standpoint is playing with the same
player<00:05:12.370> shifting<00:05:13.370> and<00:05:13.550> shift<00:05:13.760> out<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:14.210> not

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
player shifting and shift out and not

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.600 
player shifting and shift out and not
not<00:05:14.510> changing<00:05:14.990> so<00:05:15.200> much<00:05:15.380> as<00:05:15.980> a<00:05:16.040> five-man

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
not changing so much as a five-man

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.470 
not changing so much as a five-man
rotation<00:05:16.640> might<00:05:17.300> do<00:05:18.190> that's<00:05:19.190> that<00:05:19.520> it<00:05:19.910> means<00:05:20.300> a

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
rotation might do that's that it means a

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.720 
rotation might do that's that it means a
lot<00:05:20.630> to<00:05:20.800> recognizing<00:05:21.800> situations<00:05:22.460> on<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:22.640> ice

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
lot to recognizing situations on the ice

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.220 
lot to recognizing situations on the ice
and<00:05:23.120> knowing<00:05:23.360> what<00:05:23.510> your<00:05:23.720> partner's<00:05:24.050> going<00:05:24.170> to

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
and knowing what your partner's going to

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.140 
and knowing what your partner's going to
do<00:05:24.380> and<00:05:24.590> and<00:05:24.770> kind<00:05:25.460> of<00:05:25.520> getting<00:05:25.760> a<00:05:25.910> feel<00:05:26.090> for

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
do and and kind of getting a feel for

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.940 
do and and kind of getting a feel for
each<00:05:26.390> other<00:05:26.570> you<00:05:26.780> can<00:05:26.900> build<00:05:27.110> on<00:05:27.290> game<00:05:27.560> in<00:05:27.770> and

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
each other you can build on game in and

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.730 
each other you can build on game in and
game<00:05:27.980> out<00:05:28.660> beyond<00:05:29.660> that<00:05:29.870> situations<00:05:30.590> like

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
game out beyond that situations like

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.240 
game out beyond that situations like
penalty<00:05:31.190> kill<00:05:31.430> or<00:05:32.240> injuries<00:05:32.930> it<00:05:33.860> just<00:05:34.070> means

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
penalty kill or injuries it just means

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.300 
penalty kill or injuries it just means
that<00:05:34.430> you<00:05:35.270> don't<00:05:35.420> have<00:05:35.890> three<00:05:36.890> or<00:05:36.980> four<00:05:37.130> guys

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
that you don't have three or four guys

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.120 
that you don't have three or four guys
on<00:05:38.150> and<00:05:38.390> off<00:05:38.450> the<00:05:38.600> ice<00:05:38.720> for<00:05:39.380> 40<00:05:39.650> minutes<00:05:39.830> one

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
on and off the ice for 40 minutes one

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.560 
on and off the ice for 40 minutes one
night<00:05:40.340> for<00:05:40.580> maybe<00:05:40.730> three<00:05:40.940> games<00:05:41.180> in<00:05:41.360> a<00:05:41.420> row<00:05:41.450> and

night for maybe three games in a row and

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.020 
night for maybe three games in a row and
and<00:05:41.920> quite<00:05:42.920> worn<00:05:43.340> out<00:05:43.490> for<00:05:43.640> the<00:05:43.700> next<00:05:43.880> couple

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
and quite worn out for the next couple

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.290 
and quite worn out for the next couple
weeks<00:05:44.180> an<00:05:45.140> extra<00:05:45.470> body<00:05:45.710> can<00:05:46.490> go<00:05:46.640> a<00:05:46.850> really<00:05:47.120> long

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
weeks an extra body can go a really long

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.960 
weeks an extra body can go a really long
ways<00:05:47.660> and<00:05:47.770> again<00:05:48.770> just<00:05:49.280> up<00:05:49.490> the<00:05:49.640> tempo

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
ways and again just up the tempo

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.790 
ways and again just up the tempo
everyone<00:05:50.300> gets<00:05:50.480> to<00:05:50.690> rests<00:05:51.140> between<00:05:51.350> shifts

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
everyone gets to rests between shifts

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.610 
everyone gets to rests between shifts
rather<00:05:52.130> than<00:05:52.310> one<00:05:52.550> or<00:05:53.240> two<00:05:53.300> every<00:05:53.810> two<00:05:54.230> shifts

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
rather than one or two every two shifts

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.920 
rather than one or two every two shifts
on<00:05:55.160> a<00:05:55.220> five-man<00:05:55.700> rotation<00:05:55.730> so<00:05:56.330> it<00:05:56.390> should

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
on a five-man rotation so it should

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.580 
on a five-man rotation so it should
equate<00:05:57.410> to<00:05:57.440> more<00:05:57.590> physical<00:05:58.310> play<00:05:58.520> and<00:05:58.790> and

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
equate to more physical play and and

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.500 
equate to more physical play and and
just<00:06:00.590> more<00:06:00.740> energy<00:06:01.100> all<00:06:01.220> around<00:06:01.250> just<00:06:02.060> finally

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
just more energy all around just finally

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.120

do<00:06:02.570> you<00:06:02.690> still<00:06:02.900> get<00:06:03.020> as<00:06:03.140> excited<00:06:03.260> at<00:06:03.800> the<00:06:03.860> start

do you still get as excited at the start
of<00:06:04.220> another<00:06:04.310> campaign<00:06:04.880> as<00:06:05.090> you<00:06:05.210> did

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
of another campaign as you did

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.220 
of another campaign as you did
favourably<00:06:06.500> ten<00:06:06.860> years<00:06:07.040> ago<00:06:07.280> I<00:06:08.080> get<00:06:09.080> more

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
favourably ten years ago I get more

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.910 
favourably ten years ago I get more
excited<00:06:09.880> it's<00:06:10.880> it's<00:06:11.360> it<00:06:11.720> could<00:06:11.960> be<00:06:12.140> a<00:06:12.380> tough<00:06:12.770> to

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:12.920 
excited it's it's it could be a tough to

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.520 
excited it's it's it could be a tough to
game<00:06:13.070> to<00:06:13.460> leave<00:06:13.670> I<00:06:13.850> think<00:06:14.260> when<00:06:15.260> it<00:06:15.380> does

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
game to leave I think when it does

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.610 
game to leave I think when it does
happen<00:06:15.710> because<00:06:16.040> the<00:06:16.910> more<00:06:17.180> you<00:06:17.540> move<00:06:18.020> on<00:06:18.230> the

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
happen because the more you move on the

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.470 
happen because the more you move on the
older<00:06:18.860> you<00:06:18.920> get<00:06:19.040> the<00:06:19.100> more<00:06:19.280> other<00:06:19.940> commitments

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480 
older you get the more other commitments

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.300 
older you get the more other commitments
you<00:06:20.540> might<00:06:20.690> have<00:06:20.840> in<00:06:20.990> your<00:06:21.050> life<00:06:21.260> the<00:06:22.130> more<00:06:22.250> you

you might have in your life the more you
