00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.000
New Delhi, India

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.360
India… Exotic land.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.560
First of all, it’s monkeys that roam around like cats in Ukraine.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.180
It’s many various palm trees.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.140
It’s oxen, harnessed like horses, carrying something.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.160
It’s camel caravans, carrying gigantic bales.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.740
It’s funny Indians, always staring at us: “And what is this? What?

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.240
Aaa a white man, hahaha”.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.780
But despite all of this beauty, it’s trash.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.500
It’s very dirty. Here rivers stink of manure and sewage, and they are oh so dirty.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.640
Uttar Pradesh

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.260
We are being given sugar cane

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.380
So? How do you eat it?

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.680
Here? This?

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.800
Aha. Let’s taste it

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.660
Uttarakhand, river Ganges

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.080
Frankly speaking, we thought that it was going to be a lot colder in the Himalayas.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.640
The weather is great though, just like our Ukrainian summer.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.040
However, hills here are fu-u-un.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.520
Thank God, the views are just fantastic, fairy talish.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.000
They delight the soul, the heart and give you the strength to keep pedalling up the hill.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:43.600
Also, here, in the Himalayas, there are no frantic Indians,

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.800
no drivers and the omnipresent “honk-honk-honk”,

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.320
no rickshaws that cut you off all the time.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.640
There is somehow much less of this stuff here.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.060
Why won’t this fire burn? Burn!

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.860
It’s burning.
