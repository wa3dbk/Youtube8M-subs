00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.260
 the teaser is one of the most tricks 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.880
 old ones that exist in advertising is 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.830
 a way of communicating that is based on 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.910
 fragment the information to generate 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.170
 Expectation and curiosity in the users 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.790
 A name is usually shown 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.040
 brand new or a product whose 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.290
 operation we do not know and it increases 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.250
 the expectation until finally it 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.250
 reveals the enigma 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.790
 as an advertising format the teaser is 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.800
 has extended to artistic disciplines 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.410
 like the cinema the music or even the 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.210
 theater and almost always he has done the 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.910
 same way showing a few 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.770
 images revealing a famous actor or a 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.869
 especially well-known music 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.789
 as always, video games have 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.359
 used the teaser in a very similar way 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:25.450
 to the cinema they have shown a logo a face a 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:28.009
 fragment of the story or a music 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.159
 but they have always left out the 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.590
 most important the part that defines the 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.890
 video games as a medium have left out 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.920
 the gameplay yes they have agreed 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.890
 existed we see them but a demo is not 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.259
 a teaser in advertising slang a 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.929
 demo is a product test a 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.489
 small sample of something finished is a 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.579
 trailer with the best moments of the 

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:55.250
 movie is not an enigma because in a 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:58.099
 teaser that is the keyword the enigma 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.860
 the fragmented information 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:02.299
 the expectation the desire to know more than 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.000
 it causes something to be recorded in our minds 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.470
 when they reveal it to us and probably 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.179
 one of the biggest enigmas of the 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.690
 history of video games has been 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.010
 pete and piti or play ball teaser was a 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.170
 revealed game without much fanfare 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.300
 during the gamescom of 2014 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.489
 an unknown developer we 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.510
 teaches a trailer of the most generic and 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.819
 invites us to try a teaser 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.319
 interactive taking advantage of the absolute 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.099
 drought of titles that we suffered during 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.099
 the last summer 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.430
 almost the least important thing about piti is that 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.950
 finally ends up being a teaser of a 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.950
 game that will never see the light because piti 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.900
 it turns out to be much more than that 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.180
 it's an experiment that tells us about 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.310
 of terror is an experience 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.110
 wonderful mind built of 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.900
 narrative based on the environment and 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.550
 repetition is a teaser of a few 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.040
 hours of duration with a single scenario 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.720
 and without just characters and dialogues that 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.209
 however , it is capable of provoking 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.849
 more intense sensations than most 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.489
 of triples ah but let's start with the 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:06.060
 principle the game places us in the place 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.010
 more generic that there is a hallway one 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.319
 long and narrow room so lacking 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.319
 of importance that only exists as a 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.450
 way to communicate two rooms 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.219
 and to make things worse that we 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.459
 we found when we reached the end of 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:23.700
 hallway and we cross the exact other door 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.579
 hallway or rather exactly the 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.060
 same hallway and as we just said 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.069
 there's nothing as boring as a corridor 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.469
 because walking a corridor is monotonous 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.200
 In a fucking corridor nothing can happen 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:39.599
 exciting in a hallway you always go 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.909
 to find the same clock on the same table 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.909
 the same corner and behind that corner 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.959
 ok but what the hell we did not say 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.780
 that nothing can happen in a corridor 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.000
 that the corridors are boring 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.440
 to explain this maybe we should visit 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.440
 the most famous hall in history 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.579
 maybe you know it is the corridor of the 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.079
 movie the glow in her kubrick 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:10.799
 gives us one of the most important keys 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:12.480
 of terror the corridors are monotonous what 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.959
 truly important are the 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.959
 corners 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.479
 While 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.910
 Y 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.910
 Y 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.159
 efe 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.199
 this happens because the corridors 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.160
 represent the known and the corners 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:02.920
 The unknown 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.800
 and there is nothing that terrifies more to be 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.210
 human that what he does not know behind 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.630
 from a corner there can be any 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:13.770
 thing and almost always the anticipation is 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.770
 worse than the scare itself 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.549
 almost always 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.550
 however the aisle is not the only 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.360
 parallelism that exists between pitis and the 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.789
 radiance 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.449
 both works scare in the same way 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:39.699
 they use routine and disruption us 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.729
 they show a scenario and alter small 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:45.129
 things some so subtle that hardly 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.990
 we can appreciate and others so simple 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:49.569
 how to show an open door that 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.460
 It has always been closed both works 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.409
 they reflect in very similar ways 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.599
 about the horror of the ordinary about 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:57.250
 oppressive environments and violence 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:00.310
 as a cycle that repeats itself throughout 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.889
 of time as an endless hallway 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.560
 like an echo that resonates and smears to 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.750
 always the place where it happened but 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.779
 the most important similarity between both 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.550
 works is the puzzle the puzzle that does not 

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:15.729
 we got to arm everything because 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.279
 We are deliberately missing pieces 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:20.020
 both works have an end but the 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:21.639
 nature of you being of piti and the 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.559
 thematic complexity of the film of 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.259
 kubrick leave us with the feeling of 

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:28.210
 missing something the titles of 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:30.659
 credit we see the face of Norman reedus 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:33.189
 and kubrick and colima affirm their works 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:34.539
 but we can not stop imagining that 

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:36.580
 jack torrance and the silent 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:38.919
 protagonist of piti continue walking 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.199
 down the hallway looking for a 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.839
 redemption looking for a solution to 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:45.639
 enigma or simply looking at your 

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:47.999
 family to re -assassinate her one and 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:47.999
 again 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.580
 who knows what they are looking for can be 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.580
 around the corner
