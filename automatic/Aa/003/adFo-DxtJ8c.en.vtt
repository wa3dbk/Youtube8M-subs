this is the a to be COO oh and it's the

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.160 
this is the a to be COO oh and it's the
first<00:00:06.400> folding<00:00:07.029> electric<00:00:07.330> bike<00:00:07.690> from<00:00:07.870> A<00:00:08.019> to<00:00:08.049> B

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.170 
first folding electric bike from A to B

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.410 
first folding electric bike from A to B
but<00:00:08.500> really<00:00:08.950> a<00:00:09.160> to<00:00:09.460> be<00:00:09.700> merged<00:00:09.940> with<00:00:10.090> another

electric<00:00:10.840> bike<00:00:11.019> company<00:00:11.440> recently<00:00:11.650> they<00:00:12.639> had

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:12.880 
electric bike company recently they had

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.610 
electric bike company recently they had
a<00:00:12.910> bike<00:00:13.120> called<00:00:13.389> the<00:00:13.630> edge<00:00:13.780> and<00:00:14.170> so<00:00:14.320> this<00:00:14.470> is

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:14.620 
a bike called the edge and so this is

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.700 
a bike called the edge and so this is
actually<00:00:15.010> kind<00:00:15.250> of<00:00:15.309> a<00:00:16.050> merging<00:00:17.050> of<00:00:17.380> the<00:00:17.529> two

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
actually kind of a merging of the two

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.769 
actually kind of a merging of the two
brands<00:00:18.070> and<00:00:18.550> I'm<00:00:19.060> gonna<00:00:19.179> jump<00:00:19.390> right<00:00:19.509> in<00:00:19.749> and

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
brands and I'm gonna jump right in and

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.239 
brands and I'm gonna jump right in and
tell<00:00:20.140> you<00:00:20.230> about<00:00:20.319> the<00:00:20.439> specs<00:00:20.859> this<00:00:21.039> bike

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:21.249 
tell you about the specs this bike

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:24.329 
tell you about the specs this bike
offers<00:00:21.519> quite<00:00:22.060> a<00:00:22.119> bit<00:00:22.390> in<00:00:23.319> terms<00:00:23.380> of<00:00:23.859> just

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:24.339 
offers quite a bit in terms of just

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.279 
offers quite a bit in terms of just
features<00:00:24.730> as<00:00:24.939> you<00:00:24.970> can<00:00:25.149> see<00:00:25.359> there's<00:00:25.599> a<00:00:25.779> nice

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
features as you can see there's a nice

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.620 
features as you can see there's a nice
little<00:00:26.679> geared<00:00:27.399> hub<00:00:27.609> motor<00:00:27.849> back<00:00:28.179> here<00:00:28.479> it's

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
little geared hub motor back here it's

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.130 
little geared hub motor back here it's
250<00:00:29.499> watts<00:00:30.159> so<00:00:31.059> that's<00:00:31.569> kind<00:00:31.929> of<00:00:31.960> on<00:00:32.050> the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
250 watts so that's kind of on the

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.990 
250 watts so that's kind of on the
smaller<00:00:32.380> side<00:00:32.650> in<00:00:33.130> terms<00:00:33.340> of<00:00:33.550> power<00:00:33.820> and

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
smaller side in terms of power and

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.330 
smaller side in terms of power and
torque<00:00:34.240> but<00:00:34.780> for<00:00:35.410> a<00:00:35.440> folding<00:00:35.800> electric<00:00:36.160> bike

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
torque but for a folding electric bike

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.680 
torque but for a folding electric bike
that's<00:00:36.610> relatively<00:00:37.000> light<00:00:37.270> this<00:00:37.480> bikes

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
that's relatively light this bikes

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.540 
that's relatively light this bikes
around<00:00:37.840> 40<00:00:38.260> pounds<00:00:38.590> that's<00:00:38.860> that's<00:00:39.310> decent

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
around 40 pounds that's that's decent

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.670 
around 40 pounds that's that's decent

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
kind of gets you going on the flats it's

battery pack here which is 24 volt 9 amp
power<00:00:48.520> so<00:00:49.480> again<00:00:49.750> not<00:00:50.140> offering<00:00:50.650> a<00:00:50.740> ton<00:00:50.980> of

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
power so again not offering a ton of

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.280 
power so again not offering a ton of
torque<00:00:51.310> and<00:00:51.460> power<00:00:51.490> but<00:00:52.329> 9<00:00:52.660> amp<00:00:52.840> hours<00:00:53.140> is

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
torque and power but 9 amp hours is

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.810 
torque and power but 9 amp hours is
pretty<00:00:53.500> decent<00:00:53.890> a<00:00:54.040> lot<00:00:54.220> of<00:00:54.310> electric<00:00:54.640> bikes

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
pretty decent a lot of electric bikes

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.390 
pretty decent a lot of electric bikes
offer<00:00:55.060> around<00:00:55.450> 10<00:00:55.720> amp<00:00:55.930> hours<00:00:56.200> 36<00:00:56.890> volts<00:00:57.250> so

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
offer around 10 amp hours 36 volts so

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.190 
offer around 10 amp hours 36 volts so
that's<00:00:57.910> not<00:00:58.090> bad<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:58.540> you<00:00:58.630> can<00:00:58.780> see<00:00:58.960> it<00:00:59.050> fits

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
that's not bad and you can see it fits

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.819 
that's not bad and you can see it fits
real<00:00:59.560> nicely<00:01:00.070> in<00:01:00.160> here<00:01:01.200> very<00:01:02.200> easy<00:01:02.440> to<00:01:02.560> remove

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
real nicely in here very easy to remove

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.889 
real nicely in here very easy to remove
there's<00:01:03.160> like<00:01:03.310> a<00:01:03.340> key<00:01:03.700> right<00:01:03.910> here<00:01:04.179> at<00:01:04.359> keyhole

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
there's like a key right here at keyhole

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.510 
there's like a key right here at keyhole
you<00:01:05.049> can<00:01:05.199> turn<00:01:05.350> and<00:01:05.560> then<00:01:05.649> the<00:01:06.009> battery<00:01:06.280> pack

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
you can turn and then the battery pack

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.889 
you can turn and then the battery pack
slides<00:01:06.880> out<00:01:07.090> and<00:01:07.119> there's<00:01:07.299> a<00:01:07.359> little<00:01:07.420> handle

so that's really cool and I was told
that<00:01:09.819> it's<00:01:09.999> got<00:01:10.179> Panasonic<00:01:10.630> cells<00:01:11.340> which<00:01:12.340> you

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
that it's got Panasonic cells which you

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.489 
that it's got Panasonic cells which you
know<00:01:12.850> that's<00:01:12.999> a<00:01:13.149> company<00:01:13.479> I<00:01:13.509> recognize<00:01:14.259> and

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
trust and again a to be they've been

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.200 
trust and again a to be they've been
around<00:01:17.469> they're<00:01:17.979> one<00:01:18.189> of<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.340> leaders<00:01:18.639> in<00:01:18.670> the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
around they're one of the leaders in the

around they're one of the leaders in the
space<00:01:19.329> early<00:01:19.869> on<00:01:19.990> for<00:01:20.259> electric<00:01:20.590> bikes<00:01:20.799> so

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069 
space early on for electric bikes so

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:23.309 
space early on for electric bikes so
that's<00:01:21.639> a<00:01:21.729> nice<00:01:21.880> little<00:01:22.060> system<00:01:22.569> and<00:01:22.810> again<00:01:23.229> if

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:23.319 
that's a nice little system and again if

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:26.899 
that's a nice little system and again if
you're<00:01:23.499> a<00:01:23.710> super<00:01:24.210> tall<00:01:25.210> or<00:01:25.509> a<00:01:25.539> heavy<00:01:25.899> person

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
you're a super tall or a heavy person

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.489 
you're a super tall or a heavy person
it's<00:01:27.909> not<00:01:28.030> gonna<00:01:28.119> offer<00:01:28.299> a<00:01:28.450> ton<00:01:28.659> of<00:01:28.689> power<00:01:28.899> but

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:29.499 
it's not gonna offer a ton of power but

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:31.440 
it's not gonna offer a ton of power but
the<00:01:29.560> good<00:01:29.770> news<00:01:29.920> is<00:01:30.130> it's<00:01:30.459> a<00:01:30.670> relatively<00:01:31.209> light

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
the good news is it's a relatively light

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.889 
the good news is it's a relatively light
system<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.850> very<00:01:33.999> quiet<00:01:34.270> when<00:01:34.630> you<00:01:34.719> ride

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
system and it's very quiet when you ride

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.120 
system and it's very quiet when you ride
which<00:01:35.139> which<00:01:35.469> I'll<00:01:35.590> show<00:01:35.740> you<00:01:35.829> a<00:01:35.889> little<00:01:36.039> bit

which which I'll show you a little bit
later<00:01:36.249> so<00:01:37.030> other<00:01:37.270> specs<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:37.959> are<00:01:38.139> worth

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
later so other specs that are worth

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.989 
later so other specs that are worth
calling<00:01:38.590> out<00:01:38.770> on<00:01:38.920> this<00:01:39.039> bike<00:01:39.249> are<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.819> nice

calling out on this bike are the nice

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.090 
calling out on this bike are the nice
kickstand<00:01:40.600> like<00:01:41.229> that<00:01:41.409> it<00:01:41.499> kind<00:01:41.679> of<00:01:41.709> stays<00:01:41.889> out

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
kickstand like that it kind of stays out

steady<00:03:13.569> and<00:03:13.780> you<00:03:13.840> go<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.140> stop<00:03:14.379> sign<00:03:14.590> you

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
steady and you go to a stop sign you

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.050 
steady and you go to a stop sign you
have<00:03:14.859> to<00:03:14.980> stop<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.400> then<00:03:15.489> you<00:03:15.549> want<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:15.909> use

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.800 
the twist throttle get back up to speed
you<00:03:18.069> can<00:03:18.220> totally<00:03:18.579> do<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:18.730> so<00:03:19.480> that's<00:03:19.599> really

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
you can totally do that so that's really

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.349 
you can totally do that so that's really
nice<00:03:19.989> down<00:03:20.829> here<00:03:20.859> just<00:03:21.819> below<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.239> bottom

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
nice down here just below the bottom

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.629 
nice down here just below the bottom
bracket<00:03:22.569> is<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.470> controller<00:03:23.859> and<00:03:24.459> it's

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
bracket is the controller and it's

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:25.920 
bracket is the controller and it's
actually<00:03:24.940> got<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.090> nice<00:03:25.269> metal<00:03:25.690> case

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
actually got a nice metal case

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.990 
actually got a nice metal case
surrounding<00:03:26.200> it<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:27.069> kind<00:03:27.400> of<00:03:27.459> drops<00:03:27.760> down

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
surrounding it that kind of drops down

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.629 
surrounding it that kind of drops down
lower<00:03:28.329> than<00:03:28.629> the<00:03:28.840> controller<00:03:29.290> itself<00:03:29.889> which

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
lower than the controller itself which

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.129 
lower than the controller itself which
is<00:03:30.790> cool<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:31.269> they<00:03:31.329> did<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:31.629> so<00:03:31.870> that<00:03:31.900> when

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
is cool and they did that so that when

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:33.210 
is cool and they did that so that when
you're<00:03:32.260> folding<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.680> it's<00:03:32.859> kind<00:03:33.040> of<00:03:33.069> got

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
you're folding it it's kind of got

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.369 
you're folding it it's kind of got
something<00:03:33.639> to<00:03:33.730> rest<00:03:33.940> on<00:03:34.180> on<00:03:34.389> the<00:03:34.510> ground<00:03:34.750> so

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
something to rest on on the ground so

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.599 
something to rest on on the ground so
I'm<00:03:35.680> a<00:03:35.709> big<00:03:35.950> fan<00:03:36.129> of<00:03:36.160> that<00:03:36.310> it's<00:03:36.549> pretty

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
I'm a big fan of that it's pretty

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.569 
I'm a big fan of that it's pretty
thoughtful<00:03:37.000> design<00:03:37.299> and<00:03:38.069> I'm<00:03:39.069> gonna<00:03:39.280> I'm

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
thoughtful design and I'm gonna I'm

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.220 
thoughtful design and I'm gonna I'm
gonna<00:03:39.760> fold<00:03:40.000> that<00:03:40.150> up<00:03:40.329> once<00:03:40.540> once<00:03:40.930> I<00:03:41.049> take<00:03:41.200> a

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
gonna fold that up once once I take a

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.839 
gonna fold that up once once I take a
test<00:03:41.500> ride<00:03:41.709> you<00:03:42.220> can<00:03:42.310> also<00:03:42.459> see<00:03:42.730> all<00:03:42.819> the

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
test ride you can also see all the

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.159 
test ride you can also see all the
cables<00:03:43.299> and<00:03:43.389> stuff<00:03:43.540> they're<00:03:43.840> kind<00:03:44.019> of<00:03:44.109> just

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
cables and stuff they're kind of just

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.339 
cables and stuff they're kind of just
hanging<00:03:44.620> out<00:03:44.709> there<00:03:45.389> but<00:03:46.389> you<00:03:46.870> know<00:03:46.959> maybe

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
hanging out there but you know maybe

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.210 
hanging out there but you know maybe
this<00:03:47.560> is<00:03:47.709> about<00:03:47.980> frame<00:03:49.379> integrity<00:03:50.379> you<00:03:51.190> know

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
this is about frame integrity you know

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.159 
this is about frame integrity you know
some<00:03:51.549> some<00:03:51.760> electric<00:03:52.090> bikes<00:03:52.269> have<00:03:52.449> that<00:03:52.660> the

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.169 
some some electric bikes have that the

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:55.619 
some some electric bikes have that the
wires<00:03:53.709> all<00:03:53.980> inside<00:03:54.849> the<00:03:55.000> frame<00:03:55.209> but<00:03:55.389> this<00:03:55.480> is<00:03:55.599> a

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
wires all inside the frame but this is a

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.599 
wires all inside the frame but this is a
folding<00:03:55.989> electric<00:03:56.169> bike<00:03:56.560> again<00:03:56.769> you<00:03:57.400> know<00:03:57.489> the

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
folding electric bike again you know the

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.819 
folding electric bike again you know the
chain<00:03:57.819> though<00:03:58.109> wires<00:03:59.109> and<00:03:59.319> stuff<00:03:59.410> could<00:03:59.650> get

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
chain though wires and stuff could get

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.069 
chain though wires and stuff could get
messed<00:04:00.790> up<00:04:00.940> in<00:04:01.150> there<00:04:01.329> if<00:04:01.419> they<00:04:01.569> if<00:04:01.900> they

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
messed up in there if they if they

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.509 
messed up in there if they if they
integrated<00:04:02.470> them<00:04:02.680> I'm<00:04:03.040> not<00:04:03.160> really<00:04:03.280> sure<00:04:03.489> but

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
integrated them I'm not really sure but

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.430 
integrated them I'm not really sure but
it<00:04:04.269> seems<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.599> work<00:04:04.660> out<00:04:04.840> pretty<00:04:05.019> well<00:04:05.169> and

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
it seems to work out pretty well and

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.599 
it seems to work out pretty well and
they're<00:04:05.560> all<00:04:05.590> they're<00:04:06.069> all<00:04:06.190> coated<00:04:06.400> and

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
they're all they're all coated and

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:07.979 
they're all they're all coated and
sleeved<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.090> everything<00:04:07.389> it's<00:04:07.780> got<00:04:07.900> this

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
sleeved and everything it's got this

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.930 
sleeved and everything it's got this
nice<00:04:08.199> light<00:04:08.440> up<00:04:08.560> here<00:04:08.709> too<00:04:08.859> so<00:04:09.760> I'm<00:04:09.849> gonna

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
nice light up here too so I'm gonna

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.900 
nice light up here too so I'm gonna
start<00:04:10.180> out<00:04:10.299> in<00:04:10.389> twist<00:04:10.599> throttle<00:04:10.780> only<00:04:11.199> mode

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
start out in twist throttle only mode

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.150 
start out in twist throttle only mode
here<00:04:12.910> we<00:04:13.060> go<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:13.540> I<00:04:14.019> listen<00:04:14.530> for<00:04:14.560> that<00:04:14.859> for<00:04:15.099> the

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
here we go and I listen for that for the

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:38.810 
here we go and I listen for that for the
motor

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.219 

if<00:04:39.820> you<00:04:39.910> want<00:04:40.090> pedal<00:04:40.389> assist<00:04:40.690> mode<00:04:40.870> you<00:04:41.199> just

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
if you want pedal assist mode you just

00:04:41.229 --> 00:05:06.510 
if you want pedal assist mode you just
slip<00:04:41.590> that<00:04:41.740> switch<00:05:04.800> pull<00:05:05.800> in<00:05:06.099> like<00:05:06.280> this<00:05:06.460> and

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
slip that switch pull in like this and

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.420 
slip that switch pull in like this and
then<00:05:06.789> they<00:05:06.940> fold<00:05:07.180> up<00:05:07.330> that's<00:05:08.289> cool<00:05:08.530> they've

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
then they fold up that's cool they've

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.180 
then they fold up that's cool they've
got<00:05:09.610> all<00:05:09.699> these<00:05:09.849> locking<00:05:10.539> points<00:05:10.750> so<00:05:11.199> there's

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
got all these locking points so there's

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.770 
got all these locking points so there's
like<00:05:12.250> a<00:05:12.310> switch<00:05:12.550> that<00:05:12.880> toggles<00:05:13.300> up<00:05:13.449> and<00:05:13.660> then

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
like a switch that toggles up and then

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.570 
like a switch that toggles up and then
another<00:05:14.020> thing<00:05:14.710> here<00:05:14.979> that<00:05:15.130> kind<00:05:15.280> of<00:05:15.310> blocks

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
another thing here that kind of blocks

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.999 
another thing here that kind of blocks
the<00:05:15.789> folding<00:05:16.120> so<00:05:16.300> you<00:05:16.389> just<00:05:16.620> pull<00:05:17.620> that<00:05:17.650> down

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
the folding so you just pull that down

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.050 
the folding so you just pull that down
this<00:05:19.000> neck<00:05:19.330> folds<00:05:19.900> like<00:05:20.199> that<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:21.130> then

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
this neck folds like that and then

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.719 
this neck folds like that and then
there's<00:05:22.330> a<00:05:22.740> bowling<00:05:23.740> point<00:05:24.009> here<00:05:26.490> there<00:05:27.490> we<00:05:27.580> go

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
there's a bowling point here there we go

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:39.240 
there's a bowling point here there we go
that<00:05:34.620> area<00:05:36.389> there<00:05:37.389> it<00:05:37.510> is<00:05:37.599> okay<00:05:38.560> I<00:05:38.800> kind<00:05:39.070> of<00:05:39.130> did

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
that area there it is okay I kind of did

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.029 
that area there it is okay I kind of did
it<00:05:39.280> right<00:05:39.789> there's<00:05:40.750> there<00:05:41.110> it<00:05:41.199> is<00:05:41.289> all<00:05:41.560> folded

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
it right there's there it is all folded

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.240 
it right there's there it is all folded
up<00:05:42.159> pretty<00:05:43.150> compact<00:05:43.599> and<00:05:44.070> actually<00:05:45.070> there's

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
up pretty compact and actually there's

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.760 
up pretty compact and actually there's
gonna<00:05:45.400> be<00:05:45.610> a<00:05:45.639> this<00:05:46.330> is<00:05:46.479> sort<00:05:46.630> of<00:05:46.690> an<00:05:46.780> early<00:05:46.930> demo

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
gonna be a this is sort of an early demo

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.439 
gonna be a this is sort of an early demo
model<00:05:47.919> but<00:05:48.250> they're<00:05:48.669> gonna<00:05:48.760> have<00:05:48.940> a<00:05:49.000> magnet

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
model but they're gonna have a magnet

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.909 
model but they're gonna have a magnet
here<00:05:49.720> to<00:05:49.930> kind<00:05:50.110> of<00:05:50.169> keep<00:05:50.320> it<00:05:50.440> from<00:05:50.560> unfolding

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
here to kind of keep it from unfolding

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:52.589 
here to kind of keep it from unfolding
that's<00:05:51.580> sort<00:05:51.849> of<00:05:51.940> standard<00:05:52.270> on<00:05:52.389> a<00:05:52.419> lot<00:05:52.570> of

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
that's sort of standard on a lot of
