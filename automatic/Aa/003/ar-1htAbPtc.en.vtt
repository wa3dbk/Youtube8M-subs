shower cap but I'm looking super cute

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.150 
shower cap but I'm looking super cute
where<00:02:18.390> this<00:02:18.540> basically<00:02:18.989> allows<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.770> kind

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
where this basically allows it to kind

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.520 
where this basically allows it to kind
of<00:02:20.220> penetrate<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.090> hair<00:02:21.300> might<00:02:22.020> go<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.290> put<00:02:22.500> a

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
of penetrate the hair might go and put a

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.770 
of penetrate the hair might go and put a
face<00:02:22.860> mask<00:02:23.190> on<00:02:23.489> or<00:02:23.700> something<00:02:24.120> but<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.360> usually

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
face mask on or something but I usually

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.800 
face mask on or something but I usually
do<00:02:24.900> this<00:02:25.050> for<00:02:25.200> about<00:02:25.290> 10<00:02:25.590> or<00:02:25.739> 15<00:02:25.860> minutes<00:02:26.489> and

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
do this for about 10 or 15 minutes and

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.070 
do this for about 10 or 15 minutes and
then<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.140> will<00:02:28.500> rinse<00:02:28.890> out<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.610> basically<00:02:30.450> my

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
then I will rinse out and basically my

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.770 
then I will rinse out and basically my
hair<00:02:31.290> feels<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:31.920> much<00:02:32.130> softer<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.820> smoother

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.800 
take a while to dry so it's nice to kind
of<00:03:29.010> leave<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.549> air<00:03:29.730> dry<00:03:29.760> for<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.360> little<00:03:30.480> bit

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
of leave it to air dry for a little bit

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.170 
of leave it to air dry for a little bit
and<00:03:30.989> then<00:03:31.140> blow-dry<00:03:31.440> on<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.010> lower<00:03:32.280> heat<00:03:32.640> but<00:03:32.970> I

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
and then blow-dry on a lower heat but I

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.580 
and then blow-dry on a lower heat but I
was<00:03:33.570> kind<00:03:33.780> of<00:03:33.840> rushing<00:03:34.019> here

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.259 

so<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.709> can<00:03:40.860> see<00:03:41.040> it's<00:03:41.310> kind<00:03:41.519> of<00:03:41.610> partially

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
so you can see it's kind of partially

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.350 
so you can see it's kind of partially
dryer<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.470> volume<00:03:43.890> increases<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:45.239> the

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
dryer and the volume increases and the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.509 
dryer and the volume increases and the
waves<00:03:45.569> come<00:03:45.959> back<00:03:46.200> but<00:03:46.739> then<00:03:46.950> I'll<00:03:47.190> just<00:03:47.370> give

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
waves come back but then I'll just give

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.160 
waves come back but then I'll just give
it<00:03:47.550> a<00:03:47.760> little<00:03:48.000> bit<00:03:48.209> more<00:03:48.390> of<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.569> blitz<00:03:48.840> but<00:03:49.050> you

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
it a little bit more of a blitz but you

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.000 
it a little bit more of a blitz but you
can<00:03:49.290> see<00:03:49.500> what<00:03:49.680> it<00:03:49.769> looks<00:03:49.950> like<00:03:50.099> partway<00:03:52.010> so

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
can see what it looks like partway so

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.949 
can see what it looks like partway so
when<00:03:53.190> there's<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.549> little<00:03:53.940> bit<00:03:54.060> drier<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.629> can

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
when there's a little bit drier I can

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.410 
when there's a little bit drier I can
see<00:03:55.170> how<00:03:55.440> much<00:03:55.650> Harrow<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.160> want<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.819> apply<00:03:57.090> does
