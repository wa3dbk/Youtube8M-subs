00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.180
 review 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.230
 ah 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.880
 coolest 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.260
 money voices 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.260
 she is very sexy 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.260
 the chosen bid is prohibited from caritas 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.630
 forbidden in the love story of 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.030
 global and maya two brothers although the 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.370
 plot seems very simple the truth is 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.320
 that it is not because in addition the others in 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.540
 the love story subtraction is also us 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.510
 shows how these two people live 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.030
 next to his family the novel is 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.680
 narrated in quite long chapters that 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.350
 they alternate the points of view of the two 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.720
 protagonists and that has a rhythm 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.200
 quite slow because the pen of 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.840
 the writer is giving us explanations 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.470
 quite detailed but not boring 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.270
 and that they are introducing us more in this 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.470
 forbidden love story love 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.479
 is turning into my books 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.399
 favorites at the beginning I had quite 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.100
 afraid to read an incest relationship 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.270
 but the truth is that it is totally 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.759
 justified and the setting that has 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.490
 provided the writer to this novel 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.460
 It's amazing besides making you get 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.680
 full in the life that both lead and the 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.530
 truth is that it seems the most normal 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.539
 that this happens even though the plot 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.940
 main is the love story between 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.010
 the animal already we find also another 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.330
 and secondary with a lot of importance and 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.640
 that do not stay in the background 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.620
 totally but they contribute a lot to 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.960
 the plot these secondary characters 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.700
 they are the same as the family of these 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.050
 two brothers and the truth is that they have 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.220
 delighted to meet you 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.110
 the novel has two twists 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.080
 one argument to the middle and another 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.150
 in the last pages and the truth is 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.790
 that the turn of the last two pages 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.520
 that is, the end has already struck me 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.770
 very much I did not expect it at all and 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.870
 it is certainly what has already done 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.450
 they stole my heart totally for this 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.550
 novel and now I'm going to tell you a lot 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.020
 more of the story because I think it's a 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.690
 book that you have to discover 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.450
 little by little and by yourselves as 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.220
 you can see around here I have many 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.410
 marked leaves because there are a lot of 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.570
 super nice phrases and that have 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.480
 very impacted and here I have them 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.670
 pointed out each book needs a moment 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.040
 determined to be read to be able to 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.930
 enjoy all its splendor 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.090
 I think you have to read a novel with a 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.250
 open mind without hurry because it is a 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.709
 pretty slow reading and that will take us 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.159
 surely a long time to me it took me 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.590
 two weeks but I enjoyed it very much 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.120

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.489
