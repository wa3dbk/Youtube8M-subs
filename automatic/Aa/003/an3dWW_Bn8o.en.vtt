00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.179 
muscles obviously need water you drink a
lot<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.630> water<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.259> keeps<00:01:40.409> hydrated<00:01:40.979> blah

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
lot of water and keeps hydrated blah

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.880 
lot of water and keeps hydrated blah

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
blah yadda yadda so creatine is going to

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.260 
blah yadda yadda so creatine is going to
actually<00:01:43.979> make<00:01:44.250> your<00:01:44.399> muscles<00:01:44.549> turn<00:01:45.030> like

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
actually make your muscles turn like

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.149 
actually make your muscles turn like
more<00:01:45.540> like<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.720> sponge<00:01:46.020> up<00:01:46.320> taking<00:01:46.710> more<00:01:46.920> water

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
more like a sponge up taking more water

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.340 
more like a sponge up taking more water
now<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.790> not<00:01:47.909> making<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.240> dehydrated<00:01:49.049> per<00:01:49.170> se

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
now it's not making a dehydrated per se

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.649 
now it's not making a dehydrated per se
but<00:01:49.829> because<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.369> are<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:50.880> taking<00:01:51.270> more<00:01:51.450> water

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
but because you are in taking more water

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.389 
but because you are in taking more water
through<00:01:51.960> your<00:01:52.079> muscles<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.560> requires<00:01:53.220> you

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
through your muscles that requires you

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.370 
through your muscles that requires you
to<00:01:53.549> drink<00:01:53.759> more<00:01:53.939> water<00:01:54.090> or<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.780> will<00:01:54.990> become

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
to drink more water or you will become

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.620 
to drink more water or you will become
dehydrated<00:01:55.860> there<00:01:56.640> seem<00:01:56.820> like<00:01:57.000> or<00:01:57.180> cramp<00:01:57.509> up

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
dehydrated there seem like or cramp up

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.899 
dehydrated there seem like or cramp up
most<00:01:58.530> people<00:01:58.799> when<00:01:58.979> creating<00:01:59.219> first<00:01:59.610> came<00:01:59.790> out

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
most people when creating first came out

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
know it's kind of crazy and then they

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.720 
know it's kind of crazy and then they
would<00:02:27.989> all<00:02:28.109> just<00:02:28.260> like<00:02:28.439> be<00:02:28.680> cramping<00:02:29.069> up<00:02:29.219> so<00:02:29.250> so

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
bad just because they didn't know what

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.509 
bad just because they didn't know what
creatine<00:02:31.560> was<00:02:31.680> doing<00:02:31.920> for<00:02:32.099> them<00:02:32.189> at<00:02:32.340> first

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
creatine was doing for them at first

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.009 
creatine was doing for them at first
except<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:33.329> the<00:02:33.389> idea<00:02:33.659> that<00:02:33.719> they<00:02:33.870> got

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
except for the idea that they got

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.319 
except for the idea that they got
stronger<00:02:34.409> so<00:02:35.129> because<00:02:35.459> your<00:02:35.579> body<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.120> up

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
stronger so because your body is up

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.089 
stronger so because your body is up
taking<00:02:36.659> more<00:02:36.810> creatine<00:02:37.290> or<00:02:37.439> more<00:02:37.799> water<00:02:37.980> i

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
taking more creatine or more water i

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.119 
taking more creatine or more water i
should<00:02:38.340> say<00:02:38.459> from<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.909> creatine<00:02:39.269> you<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:40.469> you

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
should say from the creatine you do you

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.740 
should say from the creatine you do you
will<00:02:41.340> gain<00:02:41.609> a<00:02:41.670> little<00:02:41.879> weight<00:02:41.969> but<00:02:42.329> it's<00:02:42.569> just

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
will gain a little weight but it's just

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.720 
will gain a little weight but it's just
is<00:02:42.959> water<00:02:43.200> its<00:02:43.650> water<00:02:43.889> weight<00:02:44.159> that<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.549> will

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
is water its water weight that you will

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.250 
is water its water weight that you will
get<00:02:44.909> rid<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.120> once<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.629> stop<00:02:45.810> taking<00:02:46.079> it

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
get rid of once you stop taking it

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.679 
get rid of once you stop taking it
rather<00:02:46.530> quickly<00:02:46.709> actually<00:02:47.189> um<00:02:47.609> but<00:02:48.450> because

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
rather quickly actually um but because

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.569 
rather quickly actually um but because
you<00:02:48.810> have<00:02:48.840> more<00:02:49.319> water<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:49.829> your<00:02:49.980> muscles<00:02:50.220> your

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
you have more water in your muscles your

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.720 
you have more water in your muscles your
muscles<00:02:51.150> are<00:02:51.239> just<00:02:51.269> more<00:02:51.810> dense<00:02:52.049> more<00:02:52.739> massive

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
muscles are just more dense more massive

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.940 
muscles are just more dense more massive
in<00:02:53.909> that<00:02:54.510> sense<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.989> actually<00:02:55.290> can<00:02:55.409> lift<00:02:55.650> more

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
in that sense you actually can lift more

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.860 
in that sense you actually can lift more
so<00:02:56.549> because<00:02:56.849> you<00:02:57.060> can<00:02:57.180> lift<00:02:57.329> more<00:02:57.540> you're

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
so because you can lift more you're

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.509 
so because you can lift more you're
further<00:02:58.109> damaging<00:02:58.650> your<00:02:58.739> muscle<00:02:59.040> fibers<00:02:59.370> and

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
further damaging your muscle fibers and

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.949 
further damaging your muscle fibers and
what<00:02:59.639> you<00:02:59.730> normally<00:02:59.909> could<00:03:00.389> because<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.840> can

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
what you normally could because you can

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.020 
what you normally could because you can
lift<00:03:01.169> heavier<00:03:01.500> amounts<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.010> lift<00:03:02.519> it<00:03:02.609> faster

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
lift heavier amounts and lift it faster

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.520 
lift heavier amounts and lift it faster
and<00:03:03.060> harder<00:03:03.329> than<00:03:03.569> normal<00:03:03.689> so<00:03:04.379> when<00:03:04.469> you

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
and harder than normal so when you

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.110 
and harder than normal so when you
damage<00:03:04.859> your<00:03:04.950> muscle<00:03:05.219> fibers<00:03:05.579> obviously

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
damage your muscle fibers obviously

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.550 
damage your muscle fibers obviously
that's<00:03:06.359> you<00:03:06.719> know<00:03:06.810> what<00:03:07.019> you<00:03:07.139> want<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.439> do

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
that's you know what you want to do

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.220 
that's you know what you want to do

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
while you're in working out and then for

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.750 
while you're in working out and then for
them<00:03:10.379> to<00:03:10.469> regrow<00:03:10.799> they'll<00:03:11.219> regrow<00:03:11.549> back

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
them to regrow they'll regrow back

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.929 
them to regrow they'll regrow back
stronger<00:03:12.419> and<00:03:12.540> trying<00:03:13.379> to<00:03:13.590> try<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.430> be<00:03:14.700> ready
