00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.260 
note I'm going to start a basic note and
it<00:04:49.349> should<00:04:49.590> auto<00:04:49.830> load<00:04:50.159> right<00:04:50.430> here<00:04:50.639> where<00:04:51.240> I

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
it should auto load right here where I

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.179 
it should auto load right here where I
can<00:04:51.479> move<00:04:51.599> it<00:04:51.749> around<00:04:51.779> change<00:04:52.289> the<00:04:52.439> size<00:04:52.710> and

00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:53.189 
can move it around change the size and

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:56.929 
can move it around change the size and
then<00:04:53.610> I<00:04:53.669> can<00:04:53.849> draw<00:04:54.090> from<00:04:54.360> there<00:04:55.729> okay<00:04:56.729> there

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:56.939 
then I can draw from there okay there

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:58.489 
then I can draw from there okay there
and<00:04:57.659> one<00:04:57.810> thing<00:04:57.840> I<00:04:58.020> will<00:04:58.139> tell<00:04:58.229> you<00:04:58.319> from<00:04:58.379> the

00:04:58.489 --> 00:04:58.499 
and one thing I will tell you from the

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:00.709 
and one thing I will tell you from the
note<00:04:58.650> working<00:04:59.400> with<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.580> Galaxy<00:04:59.879> Note<00:05:00.029> 2<00:05:00.270> the

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:00.719 
note working with the Galaxy Note 2 the

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:02.029 
note working with the Galaxy Note 2 the
pin<00:05:00.930> is<00:05:01.050> much<00:05:01.199> easier<00:05:01.529> to<00:05:01.560> operate<00:05:01.770> if<00:05:01.919> like

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
pin is much easier to operate if like

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.619 
pin is much easier to operate if like
it's<00:05:02.189> more<00:05:02.370> of<00:05:02.430> a<00:05:02.520> pen<00:05:02.909> type<00:05:03.150> interface<00:05:03.539> you

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629 
it's more of a pen type interface you

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:04.760 
it's more of a pen type interface you
know<00:05:03.689> when<00:05:03.840> you<00:05:03.930> put<00:05:04.050> a<00:05:04.110> pen<00:05:04.289> down<00:05:04.379> on<00:05:04.529> paper

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
know when you put a pen down on paper

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.649 
know when you put a pen down on paper
and<00:05:04.979> you<00:05:05.039> kind<00:05:05.250> of<00:05:05.279> feel<00:05:05.460> that<00:05:05.490> feedback<00:05:06.419> that

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:06.659 
and you kind of feel that feedback that

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:07.519 
and you kind of feel that feedback that
it<00:05:06.750> gives<00:05:06.960> you<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:07.080> little<00:05:07.289> bit<00:05:07.379> of<00:05:07.409> that

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:07.529 
it gives you a little bit of that

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:09.110 
it gives you a little bit of that
resistance<00:05:07.889> when<00:05:08.250> you<00:05:08.340> put<00:05:08.460> a<00:05:08.490> pen<00:05:08.669> to<00:05:08.759> paper

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
resistance when you put a pen to paper

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.850 
resistance when you put a pen to paper
unlike<00:05:09.689> the<00:05:09.810> note<00:05:09.990> 2<00:05:10.199> it's<00:05:10.349> progressive

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
unlike the note 2 it's progressive

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.140 
unlike the note 2 it's progressive
improvements<00:05:11.370> for<00:05:11.490> Samsung<00:05:11.819> it's<00:05:11.969> better

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
improvements for Samsung it's better

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.969 
improvements for Samsung it's better
than<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.479> note<00:05:12.659> the<00:05:13.080> note<00:05:13.259> 2<00:05:13.469> is<00:05:13.620> better<00:05:13.770> and

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
than the note the note 2 is better and

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.559 
than the note the note 2 is better and
then<00:05:14.099> this<00:05:14.279> in<00:05:14.759> my<00:05:14.879> opinion<00:05:15.210> at<00:05:15.300> least<00:05:15.330> in

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:15.569 
then this in my opinion at least in

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:17.480 
then this in my opinion at least in
terms<00:05:15.689> of<00:05:15.900> overall<00:05:16.259> use<00:05:16.560> is<00:05:16.770> slightly<00:05:17.250> better

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
terms of overall use is slightly better

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.950 
terms of overall use is slightly better
than<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.759> note<00:05:18.000> 2<00:05:18.240> it<00:05:18.360> feels<00:05:18.569> like<00:05:18.750> you<00:05:18.839> know

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
than the note 2 it feels like you know

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.269 
than the note 2 it feels like you know
pin<00:05:19.169> to<00:05:19.259> paper<00:05:19.439> and<00:05:19.529> they<00:05:19.650> added<00:05:19.830> a<00:05:19.979> little<00:05:20.099> bit

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:20.279 
pin to paper and they added a little bit

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:22.610 
pin to paper and they added a little bit
of<00:05:20.370> a<00:05:20.400> better<00:05:20.580> tip<00:05:20.939> on<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:21.689> pin<00:05:21.870> itself<00:05:22.319> so<00:05:22.560> to

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
of a better tip on the pin itself so to

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.320 
of a better tip on the pin itself so to
make<00:05:22.770> it<00:05:22.800> a<00:05:22.919> little<00:05:23.039> bit<00:05:23.159> more<00:05:23.279> pin<00:05:23.550> like<00:05:23.789> so

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
make it a little bit more pin like so

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.999 
make it a little bit more pin like so
when<00:05:24.419> I'm<00:05:24.509> drawing<00:05:24.719> things<00:05:25.139> it<00:05:25.409> feels<00:05:25.650> like

when I'm drawing things it feels like

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:26.779 
when I'm drawing things it feels like
