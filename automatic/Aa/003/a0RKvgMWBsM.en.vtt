hello<00:00:11.400> everyone<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.300> vector<00:00:12.830> and<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:14.070> have

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
hello everyone this is vector and I have

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.019 
hello everyone this is vector and I have
to<00:00:14.370> say<00:00:14.580> really<00:00:15.540> really<00:00:15.780> clever<00:00:16.820> okay<00:00:17.820> it's

named let's run a style game and it's

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.670 
named let's run a style game and it's
kind<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.910> like<00:00:20.970> Mirror's<00:00:21.900> Edge<00:00:22.080> if<00:00:22.470> you

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
kind of like Mirror's Edge if you

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.050 
kind of like Mirror's Edge if you
remember<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.100> title<00:00:23.430> from<00:00:23.550> Electronic<00:00:23.939> Arts

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
remember that title from Electronic Arts

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.599 
remember that title from Electronic Arts
that<00:00:24.300> was<00:00:24.420> big<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.720> consoles<00:00:25.199> and

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
that was big on the consoles and

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.849 
that was big on the consoles and
fantastic<00:00:26.609> concept<00:00:27.090> game<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:28.170> kind<00:00:28.769> of

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
fantastic concept game that kind of

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.679 
fantastic concept game that kind of
didn't<00:00:29.189> sell<00:00:29.820> particularly<00:00:30.300> well<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.449> don't

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
didn't sell particularly well I don't

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.959 
didn't sell particularly well I don't
think<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.439> kind<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.769> takes<00:00:31.980> vector<00:00:32.520> context

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
think this kind of takes vector context

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.569 
think this kind of takes vector context
the<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.360> game<00:00:33.630> idea<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.469> parkour<00:00:35.280> free

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the the game idea of parkour free

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.750 
the the game idea of parkour free
running<00:00:35.610> across<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.630> know<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:37.760> cityscape

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
running across you know this cityscape

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.639 
running across you know this cityscape
and<00:00:39.030> takes<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> slightly<00:00:40.020> new<00:00:40.170> level<00:00:40.379> it

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
and takes it to a slightly new level it

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.740 
and takes it to a slightly new level it
is<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.860> 2d<00:00:41.579> sideways<00:00:42.120> scroller

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
is a 2d sideways scroller

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.970 
is a 2d sideways scroller
so<00:00:42.899> unlike<00:00:43.140> Mirror's<00:00:43.440> Edge<00:00:43.530> which<00:00:43.710> was<00:00:43.860> very

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
so unlike Mirror's Edge which was very

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.430 
so unlike Mirror's Edge which was very
much<00:00:44.190> about<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.579> three<00:00:44.879> dimensions<00:00:45.440> this

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
much about the three dimensions this

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.799 
much about the three dimensions this
though<00:00:47.370> has<00:00:47.850> something<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.450> Mirror's<00:00:48.719> Edge

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
though has something that Mirror's Edge

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.310 
though has something that Mirror's Edge
doesn't<00:00:49.320> have<00:00:49.500> really<00:00:50.160> good<00:00:50.340> gameplay<00:00:50.629> so<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
doesn't have really good gameplay so the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.200 
doesn't have really good gameplay so the
idea<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.100> are<00:00:53.219> running<00:00:53.430> away<00:00:53.610> from<00:00:53.730> a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
idea is you are running away from a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.420 
idea is you are running away from a
bloke<00:00:54.510> who's<00:00:54.750> chasing<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:56.399> to

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
bloke who's chasing you and you have to

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.729 
bloke who's chasing you and you have to
complete<00:00:56.730> each<00:00:57.000> level<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.690> without<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.530> guy

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
complete each level if without the guy

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.110 
complete each level if without the guy
who's<00:00:58.890> chasing<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.370> being<00:00:59.550> able<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.760> overtake

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
who's chasing you being able to overtake

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.260 
who's chasing you being able to overtake
you<00:01:00.300> you'll<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.050> leap<00:01:01.320> jump<00:01:01.829> avoid<00:01:02.670> you

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
you you'll have to leap jump avoid you

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.969 
you you'll have to leap jump avoid you
name<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:03.660> here's<00:01:03.960> me<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.379> here's<00:01:04.830> me

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
name it so here's me and here's me

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.260 
name it so here's me and here's me
running<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.729> animations

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
running and you can see the animations

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.660 
running and you can see the animations
are<00:01:06.420> absolutely<00:01:07.170> fantastic<00:01:07.439> now<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.549> sure

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
are absolutely fantastic now for sure

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.890 
are absolutely fantastic now for sure
I've<00:01:08.729> dropped<00:01:08.909> onto<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> first<00:01:09.450> level<00:01:09.720> again

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
I've dropped onto the first level again

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.530 
I've dropped onto the first level again
my<00:01:10.049> bad<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:11.100> idea<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.060> time<00:01:12.330> all

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
my bad the idea is you have to time all

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.230 
my bad the idea is you have to time all
of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.720> various<00:01:13.049> jumps<00:01:13.760> swiping<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:14.909> at<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
of the various jumps swiping up at the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.450 
of the various jumps swiping up at the
right<00:01:15.390> moment<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.110> climb<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.890> environment

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
right moment to climb the environment

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.789 
right moment to climb the environment
and<00:01:18.090> obviously<00:01:18.990> staying<00:01:19.200> away<00:01:19.409> from<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.619> guy

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
and obviously staying away from this guy

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.289 
and obviously staying away from this guy
that's<00:01:20.009> chasing<00:01:20.220> after<00:01:20.490> us<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.180> to

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
that's chasing after us you have to

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.100 
that's chasing after us you have to
slide<00:01:22.009> jump<00:01:23.009> over<00:01:23.310> objects<00:01:23.850> climb<00:01:24.420> walls

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
slide jump over objects climb walls

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.200 
slide jump over objects climb walls
you<00:01:25.439> name<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.680> basically<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:26.850> involved

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
you name it basically if it's involved

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.330 
you name it basically if it's involved
in<00:01:27.270> parkour<00:01:27.750> you'll<00:01:28.320> have<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.619> do<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.799> here<00:01:28.979> but

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
in parkour you'll have to do it here but

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.249 
in parkour you'll have to do it here but
one<00:01:29.640> thing<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.909> found<00:01:30.150> really<00:01:30.509> really<00:01:30.689> good

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
one thing I found really really good

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.469 
one thing I found really really good
about<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.799> how<00:01:32.340> smooth<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.970> animations

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
about this is how smooth the animations

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.780 
about this is how smooth the animations
are<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.869> character<00:01:34.290> they<00:01:34.740> are

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
are for the character they are

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.010 
are for the character they are
absolutely<00:01:35.790> exceptional<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.869> I'm<00:01:36.930> obviously

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
absolutely exceptional and I'm obviously

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.450 
absolutely exceptional and I'm obviously
a<00:01:37.259> lot<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.439> work<00:01:37.560> appears<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> have<00:01:38.159> got<00:01:38.280> into

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
a lot of work appears to have got into

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.069 
a lot of work appears to have got into
getting<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> animations<00:01:39.150> looking<00:01:39.600> really

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
getting the animations looking really

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.670 
getting the animations looking really
authentic<00:01:41.630> loads<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.810> loads<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.170> loads<00:01:43.290> of

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.120 
levels available in this game this is
just<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.079> first<00:01:46.229> level<00:01:46.500> gives<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.890> sense

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130

additional<00:01:59.850> moves<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.170> think<00:02:01.320> there's

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
additional moves and I think there's

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.170 
additional moves and I think there's
about<00:02:01.500> thirty<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.130> different<00:02:02.460> moves<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.820> total

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180
