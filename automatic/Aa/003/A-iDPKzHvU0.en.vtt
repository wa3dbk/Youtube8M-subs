oh man code movie be going for mind
control<00:00:20.359> that's<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.689> only<00:00:21.930> other<00:00:22.080> thing<00:00:22.170> I

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
control that's the only other thing I

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.720 
control that's the only other thing I
can<00:00:22.619> think<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.920> other<00:00:23.100> than<00:00:23.310> other<00:00:23.609> than

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
can think of other than other than

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.400 
can think of other than other than
feedback<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.390> High<00:00:24.539> Templar<00:00:24.750> but<00:00:25.170> movie

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
feedback to the High Templar but movie

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.099 
feedback to the High Templar but movie
hasn't<00:00:25.560> even<00:00:25.740> seen<00:00:26.220> high<00:00:26.820> templar<00:00:27.300> yet<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:28.080> i

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
hasn't even seen high templar yet so i

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.290 
hasn't even seen high templar yet so i
think<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.740> going<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.070> mind<00:00:29.550> control

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
think this is going to be mind control

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.930 
think this is going to be mind control
from<00:00:31.199> movie<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:32.040> could<00:00:32.219> actually<00:00:32.399> work<00:00:32.610> out

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
from movie this could actually work out

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.790 
from movie this could actually work out
great<00:00:33.149> if<00:00:33.239> he<00:00:33.420> catches<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.809> shuttle<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.410> think

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
great if he catches the shuttle I think

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.720 
great if he catches the shuttle I think
that's<00:00:34.920> what<00:00:35.070> he's<00:00:35.160> going<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.340> try<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.550> do

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
that's what he's going to try to do

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.430 
that's what he's going to try to do
catch<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.239> shuttle<00:00:36.570> full<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.050> Reavers

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
catch that shuttle full of Reavers

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.319 
catch that shuttle full of Reavers
because<00:00:38.219> if<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.460> mind<00:00:38.640> control<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> shuttle

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
because if you mind control a shuttle

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.790 
because if you mind control a shuttle
you<00:00:39.450> mind<00:00:39.629> control<00:00:39.930> everything<00:00:40.170> inside<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
you mind control everything inside the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.490 
you mind control everything inside the
shuttle<00:00:41.390> which<00:00:42.390> could<00:00:42.629> potentially<00:00:42.989> be

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
shuttle which could potentially be

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.590 
shuttle which could potentially be
game-changing<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.000> very<00:00:45.270> weird

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
game-changing this is a very weird

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.959 
game-changing this is a very weird
strategy<00:00:46.110> for<00:00:46.289> movie<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.649> may<00:00:47.309> or<00:00:47.640> may<00:00:47.940> not

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
strategy for movie and may or may not

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.260 
strategy for movie and may or may not
work<00:00:48.239> out<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:48.719> him<00:00:49.020> though<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.440> really<00:00:50.309> I'm<00:00:51.059> not

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
work out for him though I really I'm not

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.360 
work out for him though I really I'm not
sure<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.600> sacrificing<00:00:52.379> all<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:53.129> his<00:00:53.250> other

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
do with those dark templar is actually

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.420 
do with those dark templar is actually
worth<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.539> he<00:00:57.809> does<00:00:57.989> snipe<00:00:58.379> one<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
worth it he does snipe one of the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.650 
worth it he does snipe one of the
observers<00:00:59.879> out<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.210> I'm<00:01:00.270> not<00:01:00.390> sure<00:01:00.449> if<00:01:00.600> that

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
observers out and I'm not sure if that

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.429 
observers out and I'm not sure if that
observers<00:01:01.199> saw<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.440> dark<00:01:01.739> Archon<00:01:01.980> or<00:01:02.399> not<00:01:03.439> but

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
observers saw the dark Archon or not but

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.020 
observers saw the dark Archon or not but
the<00:01:04.530> dark<00:01:04.739> Archon<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.339> not<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:06.000> able

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the dark Archon is not going to be able

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.420 
the dark Archon is not going to be able
to<00:01:06.210> do<00:01:06.299> much<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:06.659> Maelstrom<00:01:07.340> against<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
to do much with Maelstrom against the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.210 
to do much with Maelstrom against the
Protoss<00:01:08.790> army<00:01:09.470> grapple<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.590> zealot<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:11.159> a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
Protoss army grapple the zealot for a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.359 
Protoss army grapple the zealot for a
while<00:01:11.990> but<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.020> think<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.220> be

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
while but I think this is going to be

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.630 
while but I think this is going to be
for<00:01:14.700> my<00:01:15.060> control<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.950> movie<00:01:16.950> coming<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.460> with

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
for my control so movie coming in with

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.580 
for my control so movie coming in with
some<00:01:17.850> innovation<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.869> game<00:01:19.110> let's<00:01:19.409> see

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
some innovation in this game let's see

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.020 
some innovation in this game let's see
if<00:01:19.650> he<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.830> make<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.130> worth<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.640> because<00:01:20.790> at

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
if he can make it worth it because at

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.820 
if he can make it worth it because at
this<00:01:21.150> point<00:01:21.240> Hillary<00:01:21.960> does<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.470> larger

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
this point Hillary does have a larger

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.940 
this point Hillary does have a larger
army<00:01:23.159> out<00:01:23.780> well<00:01:24.780> actually<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.439> doesn't<00:01:25.710> quite

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
army out well actually it doesn't quite

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.289 
army out well actually it doesn't quite
have<00:01:26.159> they<00:01:26.250> got<00:01:26.400> larger<00:01:26.670> army<00:01:26.909> yet<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.210> he's

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
have they got larger army yet but he's

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.840 
have they got larger army yet but he's
going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.750> soon<00:01:27.960> but<00:01:28.829> still<00:01:29.520> when<00:01:29.820> you

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
going to have it soon but still when you

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.429 
going to have it soon but still when you
consider<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.270> dark<00:01:30.659> our<00:01:30.810> guns<00:01:31.049> out<00:01:31.259> there

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
consider that dark our guns out there

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.080 
consider that dark our guns out there
that<00:01:31.650> dark<00:01:31.829> Archon<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.369> not<00:01:32.640> going<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.970> get

that dark Archon is not going to get

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.359 
that dark Archon is not going to get
much<00:01:33.210> done<00:01:33.479> unless<00:01:34.290> he<00:01:34.500> captures<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> shuttle

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
much done unless he captures the shuttle

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.910 
much done unless he captures the shuttle
if<00:01:35.490> he<00:01:35.610> gets<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.060> shuttle<00:01:36.390> with<00:01:36.509> mind<00:01:36.750> control

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
if he gets the shuttle with mind control

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.710 
if he gets the shuttle with mind control
this<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.400> be<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> pempus<00:01:39.060> play<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> game

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
long as movie keeps this dark Archon a

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.630 
long as movie keeps this dark Archon a
home<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.619> think<00:01:49.649> you'll<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.009> able<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.220> catch<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
home I think you'll be able to catch the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.510 
home I think you'll be able to catch the
shuttle<00:01:50.960> catch<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.170> shuttle<00:01:52.380> with<00:01:52.890> his<00:01:53.220> dark

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
Archon it the dark Archon I think does

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.560 
Archon it the dark Archon I think does
have<00:01:56.399> enough<00:01:56.579> energy<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> mind<00:01:57.420> control

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
have enough energy to do a mind control

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.929 
have enough energy to do a mind control
now<00:01:57.960> if<00:01:58.110> movie<00:01:58.380> researched<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.070> which<00:01:59.729> I

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
now if movie researched it which I

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.139 
now if movie researched it which I
pretty<00:02:00.299> sure<00:02:00.719> he<00:02:00.899> did<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:02.100> movie<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.700> prepared

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
a pretty sizable force of his own and he

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.139 
a pretty sizable force of his own and he
is<00:02:07.950> putting<00:02:08.099> these<00:02:08.280> pylons<00:02:08.670> all<00:02:08.879> over<00:02:09.060> the

place trying to find that shuttle so

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.619 
place trying to find that shuttle so
he'll<00:02:10.950> know<00:02:11.160> when<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.940> get<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.180> mind<00:02:12.390> control

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.550 
he'll know when to get the mind control
of<00:02:12.959> it

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
of it

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.860 
of it
but<00:02:14.250> i'm<00:02:14.340> pretty<00:02:14.489> sure<00:02:14.610> pure<00:02:15.180> must<00:02:15.569> have<00:02:15.690> seen

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
but i'm pretty sure pure must have seen

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.660 
but i'm pretty sure pure must have seen
that<00:02:15.959> dark<00:02:16.200> Archon<00:02:16.410> by<00:02:16.770> now<00:02:16.980> because<00:02:17.459> he's

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
that dark Archon by now because he's

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.670 
that dark Archon by now because he's
backing<00:02:18.000> off<00:02:18.209> with<00:02:18.630> all<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.870> his<00:02:18.959> troops<00:02:19.260> and

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
backing off with all of his troops and

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.610 
backing off with all of his troops and
he<00:02:19.800> must<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.510> two<00:02:21.510> shuttles<00:02:22.050> coming<00:02:22.200> in<00:02:22.410> for

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
he must have two shuttles coming in for

he must have two shuttles coming in for
pure<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:23.310> could<00:02:23.459> be<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.550> massive<00:02:23.880> drop

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
pure this could be a massive drop

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.680 
pure this could be a massive drop
actually<00:02:24.840> considering<00:02:25.500> if<00:02:26.400> pure<00:02:27.090> has<00:02:27.420> some

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690

Reavers in here this could be absolutely

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.680

inside<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.260> main<00:03:16.470> going<00:03:16.860> down<00:03:17.220> for<00:03:17.549> movie<00:03:17.670> and

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
inside the main going down for movie and

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.050 
inside the main going down for movie and
pure<00:03:18.480> actually<00:03:18.930> defends<00:03:19.560> his<00:03:19.769> third<00:03:20.160> base<00:03:20.609> so

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
pure actually defends his third base so

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.470 
pure actually defends his third base so
kind<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.930> lapse<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.890> game<00:03:23.489> sense<00:03:23.850> from<00:03:24.120> movie

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
kind of a lapse of game sense from movie

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.569 
kind of a lapse of game sense from movie
they're<00:03:24.720> keeping<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.680> dark<00:03:25.920> Archon<00:03:26.100> at<00:03:26.340> home

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
they're keeping that dark Archon at home

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:27.830 
they're keeping that dark Archon at home
would<00:03:26.940> have<00:03:27.060> definitely<00:03:27.359> made<00:03:27.600> the

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
would have definitely made the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.870 
would have definitely made the
difference<00:03:28.049> I<00:03:28.320> think<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.769> guess<00:03:29.519> that<00:03:29.670> movie

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
difference I think I guess that movie

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.729 
difference I think I guess that movie
was<00:03:30.030> thinking<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.690> pure<00:03:30.959> would<00:03:31.200> fall<00:03:31.530> back

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
was thinking that pure would fall back

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.830 
was thinking that pure would fall back
with<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.459> shuttle<00:03:32.850> full<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.120> ravers<00:03:33.329> but<00:03:33.720> oh

with the shuttle full of ravers but oh
no<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:35.760> Reavers<00:03:36.120> might<00:03:36.299> be<00:03:36.390> able<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.569> get<00:03:36.660> so

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
no the Reavers might be able to get so

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.559 
no the Reavers might be able to get so
many<00:03:37.200> probe<00:03:37.530> kills<00:03:37.799> here<00:03:38.069> oh<00:03:38.250> nice<00:03:39.150> little

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
very grim for movie at this point that

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.550 
very grim for movie at this point that
would<00:03:50.040> have<00:03:50.160> been<00:03:50.250> such<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.760> great<00:03:51.560> tempest

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
would have been such a great tempest

would have been such a great tempest
play<00:03:52.829> from<00:03:53.100> him<00:03:53.310> such<00:03:53.579> a<00:03:53.900> game-changing<00:03:54.900> move

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
play from him such a game-changing move

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.240 
play from him such a game-changing move
if<00:03:55.319> he<00:03:55.440> would<00:03:55.590> have<00:03:55.650> caught<00:03:55.859> one<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.069> those

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
if he would have caught one of those

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.690 
if he would have caught one of those
shuttles<00:03:56.519> with<00:03:57.420> his<00:03:57.630> mind<00:03:57.900> control<00:03:58.700> but

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
shuttles with his mind control but

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.960 
shuttles with his mind control but
that's<00:03:59.970> not<00:04:00.299> going<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.660> work<00:04:00.690> out<00:04:00.989> this<00:04:01.170> time

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
that's not going to work out this time

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.160 
that's not going to work out this time
unfortunately<00:04:02.970> there's<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.420> dark<00:04:03.600> Archon<00:04:03.780> in

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
unfortunately there's the dark Archon in

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.830 
unfortunately there's the dark Archon in
here<00:04:04.440> he<00:04:05.069> finally<00:04:05.639> gets<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.880> mind<00:04:06.209> control<00:04:06.420> a

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
here he finally gets the mind control a

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.490 
here he finally gets the mind control a
little<00:04:07.470> bit<00:04:07.650> late<00:04:07.950> of<00:04:08.220> that<00:04:08.790> shuttle<00:04:09.269> so<00:04:10.200> the

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
little bit late of that shuttle so the

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.289 
little bit late of that shuttle so the
shuttle<00:04:10.859> not<00:04:11.459> going<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.850> do<00:04:11.970> a<00:04:12.000> whole<00:04:12.269> lot

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
shuttle not going to do a whole lot

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.729 
shuttle not going to do a whole lot
because<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:12.989> probably<00:04:13.139> doesn't<00:04:13.440> have<00:04:13.590> that

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
because it probably doesn't have that

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.580 
because it probably doesn't have that
much<00:04:13.920> in<00:04:14.130> it<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:15.209> be<00:04:15.329> honest<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:15.840> mean<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.049> saw<00:04:16.320> one

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
much in it to be honest I mean I saw one

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.949 
much in it to be honest I mean I saw one
rever<00:04:16.889> go<00:04:17.039> down<00:04:17.220> earlier<00:04:17.639> inside<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.479> main<00:04:18.690> so

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
rever go down earlier inside the main so

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.509 
rever go down earlier inside the main so
it's<00:04:19.109> probably<00:04:19.260> not<00:04:19.410> too<00:04:19.530> much<00:04:19.950> inside<00:04:20.340> that

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
it's probably not too much inside that

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.480 
it's probably not too much inside that
shuttle<00:04:21.140> for<00:04:22.140> a<00:04:22.169> movie<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.830> now<00:04:22.950> movies<00:04:23.340> going

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
shuttle for a movie and now movies going

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.640 
shuttle for a movie and now movies going

to lose all of his gateways and
everything<00:04:26.010> up<00:04:26.159> here

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
everything up here

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.800 
everything up here
still<00:04:27.669> hanging<00:04:28.000> out<00:04:28.270> there<00:04:28.419> in<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:28.599> middle<00:04:28.750> of

still hanging out there in the middle of

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
still hanging out there in the middle of
the<00:04:28.870> map<00:04:29.110> with<00:04:29.349> this<00:04:29.879> stolen<00:04:30.879> shuttle<00:04:31.590> he<00:04:32.590> does

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
the map with this stolen shuttle he does

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.290 
the map with this stolen shuttle he does
still<00:04:33.099> have<00:04:33.190> high<00:04:33.340> templars<00:04:33.819> so<00:04:34.000> if<00:04:34.060> it<00:04:34.150> gets

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
still have high templars so if it gets

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.879 
still have high templars so if it gets
good<00:04:34.659> enough<00:04:34.960> storms<00:04:35.379> here<00:04:35.470> he's<00:04:35.620> going<00:04:35.740> to<00:04:35.800> be

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
good enough storms here he's going to be

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.290 
good enough storms here he's going to be
able<00:04:35.979> to<00:04:36.129> defend<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:36.460> little<00:04:36.699> bit<00:04:36.819> longer<00:04:36.970> but

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
able to defend a little bit longer but

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
with innovation just didn't work out for

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.189 
with innovation just didn't work out for
him<00:04:50.889> at<00:04:51.099> all<00:04:51.629> now<00:04:52.629> some<00:04:52.840> of<00:04:52.900> those<00:04:52.960> gateways

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
him at all now some of those gateways

and<00:05:01.750> I<00:05:01.840> think<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.169> pure<00:05:02.469> is<00:05:02.620> just<00:05:02.800> going<00:05:02.949> to

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
and I think the pure is just going to

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:05.700 
and I think the pure is just going to
destroy<00:05:03.969> the<00:05:04.210> third<00:05:04.389> base<00:05:04.629> and<00:05:04.990> I<00:05:05.440> think<00:05:05.650> he

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
destroy the third base and I think he

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.020 
destroy the third base and I think he
has<00:05:05.770> enough<00:05:05.830> to<00:05:06.129> destroy<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.699> natural

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
has enough to destroy the natural

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.330 
has enough to destroy the natural
