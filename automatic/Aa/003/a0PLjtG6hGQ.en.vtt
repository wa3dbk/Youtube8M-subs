00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.959
 what's up in the bronze game? 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.000
 cuisine one of you are doing well 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.880
 in this tutorial shows you like one 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.099
 easy to build an elevator is easy 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.320
 you just need one for that 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.599
 Any block from the Emmental 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.760
 then you need decorations 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.130
 once a shield and once at 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.019
 different things once 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.360
 water bucket of course in survival mode 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.010
 do you need just one one only one bucket to 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.830
 You can always replenish yours 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.710
 have to stop several wood blocks farms the 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.830
 is called trees falls around the shield 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.140
 to produce 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.540
 then knock stones or turn others 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.220
 variants then you just have to 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.559
 Build up here means we build 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.269
 Now a page up now 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.040
 went to the other side so on the 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.989
 rebuild the right side first 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.189
 where we can start here now 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:03.119
 and out there again perfect and perfect 

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:05.339
 once so it is supposed to be an elevator of 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.750
 not powered by redstone the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.600
 Of course, this is also here on the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.390
 channel but first quite simple the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.109
 first elevator you can ever build 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.729
 it is so easy and he sees now 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:21.539
 you do not have to be very good at it 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.979
 say but he is really bomb because of the 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.229
 speed alone upwards 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.299
 just have a look at what needs because 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.119
 Now, at eye level, that means 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.219
 below where the feet are so minecraft 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.939
 pretty content eye level 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:37.249
 the shield here is 12 now 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.569
 we must continue to do so 

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:43.469
 and now we have to take turns again 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:45.659
 a sign in the water a shield 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:50.340
 then again with circle out then again 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.780
 a water bucket and again and again so 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.789
 is not all I am to you now 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.350
 show in this tutorial but he 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.749
 something else is coming up now 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.049
 Wherever you can think this is possible 

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:02.399
 So now you can 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.539
 consistently up to the top if you can 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.149
 but we sometimes have 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.670
 also in the house several floors and on it 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.619
 you have to pay attention that you stop in these 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.340
 Italy can come one year out 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.319
 but how can you solve it? 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.519
 so here for example if I have that now 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.840
 Get away with the fly now 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.910
 not out that means we have to go now 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.430
 make sure that we enter again 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.890
 blog go up and water again 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.590
 once do so now is no problem 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.290
 Now you can get out of it 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.260
 we are outside but now we want 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:36.730
 from down here to the top okay that works 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.940
 too fast not too slow is completely 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.530
 ok but now people want now 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.239
 we build one between the days 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.519
 means we go down here now and 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.530
 do not pay attention where the water 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.079
 is now where he is for example 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.140
 still to do but that we now 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:55.260
 Here's where the sign is a hole 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.910
 on the other side 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.220
 we could of course also a hole here 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.480
 make or again there is the exit 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.579
 it does not matter but we want to stop 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.620
 because of the shield because of that 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.780
 must also have a hole here eighth 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.090
 shit what happens now the water 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.620
 exits no fear of this are the 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.959
 signs as they do the shield again 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.389
 there and that stops the water now 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.850
 you can already the first so the first 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.920
 floor here already build and you have 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.160
 no problem now here, for example 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.200
 Go back up and down now 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.540
 Now we want to go through the top 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.370
 without now to the first second 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.380
 or to 10 100 else what a 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.170
 but now we want to go to the 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.840
 first floor out we are out club 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.590
 so and you can still stop up here 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.359
 do it too 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.220
 that means up here is now for 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.290
 example, the shield again 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.769
 Let's get this out of here again 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.950
 tuned 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.620
 the sign back to it perfectly now 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.870
 could make the second floor already so 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.000
 then we have already seen two floors 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.989
 Like such a springboard can be like that 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.880
 Build as you like 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.040
 if you then jump down below 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.049
 into the water pure but that we already 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.250
 can see okay so it goes, the water 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.319
 down there is currently disappearing 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.209
 Perfect 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.940
 you have become smarter now me 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.609
 even now you can still in my head 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.870
 building a lift with redstone but how 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.579
 said so done 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.410
 they are coming to the 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.900
 channel I wanted to stop first the first 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.300
 Elevator on my channel bring up the 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.340
 lightest he is really easy than 90 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.500
 sometimes with electronics but only with 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.110
 any dice or a blog 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.580
 or a shield or turn with a 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.490
 Water pots so three different 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.800
 things had bad respect no elevator 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.810
 so people i am through with the video me 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.169
 Hope you have your own keys 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.820
 on 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.040
 if that's the case you know 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.930
 we'll see each other like the skin next time 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.370
 and again and again until then 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.370
 and bye
