00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.170 
have two other wires from the back of
the<00:00:44.100> GC<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.820> already<00:00:45.120> camo<00:00:45.360> controller<00:00:47.180> there

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the GC you already camo controller there

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.940 
the GC you already camo controller there
you<00:00:48.239> go<00:00:48.329> back<00:00:48.870> up<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> gimbal<00:00:49.320> controller<00:00:49.620> one

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
you go back up the gimbal controller one

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.729 
you go back up the gimbal controller one
to<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.520> rear<00:00:50.789> here<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:52.230> other<00:00:52.410> cable

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.710 
put a dent and in order to put a dent on
here<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.189> thing<00:01:53.399> had<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.880> swing<00:01:54.210> over<00:01:54.390> like

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
here this thing had to swing over like

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.440 
here this thing had to swing over like
super<00:01:55.500> fast<00:01:55.740> super<00:01:55.979> powerful<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.790> look<00:01:57.270> what

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
super fast super powerful and look what

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.260 
super fast super powerful and look what
happens<00:01:57.840> how<00:01:58.649> can<00:01:58.920> DJI<00:01:59.369> do<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.880> right<00:02:00.119> here

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
happens how can DJI do this right here

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.389 
happens how can DJI do this right here
it's<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.659> they<00:02:01.350> limit<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:01.920> side<00:02:02.159> so

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
it's like they limit this side so

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.190 
it's like they limit this side so
nothing<00:02:02.520> hits<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.479> should<00:02:03.750> have<00:02:03.930> at

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
nothing hits but this should have at

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.340 
nothing hits but this should have at
least<00:02:04.409> limited<00:02:05.310> here<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.000> doesn't<00:02:06.030> hit<00:02:06.479> you

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
least limited here so it doesn't hit you

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.249 
least limited here so it doesn't hit you
know<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.829> camera<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.520> hits<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.879> camera

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
know the camera it hits the camera

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.320 
know the camera it hits the camera
oh that's<00:02:09.860> that's<00:02:10.310> that's<00:02:10.580> pretty<00:02:10.939> stupid

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
oh that's that's that's pretty stupid

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.910 
oh that's that's that's pretty stupid
you<00:02:11.629> know<00:02:11.750> it's<00:02:11.930> like<00:02:12.049> I<00:02:12.140> don't<00:02:12.200> know<00:02:12.409> why<00:02:12.620> but

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
you know it's like I don't know why but

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.490 
you know it's like I don't know why but
that<00:02:13.700> shouldn't<00:02:14.000> be<00:02:14.180> allowed<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.840> be<00:02:15.349> that

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
that shouldn't be allowed to be that

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.380 
that shouldn't be allowed to be that
close<00:02:15.799> I<00:02:15.980> mean<00:02:16.010> dirty<00:02:16.489> limit<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:17.000> role<00:02:17.180> at

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
close I mean dirty limit the role at

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.660 
close I mean dirty limit the role at
least<00:02:17.420> limited<00:02:18.019> some<00:02:18.290> more<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.370> doesn't

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
least limited some more so it doesn't

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.100 
least limited some more so it doesn't
even<00:02:19.790> come<00:02:20.090> close<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.689> let<00:02:20.780> me<00:02:20.870> show<00:02:21.049> you

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
my transmitter torreón and i just put

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.880 
my transmitter torreón and i just put
this<00:02:28.120> my<00:02:29.120> phone<00:02:29.540> down<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:30.140> can<00:02:30.440> go<00:02:30.530> ahead<00:02:30.650> and

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
this my phone down I can go ahead and

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:39.130 
this my phone down I can go ahead and
plug<00:02:31.129> in<00:02:31.310> my<00:02:32.180> battery<00:02:37.209> so<00:02:38.209> you<00:02:38.569> can<00:02:38.689> see<00:02:38.900> here

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
plug in my battery so you can see here

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.880 
plug in my battery so you can see here
look<00:02:39.680> at<00:02:39.859> it<00:02:40.209> why<00:02:41.209> does<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.510> calibrate<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.470> get

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
look at it why does a calibrate and get

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.259 
look at it why does a calibrate and get
all<00:02:43.129> the<00:02:43.340> way<00:02:43.430> over<00:02:43.670> I<00:02:43.700> know<00:02:43.790> it's<00:02:44.030> doing<00:02:44.209> the

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
all the way over I know it's doing the

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.420 
all the way over I know it's doing the
endpoint<00:02:44.599> calibration<00:02:45.319> but<00:02:45.470> like<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:46.010> has<00:02:46.220> to

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
endpoint calibration but like it has to

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.539 
endpoint calibration but like it has to
hit<00:02:46.609> this<00:02:47.359> little<00:02:47.599> my<00:02:48.079> function<00:02:48.739> button<00:02:49.010> every

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
hit this little my function button every

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.460 
hit this little my function button every
single<00:02:49.970> time<00:02:50.180> I<00:02:50.389> would<00:02:50.480> hate<00:02:50.989> it<00:02:51.109> if<00:02:51.230> my

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
single time I would hate it if my

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.319 
single time I would hate it if my
function<00:02:51.709> button<00:02:52.220> gets<00:02:52.400> worn<00:02:52.700> out<00:02:52.849> because<00:02:53.000> of

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
function button gets worn out because of

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.149 
function button gets worn out because of
this<00:02:53.420> gimbal<00:02:53.720> what<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:54.560> can<00:02:54.680> see<00:02:54.829> it's<00:02:54.950> doing

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
this gimbal what you can see it's doing

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.520 
this gimbal what you can see it's doing
this<00:02:55.250> little<00:02:55.459> routine<00:02:55.940> thing<00:02:56.239> I<00:02:56.450> hooked<00:02:57.049> it<00:02:57.139> up

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
this little routine thing I hooked it up

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.190 
this little routine thing I hooked it up
everything<00:02:58.099> seems<00:02:58.370> up-to-date<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.239> few<00:03:00.079> issues

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
everything seems up-to-date a few issues

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.869 
everything seems up-to-date a few issues
that<00:03:00.379> I<00:03:00.500> don't<00:03:00.650> know<00:03:00.829> why<00:03:01.040> but<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.459> comes<00:03:01.670> and

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
that I don't know why but it comes and

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.180 
that I don't know why but it comes and
goes<00:03:01.909> you<00:03:02.840> can<00:03:02.989> see<00:03:03.109> that<00:03:03.230> that<00:03:03.409> little<00:03:03.590> twitch

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
goes you can see that that little twitch

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.750 
goes you can see that that little twitch
there<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:05.389> tilt<00:03:05.659> vibrating<00:03:06.349> and<00:03:06.620> this<00:03:07.609> is

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
there the tilt vibrating and this is

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.479 
there the tilt vibrating and this is
this<00:03:07.909> hot<00:03:08.480> off<00:03:08.629> the<00:03:08.659> box<00:03:09.049> there's<00:03:09.489> nothing

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
this hot off the box there's nothing

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.910 
this hot off the box there's nothing
that<00:03:10.639> you<00:03:10.790> can<00:03:10.970> actually<00:03:11.120> balance<00:03:11.780> on<00:03:11.989> here<00:03:12.290> so

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
that you can actually balance on here so

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.170 
that you can actually balance on here so
I<00:03:12.950> mean<00:03:13.220> I'm<00:03:13.340> using<00:03:13.519> the<00:03:13.669> plastic<00:03:14.090> retainer

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
I mean I'm using the plastic retainer

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.809 
I mean I'm using the plastic retainer
I'm<00:03:14.750> using<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.169> olympus<00:03:15.620> 12<00:03:16.099> millimeter<00:03:16.579> lens

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
I'm using the olympus 12 millimeter lens

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.979 
I'm using the olympus 12 millimeter lens
you<00:03:17.060> can<00:03:17.180> see<00:03:17.379> 12<00:03:18.379> millimeters<00:03:18.980> @f<00:03:19.370> 2.0<00:03:20.060> it's

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
you can see 12 millimeters @f 2.0 it's

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.949 
you can see 12 millimeters @f 2.0 it's
mounted<00:03:21.349> on<00:03:21.410> there<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:22.720> I'll<00:03:23.720> show<00:03:23.810> you<00:03:23.870> guys

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
mounted on there and I'll show you guys

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.500 
mounted on there and I'll show you guys
in<00:03:24.019> here<00:03:26.500> but<00:03:27.500> yeah<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:28.010> motors<00:03:28.340> buzzing<00:03:28.849> and

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
in here but yeah the motors buzzing and

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.059 
in here but yeah the motors buzzing and
I<00:03:29.629> believe<00:03:29.900> it's<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.260> tilt<00:03:30.530> motor<00:03:30.739> so<00:03:30.949> if<00:03:31.010> I

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
I believe it's the tilt motor so if I

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.640 
I believe it's the tilt motor so if I
pinch<00:03:31.370> it<00:03:31.519> it<00:03:32.269> goes<00:03:32.449> away<00:03:32.629> it's<00:03:32.900> rattling<00:03:33.530> like

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
pinch it it goes away it's rattling like

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.349 
pinch it it goes away it's rattling like
something's<00:03:34.010> broken<00:03:34.340> inside<00:03:34.519> I<00:03:34.819> don't<00:03:35.269> know

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
something's broken inside I don't know

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.569 
something's broken inside I don't know
what's<00:03:35.629> going<00:03:35.870> on<00:03:35.989> but<00:03:36.139> it's<00:03:36.260> rattling<00:03:36.799> every

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
what's going on but it's rattling every

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:38.740 
what's going on but it's rattling every
once<00:03:37.819> a<00:03:37.940> while<00:03:37.970> this<00:03:38.269> thing<00:03:38.329> would<00:03:38.510> start<00:03:38.690> to

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
once a while this thing would start to

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.349 
once a while this thing would start to
twitch<00:03:39.049> but<00:03:39.459> earlier<00:03:40.459> when<00:03:40.699> I<00:03:40.760> first<00:03:41.030> plug<00:03:41.239> it

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
twitch but earlier when I first plug it

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:42.939 
twitch but earlier when I first plug it
in<00:03:41.449> with<00:03:41.540> Rick<00:03:41.690> I'm<00:03:41.810> fine<00:03:42.049> no<00:03:42.349> issues<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:42.859> also
