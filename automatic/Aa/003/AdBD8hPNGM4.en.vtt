00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
knife the cool thing about this one is

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.420 
knife the cool thing about this one is
it<00:01:33.600> only<00:01:33.689> has<00:01:33.960> three<00:01:34.380> serrations<00:01:35.009> which<00:01:35.250> is

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
like perfect it doesn't take up the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.600 
like perfect it doesn't take up the
whole<00:01:37.049> knife<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.920> you're<00:01:38.040> not<00:01:38.159> going<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.430> sit

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
whole knife so you're not going to sit

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.069 
whole knife so you're not going to sit

regions don't know if anybody's ever
sharpens<00:01:41.970> two<00:01:42.060> reasons<00:01:42.360> they're<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> little

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
sharpens two reasons they're a little

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.210 
sharpens two reasons they're a little
bit<00:01:42.930> difficult<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.439> sharpen<00:01:43.829> or

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
bit difficult to sharpen or

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.630 
bit difficult to sharpen or
time-consuming<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.420> should<00:01:45.600> say<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.680> by<00:01:47.399> only

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
time-consuming I should say so by only

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.300 
time-consuming I should say so by only
having<00:01:48.060> three<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:49.110> get<00:01:49.320> some<00:01:49.560> serrations<00:01:50.159> but

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
having three you get some serrations but

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.230 
having three you get some serrations but
you<00:01:50.369> don't<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.670> sit<00:01:50.820> there<00:01:50.850> all<00:01:51.030> day<00:01:51.060> and

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
you don't have to sit there all day and

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.080 
you don't have to sit there all day and
sharpen<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> knife<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.409> it's<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.820> great
