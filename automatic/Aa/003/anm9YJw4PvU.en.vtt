 Nepal 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.529

 unusual dangerous expedition to resolve 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.130
 arrest did not take wasteland such bags 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.199

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.440
 climbers on the mountainside 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.860
 This packaging still bushes and oxygen

 cleaned up the village arrest before 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.160
 several expeditions led by Sikorsky 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.610
 climber drunk noguchi gathered about 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.030
 nine tons of garbage but no one has ever 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.880
 cleaned up the so-called 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.590
 dead zones 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.380
 and mountains of garbage piled up on high 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.540
 more than eight thousand meters the so-called 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.460
 dead zones collect trash there case 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.510
 quite risky not everyone is capable of 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.380
 this is the author 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.729
 sanitary action on leading this example 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.130
 other climbers 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.189
 according to the Sherpas, the garbage left is not 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.630
 only insulting the summit but also the reason 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.619
 water pollution and the source which 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.030
 serves snow and glaciers cc by the way their 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.420
 getting smaller himalayas and this is still 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.060
 one of the reasons for brushing on the marginal 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.350
 altitude but since then climbers from on 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.960
 often time virtuoso did not hide the snow 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.570
 cover 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.470
 In recent years, its force limit 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.480
 exposing mountains of garbage 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.310
 still ascended by clichin in the snow and we 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.700
 not going pascal 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.189
 if global warming will 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.409
 continue to future generations only from 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.329
 Books learn that when the Himalayas already 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.800
 covered in snow 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.940
 the Sharkov expedition also located 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.220
 information about the bodies of five climbers who 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.860
 should have been within 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.760
 route climb 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.800
 however, whether they were discovered 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.070
 details no arrest was for the first time 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.990
 shown by a man in 1953, since 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.820
 subsequent climbs died 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.290
 about three hundred people dead bodies in 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.690
 dead zone usually leave sinai to lead 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.560
 since from such a height it is extremely difficult 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.240
 evacuated according to the service kuryla
