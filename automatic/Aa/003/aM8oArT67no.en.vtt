got nothing to lose the worst thing in

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.520 
got nothing to lose the worst thing in
that<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.110> being<00:00:40.290> reserved

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530

championship<00:00:41.309> which<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.290> amazing<00:00:43.290> as<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.739> and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
championship which is amazing as in and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.340 
championship which is amazing as in and
of<00:00:43.950> itself<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.750> so<00:00:45.750> she's<00:00:45.930> trying<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.170> make<00:00:46.289> up

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
of itself and so she's trying to make up

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.209 
of itself and so she's trying to make up
some<00:00:46.620> ground<00:00:46.649> there<00:00:48.620> that<00:00:49.620> was<00:00:49.739> pretty<00:00:50.070> well

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
some ground there that was pretty well

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.430 
some ground there that was pretty well
done<00:00:50.250> -<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.730> would<00:00:50.969> say<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.809> these<00:00:52.079> two<00:00:52.260> horses

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
done - I would say and these two horses

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.819 
done - I would say and these two horses
are<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:52.949> different<00:00:53.809> to<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> horse<00:00:55.500> so

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
are so different to get on a horse so

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:39.970 
are so different to get on a horse so
unlike<00:00:56.190> your<00:00:56.340> own<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.559> big<00:00:58.559> test

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.990 

she<00:01:40.980> did<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.160> great<00:01:41.370> job<00:01:41.400> there

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
she did a great job there

00:01:42.000 --> 00:02:06.219 
she did a great job there
[Applause]

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.320 

and<00:02:07.229> now<00:02:07.560> will<00:02:07.710> here<00:02:07.860> we<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.039> hunter<00:02:08.459> on

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330

Patrick

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.760 

Hunter<00:02:45.150> also<00:02:45.540> opting<00:02:45.870> for<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.140> inside<00:02:46.470> turn

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
Hunter also opting for that inside turn

00:02:46.770 --> 00:03:59.150 
Hunter also opting for that inside turn
I<00:02:47.010> think<00:02:47.070> was<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.340> smart<00:02:47.670> choice

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.800 

an<00:03:59.670> offense<00:04:00.230> 2014<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.650> ASPCA<00:04:02.160> McClay<00:04:02.810> wall

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
an offense 2014 the ASPCA McClay wall

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.760 
an offense 2014 the ASPCA McClay wall
and<00:04:04.320> that<00:04:05.250> wraps<00:04:05.550> it<00:04:05.790> up<00:04:05.880> hunter<00:04:06.180> Holloway

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
and that wraps it up hunter Holloway

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.360 
and that wraps it up hunter Holloway
with<00:04:07.770> the<00:04:07.980> final<00:04:08.520> jump<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:10.100> that<00:04:11.100> is

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
with the final jump and that is

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.920 
with the final jump and that is
definitely<00:04:12.030> going<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.240> be<00:04:12.360> a<00:04:12.390> no<00:04:12.660> further

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
definitely going to be a no further

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.750 
definitely going to be a no further
