00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.020
 according to the ms it will take four months 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.910
 before you can make a vaccine 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.500
 large amount remember that for 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.450
 the moment the virus is not transmitted 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.370
 from man to man but the hypothesis is 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.049
 dreaded so what are the modes of 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.660
 contamination explanations jean jean 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.039
 flaysakier here we see the company 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.630
 air virus migratory birds 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.820
 actually carries in their intestines 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.650
 various strain responsible for influenza 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.779
 harmless avian for migratory birds 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.609
 these viruses can decimate livestock 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.010
 of turkey chicken as was the case 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.630
 last year in the language the bird flu 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.320
 also makes heavy threat on 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.550
 the man 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.710
 because we do not know how to defend ourselves 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.730
 against her while we can we 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.950
 defend against the flu that we 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.780
 meet each winter the human virus 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.520
 indeed on its surface structures that 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.350
 we call the hemagglutinin which he 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.450
 uses to enter the cells and 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.039
 neuraminidase that serves him to get 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.110
 escape and infect others 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.610
 fabrics to escape the system of 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.840
 defense he's going to change little 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.940
 pieces of these structures it's this 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.530
 called slip and for the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.510
 counter it puts every year in the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.730
 vaccine three different strains in order to 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.410
 better control it major fear of 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.290
 specialists this is the break 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.150
 the virus will totally change a 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.080
 part of its external structure 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.750
 that's what happened in 1918 that's the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.600
 Spanish flu 20 to 40 million 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.729
 deaths according to various estimates 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.590
 break again in 1957 with the flu 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.780
 Asian one million dead one sure 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.580
 still in 68 69 and the hong flu 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.320
 kong sehk ensures are actually the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.180
 result of a tragic cocktail the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.350
 encounter of an avian virus and a 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.150
 human virus 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.979
 both viruses are found in the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.140
 respiratory tract of a pig and go 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.270
 so be able to exchange their genes as well 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.950
 humanize the avian virus can be 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.840
 transmit very easily between 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.450
 humans the passage through the port is not 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.100
 an obligation in kong in 1997 we have 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.200
 found that chickens have directly 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.060
 contaminated 18 people and caused six 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.350
 death the conjunction of a flu 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.509
 avian and a human flu would 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.220
 a real tragedy because it would take 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.259
 four to six months to get a vaccine 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.170
 effective and flu vaccine 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.170
 is preparing irony of fate on eggs
