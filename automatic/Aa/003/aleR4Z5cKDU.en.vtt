00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
so as you guys can see that those two

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.599 
so as you guys can see that those two
little<00:03:12.419> slits<00:03:12.930> right<00:03:13.500> in<00:03:13.680> here<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.189> they<00:03:14.549> do

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
little slits right in here and they do

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.699 
little slits right in here and they do
have<00:03:14.909> more<00:03:15.150> padding<00:03:15.569> down<00:03:15.750> here<00:03:16.049> these<00:03:16.500> are<00:03:16.560> a

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
have more padding down here these are a

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.339 
have more padding down here these are a
nice<00:03:16.889> more<00:03:17.069> cushiony<00:03:17.579> padding<00:03:17.970> not<00:03:18.840> as<00:03:19.019> hard

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
nice more cushiony padding not as hard

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.140 
nice more cushiony padding not as hard
and<00:03:19.650> I'm<00:03:20.069> guessing<00:03:20.370> that's<00:03:20.430> more<00:03:20.609> cushiony<00:03:20.970> to

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
and I'm guessing that's more cushiony to

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.520 
and I'm guessing that's more cushiony to
be<00:03:21.269> more<00:03:21.449> shock<00:03:21.750> absorbent<00:03:22.290> when<00:03:22.379> you<00:03:22.439> have

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
be more shock absorbent when you have

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.259 
be more shock absorbent when you have
your<00:03:22.650> computer<00:03:22.769> sitting<00:03:23.189> on<00:03:23.370> here<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:23.909> as<00:03:24.180> you

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:49.259 
guys can see that so it looks like from

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:53.629 
guys can see that so it looks like from
that<00:03:49.680> side<00:03:49.949> and<00:03:50.220> turn<00:03:51.209> it<00:03:51.329> to<00:03:51.479> the<00:03:51.509> side<00:03:52.639> you

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
that side and turn it to the side you

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.129 
that side and turn it to the side you
guys<00:03:53.819> can<00:03:54.000> get<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.150> nice<00:03:54.299> little<00:03:54.479> view<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:54.959> try

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
guys can get a nice little view and try

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.099 
guys can get a nice little view and try
to<00:03:55.199> move<00:03:55.349> it<00:03:55.500> up<00:03:55.560> there<00:03:56.250> you<00:03:56.340> go<00:03:56.870> so<00:03:57.870> there's<00:03:58.049> a

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
to move it up there you go so there's a

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.420 
to move it up there you go so there's a
view<00:03:58.349> from<00:03:58.439> the<00:03:58.590> side<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:59.040> them<00:03:59.159> from<00:03:59.250> the

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
view from the side and them from the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.780 
view from the side and them from the
back<00:03:59.639> that's<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.629> view<00:04:01.280> but<00:04:02.280> usually<00:04:02.579> it<00:04:02.699> will

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
back that's the view but usually it will

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.959 
back that's the view but usually it will
be<00:04:02.879> facing<00:04:03.120> forward<00:04:03.829> are<00:04:04.829> you<00:04:04.979> guys<00:04:05.129> so<00:04:05.489> not

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
of things once again as you guys can see

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.659 
of things once again as you guys can see
how<00:04:12.269> that<00:04:12.509> the<00:04:13.259> rubber<00:04:13.739> very<00:04:14.129> nice<00:04:14.340> rubber

how that the rubber very nice rubber

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.459 
how that the rubber very nice rubber
texture<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.569> is<00:04:15.750> supposed<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.169> have<00:04:16.349> your

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:16.469 
texture that is supposed to have your

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:18.649 
texture that is supposed to have your
computer<00:04:16.880> so<00:04:17.880> does<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:18.150> know<00:04:18.209> so<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.419> doesn't

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
computer so does you know so it doesn't

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.120 
computer so does you know so it doesn't
scratch<00:04:19.019> your<00:04:19.229> computer<00:04:19.530> also<00:04:19.680> so<00:04:19.919> it<00:04:20.009> makes

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
scratch your computer also so it makes

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.439 
scratch your computer also so it makes
it<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:20.430> that<00:04:20.549> your<00:04:20.669> computer<00:04:21.000> doesn't<00:04:21.150> fall

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
it so that your computer doesn't fall

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.300 
it so that your computer doesn't fall
off<00:04:21.479> because<00:04:22.079> it<00:04:22.289> is<00:04:22.440> at<00:04:22.650> a<00:04:22.680> little<00:04:22.979> bit<00:04:23.099> of<00:04:23.130> a

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
off because it is at a little bit of a

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.790 
off because it is at a little bit of a
angle<00:04:24.029> as<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:24.240> guys<00:04:24.389> can<00:04:24.570> see<00:04:24.680> that's<00:04:25.680> the

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
angle as you guys can see that's the

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.600 
angle as you guys can see that's the
ergonomics

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
ergonomics

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.510 
ergonomics
of<00:04:26.879> this<00:04:27.300> stand<00:04:27.719> so<00:04:28.680> not<00:04:29.039> much<00:04:29.159> more<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:29.400> say

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
of this stand so not much more to say

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.629 
of this stand so not much more to say
let's<00:04:29.759> get<00:04:29.879> the<00:04:29.969> computer<00:04:30.270> right<00:04:30.539> on<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:31.639> so

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
let's get the computer right on it so

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.950 
let's get the computer right on it so
here<00:04:33.270> is<00:04:33.449> the<00:04:33.780> computer<00:04:34.490> boom<00:04:35.599> move<00:04:36.599> that<00:04:36.810> back

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
here is the computer boom move that back

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.779 
here is the computer boom move that back
a<00:04:37.020> little<00:04:37.229> bit<00:04:37.379> and<00:04:37.560> actually<00:04:38.460> only<00:04:38.580> come

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
a little bit and actually only come

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.399 
a little bit and actually only come
right<00:04:39.000> back<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.449> a<00:04:39.479> better<00:04:39.689> angle<00:04:39.900> so<00:04:40.199> you<00:04:40.229> guys

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:40.409 
right back to a better angle so you guys

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:41.830 
right back to a better angle so you guys
can<00:04:40.560> see<00:04:40.740> a<00:04:40.770> little<00:04:40.889> bit<00:04:41.009> better<00:04:41.159> so<00:04:41.370> hold<00:04:41.520> on

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
can see a little bit better so hold on

RT guys I'm back so here it is guys with

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.369 
RT guys I'm back so here it is guys with
the<00:04:44.969> computer<00:04:45.389> actually<00:04:45.509> sitting<00:04:45.960> on<00:04:46.229> the

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:46.379 
the computer actually sitting on the

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:49.129 
the computer actually sitting on the
stand<00:04:46.560> itself<00:04:47.039> as<00:04:47.250> you<00:04:47.699> guys<00:04:47.849> can<00:04:48.060> see<00:04:48.120> you<00:04:48.990> do

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
stand itself as you guys can see you do

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.740 
stand itself as you guys can see you do
get<00:04:49.319> a<00:04:49.349> little<00:04:49.620> bit<00:04:49.740> of<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:49.919> angle<00:04:50.569> so<00:04:51.569> as<00:04:51.599> you

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
get a little bit of that angle so as you

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.420 
get a little bit of that angle so as you
can<00:04:51.840> see<00:04:52.020> it<00:04:52.110> is<00:04:52.229> more<00:04:52.379> facing<00:04:52.860> towards<00:04:53.370> you

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
can see it is more facing towards you

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.059 
can see it is more facing towards you
like<00:04:53.669> it's<00:04:53.909> more<00:04:54.150> I<00:04:54.180> level<00:04:54.689> with<00:04:54.719> you<00:04:54.870> and<00:04:55.259> the

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
like it's more I level with you and the

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:58.309 
like it's more I level with you and the
actual<00:04:56.370> keyboard<00:04:57.180> itself<00:04:57.599> is<00:04:57.840> pretty<00:04:58.110> much

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.319 
actual keyboard itself is pretty much

00:04:58.319 --> 00:04:59.719 
actual keyboard itself is pretty much
slanted<00:04:58.860> so<00:04:59.009> you<00:04:59.069> can<00:04:59.189> lay<00:04:59.279> your<00:04:59.310> hands<00:04:59.580> on<00:04:59.669> it

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
slanted so you can lay your hands on it

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.029 
slanted so you can lay your hands on it
pretty<00:04:59.939> well<00:05:00.150> but<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:00.900> biggest<00:05:01.080> key<00:05:01.560> factor

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
pretty well but the biggest key factor

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.559 
pretty well but the biggest key factor
in<00:05:02.069> this<00:05:02.279> is<00:05:02.490> that<00:05:02.939> you<00:05:03.029> are<00:05:03.150> supposed<00:05:03.419> to<00:05:03.449> have

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
an external keyboard and mouse so it

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:07.909 
an external keyboard and mouse so it
acts<00:05:06.000> exactly<00:05:06.300> like<00:05:06.629> a<00:05:06.750> desktop<00:05:07.229> just<00:05:07.710> like
