 speaking of tomato sauce the sauce of 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.300
 simple tomato what all 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.470

 generations is really easy and 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.380
 versatile because it can be realized 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.360
 for many recipes 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.770
 let's go immediately to see the ingredients 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.770
 needed to make it happen 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.320
 the 20 that are needed to achieve 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:49.230
 this recipe is a medium onion 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.860
 chopped two bay leaves of 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.080
 basil 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.250
 I have it with ice cream then you can 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.250
 also use the fresh one 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.290
 avoid wanted kato then a clove 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:07.020
 of garlic or a teaspoon of oil in 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:10.470
 powder1 teaspoon walnut break 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:15.590
 Muscat half teaspoon of chili pepper 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:18.920
 powdered or half fresh chilli 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.920
 salt as needed 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.290
 2 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.290
 olive 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.970
 half a kilo of tomato sauce I 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.580
 I use this as I am 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.580
 sent and it's really high quality 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.280
 then half a glass of water 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.140
 and a pinch of sugar 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.299
 as you have seen the interventions are 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.979
 really easily available now 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:55.200
 let's go immediately to see how it is prepared 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.060
 follow me so I am on this side i 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.670
 cookers 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.920
 we immediately begin to find the south 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:12.959
 starting from the oil about 2 3 tablespoons 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:17.959
 as we said, the onion is 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:20.130
 a teaspoon dong or else 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.900
 directly a clove of garlic in 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.239
 dust ignite the fire fire must 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.290
 be initially lively because 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:34.290
 we must fry the onion with 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.989
 I always recommend garlic 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.480
 be careful not to let the onion burn 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.420
 this is a very crossed passage 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.430
 otherwise the taste of the sauce will go away 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.090
 because it recalls word 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.570
 now let's take our past this is 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:57.330
 the past of Sicily really 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:03:01.920

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:07.090
 in the pot and just over half a kilo 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:12.160
 then we take the water we put it 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:15.790
 inside the bottle we close 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.180
 with lid and we arrive as if 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:30.100
 we wanted to rinse the bottle then the 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:34.030
 we pour and mix to pass the 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.820
 flame to a minimum because the sauce does not 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.580
 must burn only needs to cook a 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.230
 slow fire for about an hour and a half is 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.840
