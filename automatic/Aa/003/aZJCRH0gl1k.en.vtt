00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello her love i want one more 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.980
 Another special trend of me out 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.809
 got caught pointing and indeed 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.360
 just look what my mother to me this 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.759
 crocheted a hat and at the moment 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.850
 this crochet is so useful to me 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.170
 Chinese is totally in the trend I 've got 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.090
 missed that again I thought 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.130
 why do you all have such a thing here? 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.320
 age upside down at 4 and so on 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.029
 Mercedessen there is always one behind 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.500
 klorolle had been in earlier and then 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.660
 was there such a regulated network over it and 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.219
 I did not associate with that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.070
 can and now my mother has it 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.320
 started and gave me what 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.579
 and she knows I am standing ears too 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.260
 So I also have one here 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.510
 she made me and now she has me 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.500
 I teach mine how to crochet 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.210
 that is still so quasi sent 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.309
 looks different but I have 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.719
 So I was really looking 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.550
 I can really get in there 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.039
 stuck and then I already have 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.770
 again wrong where and then know 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.660
 It would be long and then somehow here 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.299
 By the way it is definitely too 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.920
 learnable for jerks as you can see 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.310
 It's just not that it's necessarily long 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.890
 is for me now so I am now 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.810
 Not so much the craft specialist 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.159
 but I find it incredibly fascinating 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.290
 because I did that last night 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.310
 because you know that I hate TV 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.659
 So I can see that at all 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.640
 do not pull in well 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.890
 That's way too boring for me but if I am 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.770
 you do not have to do that anymore 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.689
 sitting alone in the evening and I have 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.970
 still a little something to do and 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.740
 surfers are not always on the internet, yes 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.020
 boring, too, that's why I'm doing now 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.880
 that and I also think it's really cool 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.310
 Link the videos with those 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.259
 Great to learn is in a separate 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.360
 blog article below below 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.280
 So I did not do the videos 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.500
 that would be totally ridiculous if one of the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.829
 can not even run itself quasi 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.350
 trying to run a video about optimal 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.790
 but I think that's it 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.350
 somehow scary satisfying because 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.060
 You can not see it's too bad now 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.829
 So as I said that is from yesterday 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.750
 and now I can always only 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.240
 join if I want one did not 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.489
 so good 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.060
 that is so it is such an absolute 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.520
 trend 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.470
 also wants to say still lose weight 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.720
 you go home too you old shit 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.310
 So you can not do it now 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.260
 I expect every video with me 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.819
 Slimming turns because my life is in the 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.430
 moment is not at all about it 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.260
 I'm happy when I weigh my weight 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.620
 currently kept normal wars and have 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.880
 completely different goals right now therefore means 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.280
 that's not me the topic is not 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.050
 So interested in things about nutrition 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.580
 about losing weight and reading that's how it is 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.500
 my absolute hobby I have there too 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.239
 I bought some new books again 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.239
 Link to the times you underneath the 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.920
 I currently devour and was ok 1 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.680
 shit that I link to you as well 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.290
 Do not buy warning who riestert vista 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.970
 already know but I want to stop me 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.860
 Do not center it so I hope here 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.209
 do not say here then I want to go with you 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.880
 her nothing left to do I wanted 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.010
 just look what you 're doing 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.069
 I'm doing at the moment like that 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.959
 Most people know about children and this is 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.880
 It is important that I have little stress 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.840
 than that I can not stress anymore and 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:13.620
 so because physically is everything top 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.630
 and with my husband, too, we have to 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.579
 now reduce the stress look there 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.989
 you can help with that too 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.709
 reduce stress because it really 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.200
 Being relaxed is when I'm not feeling well 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.640
 of what's more, I wanted to 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.709
 also tell you i have too 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.690
 another blog article I prepared 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.579
 guess if the video appears then 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.829
 I can also publish that 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:38.400
 I still have in the templates in the 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.500
 gizmos and now does not mean that 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.109
 I do not do everything as before 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.579
 That's what I want to say, that's me 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.560
 do the same nutrition I do 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.090
 my sport but I do not stress 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.069
 more so if now there weight 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.350
 goes away or not but me 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.310
 Focus on me for it 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.989
 nice and I weigh myself too 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.430
 not now, I often extra often 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.359
 I thought so maybe all 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.310
 two months 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:05.459
 and I thought so now I'll get 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.660
 me so one so I'm here at the stern 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.560
 That's why I rarely watch it 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.980
 I should always leave it 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.750
 I'll get such a body scales 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.609
 with eight contacts never works 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.380
 allows a correct bias analysis 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.600
 I have different models 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.070
 now in the eye 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.400
 you all link down below 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.290
 and it would be awesome if you guys got the 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.640
 could look at times and me your 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.800
 opinion writes which of her 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.570
 would take because I'm not like that yet 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.860
 correctly decide whether I now the from 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.510
 Take landlord, or at least by 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.630
 beurer looks to you to be all 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.760
 okay, thank you for turning it on 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:44.590
 and I hope to see you soon 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.590
