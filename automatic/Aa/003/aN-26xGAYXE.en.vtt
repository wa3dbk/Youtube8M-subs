non-working model two Super Nintendo and

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.490 
non-working model two Super Nintendo and
I<00:04:30.930> buy<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.440> shit<00:04:31.710> out<00:04:32.250> of<00:04:32.280> broken<00:04:32.880> and

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
I buy the shit out of broken and

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.220 
I buy the shit out of broken and
untested<00:04:35.270> consoles<00:04:36.270> because<00:04:36.630> I<00:04:36.660> always<00:04:36.930> get

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
untested consoles because I always get

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.860 
untested consoles because I always get
amazing<00:04:37.680> deals<00:04:37.860> that<00:04:38.220> way<00:04:38.480> so<00:04:39.480> I'm<00:04:39.540> like<00:04:39.690> yeah

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
amazing deals that way so I'm like yeah

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.900 
amazing deals that way so I'm like yeah
I<00:04:39.900> might<00:04:40.140> be<00:04:40.230> able<00:04:40.350> to<00:04:40.470> fix<00:04:40.680> this<00:04:40.920> they<00:04:41.160> said<00:04:41.430> I

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
I might be able to fix this they said I

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.080 
I might be able to fix this they said I
think<00:04:42.480> they<00:04:42.570> said<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.870> power<00:04:43.110> didn't<00:04:43.560> turn<00:04:43.740> on

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
think they said the power didn't turn on

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.270 
think they said the power didn't turn on
so<00:04:45.110> my<00:04:46.110> gut<00:04:46.290> feeling<00:04:46.590> was<00:04:46.680> go<00:04:46.860> ahead<00:04:46.950> and<00:04:47.160> buy

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
so my gut feeling was go ahead and buy

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.040 
so my gut feeling was go ahead and buy
it<00:04:47.310> let's<00:04:47.610> see<00:04:47.760> what<00:04:47.790> happens<00:04:48.330> I<00:04:48.540> try<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:48.840> with

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
it let's see what happens I try it with

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.930 
it let's see what happens I try it with
the<00:04:49.200> power<00:04:49.410> supply<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:50.100> came<00:04:50.310> with<00:04:50.550> it<00:04:50.580> and

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
the power supply that came with it and

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.450 
the power supply that came with it and
nothing<00:04:51.360> try<00:04:52.080> it<00:04:52.140> with<00:04:52.380> a<00:04:52.650> spare<00:04:53.130> Super

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
nothing try it with a spare Super

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.850 
nothing try it with a spare Super
Nintendo<00:04:53.580> power<00:04:54.030> supply<00:04:54.420> that<00:04:54.720> I<00:04:54.930> did<00:04:55.620> have

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
Nintendo power supply that I did have

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.130 
Nintendo power supply that I did have
laying<00:04:56.160> around<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.790> this<00:04:57.480> bad<00:04:57.720> boy<00:04:57.870> fired

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
laying around and this bad boy fired

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.460 
laying around and this bad boy fired
right<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.470> hell<00:04:58.620> up<00:04:58.800> so<00:04:59.900> more<00:05:00.900> than<00:05:01.050> likely<00:05:01.110> it

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
right the hell up so more than likely it

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.760 
right the hell up so more than likely it
was<00:05:01.530> just<00:05:01.740> a<00:05:01.800> bad<00:05:01.980> power<00:05:02.190> supply<00:05:02.670> and<00:05:03.710> I<00:05:04.710> also

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
was just a bad power supply and I also

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.290 
was just a bad power supply and I also
hit<00:05:07.770> this<00:05:08.010> pit<00:05:08.520> up<00:05:08.640> the<00:05:08.730> cartridge<00:05:09.030> connector

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
hit this pit up the cartridge connector

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.990 
hit this pit up the cartridge connector
with<00:05:09.540> a<00:05:09.600> can<00:05:09.750> of<00:05:09.780> compressed<00:05:09.960> air<00:05:10.410> I<00:05:11.000> figured

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
with a can of compressed air I figured

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.790 
with a can of compressed air I figured
since<00:05:12.270> they<00:05:12.480> got<00:05:12.630> you<00:05:12.990> know<00:05:13.020> dead<00:05:13.410> critters

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
since they got you know dead critters

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.830 
since they got you know dead critters
and<00:05:14.010> this<00:05:14.190> and<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:15.030> controller<00:05:15.450> that<00:05:15.540> came

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
and this and the controller that came

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.590 
and this and the controller that came
with<00:05:15.990> that<00:05:16.020> was<00:05:16.380> gunked<00:05:17.010> the<00:05:17.190> fuck<00:05:17.460> up<00:05:17.730> just

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
with that was gunked the fuck up just

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.980 
with that was gunked the fuck up just
like<00:05:18.720> had<00:05:18.990> goo<00:05:19.320> on<00:05:19.560> it<00:05:19.800> so<00:05:20.720> probably<00:05:21.720> didn't

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
like had goo on it so probably didn't

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.620 
like had goo on it so probably didn't
come<00:05:22.110> from<00:05:22.320> the<00:05:22.500> cleanest<00:05:23.100> of<00:05:23.250> people<00:05:23.880> so

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
come from the cleanest of people so

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.930 
come from the cleanest of people so
their<00:05:24.780> carts<00:05:25.440> were<00:05:25.800> probably<00:05:26.130> in<00:05:26.550> pretty

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
their carts were probably in pretty

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.650 
their carts were probably in pretty
piss-poor<00:05:27.540> shape<00:05:28.170> so<00:05:28.530> I<00:05:28.910> blew<00:05:29.910> that<00:05:29.940> out<00:05:30.360> and

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
piss-poor shape so I blew that out and

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.650 
piss-poor shape so I blew that out and
cleaned<00:05:31.380> it<00:05:31.530> up<00:05:31.650> a<00:05:31.830> little<00:05:32.010> bit<00:05:32.270> stuck<00:05:33.270> a<00:05:33.330> game
