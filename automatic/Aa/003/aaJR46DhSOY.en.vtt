00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.640
 Oh 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.550
 so we like it or not but 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.359
 personally I'm a fan 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.019
 the camaro the typical example of the single meuh 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.150
 because cheap an equipped model comes back 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.949
 less than 50000 euros 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.210
 we took possession here of the 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.329
 version authorizes which is a version 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.190
 collector with decorations that 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.350
 pay tribute to the famous brand of 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.479
 toys but under the hood it stays a 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.510
 adult car with a v8 of 4 132 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:50.609
 horses 6 liters of tumbling is 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.640
 today accompanied with a box 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.300
 six-report mecanism that is taking place 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.769
 pretty good 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:06.630
 the staging is a bit long 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:07.850
 pity ah yes so on the camaro it's a 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.950
 big baby 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.990
 on board we will be very close dice 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.670
 of autumn and despite all the car and 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.770
 behave pretty well on circuit the 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.409
 slightly light direction but the train 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.680
 before is rather catchy and we have a 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.850
 back which seize well must confess 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.850
 that the tires behind its very wide 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.869
 so as soon as we start going very 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.450
 fast on circuit the car succumbs to 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:43.490
 his weight but the behavior is 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:47.189
 frankly very good in the red zone 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.920
 starts at 6000 turns 6200 tons this is 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.020
 little but saw the couple lived myth in has 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.299
 close to 60 meters kg we adapt to it 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.820
 really very much a real favorite 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.860
 this is the case mario 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.010
 a car that really has a joke if 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.370
 and versatile I accelerate really hard 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.110
 with a master within 24 seconds who 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.290
 is very well suspended and they 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.840
 could with a mechanical box so 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.099
 resumes sports car enthusiasts 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.099
 allows a good choice
