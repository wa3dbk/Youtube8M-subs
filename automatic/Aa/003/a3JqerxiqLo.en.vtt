00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
 hey you really are a fan of time 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.430
 adventure 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.430
 I like nothing more than to 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.930
 hello hi friends thank you very much for being 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.000
 with me again and I want to thank you 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.650
 because the video of last week had 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.570
 many reproductions so 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.640
 thanks good today we are going to 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.160
 do something very easy and for all 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.590
 Adventure time lovers are going to 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.660
 love it occurred to me since one day 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.120
 he had paintings and he had a plasticine 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.770
 that dries up and stays super hard and 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.750
 then I said why not do one 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.390
 housing or a case for my phone 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.890
 let's make an end sleeve the human 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.960
 of hour of adventure and the truth I 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.210
 loved the result and effort very much 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.010
 I wanted to aggravate you if you 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.870
 like this idea do not forget to share it 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.970
 please with the entire community of 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.560
 adventurous and with all the javi friends 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.420
 I invite you to subscribe here abajito 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.980
 on the button that says subscribe because 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.470
 every Thursday I'm uploading videos 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.010
 let's see what we need to do this 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.010
 cool day 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.710
 You will need a cover for your phone 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:13.359
 I in this case am using this 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.219
 flexible pasta that I bought it but 

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:16.569
 You can also watch videos on YouTube and 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.670
 they teach you how to do it in a way 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:20.740
 homemade and much cheaper you can also 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.020
 use another type of pasta like pasta 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:32.459
 French cold porcelain or the one you most 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:32.459
 like paintings a brush 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.490
 markers 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.140
 cold or hot silicon 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.530
 clear nail varnish 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.240
 The first thing we will do is take 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:02.400
 our pasta a considerable portion 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.400
 then this will be divided into 2 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.540
 and we will form it into a ball of the most 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.979
 perfect that you can do this this 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.610
 is going to give a nicer finish to 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.610
 our figures 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.430
 now let's take one of them and then 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.500
 with our fingers we will do as 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.120
 this elongated shape as if it were a 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.010
 sausage and until you like the 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.040
 result we will do the same with the 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.040
 other 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.829
 they have to look very similar 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.200
 now we are going to take your cover and in the 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:43.230
 top part let's find the way 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.110
 to hold them with my fingers if they occur 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.110
 I was spreading it to the sheath 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.970
 since I had as a form I put a 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.980
 silicon droplet so that it sticks even 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.690
 more and I put it back in its place 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.690
 so we will do with the other 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.319
 now this must be allowed to dry mine 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.560
 it has to be let out like two or three 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.560
 days 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.230
 since it is dry now take your pencil and 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:25.300
 make some sections that will be for the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.300
 hat for shirt and pants 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.880
 and it is very easy in this part of 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.069
 above obviously we are going to paint it from 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.040
 white color if necessary you can 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.780
 give it two layers but do not exaggerate with 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.260
 this because if you can not coerce the 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.260
 painting 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.200
 we will also paint the navy blue 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.200
 shorts 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.190
 do not forget to also paint the sides 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.900
 and finally I will paint the ten shirt 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.760
 be very careful with the divisions for 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.760
 make this look more neat and nice 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.600
 now this must be left to dry 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.420
 remember that I had told them that we were going 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.340
 to use a black down because it is not 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.080
 recommended because good when doing the 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.810
 lines and then pass the varnish 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.090
 transparent this one ran the ink of 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.010
 down so we better use 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.690
 black paint to make our line 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.980
 it's good when I'm wrong because that's how 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.980
 it does not happen to you 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.270
 since the black paint is dry now 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.340
 yes we are going to pass several layers of 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.350
 transparent varnish this is going to give 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.720
 shine and will make it last longer 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.670
 phone case I gave it three layers 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.670
 but you can give less or many more 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.650
 and ready to little this does not look amazing 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:29.200
 like this video if you're a 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:30.910
 adventurous at heart this idea I like 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.890
 a lot like when we want to give 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.960
 another air to our phone and that 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.880
 see a little more striking I think that 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.560
 this idea is amazing and good because 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.240
 we walk around here I invite you to me 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.980
