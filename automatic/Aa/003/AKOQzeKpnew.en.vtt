00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.680 

what<00:02:18.980> was<00:02:19.099> that<00:02:19.459> that's<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.060> trying<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.420> source

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
what was that that's a trying to source

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.479 
what was that that's a trying to source
I<00:02:20.959> don't<00:02:21.770> think<00:02:21.950> so

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
I don't think so

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:40.550 
I don't think so
this<00:02:23.239> sounds<00:02:23.569> bigger

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.910 

this<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:41.740> how<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:41.950> make<00:02:42.250> dinosaurs<00:02:43.770> this<00:02:44.770> is

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
this is how you make dinosaurs this is

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:54.180 
this is how you make dinosaurs this is
how<00:02:45.100> you<00:02:45.160> play<00:02:45.520> God<00:02:51.870> it's<00:02:52.870> time<00:02:53.140> for<00:02:53.410> how<00:02:53.560> they

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
how you play God it's time for how they

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.290 
how you play God it's time for how they
could<00:02:54.400> talk<00:02:54.520> to<00:02:54.580> each<00:02:54.790> other

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
could talk to each other

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.120 
could talk to each other
so<00:02:56.140> what<00:02:56.260> agree<00:02:56.530> we<00:02:56.710> never<00:02:56.950> imagined<00:02:58.890> they<00:02:59.890> set

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
so what agree we never imagined they set

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.330 
so what agree we never imagined they set
a<00:03:00.160> trap<00:03:02.010> they<00:03:03.010> actually<00:03:03.370> set<00:03:03.550> a<00:03:03.580> trap

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
a trap they actually set a trap

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.710 
a trap they actually set a trap
you<00:03:05.519> probably<00:03:05.849> won't<00:03:06.000> get<00:03:06.150> off<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.330> side<00:03:06.599> of

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
you probably won't get off the side of

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:21.870 
you probably won't get off the side of
the<00:03:06.840> life
