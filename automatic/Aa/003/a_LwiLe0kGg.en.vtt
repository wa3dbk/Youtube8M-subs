this<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.940> best<00:00:06.180> i<00:00:06.359> ever<00:00:06.390> had<00:00:06.629> organelle

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
this is best i ever had organelle

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:20.810 
this is best i ever had organelle
version<00:00:07.859> by<00:00:08.040> gabby<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.490> Arda

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.760 

so<00:00:21.820> you<00:00:21.880> have<00:00:22.330> everything<00:00:22.720> all<00:00:23.439> the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
so you have everything all the

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.800 
so you have everything all the
organelles<00:00:24.400> you're<00:00:24.730> not<00:00:24.910> really<00:00:25.119> that<00:00:25.450> big

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
organelles you're not really that big

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.050 
organelles you're not really that big
you're<00:00:26.800> microscopic<00:00:27.520> you<00:00:27.640> make<00:00:27.849> up

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
you're microscopic you make up

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.390 
you're microscopic you make up
everything<00:00:28.529> everything<00:00:29.529> inside<00:00:29.860> my<00:00:30.040> body<00:00:30.250> I

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
everything everything inside my body I

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.100 
everything everything inside my body I
need<00:00:30.640> to<00:00:30.820> learn<00:00:30.970> about<00:00:31.180> you<00:00:31.540> I<00:00:31.570> swear<00:00:31.869> I'll

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
need to learn about you I swear I'll

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.070 
need to learn about you I swear I'll
learn<00:00:32.259> all<00:00:32.500> the<00:00:32.650> organ<00:00:33.070> up<00:00:33.280> animal<00:00:34.030> cells<00:00:34.449> they

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
learn all the organ up animal cells they

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.470 
learn all the organ up animal cells they
are<00:00:35.290> the<00:00:35.410> best<00:00:35.650> kind<00:00:35.890> Iran<00:00:36.220> they<00:00:36.730> have<00:00:36.970> all<00:00:37.300> the

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
are the best kind Iran they have all the

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.720 
are the best kind Iran they have all the
organized<00:00:38.080> by<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:38.320> central<00:00:38.710> vacuole<00:00:39.100> they

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
organized by the central vacuole they

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.759 
organized by the central vacuole they
don't<00:00:39.910> have<00:00:40.059> classes<00:00:40.660> they<00:00:41.199> don't<00:00:41.410> have<00:00:41.559> cell

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
don't have classes they don't have cell

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.700 
don't have classes they don't have cell
walls<00:00:41.800> but<00:00:42.489> they<00:00:42.640> do<00:00:42.699> have<00:00:43.570> everything<00:00:44.350> else

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710
