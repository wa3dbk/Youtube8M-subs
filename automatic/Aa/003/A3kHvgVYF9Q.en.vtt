Mega Man but then I realized it's
actually<00:00:28.980> not<00:00:29.130> quite<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.609> grim<00:00:29.910> even<00:00:30.689> though

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
actually not quite that grim even though

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.060 
actually not quite that grim even though
she<00:00:30.840> has<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.109> gravitational<00:00:31.679> pull<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.920> deal

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070

with<00:00:32.189> all<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.489> his<00:00:32.550> projectiles<00:00:33.059> are<00:00:33.120> gonna

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
with all of his projectiles are gonna

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.910 
with all of his projectiles are gonna
see<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> lot<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.750> down<00:00:33.989> be<00:00:34.140> from<00:00:34.380> snake<00:00:34.559> yet<00:00:34.800> I

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
see a lot of down be from snake yet I

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.790 
see a lot of down be from snake yet I
would<00:00:35.040> hope<00:00:35.280> at<00:00:35.460> least<00:00:35.489> yes<00:00:36.020> but<00:00:37.020> mega<00:00:37.440> man<00:00:37.620> can

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
would hope at least yes but mega man can

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.229 
would hope at least yes but mega man can
actually<00:00:38.100> just<00:00:38.250> detonate<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> crash<00:00:38.910> bombs

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
actually just detonate the crash bombs

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.630 
actually just detonate the crash bombs
on<00:00:39.420> luma<00:00:39.870> annually<00:00:40.440> that's<00:00:41.129> what<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.370> have

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640

was the one who was breaking that down
first<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.910> little<00:00:45.030> bit<00:00:45.239> last<00:00:45.420> time<00:00:45.750> as<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:46.050> see

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.049 
first a little bit last time as we see
right<00:00:46.440> there<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.370> consistent<00:00:47.879> crash

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
right there and the consistent crash

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.760 
right there and the consistent crash
moms<00:00:48.300> against<00:00:48.660> luma<00:00:48.899> will<00:00:49.050> also<00:00:49.410> be<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> way

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
moms against luma will also be the way

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.650 
moms against luma will also be the way
to<00:00:49.800> take<00:00:50.129> her<00:00:50.280> out<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.760> kill<00:00:51.180> her<00:00:51.300> even<00:00:51.480> if

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
to take her out and kill her even if

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.450 
to take her out and kill her even if
it's<00:00:51.780> not<00:00:51.899> off<00:00:52.050> stage<00:00:52.289> yep<00:00:52.739> even<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.309> not

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
it's not off stage yep even if it's not

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.029 
it's not off stage yep even if it's not
up<00:00:53.760> close<00:00:53.820> yeah<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.320> lot<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.620> characters

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
up close yeah so a lot of characters

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.319 
up close yeah so a lot of characters
like<00:00:56.160> when<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.579> was<00:00:56.640> fighting<00:00:56.879> sneaking<00:00:57.270> up

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
like when I was fighting sneaking up

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.729 
like when I was fighting sneaking up
with<00:00:57.539> balcony<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.109> tried<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.320> rush<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.649> and

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
with balcony I just tried to rush in and

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.380 
with balcony I just tried to rush in and
kill<00:00:58.920> luma<00:00:59.160> as<00:00:59.250> much<00:00:59.399> as<00:00:59.520> possible<00:00:59.640> cuz<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.120> I

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
kill luma as much as possible cuz I I

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.910 
kill luma as much as possible cuz I I
think<00:01:00.809> or<00:01:01.020> thought<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.440> was<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.559> optimal

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
think or thought that was the optimal

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.770 
think or thought that was the optimal
strategy<00:01:02.250> i<00:01:02.399> ended<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:02.699> losing<00:01:02.789> yeah<00:01:03.359> let's

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
strategy i ended up losing yeah let's

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.050 
strategy i ended up losing yeah let's
see<00:01:03.870> if<00:01:03.989> minty<00:01:04.320> from<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:05.010> by<00:01:05.519> attacking<00:01:05.820> from

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
see if minty from I by attacking from

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.000 
see if minty from I by attacking from
afar<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.510> actually<00:01:06.840> pull<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.080> one<00:01:07.229> off<00:01:07.290> so

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
afar can actually pull this one off so

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.380 
afar can actually pull this one off so
far<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.400> looking<00:01:08.490> pretty<00:01:08.820> good<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.000> snakey

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
far it's looking pretty good for snakey

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.940 
far it's looking pretty good for snakey
though<00:01:09.540> as<00:01:09.750> he's<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.229> playing<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.560> matchup

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
though as he's just playing the matchup

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.140 
though as he's just playing the matchup
dealing<00:01:11.220> with<00:01:11.310> those<00:01:11.369> projectiles<00:01:11.820> with<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
dealing with those projectiles with the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.690 
dealing with those projectiles with the
downbeat<00:01:12.799> now<00:01:13.799> minty<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.189> definitely<00:01:14.549> looking

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
downbeat now minty is definitely looking

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.190 
downbeat now minty is definitely looking
very<00:01:14.970> serious<00:01:15.450> right<00:01:15.630> now<00:01:15.780> though<00:01:15.930> definitely

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
very serious right now though definitely

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.170 
very serious right now though definitely
