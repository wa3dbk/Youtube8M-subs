the opening we want to control these
four<00:00:20.880> squares<00:00:21.300> right<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:22.439> know<00:00:22.560> why<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.920> is

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
four squares right you know why that is

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.700 
four squares right you know why that is
when<00:00:24.359> our<00:00:24.390> pieces<00:00:24.720> are<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.170> center<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
when our pieces are in the center of the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.740 
when our pieces are in the center of the
board<00:00:26.010> there's<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:26.970> much<00:00:28.580> I<00:00:29.580> like<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.119> c6

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
board there's so much I like a c6

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.479 
board there's so much I like a c6
because<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.560> center<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:32.040> at<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
because it is in the center but at the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.700 
because it is in the center but at the
same<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.910> guys<00:00:33.239> gonna<00:00:33.480> do<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.870> light<00:00:34.079> now<00:00:34.440> did

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
same you guys gonna do the light now did

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.010 
same you guys gonna do the light now did
you<00:00:34.860> get<00:00:35.010> one<00:00:35.250> t<00:00:35.520> for<00:00:35.550> earlier<00:00:36.480> what<00:00:36.660> any<00:00:36.840> less

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
you get one t for earlier what any less

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.880 
you get one t for earlier what any less
hassle<00:00:37.440> first<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.980> perfect<00:00:38.640> right<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.690> that

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
hassle first is perfect right so that

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.090 
hassle first is perfect right so that
a<00:00:39.950> little<00:00:40.610> bit<00:00:40.730> hard<00:00:40.970> to<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:41.180> leg<00:00:41.360> so<00:00:42.200> 96<00:00:42.950> is

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
a little bit hard to the leg so 96 is

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.340 
a little bit hard to the leg so 96 is
probably<00:00:43.610> though<00:00:43.970> and<00:00:44.210> not<00:00:44.480> our<00:00:44.660> best<00:00:44.840> move<00:00:45.170> in

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
probably though and not our best move in

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.770 
probably though and not our best move in
that<00:00:45.470> position<00:00:45.649> I<00:00:46.190> like<00:00:46.520> to<00:00:46.640> believe<00:00:46.760> in<00:00:47.120> five

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
that position I like to believe in five

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.710 
that position I like to believe in five

right does that make sitel with either

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.950 
right does that make sitel with either
one<00:00:56.629> from<00:00:56.870> 96<00:00:57.440> is<00:00:57.589> okay<00:00:57.920> well<00:00:58.400> maybe<00:00:58.610> not<00:00:58.760> ever

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
one from 96 is okay well maybe not ever

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.140 
one from 96 is okay well maybe not ever
690<00:01:01.960> develops<00:01:02.350> a<00:01:02.739> piece<00:01:03.100> attacks<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:03.850> center

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
690 develops a piece attacks the center

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.920 
690 develops a piece attacks the center
again<00:01:04.390> that<00:01:05.170> would<00:01:05.350> have<00:01:05.440> been<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:06.790> I've<00:01:07.030> you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
right here and there is haha why's

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.830 
right here and there is haha why's
active<00:01:43.000> defense<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:45.670> exactly<00:01:46.150> we<00:01:46.570> want<00:01:46.690> our

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
active defense that exactly we want our

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.050

kids<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.260> be<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:47.470> necessity<00:01:47.620> of<00:01:48.550> battery<00:01:48.850> those

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
kids to be a necessity of battery those

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.970 
kids to be a necessity of battery those
boxes<00:01:49.540> position<00:01:49.960> we<00:01:50.350> know<00:01:50.440> if<00:01:50.530> you<00:01:50.620> pass<00:01:50.830> to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
boxes position we know if you pass to

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.620 
boxes position we know if you pass to
put<00:01:51.130> it<00:01:51.220> out<00:01:51.430> of<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.640> center<00:01:51.910> maybe<00:01:52.090> gets<00:01:52.360> on

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
put it out of the center maybe gets on

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.060 
put it out of the center maybe gets on
in<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:52.810> center<00:01:53.940> with<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.060> face<00:01:55.210> you<00:01:55.650> also<00:01:56.650> the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
in the center with the face you also the

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.160 
in the center with the face you also the
only<00:01:57.220> way<00:01:57.400> to<00:01:57.460> really<00:01:57.700> defend<00:01:58.060> yourself<00:01:58.450> is<00:01:59.110> to

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
only way to really defend yourself is to

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.870 
only way to really defend yourself is to
hit<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.500> other<00:01:59.650> guy<00:01:59.860> so<00:02:00.190> he<00:02:00.310> can't<00:02:00.520> hit<00:02:00.730> you

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
hit the other guy so he can't hit you

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.740 
hit the other guy so he can't hit you
badly<00:02:01.360> so<00:02:01.840> that<00:02:02.590> show<00:02:03.130> maybe<00:02:03.310> so<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:06.330> like<00:02:07.330> this

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
attack in the middle so 95 year because

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.130 
attack in the middle so 95 year because
it<00:02:57.310> attacks<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:57.790> can<00:02:58.150> go<00:02:58.450> together<00:02:58.599> and<00:02:58.959> not

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
it attacks you can go together and not

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.900 
it attacks you can go together and not
in<00:02:59.349> the<00:02:59.379> middle<00:02:59.739> are<00:02:59.829> you<00:02:59.920> show<00:03:00.129> scare<00:03:00.610> than

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
in the middle are you show scare than

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.809 
in the middle are you show scare than
the<00:03:01.000> test<00:03:01.209> okay<00:03:01.360> that<00:03:02.049> you<00:03:02.769> had<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.069> slick<00:03:03.489> dish

which<00:03:05.710> is<00:03:05.830> probably<00:03:06.550> a<00:03:06.790> mistake<00:03:07.030> even<00:03:07.930> though

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
which is probably a mistake even though

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.620
