your Settings button you've got your
camera<00:01:52.439> change<00:01:52.890> both<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.119> can<00:01:54.299> change

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
camera change both so you can change

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.649 
camera change both so you can change
your<00:01:55.079> camera<00:01:55.350> from<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.159> front-facing<00:01:57.149> view

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
your camera from the front-facing view

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.050 
your camera from the front-facing view
to<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.200> bottom<00:01:58.619> face<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.159> view<00:01:59.399> so<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.820> can

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
to the bottom face and view so you can

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.700 
to the bottom face and view so you can
even<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.420> both<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.020> same<00:02:01.229> screen

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
even have both on the same screen

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.690 
even have both on the same screen
for<00:02:01.979> instance<00:02:02.340> here<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.490> flying

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
for instance here so on to the flying

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.290 
for instance here so on to the flying
tutorial<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:07.079> first<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.619> all<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.950> takeoff<00:02:08.429> so

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
tutorial so first of all the takeoff so

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.180 
tutorial so first of all the takeoff so
for<00:02:09.599> takeoff<00:02:09.989> you'll<00:02:10.229> need<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> little<00:02:10.770> space

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
for takeoff you'll need a little space

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.370 
for takeoff you'll need a little space
around<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.790> AR<00:02:12.090> Joe

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.620 

so<00:02:16.380> now<00:02:16.560> when<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.920> consume<00:02:17.430> in<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.700> device<00:02:18.000> so

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
so now when to consume in the device so

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.540 
so now when to consume in the device so
to<00:02:18.690> move<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.110> device<00:02:19.440> forward<00:02:20.100> hold<00:02:20.370> the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
to move the device forward hold the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.220 
to move the device forward hold the
person<00:02:20.730> on<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.120> left<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.570> tilt<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.110> device

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
person on the left and tilt the device

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.270 
person on the left and tilt the device
forward<00:02:23.010> like<00:02:23.460> this<00:02:24.590> now<00:02:25.590> once<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:25.950> do<00:02:26.100> this

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
forward like this now once you do this

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.730 
forward like this now once you do this
the<00:02:26.550> device<00:02:27.240> will<00:02:27.690> automatically<00:02:28.410> move

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
the device will automatically move

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.070 
the device will automatically move
forward<00:02:29.310> now<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.730> move<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.210> device<00:02:30.510> back<00:02:30.810> do

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
forward now to move the device back do

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.860 
forward now to move the device back do
exactly<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.770> same<00:02:32.010> but<00:02:32.670> till<00:02:33.390> their<00:02:33.600> device

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
exactly the same but till their device

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.780 
exactly the same but till their device
for<00:02:35.960> now<00:02:36.960> do<00:02:37.020> exactly<00:02:37.320> in<00:02:37.830> same<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.400> move<00:02:38.610> the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
for now do exactly in same to move the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.949 
for now do exactly in same to move the
device<00:02:39.150> left<00:02:39.540> or<00:02:39.750> right

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.809 

to<00:02:46.959> move<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.410> device<00:02:47.709> up<00:02:47.739> and<00:02:48.069> down<00:02:48.190> use<00:02:48.640> the

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
to move the device up and down use the

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.580 
to move the device up and down use the
analog<00:02:49.239> stick<00:02:49.540> on<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.840> right

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.140 

so<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.650> turn<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.130> device<00:02:56.280> round<00:02:56.760> just<00:02:56.970> do

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
so to turn the device round just do

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.760 
so to turn the device round just do
exactly<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.750> same<00:02:57.840> with<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.319> analog<00:02:58.709> stick

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
exactly the same with the analog stick

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.940 
exactly the same with the analog stick
however<00:02:59.730> this<00:02:59.880> time<00:03:00.209> move<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.170> analog<00:03:01.620> stick

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
however this time move the analog stick

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.460 
however this time move the analog stick
left<00:03:02.280> or<00:03:02.580> right<00:03:02.880> whichever<00:03:03.599> way<00:03:06.110> now<00:03:07.110> on<00:03:07.319> to

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
left or right whichever way now on to

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.680 
left or right whichever way now on to
the<00:03:07.590> final<00:03:07.980> part<00:03:08.190> landing<00:03:08.910> just<00:03:09.270> press<00:03:09.510> the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
the final part landing just press the

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.270 
the final part landing just press the
London<00:03:10.080> burn<00:03:10.260> which<00:03:10.560> choose<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.040> be<00:03:11.160> the

London burn which choose to be the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.340 
London burn which choose to be the
take-off<00:03:11.670> button<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.300> lunch<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:13.080> it<00:03:13.230> will
