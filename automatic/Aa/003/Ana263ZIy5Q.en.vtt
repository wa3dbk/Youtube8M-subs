an okay FPS the engine is old that's one
of<00:01:25.380> my<00:01:25.470> biggest<00:01:25.710> problems<00:01:25.890> they<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.939> guys

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
of my biggest problems they if you guys

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.940 
of my biggest problems they if you guys
don't<00:01:27.270> know<00:01:27.509> if<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.530> some<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.890> are

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
don't know if you if some of you are

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.260 
don't know if you if some of you are
sitting<00:01:29.100> there<00:01:29.280> playing<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.670> going<00:01:29.820> oh<00:01:29.939> god

sitting there playing and going oh god

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.240 
sitting there playing and going oh god
this<00:01:30.509> awfully<00:01:31.229> looks<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.560> modern<00:01:31.829> warfare<00:01:31.979> 2

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
this awfully looks like modern warfare 2

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.520 
this awfully looks like modern warfare 2
you<00:01:32.369> know<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:33.180> very<00:01:33.390> very<00:01:33.659> similar<00:01:33.869> why<00:01:34.079> it's

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
you know it's very very similar why it's

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.899 
you know it's very very similar why it's
because<00:01:34.829> they<00:01:34.950> use<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> same<00:01:35.250> bloody<00:01:35.610> engine

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
because they use the same bloody engine

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.210 
because they use the same bloody engine
that's<00:01:36.090> why<00:01:36.259> they<00:01:37.259> created<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.130> know

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
that's why they created the you know

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.859 
that's why they created the you know
modern<00:01:38.549> warfare<00:01:38.610> free<00:01:39.000> from<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> modern

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
modern warfare free from the modern

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.050 
modern warfare free from the modern
warfare<00:01:40.020> 2<00:01:40.259> engine<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.770> don't<00:01:41.640> know<00:01:41.729> what<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
warfare 2 engine I don't know what the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.310 
warfare 2 engine I don't know what the

and the challenge is obviously winning

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.150

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
that and I think that's pretty cool idea

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.890 
that and I think that's pretty cool idea
and<00:02:54.970> spec<00:02:55.970> ops<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.299> really<00:02:56.540> haven't<00:02:56.690> been

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
and spec ops I really haven't been

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.930 
and spec ops I really haven't been
getting<00:02:57.230> into<00:02:57.440> spec<00:02:57.709> ops<00:02:57.859> I<00:02:57.950> don't<00:02:58.099> care<00:02:58.340> and

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
getting into spec ops I don't care and

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.069 
getting into spec ops I don't care and
the<00:02:59.090> fact<00:02:59.239> that<00:02:59.329> it's<00:02:59.510> two<00:02:59.629> player<00:02:59.870> is

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
the fact that it's two player is

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.839 
the fact that it's two player is
probably<00:03:00.769> why<00:03:00.950> because<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.280> play<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:01.640> shit

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
probably why because I play the shit

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.580 
probably why because I play the shit
load<00:03:02.000> of<00:03:02.030> zombies<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.569> was<00:03:02.720> crap<00:03:02.989> at<00:03:03.109> zombies<00:03:03.470> on

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
load of zombies I was crap at zombies on

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.289 
load of zombies I was crap at zombies on
black<00:03:03.769> ops<00:03:03.950> i'll<00:03:04.129> be<00:03:04.519> honest<00:03:04.730> i<00:03:04.790> was<00:03:04.909> very<00:03:05.030> crap

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
black ops i'll be honest i was very crap

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.690 
black ops i'll be honest i was very crap
I<00:03:05.540> wasn't<00:03:06.530> very<00:03:06.560> good<00:03:06.709> at<00:03:06.920> zombies<00:03:06.950> because

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
I wasn't very good at zombies because

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.580 
I wasn't very good at zombies because
most<00:03:08.390> probably<00:03:08.629> cause<00:03:08.780> of<00:03:08.870> my<00:03:08.930> tactics<00:03:09.349> and

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
most probably cause of my tactics and

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.899 
most probably cause of my tactics and
because<00:03:09.980> zombies<00:03:10.129> just<00:03:10.370> charge<00:03:10.670> that<00:03:10.849> you

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
because zombies just charge that you

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.309 
because zombies just charge that you
like<00:03:11.060> madmen<00:03:11.450> they<00:03:11.629> don't<00:03:11.780> care<00:03:11.930> if<00:03:12.019> they<00:03:12.140> die

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
like madmen they don't care if they die

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.899 
like madmen they don't care if they die

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:12.029 
think that if you have a killstreak it

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:13.249 
think that if you have a killstreak it
should<00:06:12.150> be<00:06:12.270> able<00:06:12.360> to<00:06:12.479> kill<00:06:12.630> anyone<00:06:12.990> on<00:06:13.169> the
