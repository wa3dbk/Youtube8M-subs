I<00:05:30.820> guess<00:05:31.540> let's<00:05:32.290> try<00:05:32.500> it<00:05:32.740> I<00:05:33.210> think<00:05:34.210> I'm<00:05:34.300> gonna

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
I guess let's try it I think I'm gonna

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.830 
I guess let's try it I think I'm gonna
see<00:05:34.720> if<00:05:34.780> I<00:05:34.870> can

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840
