00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
so the second addition palette is

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.930 
so the second addition palette is
obviously<00:02:04.930> very<00:02:05.930> colorful<00:02:06.530> very<00:02:06.920> bright<00:02:07.250> you

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
obviously very colorful very bright you

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.910 
obviously very colorful very bright you
get<00:02:08.119> an<00:02:08.240> array<00:02:08.630> of<00:02:08.660> colors<00:02:09.290> which<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.710> what<00:02:09.890> I

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
get an array of colors which is what I

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.950 
get an array of colors which is what I
like<00:02:10.280> okay<00:02:10.670> I<00:02:10.940> didn't<00:02:11.420> choose<00:02:11.570> the<00:02:11.750> first

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
like okay I didn't choose the first

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.330 
like okay I didn't choose the first
addition<00:02:12.350> just<00:02:12.470> because<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:12.950> wasn't<00:02:13.250> that

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
addition just because it wasn't that

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.190 
addition just because it wasn't that
appealing<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.910> me<00:02:14.030> maybe<00:02:14.210> because<00:02:14.510> it<00:02:14.840> was<00:02:15.050> the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
appealing to me maybe because it was the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.050 
appealing to me maybe because it was the
first<00:02:15.230> edition<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:15.920> not<00:02:16.100> but<00:02:16.640> it's<00:02:16.820> the

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
first edition and not but it's the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.270 
second edition to me this has a little
bit<00:02:19.490> more<00:02:19.670> oomph<00:02:19.910> that<00:02:20.000> I'm<00:02:20.330> looking<00:02:20.480> for

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
bit more oomph that I'm looking for

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.370 
bit more oomph that I'm looking for

to recommend 120 palette this would be

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.750 
to recommend 120 palette this would be
the<00:02:32.660> one<00:02:33.040> even<00:02:34.040> over<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.370> eighty<00:02:34.550> eight's

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760

third edition 120 and that's what it

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.970 
third edition 120 and that's what it
looks<00:02:40.430> like<00:02:40.640> hopefully<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:42.290> camera<00:02:42.530> excuse

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
looks like hopefully the camera excuse

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.740 
looks like hopefully the camera excuse

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
me the lighting is not washing it out

palette just in here there it on camera
it<00:03:11.650> may<00:03:11.830> seem<00:03:12.130> like<00:03:12.310> it's<00:03:12.550> a<00:03:12.610> bunch<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.880> the

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
it may seem like it's a bunch of the

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.290 
it may seem like it's a bunch of the
same<00:03:13.540> kinds<00:03:13.960> of<00:03:14.050> shades<00:03:14.320> but<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:15.490> really<00:03:16.090> get

a nice combination of colors here now
they're<00:03:19.750> very<00:03:19.960> reminiscent<00:03:20.410> of<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.770> palettes

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130
