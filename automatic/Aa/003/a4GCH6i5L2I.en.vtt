okay<00:00:01.560> the<00:00:01.890> next<00:00:02.010> connection<00:00:02.399> we're<00:00:02.639> gonna<00:00:02.760> do

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
okay the next connection we're gonna do

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.710 
okay the next connection we're gonna do
is<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.689> FG<00:00:04.319> not<00:00:04.529> which<00:00:05.069> is<00:00:05.310> similar<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.420> PR

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
is the FG not which is similar to the PR

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.980 
is the FG not which is similar to the PR
not<00:00:06.980> insofar<00:00:07.980> as<00:00:08.160> it<00:00:08.400> only<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.660> single

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
not insofar as it only is the single

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.350 
not insofar as it only is the single
strand<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.559> leader<00:00:11.099> but<00:00:11.700> it's<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:12.059> bit

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
strand and leader but it's a bit

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.470 
strand and leader but it's a bit
different<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:13.080> don't<00:00:13.230> use<00:00:13.440> at<00:00:13.590> all<00:00:13.769> it's<00:00:14.160> just

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
different you don't use at all it's just

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.240 
different you don't use at all it's just
tension<00:00:15.480> wrap<00:00:15.839> around<00:00:16.199> your<00:00:16.619> hands<00:00:16.949> like<00:00:17.220> a

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
tension wrap around your hands like a

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.700 
tension wrap around your hands like a
Chinese<00:00:18.000> thumb<00:00:18.300> trap<00:00:18.600> kind<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.320> range<00:00:19.529> but

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
Chinese thumb trap kind of a range but

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.380 
Chinese thumb trap kind of a range but
the<00:00:19.800> harder<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.250> pull<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.490> top<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.210> line

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
the harder you pull the top of the line

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.050 
the harder you pull the top of the line
vice<00:00:21.689> gets<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.260> leader<00:00:22.640> so<00:00:23.640> what<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.820> do<00:00:23.939> is

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
vice gets the leader so what you do is

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.810 
vice gets the leader so what you do is
you<00:00:24.150> get<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.650> folded<00:00:25.650> over<00:00:25.740> section<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.730> your

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
you get a folded over section of your

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.029 
you get a folded over section of your
braid<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.300> you're<00:00:27.420> trying<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.689> join<00:00:28.039> put

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
braid that you're trying to join put

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.220 
braid that you're trying to join put
that<00:00:29.189> over<00:00:29.310> your<00:00:29.490> thumb<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.679> forefinger<00:00:31.969> then

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
that over your thumb and forefinger then

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.569 
that over your thumb and forefinger then
make<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> little<00:00:34.469> triangle<00:00:34.770> there<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.399> then

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
make a little triangle there and then

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.479 
make a little triangle there and then
after<00:00:36.380> the<00:00:37.380> two<00:00:37.559> strands<00:00:37.890> down<00:00:38.160> over<00:00:38.340> your

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
after the two strands down over your

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.709 
after the two strands down over your
little<00:00:38.700> finger<00:00:38.940> there<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.210> just<00:00:39.329> lock<00:00:39.540> that

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
little finger there and just lock that

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.729 
little finger there and just lock that
in<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.559> get<00:00:40.950> plenty<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.610> tension<00:00:42.739> across

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
in so you get plenty of tension across

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.090 
in so you get plenty of tension across
your<00:00:44.010> thumb<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.280> forefinger

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
your thumb and forefinger

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.570 
your thumb and forefinger
like<00:00:46.520> that

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.940 

grab<00:00:52.150> the<00:00:52.300> end<00:00:52.450> of<00:00:52.600> your<00:00:52.690> leader

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
grab the end of your leader

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.150 
grab the end of your leader
that<00:00:54.400> goes<00:00:54.580> in<00:00:55.330> through<00:00:55.660> underneath<00:00:56.560> the<00:00:56.860> the

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
that goes in through underneath the the

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.480 
that goes in through underneath the the
braid<00:00:57.940> and<00:00:58.780> then<00:00:58.900> you<00:00:59.020> twist<00:00:59.770> the<00:00:59.920> braid<00:01:00.130> over

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.490 
braid and then you twist the braid over

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.660 
braid and then you twist the braid over
and<00:01:01.450> hook<00:01:01.660> it<00:01:01.840> back<00:01:01.960> through<00:01:02.260> then<00:01:03.160> twist<00:01:03.520> the

braid back again so his little
crisscross<00:01:06.550> pattern<00:01:06.940> happening<00:01:07.240> we<00:01:08.020> do<00:01:08.140> that

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
crisscross pattern happening we do that

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.420 
crisscross pattern happening we do that

as I go Western and pull tight it's

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.030 
as I go Western and pull tight it's
getting<00:01:39.150> little<00:01:39.540> constant<00:01:40.320> crisscross<00:01:40.830> is

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
getting little constant crisscross is

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.280 
getting little constant crisscross is
going<00:01:41.280> all<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.490> way<00:01:41.640> down<00:01:42.020> later<00:01:43.020> there's

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
going all the way down later there's

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.480 
going all the way down later there's
little<00:01:43.950> bits<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.220> gaps<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.760> there<00:01:44.990> between<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
little bits of gaps in there between the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.859 
little bits of gaps in there between the
braids<00:01:47.490> but<00:01:48.030> that's<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.300> lot<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> problem<00:01:48.810> as

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
braids but that's a lot a problem as

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.960 
braids but that's a lot a problem as
long<00:01:48.930> as<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.350> biking<00:01:49.799> nice<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.580> tight<00:01:50.759> as

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
long as it's biking nice and tight as

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.380 
long as it's biking nice and tight as
you<00:01:51.090> go<00:01:51.320> it'll<00:01:52.320> all<00:01:52.440> lock<00:01:52.710> down<00:01:52.979> really<00:01:53.759> well

there's<00:02:29.700> where<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.909> lines<00:02:30.180> locked<00:02:30.480> around

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:30.749 
there's where the lines locked around

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:32.300 
there's where the lines locked around
our<00:02:30.900> finger

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.250 

well<00:03:47.970> I'm<00:03:48.120> truly<00:03:48.420> going<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.659> lock<00:03:48.810> that<00:03:48.840> down

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
well I'm truly going to lock that down

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.640 
well I'm truly going to lock that down
to<00:03:50.129> finish<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.819> off<00:03:50.909> and<00:03:51.299> then<00:03:51.659> we<00:03:51.900> all<00:03:52.439> type

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:03.880 

Michael<00:03:56.489> but<00:03:56.730> no<00:03:57.470> it's<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.530> really<00:03:58.680> big<00:03:59.250> need

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.760 

then<00:04:04.460> as<00:04:04.760> before<00:04:05.240> then<00:04:06.110> we<00:04:06.200> move<00:04:06.380> our<00:04:06.560> hitches

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
then as before then we move our hitches

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:43.410 
then as before then we move our hitches
onto<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.400> main<00:04:07.850> line

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.750 

so<00:04:43.990> we've<00:04:44.110> got<00:04:44.260> that<00:04:44.380> little<00:04:44.650> bit<00:04:44.830> of<00:04:44.860> pitching

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
so we've got that little bit of pitching

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.580 
so we've got that little bit of pitching
down<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.120> main<00:04:46.300> part<00:04:46.930> of<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.110> braid<00:04:47.320> line

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
down the main part of the braid line

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.800 
down the main part of the braid line
there<00:04:47.830> to<00:04:48.010> protect<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.970> braid<00:04:49.240> against<00:04:49.540> the

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
there to protect the braid against the

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.870 
there to protect the braid against the
end<00:04:50.140> of<00:04:50.260> the<00:04:50.320> leader<00:04:52.020> cut<00:04:53.020> off<00:04:53.140> our<00:04:53.580> tag<00:04:54.580> on<00:04:54.790> the

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
end of the leader cut off our tag on the

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.330 
end of the leader cut off our tag on the
braid

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:22.340 

and<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:00.760> later<00:05:01.000> their<00:05:05.790> face

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.170 

so<00:05:22.980> we<00:05:23.100> end<00:05:23.280> up<00:05:23.370> with<00:05:23.490> a<00:05:23.550> nice<00:05:23.670> neat<00:05:23.730> little

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
so we end up with a nice neat little

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.540 
so we end up with a nice neat little
finish<00:05:24.540> to<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:24.780> knot

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.130 

nice<00:05:28.550> again<00:05:29.360> smooth<00:05:30.050> not<00:05:30.350> no<00:05:31.600> no<00:05:32.600> pictures<00:05:32.990> in

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
nice again smooth not no no pictures in

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.170 
nice again smooth not no no pictures in
the<00:05:33.230> main<00:05:33.410> line<00:05:33.650> so<00:05:33.950> it<00:05:34.070> goes<00:05:34.220> very<00:05:34.460> smoothly

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
the main line so it goes very smoothly

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.960 
the main line so it goes very smoothly
and<00:05:35.390> easily<00:05:35.600> through<00:05:36.020> the<00:05:36.050> guides<00:05:36.320> and<00:05:36.970> very

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
and easily through the guides and very

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.610 
and easily through the guides and very
very<00:05:38.210> strong<00:05:38.300> not<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:38.900> harder<00:05:39.170> you<00:05:39.230> pull<00:05:39.440> the

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
very strong not the harder you pull the

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.310 
very strong not the harder you pull the
tighter<00:05:39.800> and<00:05:40.040> fights
