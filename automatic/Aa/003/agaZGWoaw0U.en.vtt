00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.700
 I have been here since childhood it is expected that the dynamic growth 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.759
 who taught the fisherman's house 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:11.709
 for bass fishing as artificial baits 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:12.940
 you can use 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.539
 various models and what types of baits 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.050
 that act have different depths 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.310
 in the case of sea bass fishing in rivers and mangroves specifically on the river 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.130
 I'll give you 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.559
 we separate some rescue models you can succeed 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.689
 Let's start talking. 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.760
 of the baits that acted on the surface that cause much more adrenalin the fisherman 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.830
 in case 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.790
 in this question 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.000
 rc stretches it from the cup and a string to pj quite used as you are seeing 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.440
 another stick model and that in addition team it is a pop it has a 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.180
 little mouth 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.420
 and our known tics and tried to account for 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.920
 the institutes are the ones that imitate one by this wound swimming in the surface 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.310
 What's the rush? 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.140
 is much easier to catch by the predator 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.990
 another that can be very efficient surface 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.190
 it's the baits 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.500
 learn to work on this list and you will be very successful in 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.870
 part of the snooks here we separate the two tokyo lists that are the 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.280
 Sensation of the moment 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.829
 the nervous of death 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:15.570
 Aunt Bill had given and told 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.149
 another was surface 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.190
 I work very efficiently 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.780
 are the poppers here in the case I separated as 44 mre also voluble 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.930
 the half water baits 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.140
 very easy to work with 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.350
 some possessing 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.490
 short novel 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.030
 middle barb and even the dewlap are long 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.020
 let's emphasize some half water baits 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.970
 which we are having a lot of success 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.940
 Here's the swimsuit pms 70 davi told 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.580
 the order we put a little horn to make art 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.250
 the work of pop 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.900
 here we have a full of slowing the blade 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.560
 in the same way with a horn 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.430
 a poor 13 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.000
 with Cyprus also 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.520
 and this one here that is killing the cock 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.770
 which is a persistent ipi 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.030
 morale is the third floor to the rear 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.420
 the same way we have here still take the floor 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.389
 5 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:09.539
 arrives suddenly 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.619
 with a horn 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.169
 and one more in the right model and also with Cyprus 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.849
 still out of these here we stand out too 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.040
 the lawyer 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.130
 of the butterfly I want to emphasize this list that was the deadly killer 'killer and 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.120
 stick to it 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.579
 It is a brastemp of falling wall 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.200
 to where we suppressed the garate to bring the 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.150
 we put a little horn and so she has a much larger fluctuation than she 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.780
 originally the half-water baits are very productive 

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:45.049
 in the course of the day sometimes or fish is no longer attacking you so you 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.759
 will do what you are going to leave for a suspended bait a bottom bait 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:52.790
 several are the striped patterns 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.299
 in this case, we must emphasize 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.279
 specifically this model 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:58.919
 of the cultivar brand 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:03.629
 where we have several programs, we have demonstrated its efficiency and 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.119
 Suape and stay 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:09.299
 Another model of suspended baits is the artificial shrimps where 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.899
 originally it comes with a ballast making so suspended route 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:17.729
 another model of escaping rubber passing to these background is the 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:18.749
 own shrimp 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:21.069
 To order we put a head of giggs 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.040
 and he passed the comic book with 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.449
 a bottom bait 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.549
 another model of bait where the kingdom of tap having very successful 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:29.879
 It's a giggs head. 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.689
 trailer of sherlock that look alike 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:36.680
 with more natural gas at the level of the region's active 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.709
 little cabbage 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.930
 these were some of the criticisms that we use 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.219
 in this fishery observe the nature 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:48.779
 determined moment of the day the fish begins to feed on small baits 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:54.039
 we started to use and these small formatted mother showers and small 

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:55.489
 sardines 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.239
 if the fish begin to feed on larger prey 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.529
 then you should enjoy this rapisca the largest so you have enough 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:06.890
 success in your fishery with this fateful one is just you to spend here in the 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.949
 feature als get some sparse and go fishing
