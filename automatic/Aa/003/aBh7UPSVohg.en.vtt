 they received their missions from a 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.119
 machine called tiger type that I do not 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.770
 I know her name in Portuguese then. 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.650
 Let's stay with the father that's saying. 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.900
 which rewards several targets for him now 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.580
 order that they will recover the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.450
 decided to enter the business of 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.310
 investigations 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.560
 instead of following a single story to the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.689
 The full length adventure game brings a 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.060
 series of separate missions but 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.490
 relate to each other in which to pretend 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.860
 He had to travel the river kingdoms to 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.259
 solve mysteries attack time 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.829
 set in the middle of the sixth season of 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.509
 series 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.030
 the game will have a greater focus on 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.399
 investigations of targets and the same action will be 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.229
 an adventure with many others that 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.210
 have around now changing 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.920
 completely of subject you should be 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.189
 wondering, will I need it? 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.750
 turn these things on then it was not 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.790
 released the requirements for the game 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.729
 after the game was released released the 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.009
 game design recently but the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.540
 game to be very light very light even 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.820
 any need to play 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.190
 I think you can not guarantee anything 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.660
 15 teams arrive in stores this fall 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.190
 But do not count on it, it does not always have 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.290
 that base pass 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.420
 I will not leave you a trailer of 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.910
 20 seconds and released from the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.890
 game design give more dimension to say 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.930
 what is the idea of â€‹â€‹the game and how does the game go 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.640
 be in some movements that are a 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.320
 a little weird but this will be 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.290
 That's the answer, and if you liked 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.820
