00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.910
 according to the inail in 2007 the victims at work fell by 6% 1260 people 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.200
 they lost the lives of which 1100 30 in the industry work accidents are 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:25.140
 900 were 13,000 that 500 less than in past years but still too many if yes 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.970
 he thinks they could be avoided and the risks should not be considered minor 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.260
 deriving from the use of portable ladders, the spisal takes care of stairs 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.940
 laptops we have identified for years 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.390
 that many fatal injuries and even those with permanent sequelae determines 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.210
 are determined by the use of this equipment 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.960
 portable ladders are widespread in all work environments in 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.720
 particularly in the building industry metalworking brands and these injuries 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.380
 composed - 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.690
 others feel they are both employers and workers, and that is a lot 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.720
 important the same text only arriba surroundings 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.140
 a strong concert when you can since the portable ladders are a press 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.030
 not sure and you have to work when you're up 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.520
 use other safer equipment 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.710
 the use of the portable ladder is widespread not only for employees 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.090
 to the works 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.060
 but also among the do-it-yourself people who must be aware deinde 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.340
 risk running 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.240
 you know how it should be used 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.550
 used autostar that usually in the living environment in the workplace 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:31.830
 at the double staircase 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.600
 In this case we have a double aluminum ladder 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.000
 its features are 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.900
 non-slip feet 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.410
 presence of a step from the terminal with the possibility to climb one 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.420
 parapet 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.420
 centumcellae how nice to be in church during the opening phase as far as 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.360
 concerns the supporting stairs called wall things 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.880
 it is important to indicate that the scale is given to be around 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.990
 base equal a quarter of the defense 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.610
 besides the important minds are arranged travel structure or at the base in 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.120
 height 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.940
 and the fact that the auction must spouse at least one meter beyond the sex plan 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.500
 especially in the home environment there are small steps 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.099
 transformable ask stairs dupli become 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.489
 scales after another these points are usually theses 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:23.039
 the attachment points that can become dangerous 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:27.289
 and another important thing to consider is the correct functioning of the scale 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:31.029
 put on the scale a verse if positioned upside down it can become 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:32.169
 source of danger 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:36.040
 when possible as an alternative to portable decoders to be used in 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:39.069
 work environment the so-called bridge on wheels 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.169
 what bike you pizarro foundling this element this better than stature is 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:45.479
 safe as long as it is correctly assembled 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:46.659
 and it means 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.910
 railing on the work area with a higher current 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.910
 currents between middle toe board 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.809
 access from inside with ladder opening hatch 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.029
 braking system the base 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.339
 of course in the use of portable stairs always load-bearing go up and 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:06.859
 always go down with the face turned towards the climb and with the hands on the pegs 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.599
 it is never on the mutants there are rules that regulate the use of the stairs 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.259
 portable here only text to resume all the existing merit legislation 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:17.260
 to portable ladders defining 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.870
 that should be used only in some situations and in these situations with the 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.540
 modalities that we have just explained the Veneto region welcomes bilateral bodies 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.610
 intend to distribute information material 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.490
 to feel unsafe portable ladders but always remember not to 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.310
 use them if you can aba green other equipment so there is xd in life 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.740
 comes down and there are those who come up
