by<00:03:42.480> having<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.870> climbing<00:03:43.440> angle<00:03:43.590> on<00:03:43.859> it<00:03:43.889> if<00:03:44.400> you

climbing angle means the leading edge of

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.300 
climbing angle means the leading edge of
your<00:03:48.239> blade<00:03:48.450> is<00:03:48.810> higher<00:03:49.319> which<00:03:49.889> allows<00:03:50.160> the
