 they are all my name is uribe back and 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.390
 we are reunited once again for another 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.130
 new video and today we are here 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.110
 for a new episode of uribe decks 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.330
 this series that had already left quite 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.550
 pretty forgotten, I've already been almost there 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.279
 six months with uploading an episode a lot 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.710
 time but good family this the day of 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.409
 Today we are going to talk about growing 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.390
 pokemon number 448 of the pokédex 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.589
 national is a pokémon that came out in 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.579
 fourth generation is a pokémon 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.519
 legendary 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:33.280
 weighs 85 kilos and measures a meter 50 and is 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.800
 considered the lunar pokemon to grow is 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.450
 of pure and good psychic type is a 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.460
 pokémon that to me personally 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.860
 love this time we're going to talk 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.170
 of the oriented to the double combats but 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.980
 well that we'll talk about later 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.750
 good in terms of skills 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.640
 possible that may have grow already 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.100
 grow can only have the 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.780
 levitation skill that is a 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.329
 ability that allows us to be immune 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.850
 totally to ground type attacks 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.110
 that's good, that's pretty good, it's not 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.450
 a bad skill is not a 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.670
 skill that comes to you perfect cheesemaking 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.899
 but it's not a bad skill at most 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.490
 absolute minimum on the contrary is a 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.250
 pretty good skill like 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.470
 in terms of its etymology or where 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.270
 comes his name because the word grows 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.430
 the comes from grow that is a word 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.220
 in English that means crescent 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.979
 referring to this phase of the moon and in 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.649
 the ending celia probably 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.970
 comes from that ln who is the goddess 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.039
 Greek of the moon 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.630
 all this obviously referring to 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.880
 Well, the moon, as it would grow, is the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.409
 pokemon lunar and well let's go to the part 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.289
 that are probably more interested in 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.149
 all of you who is the musel or the 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:41.380
 strategy so that it would be this time was 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:43.360
 oriented to vgc to vgc format or to doubles 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.299
 les mobbing as you want to fight 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.069
 doubles can you say this is a 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.830
 strategy that I used or that I like 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.420
 much in used or I really like to use in 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.110
 fifth generation but in this sixth 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.270
 generation 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.369
 I imagine that it serves perfectly well 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.840
 and I do not think there are many changes and 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.299
 I'm sure it can also serve you 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.890
 Knowing the good utility as I told you 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.659
 previously, growing up is a Pokémon that 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.060
 I love it for its great big 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.250
 defensive capabilities that's why I 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.170
 like a lot and good about the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.490
 movements that we will put this will be 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.350
 a growing dual screen 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.610
 will put and put screens to receive 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.380
 less damage and it will also be 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.450
 we can use it to put trick 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.740
 room if we wish and good as it is 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.810
 a dual screen air grow 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.330
 obviously first of all you will have 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.370
 reflex and light screen as your two 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.470
 movements his first two movements 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.570
 this is the movement is an attack by 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.000
 is that it can be psychic or psycho 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.710
 load is what you want that I leave it to 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.750
 like everyone and as the fourth 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.180
 movement we can put reinforcement or 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.700
 Weird space also depends on each 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.440
 who if you want to make it integrate 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.150
 a weird space team and make him 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.610
 put the weird space can put that 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.260
 weird space and if on the other hand I 'm not 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.680
 very interested in this type of equipment 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.960
 with this control he puts that 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.140
 reinforcement and there is no problem the 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.270
 nature will be serene or rude 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.540
 serene in case you do not want it 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.400
 for a weird space team because the 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.590
 nature serenates low attack you 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.150
 up the special and rude defense if the 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.500
 you want for a weird space team 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.630
 because that way we can lower the 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.400
 speed and climb in the special defense 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.080
 because remember that in a team of 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.510
 weird space you always have to try to 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.550
 be as slow as possible since the 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.500
 rare space invests in the order of 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.860
 shifts in the slowest go first and 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.090
 the fastest go to the end although the 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.100
 priority move then they continue 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.990
 having the same priority 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.060
 also as I told you to grow already 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.040
 we love we make a very defensive pokémon 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.810
 both physically and especially have 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.210
 excellent excellent defenses hp 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.760
 I think it's my favorite dual screener of 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.350
 all the game and good however not 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.300
 everything is rosy and this brings us 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.240
 the counter would grow, that is, the 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.900
 pokemon that can stop it or stop it 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.370
 and good one of them and probably one 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.070
 of the biggest with interest to grow 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.570
 is already digging jr since by its type there 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.710
 we can do anything, we can not 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.120
 touch this and he can get us attack 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.010
 super cash from bug type and 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.720
 eliminate us eliminate us without much 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.220
 problem besides that we are in a 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.230
 lome trigger device will be more 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.520
 fast that we undoubtedly and 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.440
 good in general is gentleman can 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.060
 trust very easily grows already and another 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.890
 it's pokemon that also with tian very 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.230
 easy to grow already in general are from 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.910
 sinister type pokemon since the 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.560
 sinister type pokemon to be immune 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.180
 to the attacks of psychic type we 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.370
 can easily be removed if we do not have 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.200
 some attack that is not psychic 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.050
 come to have an attack that is not of type 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.030
 psychic as it grows it does not attack very 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.410
 strong that we say the only option that 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.180
 we could have to try to eliminate 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.419
 a pokemon of sinister type concrete 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.520
 would be putting him toxic for example but 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.500
 in general you can find it easily 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.750
 and good also something else that can 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.180
 stop very easily to grow is already the 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.800
 move mock down since this 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.169
 movement prevents us from doing 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.060
 movements that are not done 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.759
 damage to the opponent so if for example you 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.770
 you put a movement to regenerate 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.539
 life that is her because no it is not going to 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.009
 you will not be able to use it you are not going to 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.080
 be able to put light screens we are going to 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.789
 This TICLE to use ingenuity you do not go 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.250
 to be able to use any movement that does not 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.320
 be to hurt then a mockery 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.180
 also with I love you so much I would grow up and 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.710
 also in general the pokemon that 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.780
 like it very much if you allow a 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.220
 pokémon start to like a lot despite 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.560
 that he declined is very defensive going to 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.030
 finish eliminate eliminating you forgiveness 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.250
 so you also have to have a lot 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.449
 Be careful with that and well that's all 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.580
 about growing already but before finishing 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.259
 simpson very short I'm uribe of c's 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.520
 but well before finishing I would like 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.949
 tell them that the movements that I 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.840
 I said are not the only ones have many 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:42.270
 other movements that you can put 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.630
 example there is if wayne some kind of haydn 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.710
 power under wave or toxic can you put 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.930
 a great truth of very micros 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.880
 obviously in the world that I gave them 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.130
 it occurs to us to use it in zinc in singles 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.560
 or in individual battles because they do not 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.180
 is going to serve a lot of good I do not know if after 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.280
 to serve only do not go to put 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.550
 reinforcement better use it if you want it will be 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:06.490
 as for you but I recommend it more 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.800
 focused on double fighting a lot 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.540
 more works very well and if we are going to give it 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.150
 in singles I do not know if maybe another one already 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.910
 I raise a level of experts now that 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.110
 would be in individual matches because if 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.420
 I did it right here in this episode 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.460
 It would be very long but it would also be used 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.170
 in singles in no problem but with 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.060
 an object a little different from the one that 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.160
 I said rather you have to put the 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.320
 movements like moonlight probably 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.870
 toxic and have wave more than anything toxic 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.670
 it could be useful but in short 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.620
 comics that I will not leave for another possible 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.510
 episode I hope you liked this 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.430
 chapter of an excessive level so it does not 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.230
 forget to give it a like to leave me a 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.210
 Comment please with sting 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.620
 telling me that pokemon we would like to see 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.090
 in the next episode homies and good 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.870
 that's all for today and as always 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.870
 I say alavesa dance 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:54.360
 13 a level 3 is the best and pokemon will 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.940
 despite the fact that it offers this beautiful channel 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.280
 little by little grows come come closer 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:02.580
 good bite just is not going sometimes was 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.890
 receive 13 uribe 13 if you listen to that 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.410
 name you better you pray this 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.630
 beautiful channel little by little grow 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.249
 come closer I do not bite good only I do it to 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.049
 times 

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:15.839
 and good homies like you surely 

00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:17.519
 you know at the end of the videos of these 

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:19.349
 uribe review videos like to leave them 

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:21.839
 some curiosities about the pokemon in 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:23.729
 question and good about will grow I found 

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:25.769
 So many curiosities but I found two 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:28.499
 very interesting the first of them that 

00:07:25.769 --> 00:07:30.659
 is that it would grow loose to some objects or 

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:33.689
 drop some objects called pens 

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:35.279
 I imagine that you will know them without 

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:37.259
 However, despite this, growth is no longer 

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:39.569
 it has feathers which is extremely rare 

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:41.069
 but anyway and also another curiosity 

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:42.719
 that I found to grow and that is one 

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:45.479
 of the only seven legendary pokémon 

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:48.089
 that have gender because all the 

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:49.199
 grow up they are already females then it is one of 

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:51.149
 the only seven of legendary pokémon 

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:52.529
 with gender I do not know which ones are 

00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:54.599
 we imagine that it is not dairy 

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:55.889
 others must be dairy and the others do not 

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:57.779
 agreement right now which can be 

00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:59.579
 but good with my wings and that was it 

00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:01.469
 for this in this video I hope there 

00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:05.029
 liked a lot down here confiscated them 

00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:05.029
 iter and as I always say there is the time
