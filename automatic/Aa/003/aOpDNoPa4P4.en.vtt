00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
let us read a question it was us who had

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.430 
let us read a question it was us who had
left<00:00:10.980> before<00:00:11.219> he<00:00:11.519> arrived<00:00:12.019> the<00:00:13.019> underlying

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.790 
us who had left again us who had left
and<00:00:25.410> me<00:00:25.920> who<00:00:26.099> ended<00:00:26.810> so<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.260> first<00:00:28.619> choice

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
and me who ended so it's a first choice

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.200 
and me who ended so it's a first choice
we<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.340> kiss<00:00:29.609> between<00:00:29.869> us<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.260> B<00:00:31.940> so<00:00:32.940> if<00:00:33.180> we

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
we have a kiss between us and B so if we

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.389 
we have a kiss between us and B so if we
go<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.860> this<00:00:34.860> page<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.460> think<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.660> world

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
go to this page and think that the world

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.400 
go to this page and think that the world
was<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.000> form<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.570> team<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:41.600> to<00:00:42.600> be<00:00:42.629> requires

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
was is a form of team and to be requires

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.060 
was is a form of team and to be requires
the<00:00:44.399> case<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> same<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.230> either<00:00:46.590> side

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
the case to be the same on either side

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.910 
the case to be the same on either side
of<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:48.360> if<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.980> is<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.670> subject<00:00:50.910> case

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
of it so if it is in the subject case

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.740 
of it so if it is in the subject case
then<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> other<00:00:53.309> side<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:54.329> must<00:00:54.510> have

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
then on the other side we must have

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.750 
then on the other side we must have
another<00:00:54.960> pronoun<00:00:55.410> which<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.710> also<00:00:55.890> used<00:00:56.550> as<00:00:56.730> a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
another pronoun which is also used as a

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.060 
another pronoun which is also used as a
subject<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.989> from<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.320> table<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:58.800> see<00:00:59.039> that

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
subject but from the table we see that

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.680 
subject but from the table we see that
us<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.969> always<00:01:00.390> used<00:01:00.870> as<00:01:01.109> an<00:01:01.440> object<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:03.480> we

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
us is always used as an object so we

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.710 
us is always used as an object so we
must<00:01:03.960> come<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.860> comply<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.580> rule<00:01:05.850> we

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
must come to comply with this rule we

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.870 
must come to comply with this rule we
must<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:07.350> B<00:01:08.119> so<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.299> takes<00:01:09.570> us<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.820> making<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
must have B so this takes us to making a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.940 
must have B so this takes us to making a
choice<00:01:12.150> between<00:01:13.970> options<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.960> options

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
choice between options a and options

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.880 
choice between options a and options
option<00:01:17.880> B<00:01:19.909> now

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
option B now

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.720 
option B now
in<00:01:23.550> between<00:01:24.480> two<00:01:24.660> options<00:01:25.310> let's<00:01:26.310> look<00:01:26.550> at<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
in between two options let's look at the

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.910 
in between two options let's look at the
tents<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.230> had<00:01:28.650> left<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.510> had<00:01:30.510> arrived

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
tents we have had left and had arrived

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.600 
tents we have had left and had arrived
we<00:01:31.920> had<00:01:32.040> had<00:01:32.280> left<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.910> Here<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.510> am<00:01:34.550> now<00:01:35.550> we

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
we had had left and Here I am now we

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.690 
we had had left and Here I am now we
have<00:01:35.910> two<00:01:36.180> instances<00:01:36.750> two<00:01:37.400> events<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.580> are

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
have two instances two events that are

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.420 
have two instances two events that are
happening<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.270> past<00:01:40.130> arriving<00:01:41.130> and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
happening in the past arriving and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.580 
happening in the past arriving and
leaving<00:01:45.170> leaving<00:01:46.170> happens<00:01:46.770> before<00:01:47.520> arriving

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
leaving leaving happens before arriving

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.530 
leaving leaving happens before arriving
so<00:01:49.590> leaving<00:01:49.830> must<00:01:50.190> use<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.790> past<00:01:51.090> perfect

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
so leaving must use the past perfect

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:59.120 
so leaving must use the past perfect
tense<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:56.960> arriving<00:01:57.960> must<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.530> expressed<00:01:58.740> in

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
tense and arriving must be expressed in

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.560 
tense and arriving must be expressed in
simple<00:01:59.940> past

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.040 

thus<00:02:03.570> option<00:02:04.050> a<00:02:04.230> is<00:02:04.530> ruled<00:02:04.830> out<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:06.750> correct

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
thus option a is ruled out the correct

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.310 
thus option a is ruled out the correct
answer<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.410> option<00:02:07.680> D<00:02:08.540> now<00:02:09.540> let<00:02:10.020> us<00:02:10.050> do<00:02:10.290> a

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
answer is option D now let us do a

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.730 
answer is option D now let us do a
little<00:02:10.440> bit<00:02:10.710> of<00:02:10.830> recap<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.400> look<00:02:11.580> at<00:02:11.730> other

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
little bit of recap and look at other

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.670 
little bit of recap and look at other
from<00:02:13.740> which<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.250> concept<00:02:14.820> might<00:02:15.000> be<00:02:15.180> asked

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
from which this concept might be asked

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.640 
from which this concept might be asked
one<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:17.100> comparison<00:02:18.320> instead<00:02:19.320> of<00:02:19.440> two

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
one is of comparison instead of two

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.400 
one is of comparison instead of two
Bayes<00:02:19.860> rule<00:02:19.890> applies<00:02:20.670> also<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.890> as

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
Bayes rule applies also for that and as

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.940 
Bayes rule applies also for that and as
we<00:02:25.410> always<00:02:25.590> say<00:02:25.800> he<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.190> taller<00:02:26.490> than<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.910> am<00:02:27.270> and

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
we always say he is taller than I am and

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.440 
we always say he is taller than I am and
not<00:02:28.950> he's<00:02:29.160> taller<00:02:29.400> than<00:02:29.489> me

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.050 

and<00:02:33.620> also<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.830> might<00:02:35.010> want<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.370> refer<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.730> this
