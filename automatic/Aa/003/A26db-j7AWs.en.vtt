00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
and now let's go it's been doing it

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.549 
and now let's go it's been doing it
since<00:00:11.490> recently<00:00:12.360> or<00:00:12.900> have<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.200> been<00:00:13.320> doing

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
since recently or have you been doing

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:13.730 
since recently or have you been doing
that

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
that

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.480 
that
Robbie<00:00:13.920> you're<00:00:14.040> just<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.280> bit<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.580> show-off

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
Robbie you're just a bit of a show-off

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.609 
Robbie you're just a bit of a show-off
we've<00:00:17.490> found<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.420> transmission<00:00:19.230> hasn't

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
we've found that the transmission hasn't

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.970 
we've found that the transmission hasn't
been<00:00:19.710> quite<00:00:19.920> right<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.400> we're<00:00:21.769> here<00:00:22.769> and

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
been quite right so we're here and

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.250 
been quite right so we're here and
rather<00:00:23.939> than<00:00:24.240> just<00:00:24.449> be<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> bit<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.900> shock<00:00:25.109> we

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
rather than just be a bit of a shock we

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.349 
rather than just be a bit of a shock we
thought<00:00:25.439> we'd<00:00:25.590> wander<00:00:25.769> up<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.130> at<00:00:26.939> least<00:00:27.150> get

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
thought we'd wander up and at least get

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.970 
thought we'd wander up and at least get
some<00:00:27.570> good<00:00:27.599> launchers<00:00:28.140> going<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:28.619> everybody

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
some good launchers going for everybody

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.250 
some good launchers going for everybody
so<00:00:29.220> yeah<00:00:29.429> we're<00:00:30.359> just<00:00:30.390> got<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> DJ<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.050> wheel

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
so yeah we're just got a DJ the wheel

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.160 
so yeah we're just got a DJ the wheel
stands<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.710> little<00:00:31.830> bit<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.540> then<00:00:33.540> once<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
stands a little bit and then once the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.930 
stands a little bit and then once the
transmission<00:00:34.559> sort<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.130> will<00:00:35.280> feel<00:00:35.579> like<00:00:35.700> okay

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
transmission sort of will feel like okay

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.850 
transmission sort of will feel like okay
I'm<00:00:36.180> running<00:00:36.390> nine<00:00:39.230> stations<00:00:40.230> occluded

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
I'm running nine stations occluded

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.540 
I'm running nine stations occluded
including<00:00:41.550> stains<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.559> basically<00:00:43.559> no<00:00:44.280> Top

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
including stains and basically no Top

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.900 
including stains and basically no Top
Gear<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.840> Top<00:00:46.559> Gear<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:46.950> it's<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.190> slipping

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
Gear so Top Gear but it's just slipping

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.810 
Gear so Top Gear but it's just slipping
all<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> way<00:00:48.530> so<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:50.010> know<00:00:50.370> we're<00:00:50.550> near<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
all the way so you know we're near the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.369 
all the way so you know we're near the
power<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.329> hear<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.780> no<00:00:51.960> nitrous

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
power that it can hear that no nitrous

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.670 
power that it can hear that no nitrous
see<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.280> dyno<00:00:53.489> we've<00:00:54.230> been<00:00:55.230> testing<00:00:55.440> a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
see it on the dyno we've been testing a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.750 
see it on the dyno we've been testing a
250<00:00:56.219> shot<00:01:00.500> on<00:01:01.500> track<00:01:01.800> me<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.340> suppose<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> lot

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
250 shot on track me as I suppose a lot

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.270 
250 shot on track me as I suppose a lot
of<00:01:02.910> projects<00:01:03.300> do<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.690> saw<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.619> with<00:01:05.220> a

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
of projects do I saw it with a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.510 
of projects do I saw it with a
small-block<00:01:06.000> sheep<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.920> old<00:01:07.920> school<00:01:08.250> sort

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
small-block sheep on the old school sort

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.410 
small-block sheep on the old school sort
of<00:01:08.580> thinking<00:01:08.820> was<00:01:08.939> something<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.270> bit

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
of thinking was something a bit

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.539 
of thinking was something a bit
different<00:01:09.680> but<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.770> see<00:01:10.920> what<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> setup<00:01:11.430> of

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
different but I see what the setup of

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.460 
different but I see what the setup of
the<00:01:11.729> cat<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.240> throw<00:01:12.450> pretty<00:01:13.350> much

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
the cat we can throw pretty much

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.050 
the cat we can throw pretty much
whatever<00:01:13.650> power<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.189> could<00:01:14.310> make<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.909> and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
whatever power we could make in it and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.359 
whatever power we could make in it and
use<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.900> test<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.259> engines<00:01:16.619> from<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> day

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
use it to test the engines from the day

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.830 
use it to test the engines from the day
that<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.610> saw<00:01:17.850> her<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.030> decided<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.720> was

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
that I saw her I decided that it was

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.050 
that I saw her I decided that it was
exactly<00:01:18.990> what<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.409> wanted<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.640> was<00:01:20.850> sort<00:01:20.970> of

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
exactly what I wanted and I was sort of

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.999 
exactly what I wanted and I was sort of
hoping<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:22.110> might<00:01:22.170> do<00:01:22.530> some<00:01:22.560> good<00:01:22.740> real

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
hoping that it might do some good real

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.770 
hoping that it might do some good real
stands<00:01:23.280> as<00:01:23.430> well<00:01:23.580> which<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.939> does<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.360> what<00:01:24.659> I'd

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
stands as well which it does so what I'd

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.719 
stands as well which it does so what I'd
be<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.530> pretty<00:01:26.159> much<00:01:26.250> what<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.460> specialize

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
be this is pretty much what I specialize

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.030 
be this is pretty much what I specialize
on<00:01:27.049> 99%<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> motors<00:01:28.409> I've<00:01:28.530> builder<00:01:28.799> happy

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
on 99% of the motors I've builder happy

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.030 
on 99% of the motors I've builder happy
thirties<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.869> they're<00:01:30.869> us<00:01:31.020> with<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
thirties so they're us with you the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.440 
thirties so they're us with you the
twice<00:01:32.250> that's<00:01:32.490> has<00:01:32.640> been<00:01:32.790> do<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.030> for<00:01:33.180> me<00:01:33.270> that

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
twice that's has been do it for me that

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.060 
twice that's has been do it for me that
they<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:33.659> haven't<00:01:34.229> got<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.500> low<00:01:34.799> down<00:01:34.829> and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
they just haven't got the low down and

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.130 
they just haven't got the low down and
the<00:01:35.340> mid-range<00:01:35.640> talk<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.900> three

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
the mid-range talk that the three

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.690 
the mid-range talk that the three
leaders<00:01:37.320> have<00:01:37.530> got<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.250> number<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.670> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
leaders have got so the number on a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.609 
leaders have got so the number on a
piece<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:39.060> paper<00:01:39.240> doesn't<00:01:39.689> mean<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> lot<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.409> me

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
piece of paper doesn't mean a lot to me

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.380 
piece of paper doesn't mean a lot to me
that's<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.280> way<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.460> drives<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.180> how<00:01:42.240> much

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
that's the way it drives and how much

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.410 
that's the way it drives and how much
torque<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:42.840> got

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.399 

okay<00:01:47.659> he<00:01:47.930> basically<00:01:49.000> between<00:01:50.000> us<00:01:50.200> we<00:01:51.200> build

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
okay he basically between us we build

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.330 
okay he basically between us we build
the<00:01:51.560> complete<00:01:51.770> cat<00:01:52.510> most<00:01:53.510> trades<00:01:54.340> fabrication

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
the complete cat most trades fabrication

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.180 
the complete cat most trades fabrication
per<00:01:56.270> se<00:01:56.510> but<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.290> amount<00:01:57.650> of<00:01:57.680> support<00:01:57.860> from<00:01:58.010> a

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
per se but the amount of support from a

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.640 
per se but the amount of support from a
life-size<00:01:58.820> just<00:01:59.350> mixing<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.440> two<00:02:00.590> together

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
life-size just mixing the two together

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.680 
life-size just mixing the two together
which<00:02:01.010> is<00:02:01.130> good<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.430> know<00:02:01.460> obviously<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:02.479> got

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
which is good you know obviously you got

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.440 
which is good you know obviously you got
a<00:02:02.720> vise<00:02:02.869> sort<00:02:03.050> of<00:02:03.110> some<00:02:03.320> glutes<00:02:03.619> gonna<00:02:03.830> fit<00:02:04.450> so

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
a vise sort of some glutes gonna fit so

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.359 
a vise sort of some glutes gonna fit so
we<00:02:05.540> just<00:02:05.660> use<00:02:05.810> dummy<00:02:06.380> blocks<00:02:06.650> and<00:02:07.040> she<00:02:07.250> also

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
we just use dummy blocks and she also

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.180 
we just use dummy blocks and she also
put<00:02:07.670> spaces<00:02:07.970> to<00:02:08.410> basically<00:02:09.410> jig<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:09.800> up<00:02:09.890> and

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
put spaces to basically jig it up and

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.949 
put spaces to basically jig it up and
make<00:02:10.550> sure<00:02:10.580> those<00:02:11.000> are<00:02:11.120> nice<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.690> looks<00:02:11.900> like

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
make sure those are nice and looks like

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.500 
make sure those are nice and looks like
it's<00:02:12.200> supposed<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.560> be<00:02:12.850> if<00:02:13.850> you<00:02:14.030> just<00:02:14.270> got<00:02:14.450> a

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
it's supposed to be if you just got a

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.010 
it's supposed to be if you just got a
couple<00:02:14.750> times<00:02:15.050> now<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.530> dummy<00:02:15.830> cap<00:02:16.870> like<00:02:17.870> if

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
couple times now is a dummy cap like if

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.930 
couple times now is a dummy cap like if
I<00:02:18.110> step<00:02:18.319> and<00:02:18.350> I<00:02:18.500> figure<00:02:18.800> four<00:02:18.980> GTR<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.489> a<00:02:19.700> sharp

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
I step and I figure four GTR and a sharp

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.229 
I step and I figure four GTR and a sharp
would<00:02:20.090> use<00:02:20.270> a<00:02:20.420> dummy<00:02:21.250> but<00:02:22.250> this<00:02:22.580> is<00:02:22.760> part<00:02:23.120> way

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
would use a dummy but this is part way

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.620 
would use a dummy but this is part way
through<00:02:23.270> Bryce's<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:23.959> removing<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.350> cap

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
the eights no problem and then we'll

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.409 
the eights no problem and then we'll
really<00:04:16.900> start<00:04:17.019> to<00:04:17.320> wind<00:04:17.500> up<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.799> pattern<00:04:18.419> get

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
really start to wind up the pattern get

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.360 
really start to wind up the pattern get
some<00:04:19.630> almond<00:04:19.930> air<00:04:20.079> into<00:04:20.380> it<00:04:20.500> and<00:04:20.769> see<00:04:21.160> if<00:04:21.220> we

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
some almond air into it and see if we

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.580 
some almond air into it and see if we
can<00:04:21.519> crack<00:04:21.790> that<00:04:21.820> 160<00:04:22.540> on<00:04:22.600> street<00:04:22.930> tires<00:04:22.960> it's

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
can crack that 160 on street tires it's

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.290 
can crack that 160 on street tires it's
that's<00:04:24.010> my<00:04:24.070> goal<00:04:24.340> was<00:04:24.520> to<00:04:24.610> do<00:04:24.700> having<00:04:24.940> a<00:04:25.000> 60

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
that's my goal was to do having a 60

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.460 
that's my goal was to do having a 60
mile<00:04:25.450> an<00:04:25.479> hour<00:04:25.660> on<00:04:25.720> street<00:04:25.990> tires<00:04:26.020> on<00:04:26.410> the

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
mile an hour on street tires on the

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.880 
mile an hour on street tires on the
corner<00:04:26.740> if<00:04:27.010> it<00:04:27.190> gets<00:04:27.370> to<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.610> point<00:04:27.760> where

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
corner if it gets to the point where

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.469 
corner if it gets to the point where
we're<00:04:29.890> breaking<00:04:30.729> my<00:04:30.850> toes<00:04:31.030> or<00:04:31.180> having

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
we're breaking my toes or having

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.250 
we're breaking my toes or having
problems<00:04:31.810> with<00:04:31.960> power<00:04:33.000> then<00:04:34.000> obviously<00:04:34.180> the

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
problems with power then obviously the

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.410 
problems with power then obviously the
crickets<00:04:35.950> to<00:04:36.010> be<00:04:36.130> lighter<00:04:36.340> we<00:04:37.060> can<00:04:37.210> be<00:04:37.330> as

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
crickets to be lighter we can be as

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.480 
crickets to be lighter we can be as
white<00:04:37.690> as<00:04:37.720> eleven<00:04:38.170> hundred<00:04:38.370> thousand<00:04:39.370> and

thang so yeah I'm confident we're gonna
do<00:05:09.640> this<00:05:10.240> code<00:05:12.270> for<00:05:13.270> that<00:05:13.300> and<00:05:13.630> we'll<00:05:14.020> have<00:05:14.050> the

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
do this code for that and we'll have the

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.860 
do this code for that and we'll have the
trans<00:05:14.590> sort<00:05:14.830> of<00:05:14.950> boil<00:05:15.130> in<00:05:15.310> so<00:05:16.000> I'll<00:05:16.450> either<00:05:16.630> be

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
trans sort of boil in so I'll either be

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.660 
trans sort of boil in so I'll either be
flipping<00:05:17.650> it<00:05:17.740> over<00:05:17.800> backwards<00:05:18.310> or<00:05:18.400> do<00:05:18.550> their

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
flipping it over backwards or do their

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.400 
flipping it over backwards or do their
