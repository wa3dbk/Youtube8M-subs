00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.760 
one of those things that we've been
really<00:02:03.119> really<00:02:03.450> counting<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.140> personally

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
really really counting on I personally

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.219 
really really counting on I personally
thought<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.280> was<00:02:05.369> going<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.610> get<00:02:05.729> released

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
thought it was going to get released

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.919 
thought it was going to get released
last<00:02:07.229> week<00:02:07.409> if<00:02:07.740> not<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.910> week<00:02:09.179> I'm<00:02:09.420> like

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
last week if not this week I'm like

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.500 
last week if not this week I'm like
Monday<00:02:10.319> or<00:02:10.349> even<00:02:10.770> like<00:02:10.890> today<00:02:11.180> but<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.209> mean<00:02:12.450> of

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
Monday or even like today but I mean of

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.340 
Monday or even like today but I mean of
course<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.810> going<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.989> be

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
course it going to be

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.420 
course it going to be
they<00:02:13.740> could<00:02:13.890> have<00:02:13.980> really<00:02:14.160> stayed<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.310> little

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
they could have really stayed a little

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.950 
they could have really stayed a little
earlier<00:02:14.850> but<00:02:15.060> since<00:02:15.270> they<00:02:15.420> are<00:02:15.510> going<00:02:15.690> in<00:02:15.840> and

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
earlier but since they are going in and

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.630 
earlier but since they are going in and
making<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.200> trip<00:02:16.440> they<00:02:16.890> really<00:02:17.100> can't<00:02:17.400> do

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
making that trip they really can't do

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.040 
making that trip they really can't do
that<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.060> mean<00:02:18.210> it<00:02:18.300> was<00:02:18.360> another<00:02:18.570> big<00:02:18.720> deal

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
that so I mean it was another big deal

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.810 
that so I mean it was another big deal
we<00:02:19.200> gotta<00:02:19.350> wait<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.500> couple<00:02:19.650> more<00:02:19.860> days<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.550> it

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
we gotta wait a couple more days and it

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.360
