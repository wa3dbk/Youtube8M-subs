 go quiet where and we end up 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.510
 today for gameplay in zone of 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.279
 the riaj to the msr on the map hard hat 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.690
 it's a pretty good gameplay I have you 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.400
 realized there with a pretty good score there 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.690
 there are no mob attempts in the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.880
 gameplay one not bother to do you 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.770
 movies or anything I did not 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.170
 not realized fashion during this part 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.190
 in any case it's still there it's 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.580
 less well placed for that I tell you 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.230
 offers 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.789
 and if I make you a video it's 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.469
 also because bah this gameplay 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.699
 I'm pretty proud of it because I had to 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.230
 achieve in the second part of the 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.000
 day so today signed this after 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.470
 noon and so when I realize good 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.090
 end gameplay that makes sense I have everything 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.440
 immediately want to film them and 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.239
 comment so here I am not taking the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.190
 head I am I hope you feel 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.390
 a little bit about commenting in my 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.890
 voice because otherwise it's not even the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.489
 I'm still struggling to get out 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.989
 videos so that's during this part 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.579
 end during this video I will address 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.160
 several topics but before anything 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.660
 I would like to thank two people 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.180
 first person that this trait thank 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.729
 this is my graphist cder gleacher case 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.320
 who did the overlay that you see in 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.359
 top right of the video at word at this 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.280
 moment when I speak and the 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:12.630
 background on my channel then I the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.159
 really thanks a lot because 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.770
 must know that I really wanted 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.060
 to stop my outer chain and then after 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.289
 I spoke again with friends and I 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.969
 realized that over 3000 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.619
 subscribers it's still not 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:24.420
 innocuous it's still a big enough 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.469
 number figures yes a big enough 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.459
 number and so that's it I opened the 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:29.969
 eyes and I realized that 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:32.490
 it was a lot 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.159
 and so I'm going to delete everything 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.420
 I expressed my avatar my background 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.310
 my overlay I make them all deleted 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.599
 video I did not delete you late on 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.090
 my chain again where I'm not corner this 

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:43.439
 Point out good anyway but if one day 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.719
 I'm giving you a little precision as well 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.099
 one day I stop my youtube channel that's 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.539
 clear that I would leave I will leave her 

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:50.039
 open 1 I mean I would not say 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.719
 delete all the work that I have 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.409
 realized knowing that I'm no longer 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.419
 on my pc 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.429
 it would be really wasted time finally 

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:57.889
 I mean it's unimaginable for me 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.020
 to delete all these videos 

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:02.310
 Internet to view what I mean 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.779
 when I'm old that's where I'm 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.369
 taperais debate turned on this string 

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:06.329
 youtube looked at the old ones I 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.770
 did it that will make me laugh 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.819
 or so when I'm old I go out 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.920
 still on youtube I know it strictly 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.900
 nothing in any case 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.510
 that's how I wanted to say I 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.160
 wanted to thank his Gleacher arca 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.090
 string and in the description and so 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.860
 here I was not finished 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.599
 I thank him very much because I 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.190
 so go ask when I had 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.959
 realized that it was all removed 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.099
 I needed a graphic designer so I'm going 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.330
 ask in the afternoon to make me 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.040
 stuff finally if he could if he was 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.569
 available and in the evening I the 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.580
 had more and quality so bah 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.660

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.980
 pleasure his chain and in the description 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.680
 do not hesitate go throw a whole 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.470
 I was a ride to take a look at his 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.540
 chain if you are a glitch lover 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.489
 bugs and others especially the call of duty 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.410
 see other games do not hesitate to go 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.970
 take a look here is the second 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.239
 I would like to thank 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.500
 today thanks today yeah 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.360
 it's French these French imputes a 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.190
 nice turn at the passage of the second 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.540
 no one whom I would like to thank and 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.519
 rocks 3 which is simply my 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.709
 publisher you certainly do not need yourself 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.030
 not know who it is I want to be 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.989
 that you know he knows in any case 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.180
 I never talked about it 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.340
 so it's my publisher who did the 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.200
 farwell editing trailer which is 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.299
 available on his channel which will be at 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.890
 passage in the description and it is 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.090
 currently editing editing 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.860
 but it's true that if he will not go out 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.390
 right now because you have to know 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.470
 that he is on several montages at the same 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.970
 time can I quite 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.769
 understand he does not have much time 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.299
 and that for mom a lot of time 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.370
 to edit so here take your time if 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.109
 you watch this video and then it will do 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.019
 a great job it's a great editor 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.739
 he makes edith for a lot of people 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.840
 especially he made a little video 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.040
 surprise for me not miss you I 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.680
 invite to go see her she came back 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.819
 very well edited and then here are all the 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.940
 info or again are in the 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.099
 description and then and so here is so 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.670
 the subject of the video I would like 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.730
 address 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.919
 that's what make you think almost 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.760
 in a t notes control to a crowd and 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.669
 business action or I do not know what 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.340
 does the connections on mw3 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:57.120
 can change can change the game 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.099
 what simply 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.680
 so for me my own experience 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.359
 it's true that I'm at free 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.470
 for those who are free 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.569
 will certainly understand my suffering 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.709
 and in addition to being at free I am in 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.150
 end of line that is to say that I am 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.829
 not completely campaign I'm in 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.660
 Parisian suburbs so wait 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.310
 passage stop on form our mouths look 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.799
 first kills second he 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.570
 third he fourth he what's 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.329
 following maybe five cds whose lock 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.190
 which prevents me from doing the 5.5 fidh brief 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.270
 So here I am at free and those 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.070
 who are at free may know 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.400
 what am I talking about when you turn on 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.199
 your fucking TV at free 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.790
 in this case it is not me that he 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.880
 turn on my parents watching the 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.660
 TV hd channel + the football matches on 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.190
 little newspaper etc 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.770
 finally logical like all the parents of the 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.509
 world and so bah must know when you 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.280
 turn on the TV at free sonic la 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:46.490
 half of your connection it's not 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.830
 complicated me I'm sitting this mega 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.380
 download so download this 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.759
 which is really reasonable in passing 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.750
 I am at 60 at my grandparents 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:57.470
 because they have the fiber these bastards 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.660
 and in addition he circles open internet brief 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.520
 so here I am at this mega when 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.760
 I call on TV and TV cases 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.210
 well I immediately go to 2 3 mega 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.710
 so basically there is evidence that there is 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.380
 concrete facts I do not invent 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.720
 bullshit when the TV is on I 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.110
 can not play in drop zone 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.370
 outside experts 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.650
 the object of the automatic ie 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.580
 what I do and marker on hit mark 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.440
 so that is to say that during this 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.729
 gameplay I went back there was not but 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.289
 not left at the meeting of my little 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.650
 sister are not completely the 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.860
 balls 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.270
 so when I turn on my TV I 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.830
 do that markers that is to say that 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.660
 on four shots I'm going to do two three 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.979
 marker hits while the over four 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.830
 shots I will not even do a rite mark 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.479
 kirk finally it's just that it's just the 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.960
 topic that I wanted to address today 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.360
 so is nick video games 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.010
 completely is the connection 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.570
 can completely nick is a video game 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.990
 so that's dead for me the answer is 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.060
 Yes 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.289
 in any case I hope this gameplay 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.940
 you will be pleased do not hesitate to give me 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.330
 your impressions of the quality of 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.340
 gameplay 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.080
 the team I did as m tahri 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.220
 and then your your impression if you 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.130
 are at free also I would like 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.120
 know people who are in the 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.030
 same case as me because frankly 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.880
 it gave me the highest point 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.020
 and then restart ends on ends 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.940
 and damn I say shit so 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.830
 finished on a score of 49 that he 14 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.400
 dead I hope you enjoyed it at the 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.400
 next lease
