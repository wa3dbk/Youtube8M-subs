00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.949 
and we get more about black ops 3 I
would<00:03:10.459> imagine<00:03:10.639> that<00:03:10.879> is<00:03:11.269> probably<00:03:11.720> one<00:03:11.930> the

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
would imagine that is probably one the

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.839 
would imagine that is probably one the
first<00:03:12.290> hints<00:03:12.739> of<00:03:12.859> whatever<00:03:13.159> consoles<00:03:13.670> whether

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
first hints of whatever consoles whether

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.280 
first hints of whatever consoles whether
it<00:03:13.940> be<00:03:14.060> poured<00:03:14.299> it<00:03:14.359> down<00:03:14.389> to<00:03:14.629> 360<00:03:15.139> and

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
it be poured it down to 360 and

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.289 
it be poured it down to 360 and
PlayStation<00:03:15.889> 3<00:03:16.129> there<00:03:16.669> will<00:03:16.760> be<00:03:16.790> my<00:03:17.000> best

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
PlayStation 3 there will be my best

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.970 
PlayStation 3 there will be my best
guess<00:03:17.449> as<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.870> when<00:03:18.290> we'd<00:03:18.410> see<00:03:18.620> our<00:03:18.739> first

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
guess as to when we'd see our first

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.559 
guess as to when we'd see our first
information<00:03:19.639> on<00:03:19.819> whether<00:03:20.150> or<00:03:20.239> not<00:03:20.389> it's

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
information on whether or not it's

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.449 
information on whether or not it's
actually<00:03:20.959> coming<00:03:21.139> we<00:03:21.680> could<00:03:21.829> potentially<00:03:21.919> see

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
actually coming we could potentially see

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.430 
actually coming we could potentially see
it<00:03:22.549> be<00:03:22.669> confirmed<00:03:23.090> or<00:03:23.299> denied<00:03:23.629> there<00:03:23.870> as<00:03:24.019> well

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440
