00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.509
 Y 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.509
 a besote for production 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.209
 they did not tell me in the previous cut but 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.830
 good as a center now no longer our 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.509
 our theme today that are the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.450
 spices let's talk a little bit about the 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.060
 history donato of the species let's go 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.630
 to prehistory for example imagine 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.780
 a situation where there is no 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.250
 refrigerators 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.410
 what did people do 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.090
 I collected 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.420
 and things tend to spoil 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.400
 they have their expiration have their time 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.590
 especially the animals and that's 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.110
 pretty fast then that 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.500
 happened they started to get wrong 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.320
 flavor had to mask that bad taste 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.110
 then they began to discover that there was 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.170
 strong substances with a strong odor 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.110
 strong flavor that if added to the 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.989
 food that masks go bad 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.800
 disguise flavors but they concealed 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.620
 civilians 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.610
 that's right and good starts those things and 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.100
 it's over 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.170
 from there jump to the question of good 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.330
 let's go to the seasoning level and 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.300
 they started using them and we're going to give them 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.790
 certain flavors of things 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:22.590
 and it was so important but so important 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:26.040
 that the economy starts to grow based 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.510
 in fact species several species 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.060
 they became currency 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.480
 that's where you think the 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.630
 salary word 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.330
 of the medical saga of salt and if the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.750
 Roman Empire the Roman Empire came out to 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:46.260
 conquer and their legions paid 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.840
 with sacks of salt was so important 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.080
 as they did to him at that time was for 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:58.440
 to preserve for example meat 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:00.340
 what is dried meat with salt 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.580
 dehydrated by the farc 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:08.320
 ok then it was really financially 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.320
 strong began to grab water and by 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:16.380
 course at the level of good use here 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:19.590
 between our plan the cocoa was currency 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.080
 the cocoa seed was exchanged 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.230
 why were you going to the market with your morralito 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.310
 seeds and used as currency has been 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.390
 important 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.960
 and then all that began to happen from 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.960
 that way 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.400
 the route in the Indian 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.460
 and coincidentally where it develops more 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.860
 strong all this in tropical countries 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:49.730
 because because they are the warm countries in 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.260
 things in the Nordic countries in the 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.010
 countries the side then hold on a 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.010
 little bit more the situation 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.570
 It's very interesting when you see 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:04.580
 how this whole thing comes in the 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:07.490
 history that's how it is then that's how 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.160
 appear in the story the pepper the 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:14.750
 clove in cinnamon mustard quiles 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:17.209
 ginger is growing the saffron garlic 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.190
 all this strong all are flavors 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.830
 strong and 7 that we want that 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.750
 according to if the great-great-grandmother does not 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.150
 here in that and to use more what is 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.150
 the nail and for him the pepper 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.430
 the food tastes delicious 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.320
 what happens is that then through 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.830
 the shamans through the healers 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.170
 all these herbalist species all 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.820
 this is what they worked with and 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.200
 we were going to realize now that 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.360
 let's see 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.580
 how they are used in cooking and how they are used 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.870
 as remedies all the applications that 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.629
 It has is fabulous 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.790
 and you know he's very brave, he changes us 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.220
 much the taste when we have our 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.599
 food and you add tantito especially 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.459
 in these times when we cook 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.140
 too much because I could three of 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.120
 different dishes no longer three 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.160
 different things for precisely the 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.950
 season in which we are to eat from 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.919
 everything little or everything that everyone carries 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.419
 subjective and everyone has their seasoning and 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:20.669
 fortunately in those times is when 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:24.720
 more we use precisely from the 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:27.479
 funny spices through different 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.880
 times in different circumstances has 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:33.660
 had different uses for example in 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.330
 when the empires begin to 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.729
 conquer and its power to conquer 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.310
 it depends on fleet is talking 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:47.070
 specifically of the British Empire and 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:50.430
 in Spain ' they their fleets were 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:54.030
 but that gave them strength the power that 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.940
 they were sailing boats and now they go a lot 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.300
 time in crossing that they were going to eat those 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.300
 marine 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.860
 then preserved food although it 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.990
 preserved 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.670
 beautiful family do not leave us a 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.110
 horita the kitchen with monya and with bernie 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.910
 and we will continue talking yet 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.590
 much more of this because the program is 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.270
 will deal with precisely that come to 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.710
 continuation the subject of the benefits 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.910
 of the spices do not go this one 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.910
 wake up monte
