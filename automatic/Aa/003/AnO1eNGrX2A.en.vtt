00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.280
 that a new cat and welcome to a 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.700
 simulation over the mx league is the 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.260
 Session number 15 of the 2015 cloister and 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.360
 the previous simulation that I bring to 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:18.020
 continuation is that of veracruz against 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.620
 pumas like this is veracruz only get a 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.810
 point 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.510
 and that keeps him in the second position 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.490
 so there are no changes so far 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.250
 like the cross on the other side the cougars in 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.710
 he won his home match so that's what 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.700
 win before the saints with a score of 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.500
 10 and well, this one 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.460
 that puts him in the position number 10 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:49.720
 it has already risen a bit, it will be getting closer 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.520
 towards the picks plus the top 8 this 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.040
 position is to qualify but you have to 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.450
 win his three games but let's see 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.180
 How are you doing when Veracruz is here? 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:03.829
 he is also brave until he is strong 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.900
 to maintain his second position 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.290
 in this game we are given on Friday 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.750
 at eight thirty that's all 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.170
 fans of cougars and veracruz 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.820
 Attentive party at eight in the middle 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.200
 I know why channel 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.790
 in fact in opposition the channels but 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.180
 well you already know 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.570
 I can not say more important throughout 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.840
 of this season this day 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.820
 this simulation of day we are going to 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.329
 then to upload a video of the goals that 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.820
 are made in this simulation is both my 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.250
 partner so I decided to know 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.109
 what a goal is the best but you go 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.140
 to have to vote for that goal and we 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:48.939
 they arrive that goals taste that which is 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.740
 does the best as we are seeing in 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:56.740
 this principle and the first goal that falls and 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.500
 you say they liked you did not like it anymore 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.920
 see how they comment and tell us what is 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.420
 his own goal of the 15th day of 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:11.039
 simulation is the barqueta and then good 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.630
 I talk a little cougars and 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.630
 of others 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.980
 this vehicle later is lately 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:24.340
 I have been declining but I do not know about the game but 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:28.420
 Well, we do not see it so bad, it's still 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:32.050
 position number 2 stays in pumas 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.270
 he was going with a streak now he lost 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.990
 pachuca was visiting and now he has 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:42.350
 that look for ways to upload posts to 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.390
 see how to see how they are done 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.980
 and there we see the play the play that 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.950
 comes from veracruz and here and the first goal 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.330
 in our previous simulation 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.050
 in this game there comes to Veracruz 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.750
 try to put attentive saldivar that is 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.099
 the point of salivary that always 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.370
 can throw the parties and then 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.850
 everything falls down no longer reframed to others 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.069
 matches 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.290
 but there comes another play and no 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:15.100
 nothing else the header we have it with 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:18.590
 dante lÃ³pez did not fail him to dante 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:23.960
 see where it happens 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.670
 Cougars genius this is 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.980
 how will they realize today driving 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.010
 veracruz so they can see that we're leaving 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.080
 he wants to be winning amis cougars but hey 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.990
 last move because they are already in hands 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.510
 nor time gave them to make the play 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:41.600
 we finished this first time 1 to 0 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.970
 please the cougars in our previous 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.940
 match of the day number 15 between 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.460
 veracruz and pumas wow wow wow 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.910

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.910
 keep going 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.200
 it's good quickly we go to the second 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.380
 part of this simulation of day 15 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.030
 between veracruz and pumas, let's see what 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.050
 happens for this second time 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:14.110
 whoever else maintains that victory or 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:20.040
 Veracruz draws and turns or goes 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.040
 he expanded the goals more to see let's see 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:31.830
 we do not know to see 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.930
 a good shot good shot there but 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.810
 pay attention attentive well in the 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.230
 goal 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.980
 nothing happens in that goal until the 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:51.249
 moment the pumas come nothing the 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.109
 defense of attentive veracruz 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.889
 he remembers where he is from here 

00:04:53.109 --> 00:04:56.990
 over there 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:00.889
 and space opens up over space 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:05.030
 well in space pulls google 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:10.789
 what a beautiful goal they deceived the goalkeeper 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:12.600
 the defense and they do not see those mistakes are 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:16.640
 is that 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:20.850
 that should not happen in this game 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:23.280
 that is coming on Friday but good 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.860
 this continues let's go for more to see 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.650
 what other goals tell us other goals 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.750
 who already tied the game and the 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.990
 veracruz is 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.310
 with momentum since he scored the goal and also 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.180
 they want 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.770
 maintain that position and climb the 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:45.300
 position number 1 since we're not 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:48.960
 away from the chivas as you well know 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.539
 good shot good one hand chop 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:56.980
 let's see what comes out with this shot of 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:06:00.220
 corner on the part of the parents nothing 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:03.030
 and there comes another shot when you're 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:06.560
 judged the sports shots 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.560
 and fell to the lack 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:12.660
 of the advantage they do not accept it but good 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.790
 let's see what happens 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:19.120
 hit and nothing 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:22.380
 nothing, nothing, nothing 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.380
 Until now 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.270
 although in the cougars 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:37.420
 they go down the band for the band 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:37.420
 you put it in and that fire could not get it 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:46.380
 clearance you have to hurry the 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.170
 sharks 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:52.010
 to see who can stand in endurance 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.010
 I saw you 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:07:00.780
 if you want to face last minute 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.780
 last before it ends 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.550
 and he is not going to give him time he does not pay him the 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.650
 weather 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.200
 he gives does not give 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:14.320
 front attentive 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.580
 and then we up here is the 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.420
 pre-match simulation between 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:21.310
