00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.620
CM: Missing top!

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.500
TERRORBLADE: Ugh, he's not missing.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.900
He's just left our vision for a brief moment!

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.940
See? Not missing.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.014
CM: Missing top!

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:17.994
TERRORBLADE No no no no no! Not listening! Lalalalala!

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.440
ENIGMA: Winter Sorceress!

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.100
We need to teleport bottom and help out sea monster guy.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.580
Use your teleport scroll that I'm sure you totally have, right?

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.020
Ugh, always carry a teleport scroll. Go to the shop and- oh you actually have one.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.113
Let's go!

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.880
EIDOLON (V.O.): And he was gone just like that...

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.460
And we... were alone...

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.960
Brothers without direction, without purpose.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.280
We were aimless vessels, Eidolons who had nothing left.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.340
And then we died.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.240
RUBICK: Ready to dive, Juggernaut?

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.100
Attack!

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.100
TIDEHUNTER: Oh no oh no oh no no no no no!

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.820
Friends!

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.020
ENIGMA: Turn around and fight, Tidefighter... hunter.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.600
Oh, hey, it's Rubick.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.880
RUBICK: Hey, it's me!

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.660
ENIGMA: I completely forgot Rubick was in this game.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.100
I've just, you know...

00:01:13.107 --> 00:01:15.947
been in my own little world on the other side of the map the whole time.

00:01:15.947 --> 00:01:20.087
Haven't really paid attention to... anything else.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.000
CM: To battle!

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.660
JUGGERNAUT: Back! Back!

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.100
RUBICK: Retreat for the moment, but Juggy,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.120
are you ready for...

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.940
the turnaround!

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.840
AXE: Axe is axe!

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.760
ENIGMA: Ah! I don't want to attack you!

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.740
Why can't I control my body!?

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.040
OH my god that was so violent!

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.600
TIDEHUNTER: Lady?

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.560
ENIGMA: Oh, thanks, tower.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.720
Le'ts turn around! We can pick off Rubick.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.560
Now's our chance to get back at the

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.420
HOLY SHIP!

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.320
TIDEHUNTER: KUNKKA!

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.260
RUBICK: It's the turnaround!

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.360
Again!

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.500
ENIGMA: More reinforcments.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.820
TIDEHUNTER: More friends.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.420
ENIGMA: Okay... Let's turn around!

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.540
Whoa that's awesome!

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.860
TIDEHUNTER: WOW!

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.820
ENIGMA: Okay.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.080
Gotcha!

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.440
KUNKKA: Tidehunter, you putrid, fat

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.580
ENIGMA: I'm sorry, were you trying to say something?

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.900
I'm not sure, I can't hear you.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.980
TIDEHUNTER: Ha ha ha ha ha!

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.840
ENIGMA: Oh, you're dead.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.320
TIDEHUNTER: Friends help kill Kunkka! Yay!

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.380
JUGGERNAUT: Quite the battle.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.980
RUBICK: But it's not over yet.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.620
Are you ready for the turnaround again...

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.340
...Again!

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.440
ENIGMA: Good going, guys, it was kind of messy, but we came out of that

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.420
OH my god a little pink guy in a robot!

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.380
TIMBERSAW: Wahoo!

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.340
That's going on the highlight reel. 'Not 0-1 anymore! Huehuhe.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.700
TERRORBLADE: Uh. Missing, erm. Top.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.760
TIDEHUNTER: Tidehunter okay.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.700
Turn... around?

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.280
ENIGMA: *ahem*... yeah.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.500
TERRORBLADE: Who's the carry you ask?

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.360
I'm the carry. Yeah that's right, I'M the carry.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.520
The carry here, farming awaay...

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.600
Oh! What's this?

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.920
Are those MY badass flaming footsteps?

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.560
Well would you look at that, they are.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.920
Hey, Terrorblade!

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.580
CONJURATION: Sup.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.340
TERRORBLADE: Check this out.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.140
