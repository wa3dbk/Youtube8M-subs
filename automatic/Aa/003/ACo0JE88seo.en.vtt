00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.650
 good very good to all welcome to the 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.209
 a camper's day, my name is Ricardo 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.860
 I'm responsible for the blog and in this 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.960
 I would like to give you all the 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.910
 thanks for the support we received in the 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.800
 previous video I had 5 tips left 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.120
 for bike buyers and 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.770
 that are usually the mistakes that I have 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.570
 seen that they are committed more often 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.040
 and since in that video many people 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.690
 he was writing comments that I 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.370
 I like it a lot and they were asking me 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.500
 continue to elaborate 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.120
 this guy has encouraged me to elaborate today 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.100
 a video that I think is going to be pretty 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.930
 practical especially in a few days something 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.610
 that always tried with the blog to be 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.020
 the tips that may be useful to 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.300
 people who are starting in the world 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.579
 of sport the devil in cycling 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.680
 road mountain bike running 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.560
 little training because I practice so much 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.510
 a lot but in swimming and so on 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.920
 that on this occasion I would like to give 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.480
 advice that I think can be very useful 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.250
 to people who are thinking of buying 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.420
 a bicycle soon this year will 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.920
 gave a circumstance that has ended 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.329
 affecting the world of 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.680
 bicycle not only the world of 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.950
 bicycle but for what we are going to 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.930
 try in this case yes 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.490
 the euro this year lost quite a bit of value 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.310
 with respect to the dollar and that has affected 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.049
 that from February or March this 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.329
 year many brands had been the 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.740
 prices of some bicycles some 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.179
 way throughout its catalog in our 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.789
 cases only affected the models 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:23.500
 punctual but predictably the year 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.360
 coming will increase the price of 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.460
 absolutely all bicycles and already 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.899
 not only of bicycles but 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.700
 also of the components that form 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.799
 how transmissions can be 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.960
 brakes and lines and everything they 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.479
 I guess you can imagine that too 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.990
 It affects the clothes and well normally 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.030
 usually from June to July and 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.560
 especially in August and September when 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.659
 the change of season usually occurs 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.509
 as to what are bicycles 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.920
 the bicycles themselves and the components 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.539
 new seasons often reach 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.789
 from September so the 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.640
 June months July and August especially 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.319
 the brands tend to get rid of the stock 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.239
 they have and also the stores of such 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.340
 way they usually appear at prices 

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:05.409
 rewarded many people is 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.270
 aware of this other no 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.369
 the one that is conscious is usually expected 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.830
 these months to buy the 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.319
 bicycles and get a discount 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.390
 quite important the case is that 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.680
 also since the crisis began 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.480
 many bicycle shops every time 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.640
 they have less stock at the beginning of 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.769
 season in such a way that what comes 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.870
 it being the period that works 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.000
 itself already usually have fewer options 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.769
 among which to choose at least 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.140
 about what happened a few years ago 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.060
 besides this year there is one thing that is 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.739
 quite important and is that as a lot 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.690
 people are aware of the period of 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.239
 these rebates and is also aware of 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.560
 the climb that you could practically 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.019
 confirm that it is one hundred percent that 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.549
 has produced me in all the brands already 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.500
 they are buying bicycles every day 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.750
 today to not run out of this when 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.220
 come the change of season so if 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.980
 are you thinking about waiting to get 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.319
 a bonus price I do not you 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.730
 I would play too much and he explained what 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.859
 been watching and I've been talking to 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.879
 people who have stores and who know more 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.410
 that I and that has another series of 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.569
 contacts and that I do not have and also 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.760
 some contacts that I have so 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.930
 less that of enough models that go to 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.629
 to pass for example to make us 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.459
 two euros to about 1200 and also 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.140
 components that experience a rise 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.120
 similar in such a way that I think that 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.590
 this year will not be worth the wait 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.829
 the period of rebates to arrive 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.650
 purchased can you concrete components to 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.150
 the best even in the clothes I can not 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.189
 ensure that it will go up so much but yes 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.769
 I know that with regards to components and 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:32.230
 bicycles almost almost certainly all 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.700
 marks up and is not talking about 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.010
 small rises but rather rise 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.349
 important then I think that it 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.569
 I could almost consider that already to day 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.720
 today we are on sale and what 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.549
 We can see already in in August or in July 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.040
 end of July are already like the last 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.769
 rebates so good if you're waiting 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.209
 to buy a bicycle I said 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.680
 I think it's not worth this year 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.560
 expect much more since you run the 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.989
 risk of running out of models in front 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.790
 without sizes and what you expect after 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.010
 Summer is a pretty important stick 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.540
 so good so I do not expect anything 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.889
 have liked the video I hope down at the 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.329
 comment section for you 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.159
 impressions regarding this the 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:11.200
 change of season this year the rises 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.520
 of prices that you will see by bike that is 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.220
 without components or bread 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.560
 the 2016 season coming from 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.970
 September October and nothing that I hope 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.830
 your comments I hope your 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.930
 impressions we would like us to form 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.580
 some kind of debate around this very 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.110
 soon we will continue uploading videos 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.190
 and very especially this weekend 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.470
 since I have to make an announcement 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.940
 pretty important for the blog so 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.940
