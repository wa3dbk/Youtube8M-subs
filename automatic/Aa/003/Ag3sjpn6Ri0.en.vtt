mine<00:00:25.080> are<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.350> little<00:00:25.560> bit<00:00:25.800> different<00:00:26.039> than

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
mine are a little bit different than

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.570 
mine are a little bit different than
most<00:00:27.090> makers<00:00:27.859> basically<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:28.980> put<00:00:29.189> your<00:00:29.310> chin

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
most makers basically you put your chin

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.030 
most makers basically you put your chin
in<00:00:29.820> first<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.599> then<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.410> strap<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.769> on<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
in first and then you strap it on and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.650 
in first and then you strap it on and
I'm<00:00:32.309> gonna<00:00:32.399> do<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.669> right<00:00:32.820> now<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.630> you

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
I'm gonna do that right now so that you

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.350 
I'm gonna do that right now so that you
can<00:00:33.930> see<00:00:34.460> how<00:00:35.460> far<00:00:36.410> it<00:00:37.410> goes<00:00:37.739> down<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.489> also

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
can see how far it goes down and also

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:52.060 
can see how far it goes down and also
the<00:00:39.750> slope<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:41.129> muzzle<00:00:41.340> so

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.120 

so<00:00:52.610> as<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:52.910> can<00:00:53.030> see<00:00:53.090> it's<00:00:53.420> on<00:00:53.570> now<00:00:53.810> I<00:00:54.770> don't

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
so as you can see it's on now I don't

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.570 
so as you can see it's on now I don't
have<00:00:55.310> any<00:00:55.460> elastic<00:00:56.470> for<00:00:57.470> the<00:00:57.560> jaw<00:00:57.740> so<00:00:58.100> you

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
have any elastic for the jaw so you

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.870 
have any elastic for the jaw so you
can't<00:00:58.820> really<00:00:59.000> see<00:00:59.270> the<00:00:59.390> movement<00:00:59.780> but<00:01:00.880> I'm

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
can't really see the movement but I'm

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.970 
can't really see the movement but I'm
gonna<00:01:02.060> try<00:01:02.540> to<00:01:02.840> show<00:01:03.080> that<00:01:03.410> because<00:01:03.680> it's<00:01:03.920> a

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
gonna try to show that because it's a

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.240 
gonna try to show that because it's a
work<00:01:04.100> in<00:01:04.190> progress<00:01:04.840> but<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.560> elastic<00:01:06.830> comes

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250

if you have if you have the mask like

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.999 
if you have if you have the mask like
this<00:01:37.009> you'd<00:01:37.610> be<00:01:37.640> looking<00:01:37.850> out<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.300> nose<00:01:39.009> it

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
this you'd be looking out the nose it

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.040 
this you'd be looking out the nose it
would<00:01:40.160> be<00:01:40.310> straight<00:01:40.640> out<00:01:40.850> at<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.600> bottom<00:01:41.780> of

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
would be straight out at the bottom of

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.740 
would be straight out at the bottom of
this<00:01:42.820> right<00:01:43.820> up<00:01:44.000> in<00:01:44.180> here<00:01:44.560> just<00:01:45.560> plastic<00:01:46.750> the

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
this right up in here just plastic the

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.450 
this right up in here just plastic the
plastic<00:01:47.780> that<00:01:48.410> would<00:01:48.560> be<00:01:48.710> underneath<00:01:49.070> your

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
plastic that would be underneath your

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.120 
plastic that would be underneath your
chin<00:01:49.750> would<00:01:50.750> be<00:01:50.990> like<00:01:51.259> running<00:01:51.500> into<00:01:51.830> your

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
chin would be like running into your

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.700 
chin would be like running into your
mouth<00:01:52.840> so<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:53.899> don't<00:01:54.140> want<00:01:54.290> that<00:01:54.320> to<00:01:54.590> happen

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
mouth so you don't want that to happen

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.680 
mouth so you don't want that to happen
you<00:01:54.950> want<00:01:55.600> that<00:01:56.800> slope<00:01:57.800> here<00:01:58.300> so<00:01:59.300> you're<00:01:59.450> kind

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
you want that slope here so you're kind

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.520 
you want that slope here so you're kind
of<00:01:59.750> sloping<00:02:00.440> downwards<00:02:02.170> okay<00:02:04.750> so<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:06.290> think

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
of sloping downwards okay so I think

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.000 
of sloping downwards okay so I think
that's<00:02:06.860> pretty<00:02:07.070> much<00:02:07.190> all<00:02:07.370> I<00:02:07.460> wanted<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.760> cover

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
that's pretty much all I wanted to cover

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.650 
that's pretty much all I wanted to cover
but<00:02:10.010> I'll<00:02:10.160> do<00:02:10.310> a<00:02:10.340> quick<00:02:10.549> do<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.180> quick<00:02:11.390> turn

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
but I'll do a quick do a quick turn

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.120 
but I'll do a quick do a quick turn
around

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.570 

there's<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> lot<00:02:18.820> of<00:02:18.850> pins<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.390> stuff<00:02:19.570> going<00:02:20.110> on

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
there's a lot of pins and stuff going on

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.420 
there's a lot of pins and stuff going on
but<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:22.330> just<00:02:22.480> have<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.660> remember<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:24.220> don't
