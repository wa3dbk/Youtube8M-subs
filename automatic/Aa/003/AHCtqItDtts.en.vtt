00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.879
 who what is for him the world of cante figure antonio perez 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.870
 and I was lucky in addition to 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.820
 this relic that in cordoba 50 years ago who was born that still 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.430
 do not 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.370
 I was there watching him pick up the golden key of cante 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.080
 they gave it to me 50 years ago my first lion chronicle 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.180
 only during the morning 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.860
 It was a big 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.620
 it was a legend and life 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.850
 sl has called in a very beautiful way the guardian of the euro 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.060
 of the gypsy cante of his time 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.130
 I feared the big pinch was the bridge between 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.690
 what he had heard from others 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.930
 and above all 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.670
 what would come next 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.670
 took the cante out of the room 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.180
 from the tavern and took him to the university 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.620
 He was a man with a personality 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.350
 overwhelming 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.960
 very elegant 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.420
 and above all and this is the most important thing 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.500
 is that he kept the cantes 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.520
 as if they were in a chest the treasure chest of his own voice 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.840
 and then moved it 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.530
 to the times that we live to &amp; m the 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.020
 I remember having provided singing sing for example antonio but 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.430
 commented with his nephew in america 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.600
 and look at a very beautiful thing 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.560
 I said it is too much and I forgive me peace Antonio rests 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.140
 because he left 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.550
 in him he left was a very elegant man 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.010
 see what more graceful or complete story and the Lebrija is the 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.350

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:33.409

 the mother of the prince 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.499
 it also highlighted the advance 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:59.219
 yes 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.219
 had to start the paper to go down 

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:06.319
 very young in the father's forge 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.129
 how that influenced him later he asked while it's his nephews of the press 

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:13.689
 good can 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.999
 Forge 

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:20.599
 It has been a place where not great singers have been forged 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.279
 especially the gypsy cantaores 

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:25.900
 my uncle 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.090
 it came 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.830
 his father were a ferrero who came from a herrera family, he was going to be less 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.479
 for do 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.039
 I counted eta 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.039
 in the forge where he began to pour out to hear the first 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.099
 of cante you have to keep in mind also that Antonio was a person 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:46.309
 what 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:52.189
 it was little up to the school nothing you are looking for almost nothing remorseful messenger 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:54.650
 sorry for his office 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.870
 because I had to work the forge of the German killed 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.169
 and I had to help plow the father 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.949
 cut javi h 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.089
 the wing of drink to the people 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:11.409
 what is true that min antonio my grandfather from very small town of baba 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.299
 barcalá to listen joaquin the one of la paula so that he learned the cantes 

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:17.379
 and so ark the 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:21.280
 and then antonella felt tempted to become an artist very soon 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.389
 that is, it has been sung 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.780
 yes of course he liked to go on a spree to extinguish grandfather wanted 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.020
 will work eta in the forge gil and then between them they had a fight 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.330
 very great good antonio so much state does artist has let started sometimes 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.469
 out there but I was going now the artist said here we have an artist 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:45.629
 because he was so special that he embraced now that we talk to someone who believes 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:50.189
 cantarell and that is in that world here that is something very difficult that this one 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:52.789
 It made you stand out because you are impressed 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.189
 I will give an example bush 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:57.879
 to understand what he presented 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:00.879
 the cathedral of dublin 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.360
 118 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.479
 and they still have not had a crack 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.479
 the work of antonio all that one of these trains 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.830
 so that we understand each other and because he knows why 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.050
 jorge feel very good 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.080
 yes all 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.889
 and trusted the oral tradition 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:25.900
 can of all the elders as they will know to see from the forge 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.569
 from hook loja 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:30.439
 Soboce because it was called so wide 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:32.830
 because he said every ranch 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.830
 2 2 real 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.059
 and from the jug of wide loja there is a groove of carancho 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:43.619
 what does antonio do 

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:46.619
 make the sea what one does 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:51.629
 is that I can talk to you is due the north island 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.420
 of hundred of decanters that each each melody of one mirna xibillé same 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.699
 at least 80 different singing shape 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:04.169
 and teachers etc to families 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:07.169
 that's why that cathedral will not be able to bring many 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.380
 for it and winds for the foundations this man acquires
