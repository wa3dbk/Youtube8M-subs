I<00:01:18.930> don't<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.380> will<00:01:19.439> work<00:01:19.500> since<00:01:20.009> it's

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
I don't think it will work since it's

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.340 
I don't think it will work since it's
inside<00:01:20.729> because<00:01:21.420> that's<00:01:21.570> where<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.750> light

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
inside because that's where the light

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.469 
inside because that's where the light
emits<00:01:22.710> from<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.310> go<00:01:23.700> ahead<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:23.939> put<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:24.119> one

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
was a lot better than it was before like

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.560 
was a lot better than it was before like
it<00:02:11.350> was<00:02:11.440> amazingly<00:02:12.010> better<00:02:12.220> well<00:02:13.060> ten<00:02:13.360> times

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
it was amazingly better well ten times

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.560 
it was amazingly better well ten times
better<00:02:13.810> literally<00:02:14.710> 10<00:02:15.040> times<00:02:15.070> better<00:02:15.460> but<00:02:16.210> we

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
better literally 10 times better but we

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.780 
better literally 10 times better but we
could<00:02:16.840> make<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.170> look<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.590> lot<00:02:17.980> better<00:02:18.460> than<00:02:18.760> it

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
could make it look a lot better than it

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.520 
could make it look a lot better than it
did<00:02:19.120> before<00:02:19.270> um<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:21.040> what<00:02:21.280> we're<00:02:21.400> gonna<00:02:21.460> do<00:02:21.730> is

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
did before um so what we're gonna do is

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.350 
did before um so what we're gonna do is
if<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.770> hurt<00:02:23.950> okay<00:02:24.340> so<00:02:24.400> first<00:02:24.670> off<00:02:24.880> copy<00:02:25.150> this

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
if you hurt okay so first off copy this

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.360 
if you hurt okay so first off copy this
over<00:02:25.510> here<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.020> if<00:02:26.590> you've<00:02:26.770> ever<00:02:26.980> seen<00:02:27.310> a

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
over here and if you've ever seen a

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.410 
over here and if you've ever seen a
light<00:02:27.640> in<00:02:27.820> real<00:02:28.030> life<00:02:29.040> basically<00:02:30.420> especially

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
light in real life basically especially

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.720 
light in real life basically especially
don't<00:02:31.570> lights<00:02:31.810> in<00:02:32.130> general<00:02:33.130> are<00:02:33.250> basically

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
don't lights in general are basically

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.460 
don't lights in general are basically
not<00:02:34.000> why<00:02:34.300> did<00:02:34.510> all<00:02:34.660> they<00:02:34.810> are<00:02:34.990> usually<00:02:35.260> a

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
not why did all they are usually a

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.170 
not why did all they are usually a
peachy<00:02:35.800> color<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.250> very<00:02:36.580> light<00:02:36.700> peachy<00:02:36.970> color

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
peachy color a very light peachy color

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.730 
peachy color a very light peachy color
so<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.450> just<00:02:37.810> went<00:02:37.960> ahead<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.290> opened<00:02:38.380> the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
so I just went ahead and opened the

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.220 
so I just went ahead and opened the
physical<00:02:39.640> properties<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.990> brightness

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
physical properties and the brightness

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.110 
physical properties and the brightness
you<00:02:41.680> want<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:41.890> select<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.160> brightness<00:02:42.550> you

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
you want to select the brightness you

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.280 
you want to select the brightness you
know<00:02:43.180> all<00:02:43.300> these<00:02:43.450> things<00:02:43.510> like<00:02:43.930> brightness

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
know all these things like brightness

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.950 
know all these things like brightness
now<00:02:44.590> i'm<00:02:44.650> writing<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:44.980> HDR<00:02:45.550> brightness<00:02:46.090> now

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
now i'm writing this HDR brightness now

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.910 
now i'm writing this HDR brightness now
you<00:02:47.020> got<00:02:47.470> four<00:02:47.950> values<00:02:48.310> pretty<00:02:48.790> much<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.920> I'll

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
you got four values pretty much and I'll

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.380 
you got four values pretty much and I'll
each<00:02:51.460> value<00:02:51.880> is<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:52.480> our<00:02:52.720> for<00:02:53.710> red<00:02:53.890> green

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
each value is this is our for red green

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.350 
each value is this is our for red green
blue<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.420> brightness<00:02:56.520> so<00:02:57.520> our<00:02:57.880> jeebies

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
blue and brightness so our jeebies

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.500 
blue and brightness so our jeebies
basically<00:02:59.370> mixes<00:03:00.370> red<00:03:00.880> green<00:03:01.330> and<00:03:01.390> blue

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
basically mixes red green and blue

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.850 
basically mixes red green and blue
different<00:03:01.930> densities<00:03:02.320> of<00:03:02.350> red<00:03:02.620> green<00:03:02.800> and

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
different densities of red green and

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.620 
different densities of red green and
blue<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.280> order<00:03:03.490> to<00:03:03.610> get<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:04.030> certain<00:03:04.420> color

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
blue in order to get a certain color

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.930 
blue in order to get a certain color
which<00:03:05.380> is<00:03:05.410> what<00:03:05.770> I<00:03:05.950> think<00:03:06.130> most<00:03:06.459> modern<00:03:06.790> day

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
which is what I think most modern day

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.600 
which is what I think most modern day
technologies<00:03:07.600> use<00:03:07.840> so<00:03:08.410> it's<00:03:08.590> like<00:03:08.650> RGB<00:03:09.220> values

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
technologies use so it's like RGB values

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.370 
technologies use so it's like RGB values
and<00:03:09.820> then<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.360> brightness<00:03:10.690> is<00:03:10.840> of<00:03:10.989> course<00:03:11.110> how

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
and then the brightness is of course how

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.949 
and then the brightness is of course how
bright<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.739> is<00:03:11.770> so<00:03:12.330> let's<00:03:13.330> go<00:03:13.450> ahead<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.660> pick

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
bright it is so let's go ahead and pick

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.699 
bright it is so let's go ahead and pick
our<00:03:14.470> color<00:03:14.800> arm<00:03:15.810> let's<00:03:16.810> go<00:03:16.900> for<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:17.200> light<00:03:17.410> like

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
our color arm let's go for a light like

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.350 
our color arm let's go for a light like
a<00:03:18.209> orange<00:03:19.209> like<00:03:20.080> put<00:03:20.290> this<00:03:20.380> in<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.709> orange<00:03:21.070> and

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
a orange like put this in the orange and

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.680 
a orange like put this in the orange and
take<00:03:22.360> this<00:03:22.570> and<00:03:22.840> drag<00:03:23.260> it<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.560> bit<00:03:23.739> down<00:03:23.980> like<00:03:24.690> so

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
take this and drag it a bit down like so

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.690 
take this and drag it a bit down like so
I<00:03:26.019> hit<00:03:26.890> ok<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:27.250> apply<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:30.340> don't<00:03:30.489> have<00:03:30.580> to

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
I hit ok and apply and you don't have to

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.060 
I hit ok and apply and you don't have to
any<00:03:30.910> of<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.180> other<00:03:31.330> properties<00:03:31.750> for<00:03:31.900> now<00:03:32.070> just

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
any of the other properties for now just

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.990 
any of the other properties for now just
go<00:03:33.310> ahead<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:33.580> apply<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.209> and<00:03:34.480> cancel<00:03:35.320> it<00:03:35.440> I

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
go ahead and apply it and cancel it I

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.840 
go ahead and apply it and cancel it I
was<00:03:37.000> found<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:37.269> ironic<00:03:37.750> pie<00:03:38.019> canceled<00:03:38.530> but

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
was found that ironic pie canceled but

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.930 
was found that ironic pie canceled but
whatever<00:03:39.850> it<00:03:40.000> works<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.590> so<00:03:41.590> now<00:03:41.830> they've<00:03:42.760> got

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
whatever it works and so now they've got

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.820 
whatever it works and so now they've got
that<00:03:43.090> let's<00:03:43.300> go<00:03:43.810> ahead<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.019> go<00:03:44.200> in<00:03:44.350> game<00:03:44.530> and

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
that let's go ahead and go in game and

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.830 
that let's go ahead and go in game and
say<00:03:45.280> oh<00:03:45.310> looks<00:03:45.610> from<00:03:45.910> there<00:03:48.269> now<00:03:49.269> as<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:49.630> can

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
say oh looks from there now as you can

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.880 
say oh looks from there now as you can
see<00:03:49.900> this<00:03:50.410> is<00:03:50.620> our<00:03:50.769> room<00:03:51.130> and<00:03:52.620> we've<00:03:53.620> got<00:03:53.769> this

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
see this is our room and we've got this

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.229 
see this is our room and we've got this
light<00:03:54.130> load<00:03:54.370> nice<00:03:54.670> white<00:03:54.970> light<00:03:55.209> that

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
light load nice white light that

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.100 
light load nice white light that
actually<00:03:55.870> is<00:03:56.350> pretty<00:03:56.680> damn<00:03:57.160> sexy<00:03:57.400> way<00:03:58.110> but

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
actually is pretty damn sexy way but

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.800 
actually is pretty damn sexy way but
even<00:03:59.830> more<00:04:00.160> so<00:04:00.459> we<00:04:00.610> have<00:04:00.760> this<00:04:01.000> light<00:04:01.300> which<00:04:01.570> is

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
even more so we have this light which is

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.800 
even more so we have this light which is
as<00:04:02.260> you<00:04:02.470> can<00:04:02.620> tell<00:04:02.860> it's<00:04:03.300> much<00:04:04.300> better<00:04:04.480> looks

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
as you can tell it's much better looks

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.110 
as you can tell it's much better looks
more<00:04:05.140> realistic<00:04:05.530> if<00:04:06.310> we<00:04:06.610> could<00:04:06.730> probably<00:04:06.940> make

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
more realistic if we could probably make

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.740 
more realistic if we could probably make
it<00:04:07.180> a<00:04:07.330> bit<00:04:07.600> wider<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:08.230> brighter<00:04:08.800> but<00:04:09.760> for<00:04:10.630> now

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
it a bit wider and brighter but for now

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.110 
it a bit wider and brighter but for now
it's<00:04:10.989> pretty<00:04:11.260> good<00:04:11.440> actually

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
it's pretty good actually
