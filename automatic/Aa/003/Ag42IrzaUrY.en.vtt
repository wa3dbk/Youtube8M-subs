Hey, guys, John here at RealTruck.com.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.010
Today, I want to show you how to install the
Lund Interceptor Bug Shield onto this 2015

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:16.040
Chevy Silverado.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:28.359
You can see here we've got our Lund Interceptor
Bug Shield out of the box, everything laid

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:29.359
out.

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.730
It comes with everything you need to get this
installed on the truck.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.300
Some of the really nice features about this
is this big wraparound design actually goes

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.940
around and protects along the whole front
painted area of your truck -- being as the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.989
hood in the fronts of the fenders -- and comes
in this dark smoke or clear finish, either

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.250
one, depending on what you want.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.370
It is paintable, so if you want to color match
it to your truck, you can do that, too.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.949
So that's kind of a neat thing.

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:03.609
Also, you can see here it comes with your
alcohol prep pads, your paint protectors,

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.130
all your clips, and all the bolts and such
to get this on the truck.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.870
So the next thing we're gonna do here is we're
gonna go ahead and do that and show you how.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.180
So the first thing you want to do when we
get ready to install our Lund Interceptor

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.140
Bug Shield is to clean and prep the front
of the truck.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.880
We've already done that, so the next thing
we're gonna do here is start attaching the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.460
bracket pieces to our bug shield.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:38.500
It's not really all that difficult to do,
and we're going to take our brackets, our

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.960
flathead screw bolt, and our three-eighths
inch nut.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.450
Well, it's actually technically not three-eighths
inch, but that's what you use the wrench . . . three-eighths

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.450
inch for the nut.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.950
So we want to use that and we want to attach
these to our bug shield.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.090
And the way we're gonna do that is we're gonna
take them, and they go this way.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.180
You take one of the screws and put it up through
the bottom, and then you put your piece on

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.819
the top of here, like so.

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:21.510
And then you attach your nut onto the bolt
just like that.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.590
And then what we're gonna do now is we're
gonna go ahead and attach all of these onto

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.280
this bug shield.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.730
And just to show you how they go, once I have
them attached, then I'll go back and actually

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.069
tighten them up.

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.230
In the meantime, I'm gonna grab something
to lay this bug shield on so that I don't

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.909
scratch or scuff it up while I'm working on
it here on the bench.

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.300
Okay, guys, once these are all snugged in
place, then we can take our wrench and our

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.129
screwdriver and we can go back through and
tighten them all up.

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:59.050
What I like to do when I do this is to center
them in the slot before I actually tighten

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:10.850
them, and that'll keep them in a pretty good
location for attaching it to the truck.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.629
And make sure, guys, when you're tightening
these up, you tighten it with the screwdriver

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.319
and not the wrench.

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.340
Otherwise, you may overtighten it.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.260
And you could possible crack your bug shield
by overtightening it like that, so you don't

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.129
want to do that.

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:33.670
Okay, so the next thing we're gonna do once
we've got all these attached to our bug shield

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.200
here is to prep the truck and get ready to
put it on.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:47.420
So we're gonna go ahead and grab our alcohol
prep pads and our paint protector pieces and

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.360
a marking pen so we can mark this to get ready
to put it on there.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:03.129
I'm going to grab the marking pen here and
our alcohol pad, and then we have our paint

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:04.129
protectors ready to go also.

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.129
Here we go.

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:10.490
Okay, guys, so what we're gonna is we're gonna
mark out the location on here where we're

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.550
gonna need to put our paint protector pads
and just using a pencil that's specially designed

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.600
for doing this.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.220
That way, it doesn't stay on the paint and
that the mark will actually wipe right off

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.500
when we want it to.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.800
So that way, we're all in good shape and we
don't have to worry about marking up our truck

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.470
here.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.750
The center one's the easiest one because we're
gonna center it right up on this pushpin so

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.450
we don't even have to worry about marking
that one.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:50.500
Okay, so maybe we can take this back down
and just set it out of the way here, and then

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.550
what we're gonna do is we're gonna take our
alcohol pad, if you haven't already done so,

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:02.760
and clean up all these areas where our paint
protector's gonna attach to.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.850
What I do is I just go across the whole front
of the hood and then just clean it up really

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:15.640
nice, and be careful not to get underneath
the underside and wipe our marks off.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.420
But once we have that done, we're gonna take
our paint protector pieces that come with

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.370
our kit.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.530
We're gonna peel this backing off of them.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.620
Okay, got that one off.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.150
So then what we're gonna do with it is we're
just gonna take it and we're just gonna slide

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:42.120
it underneath this rubber seal here a little
bit and then just roll it right up and over

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.120
onto the hood.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.040
And what we're gonna do then is we're gonna
go along and do all five of those like that.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.121
What I'm gonna do, which makes this a little
bit easier for us, is just to go ahead and

00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:54.530
start these set screws.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.210
And just make sure that when you start, that
you actually have the Allen head facing out.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:06.590
Well, that's how we'll have to tighten them
up later so we want to be able to get to that.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.320
This just makes it a little easier for when
we go to put it up on the truck, we don't

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.270
have to try to hold it in place and start
these all at the same time.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.230
Because then we'll be dropping things and
losing these tiny little set screws . . . not

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.230
much fun.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.810
Okay, so now what we're gonna do then is we're
gonna take our bug shield and put it back

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:31.080
up on the truck and then take our Allen wrench
and our set screws.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:39.350
And we're going to tighten this down in place
here, starting with the center one.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.880
And then we'll just work our way to the ends.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:54.940
Okay, guys, once you have the set screw tightened
down, what we're gonna do then is we're gonna

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:00.910
move on over to the other side, do the other
side, and then we'll let you see what this

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.130
looks like when it's all on here.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.580
So let me get this is other side done and
then we'll come back.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.840
So there you go, guys.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:14.070
That's how quick, simple, and easy it is to
install this Lund Interceptor Bug Shield onto

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.070
your truck.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.440
So remember, until next time, happy motoring.
