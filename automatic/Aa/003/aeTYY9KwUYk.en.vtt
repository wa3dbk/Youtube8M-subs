00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello everyone for this 260th issue of 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.160
 flat 6 we have booked a 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:13.170
 comparative shock come to my right here 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.450
 the 997 turbo 3 8 6 phase 1 so strong 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.260
 rate of his 480 horsepower and to my left 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.380
 the 997 gt3 3.6 also also phase 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.050
 1 who owns 415 horses 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.210
 these two models are they really 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.789
 the heirs of two myths of 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.360
 the history of the whole porsche brand 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.700
 the turbos appeared 1975 the gt3 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.000
 are the heirs of the famous ones of the it 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.190
 crs and there are a lot of dreams 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.020
 around these two models today 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.480
 if we offer you this comparison 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.120
 it's mainly because their 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.660
 price on the market quotation of the occasion 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.300
 is very very close it is located 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.219
 between 75 and 80 thousand euros either 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.620
 it's still important almost 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.210
 half less than it was worth to 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.820
 the time when they came out 9 and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.500
 it's not so old their way out 9 and 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.420
 today we can therefore ask ourselves 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.860
 question of whether one prefers for 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.270
 this sum or 997 turbo 997 gt3 knowing 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.860
 that these two models answer yet 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.520
 of two totally different philosophies 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.290
 different 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.470
 the great tourism the comfort the luxury 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.020
 performance for the turbo sport in 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.380
 all its splendor with the gt3 the pure 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.050
 and hard 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.110
 a model that is more intended for a 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.340
 mixed use track circuit then 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.790
 which to choose is what we will see 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.130
 today 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.290
 so we make no mistake we 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.660
 are here in front of a magnificent castle 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.229
 in a quiet and peaceful site and 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.150
 carrying the 997 gt3 is an authentic 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.940
 furious as they say it's really a 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.690
 real pure and hard it's a real car 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.119
 of sport a porsche that could be said 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.910
 that we must not put in between 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.070
 hands and that's part of the little 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.200
 legend elsewhere of the brand porsche on 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.270
 often said when we know how to drive a 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.950
 porsche 911 we all know driving that did not 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.210
 not always been true and it's even 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.020
 less and less true because the 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.360
 today's porsche are 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.220
 especially easy to drive very 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.530
 comfortable and at the same time very 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.239
 powerful but this one somewhere 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.840
 there really is that because it's a 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.850
 self difficult enough to take on the road 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.560
 open if you want to start 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.170
 have fun especially if the coating 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.239
 is not good and at the same time that is 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.239
 a formidable weapon on the circuit 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.830
 then at the level of its external appearance 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.750
 obviously we will notice elements 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.920
 which makes her particularly bright here 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.110
 still we are 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.790
 in a relatively sober version 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.069
 white black rims but there is when 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.920
 even this fin which is still very 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.900
 impressive and who in the street will have 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.319
 tend to scare a little bit of 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.209
 passersby favored her even though she 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.230
 remains civilized if it is the 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.670
 drive in town 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.040
 we had a touch 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.819
 exhaust that allows to have a little 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.140
 of his 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.700
 or not at all 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.120
 it allows to cross 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.800
 calmly cities and power when 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.090
 even use this car every day 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.690
 do not be scared at all 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.730
 everyday use of a gt3 there 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.130
 where it gets more complicated when 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.390
 it's really about exploiting the 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.390
 car in its last limits 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.060
 during the 997 turbo she is a lot 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.530
 more in his element here in front 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.719
 still as sumptuous castle 997 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.209
 turbo is the very definition of the big 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:49.400
 internal tourism that may have been a 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.260
 little too often used wrongly and 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.390
 through but that means in the 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.299
 world of the car really the 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.239
 sports car big highway in the 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.709
 comfort and all the turbo generation 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.260
 since the very first 3 liters is 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.329
 exactly that is comfort with a 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.060
 extremely high level of performance 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:11.299
 thanks to this turbo technology that has 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.250
 been not invented but in any case 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.009
 developed by porsche is really 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.739
 marketed from the 1975 vintage 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:20.139
 they were among the 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.849
 first brought this process on a 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.060
 road car and it's become 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:26.800
 the naming turbo has really become 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.630
 totally mythical effect enormously 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.389
 dream and this is one of the models 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.610
 today in the 911 range which 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.000
 knows the greatest success one of the most 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.360
 great success in any case for sale 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.530
 despite learned very high 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.520
 except today precisely in the 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.740
 framework of this comparative 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.990
 the interest is that the prices of the phases 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.599
 1 of the first 997 turbo 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.280
 still a lot down without being 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.699
 absolutely accessible to all 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.400
 scholarships 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.979
 a lot of porschists today 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.159
 can afford this model actually from 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.159
 dream 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.310
 so when we talk about grand tourism it 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.080
 must also evoke the sound that obviously 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.790
 an essential element in the pleasure 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.310
 felt inside a porsche 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:19.490
 but here as we played absolutely the 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.320
 comfort card and well the sound is very 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.510
 very diffuse it is a breath to 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.180
 inside it has absolutely nothing to 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.820
 see with the are really racing very 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.140
 gt3 race so it's both 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.970
 one of the highlights of the turbo 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.350
 precisely his comfort his silence in 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.430
 same time it is sometimes what he had a 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.350
 little blamed for being too much 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.420
 silent then this silence is in 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.190
 part due to mechanical reasons of 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.980
 any compressed turbo system in itself 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.570
 take in more silence but also 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.790
 a desire to porsche precisely 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.170
 absolutely play this comfort card 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.790
 this says a small interesting detail 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.860
 for lovers of sounds I you 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.780
 encourages listening to a turbo in full 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.270
 acceleration on the side of a road and 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.950
 I think you will review your opinion 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.920
 concerning the lack of sound of turbos 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.360
 because the breath cleared in this 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.990
 moment there is really very 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.990
 impressive
