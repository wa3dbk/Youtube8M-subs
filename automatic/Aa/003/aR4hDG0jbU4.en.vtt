take a few weeks to get here so here it

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.650 
take a few weeks to get here so here it
is<00:00:34.380> few<00:00:34.770> weeks<00:00:34.920> into<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.700> iphone<00:00:36.090> 4<00:00:36.450> release

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
is few weeks into the iphone 4 release

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.810 
is few weeks into the iphone 4 release
date<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.559> it's<00:00:38.219> not<00:00:38.340> available<00:00:38.520> anymore

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
date and it's not available anymore

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.920 
date and it's not available anymore
because<00:00:39.149> i<00:00:39.629> guess<00:00:40.550> they<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:41.719> didn't<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:42.809> to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
because i guess they just didn't like to

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.180 
because i guess they just didn't like to
continue<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.500> because<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.860> guess<00:00:44.010> it's

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
continue that because I guess it's

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.709 
continue that because I guess it's
costing<00:00:44.489> way<00:00:44.610> too<00:00:44.670> much<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:45.090> them<00:00:45.239> pay<00:00:45.539> like

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
costing way too much for them pay like

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.299 
costing way too much for them pay like
600<00:00:46.260> bucks<00:00:46.289> for<00:00:46.710> each<00:00:46.739> without<00:00:47.670> contract<00:00:48.270> arm

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
600 bucks for each without contract arm

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.520 
600 bucks for each without contract arm
so<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.730> envelope<00:00:51.180> actually<00:00:51.719> um<00:00:51.989> it's

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
so the envelope actually um it's

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.189

actually<00:00:52.980> opened<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.690> reason<00:00:54.989> for<00:00:55.020> that

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
