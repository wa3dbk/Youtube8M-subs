00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
he liked it very much it's gonna snag a

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:51.290 
he liked it very much it's gonna snag a
piece<00:03:40.660> I<00:03:40.810> think

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:04:00.750 

yeah<00:03:54.300> all<00:03:55.300> right<00:03:55.510> let's<00:03:55.840> find<00:03:56.110> out<00:03:59.430> what<00:04:00.430> big

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
yeah all right let's find out what big

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:25.110 
yeah all right let's find out what big
the<00:04:01.060> angles

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.390 

I<00:04:25.180> can<00:04:25.900> see<00:04:26.350> where<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.680> rubbery<00:04:26.979> texture

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
I can see where the rubbery texture

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.939 
I can see where the rubbery texture
would<00:04:27.580> be<00:04:27.760> but<00:04:27.970> if<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.270> chicken<00:04:28.870> the<00:04:29.680> China

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
would be but if the chicken the China

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.730 
would be but if the chicken the China
the<00:04:30.160> stir-fry<00:04:30.550> happens<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:31.000> be<00:04:31.090> tough<00:04:31.240> enough

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
the stir-fry happens to be tough enough

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.230 
the stir-fry happens to be tough enough
so<00:04:32.740> that<00:04:32.770> it<00:04:32.979> just<00:04:33.490> feels<00:04:33.820> like<00:04:33.970> a<00:04:34.000> regular

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
so that it just feels like a regular

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.719 
so that it just feels like a regular
