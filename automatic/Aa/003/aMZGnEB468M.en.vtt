00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:07.319
 that without this lemon and in another read that yes 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.559
 and just normal play that if its no longer 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.570
 oil that if he sucks the hello to all 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.139
 if you want in this lemon and we are here 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.730
 in a new tutorial that do eat 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.310
 It's not like trolling in broth your type 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.359
 basically what I 'm going to do is 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.990
 change everything basically has nothing 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.579
 I see one thing with another I will say 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.119
 first in this chapter the classes 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.119
 then I will say 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.820
 and then on all the maps videos where 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.650
 you can do ninjas 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.880
 basically, I 've never done it that way 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.800
 I hope that the first time I do 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.710
 well and we have reception in the channel 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.140
 and well let's go to them these are the 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.890
 first classes for me that are better 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.570
 to troll and well let's go first 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.120
 if for example you want to catch someone 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.269
 it contains the shield and already 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.870
 you put the radar if you want and that 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:05.059
 yes always without camouflage so you do not 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.250
 see from afar and you can catch it 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.009
 the truth that comes while secondary and 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.039
 I would not put for that you put a c4 if 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.619
 you want or if not the concussions always 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.110
 They have to go and so puts Pippa 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.720
 that 4 if you want or not or you want if 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.250
 you want to have more advantages or less and 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.440
 well let's go to the disadvantages advantages 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:30.640
 basically this would be this 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.610
 it is deadly silence not 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.760
 this field deadly silence yes no 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.040
 detect running and running for me would be 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.040
 the most important thing since the rest 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.190
 it is not very necessary that we say now 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:50.560
 if you want to put 4 you have a spare 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:53.290
 place 4 and so you will have the first class 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.560
 now we go with the hairline that would be 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:01.300
 basically help and you put the sat with 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:03.040
 the box and this because with this I do not know 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.290
 could kill the 30 degrees and kill yourself 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.960
 with them more or less to troll and 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.179
 them a laugh and now we go for the 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.709
 class of ninjas to ninja basically not 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.230
 you need no weapon with you 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.470
 put better if you want the a-7 that has 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.800
 silencer but advisable mind me 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.110
 I would not wear anything since I do not know why 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.400
 of week you postpone the knife ni 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.530
 nothing but I do not know I would not put anything 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.879
 in a consultancy or anything and then 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.879
 shocked now that yes 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.340
 nothing or camouflages or anything clear 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.910
 excited and nothing else the advantages 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.910
 would 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.370
 this is one more tactic for you 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.080
 put 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.210
 one more storer that I think is 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.780
 it puts only if it goes in a single 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.970
 this from here this and this this yes that 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.570
 it takes 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.570
 and is going to put something more good because this if 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.270
 you want as you really want 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.790
 helped put this but you see that I did not 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.440
 make a hole but otherwise everything goes 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.370
 well then you put a random as well as 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:13.820
 crazy like crazy from the wall then in the 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:18.710
 streaks would be asad help with the 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.990
 If you want to stop and if you want, I'll go 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.360
 to simply that because instead of not 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.860
 I think he thinks a lot of things are going to 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.300
 be looking for and rescue but not you 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.330
 you worry that on November 15 I think 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.670
 which is that they put 20 like this so that it returns 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.040
 competitive lot that nothing happens to them nor 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.540
 give him a patatÃºs and in the last 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.370
 update works six rounds 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.680
 in 20 because for competitive 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.180
 because before there was only today so 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.710
 well we continue with this that would be the sat 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.810
 with the vest and the smugmug the magÃ¼ey 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.340
 and well I'm already going back to the other one 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.110
 I already wanted to go back as I have 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.340
 enough games is already the second the 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.650
 channel and development so I go back I 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.560
 I will bring enough trolley I also wait for you 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.350
 the guide is that I will upload an episode to the 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.650
 week from each one I do not know what day 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.970

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.930

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.930
