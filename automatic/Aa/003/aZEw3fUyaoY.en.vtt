sides<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.310> do<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.670> same<00:01:38.880> thing<00:01:41.630> okay<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.470> once

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
sides and do the same thing okay so once

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.990 
sides and do the same thing okay so once
you<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:43.799> your<00:01:44.130> eight<00:01:44.340> loops<00:01:44.610> what<00:01:44.880> we're

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
you have your eight loops what we're

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.060 
you have your eight loops what we're
going<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> go<00:01:45.270> ahead<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.630> do<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:46.020> take<00:01:46.290> two<00:01:46.740> of

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
going to go ahead and do is take two of

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.639 
going to go ahead and do is take two of
your<00:01:47.460> neon<00:01:48.299> pink<00:01:48.540> here<00:01:48.869> taking<00:01:49.290> your<00:01:49.439> first

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
your neon pink here taking your first

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.410 
your neon pink here taking your first
one<00:01:50.040> you're<00:01:50.670> going<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.939> pull<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.149> through<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
one you're going to pull it through the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.179 
one you're going to pull it through the
first<00:01:51.570> four<00:01:51.990> loops<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> first<00:01:52.770> half<00:01:53.009> of

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
first four loops to the first half of

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.789 
first four loops to the first half of
your<00:01:53.220> band<00:01:53.490> or<00:01:54.299> half<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.899> your<00:01:54.990> bands<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.710> are

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
your band or half of your bands so are

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.649 
your band or half of your bands so are
here<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.100> lift<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.399> first<00:01:56.640> or<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.909> second<00:01:57.509> and

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
here to lift the first or the second and

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.410 
here to lift the first or the second and
the<00:01:57.930> fourth<00:01:58.110> bands<00:01:58.890> for<00:01:59.490> loops<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.360> looks

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
the fourth bands for loops so it looks

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.660 
the fourth bands for loops so it looks
something<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.280> now<00:02:02.280> I'm<00:02:02.369> going<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.579> go

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
something like this now I'm going to go

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.330 
something like this now I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.880> pinch<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.659> turn<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.960> around

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
ahead and pinch this and turn it around

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.809 
ahead and pinch this and turn it around
but<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.460> can<00:02:05.670> do<00:02:05.820> whatever<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.450> like<00:02:07.819> so

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
but you can do whatever you like so

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.729 
but you can do whatever you like so
turning<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.479> around<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:10.110> taking<00:02:10.289> your<00:02:10.530> other

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
turning it around and taking your other

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.040 
turning it around and taking your other
band<00:02:11.099> again<00:02:12.060> pulling<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.569> through<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.870> first

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
band again pulling it through the first

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.640 
band again pulling it through the first
four

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
four

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.250 
four
loop's<00:02:13.980> you're<00:02:14.849> going<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.209> lift<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.780> second

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
loop's you're going to lift the second

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.069 
loop's you're going to lift the second
and<00:02:16.439> the<00:02:17.159> fourth<00:02:17.370> band<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.629> should<00:02:18.900> have

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
and the fourth band so you should have

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.410 
and the fourth band so you should have
something<00:02:19.349> like<00:02:19.680> this<00:02:19.709> now<00:02:20.189> you're<00:02:21.090> going<00:02:21.299> to

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
something like this now you're going to

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.899 
something like this now you're going to
go<00:02:21.540> ahead<00:02:21.689> and<00:02:21.870> take<00:02:22.439> one<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.069> these<00:02:23.310> loops<00:02:23.700> it

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
go ahead and take one of these loops it

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.210 
go ahead and take one of these loops it
doesn't<00:02:24.209> matter<00:02:24.360> which<00:02:24.599> one<00:02:25.040> you're<00:02:26.040> just

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
doesn't matter which one you're just

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.890 
doesn't matter which one you're just
going<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.459> cross<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.909> over<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.269> other<00:02:27.450> one<00:02:27.659> so

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
going to cross it over the other one so

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.539 
going to cross it over the other one so
I'm<00:02:27.989> going<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.170> take<00:02:28.319> these<00:02:28.769> loops<00:02:29.099> and<00:02:29.340> cross

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
I'm going to take these loops and cross

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.449 
I'm going to take these loops and cross
them<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:31.290> now<00:02:31.439> that<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.680> have<00:02:31.859> something<00:02:32.159> like

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
them so now that I have something like

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.369 
them so now that I have something like
this<00:02:32.730> crossed<00:02:33.420> bands<00:02:33.959> I'm<00:02:34.079> going<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.290> go<00:02:34.349> ahead

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
this crossed bands I'm going to go ahead

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.670 
this crossed bands I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:34.560> take<00:02:34.829> my<00:02:35.519> zebra<00:02:35.790> band<00:02:36.150> here<00:02:36.560> pull<00:02:37.560> it

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
and take my zebra band here pull it

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.039 
and take my zebra band here pull it
through<00:02:37.859> the<00:02:37.950> first<00:02:38.220> four<00:02:39.180> loops<00:02:39.569> make<00:02:39.900> sure

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
through the first four loops make sure

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.289 
through the first four loops make sure
your<00:02:40.200> band<00:02:40.409> stay<00:02:40.650> crossed<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.280> then<00:02:42.209> I'm

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
your band stay crossed and then I'm

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.770 
your band stay crossed and then I'm
going<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.569> lift<00:02:42.840> just<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.409> outside<00:02:43.590> one<00:02:44.129> and

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
going to lift just the outside one and

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.809 
going to lift just the outside one and
then<00:02:45.780> taking<00:02:46.019> my<00:02:46.319> second<00:02:47.010> band<00:02:47.190> pulling<00:02:47.730> it

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
then taking my second band pulling it

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.390 
then taking my second band pulling it
through<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:48.120> first<00:02:48.299> two<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.170> just<00:02:49.920> lifting

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
through the first two and just lifting

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.430 
through the first two and just lifting
the<00:02:50.579> outside<00:02:50.970> one<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:51.959> now<00:02:52.109> you<00:02:52.170> should<00:02:52.409> have

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
the outside one so now you should have

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.530 
the outside one so now you should have
for<00:02:52.950> zebra<00:02:53.340> loops<00:02:53.579> and<00:02:53.849> then<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.359> should<00:02:54.510> have

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
for zebra loops and then you should have

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.360 
for zebra loops and then you should have
to<00:02:54.959> neon<00:02:55.230> pink<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.680> then<00:02:55.769> two<00:02:55.980> zebras<00:02:56.340> in

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
to neon pink and then two zebras in

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.789 
to neon pink and then two zebras in
between<00:02:56.819> those<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:58.049> again<00:02:58.500> you're<00:02:58.620> going<00:02:58.709> to

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
between those so again you're going to

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.229 
between those so again you're going to
go<00:02:58.889> ahead<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.189> turn<00:02:59.310> this<00:02:59.489> around<00:02:59.670> on<00:02:59.970> your

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
go ahead and turn this around on your

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.879 
go ahead and turn this around on your
hook<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:00.569> you<00:03:00.629> can<00:03:00.780> do<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.900> other<00:03:01.170> side<00:03:01.560> here

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
hook so you can do the other side here

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.360 
hook so you can do the other side here
and<00:03:02.870> taking<00:03:03.870> two<00:03:04.019> more<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.439> your<00:03:04.680> zebra<00:03:04.889> bands

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
and taking two more of your zebra bands

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.009 
and taking two more of your zebra bands
you're<00:03:05.549> going<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.909> pull<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.420> first<00:03:06.659> band

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
you're going to pull the first band

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.809 
you're going to pull the first band
through<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.099> first<00:03:08.750> four<00:03:09.750> loops<00:03:10.109> here<00:03:10.819> you're

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
through the first four loops here you're

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.129 
through the first four loops here you're
going<00:03:11.909> to<00:03:12.000> go<00:03:12.060> ahead<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.329> lift<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.750> outside

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
going to go ahead and lift the outside

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.789 
going to go ahead and lift the outside
one<00:03:13.700> just<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.819> outside<00:03:14.970> one<00:03:15.650> then<00:03:16.650> you're

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
one just the outside one then you're

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.069 
one just the outside one then you're
going<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.040> take<00:03:17.129> your<00:03:17.609> next<00:03:18.419> band<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.900> pull<00:03:19.049> it

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
going to take your next band and pull it

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.470 
going to take your next band and pull it
through<00:03:19.139> the<00:03:19.290> first<00:03:19.530> two<00:03:19.919> and<00:03:20.209> lift<00:03:21.209> the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
through the first two and lift the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.740 
through the first two and lift the
outside<00:03:21.900> one<00:03:22.440> just<00:03:23.190> like<00:03:23.370> so<00:03:23.639> and<00:03:23.910> now<00:03:24.690> you

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
outside one just like so and now you

make sure that you cross your bands the
same<00:03:59.970> way<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.180> did<00:04:00.359> last<00:04:00.419> time<00:04:00.900> so<00:04:01.290> I'm<00:04:01.470> going

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
same way you did last time so I'm going

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.890 
same way you did last time so I'm going
to<00:04:01.859> again<00:04:02.430> cross<00:04:02.790> mine<00:04:03.120> backwards<00:04:04.159> like<00:04:05.159> so

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
to again cross mine backwards like so

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.800 
to again cross mine backwards like so
and<00:04:06.900> if<00:04:07.049> you<00:04:07.609> just<00:04:08.609> look<00:04:08.849> at<00:04:09.000> these<00:04:09.180> bands<00:04:09.629> down

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
and if you just look at these bands down

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.719 
and if you just look at these bands down
here<00:04:10.139> just<00:04:10.680> make<00:04:10.829> sure<00:04:10.859> you<00:04:10.979> cross<00:04:11.280> those<00:04:11.549> the

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:11.729 
here just make sure you cross those the

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:15.770 
here just make sure you cross those the
same<00:04:11.909> way<00:04:13.190> so<00:04:14.190> again<00:04:14.699> just<00:04:14.909> don't<00:04:15.239> alternate<00:04:15.750> I

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
same way so again just don't alternate I

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.750 
same way so again just don't alternate I
guess<00:04:16.049> if<00:04:16.229> it<00:04:16.380> looks<00:04:16.650> neater<00:04:16.949> if<00:04:17.340> you<00:04:17.519> cross

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
guess if it looks neater if you cross

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.099 
guess if it looks neater if you cross
them<00:04:17.940> all<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.239> same<00:04:18.269> way<00:04:18.539> and<00:04:18.750> make<00:04:18.989> it

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
them all the same way and make it

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.250 
them all the same way and make it
consistent<00:04:19.409> so<00:04:19.919> yeah<00:04:20.729> anyway<00:04:21.449> you're<00:04:22.049> going

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.839 
consistent so yeah anyway you're going
to<00:04:22.380> take<00:04:22.620> now<00:04:23.070> after<00:04:23.370> you've<00:04:23.490> crossed<00:04:23.669> you're

fourth<00:05:21.389> loop<00:05:21.750> here<00:05:22.729> now<00:05:23.729> go<00:05:23.939> ahead<00:05:23.969> and<00:05:24.210> turn

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
fourth loop here now go ahead and turn

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:30.320 
fourth loop here now go ahead and turn
this<00:05:24.659> around<00:05:24.870> and<00:05:28.490> do<00:05:29.490> the<00:05:29.610> same<00:05:29.819> thing<00:05:30.089> so

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
this around and do the same thing so

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.059 
this around and do the same thing so
take<00:05:30.539> your<00:05:30.689> next<00:05:30.930> pink<00:05:31.259> band<00:05:31.500> pull<00:05:31.860> it<00:05:31.919> through

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:32.069 
take your next pink band pull it through

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:34.369 
take your next pink band pull it through
the<00:05:32.159> first<00:05:32.310> four<00:05:32.669> lifting<00:05:33.629> the<00:05:33.750> second<00:05:34.169> and

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:34.379 
the first four lifting the second and

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.369 
the first four lifting the second and
the<00:05:34.529> fourth<00:05:34.770> loop<00:05:35.370> and<00:05:35.930> again<00:05:36.930> making<00:05:37.110> sure

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:37.379 
the fourth loop and again making sure

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:38.929 
the fourth loop and again making sure
that<00:05:37.680> you<00:05:37.770> are<00:05:37.889> crossing<00:05:38.069> your<00:05:38.370> bands<00:05:38.819> the

00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:38.939 
that you are crossing your bands the

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:41.059 
that you are crossing your bands the
same<00:05:39.180> way<00:05:39.360> that<00:05:39.539> you<00:05:39.659> happen<00:05:40.020> the<00:05:40.289> other<00:05:40.500> the

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:41.069 
same way that you happen the other the

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:44.179 
same way that you happen the other the
other<00:05:41.449> sections<00:05:42.449> so<00:05:43.349> crossing<00:05:43.680> line<00:05:44.009> like

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:44.189 
other sections so crossing line like

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:48.829 
other sections so crossing line like
this<00:05:44.960> now<00:05:45.960> taking<00:05:46.469> two<00:05:47.009> zebra<00:05:47.399> bands<00:05:47.759> pull<00:05:48.719> the

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:48.839 
this now taking two zebra bands pull the

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:52.600 
this now taking two zebra bands pull the
first<00:05:49.080> one<00:05:49.759> through<00:05:50.759> the<00:05:50.939> first<00:05:51.210> four<00:05:51.990> loops

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
first one through the first four loops

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.110 
first one through the first four loops
lift<00:05:53.610> just<00:05:54.120> the<00:05:54.300> outside<00:05:54.719> one<00:05:54.960> here<00:05:55.849> now<00:05:56.849> take

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
lift just the outside one here now take

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.550 
lift just the outside one here now take
your<00:05:57.149> second<00:05:57.689> band<00:05:57.870> and<00:05:58.139> pull<00:05:58.289> it<00:05:58.319> through<00:05:58.500> the

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
your second band and pull it through the

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.540 
your second band and pull it through the
first<00:05:58.770> two<00:05:59.460> lifting<00:06:00.210> the<00:06:00.509> outside<00:06:00.899> one<00:06:01.139> and

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
first two lifting the outside one and

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.320 
first two lifting the outside one and
we're<00:06:02.550> going<00:06:02.669> to<00:06:02.699> go<00:06:02.789> ahead<00:06:02.819> and<00:06:03.060> turn<00:06:03.210> this

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
we're going to go ahead and turn this

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.329 
we're going to go ahead and turn this
around<00:06:03.509> on<00:06:03.810> the<00:06:03.960> hook<00:06:04.169> again<00:06:06.949> taking<00:06:07.949> two<00:06:08.129> more

00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:08.339 
around on the hook again taking two more

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:10.850 
around on the hook again taking two more
zebras<00:06:08.729> bins<00:06:08.939> take<00:06:09.899> your<00:06:10.050> first<00:06:10.199> one<00:06:10.529> pull<00:06:10.770> it

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
zebras bins take your first one pull it

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.240 
zebras bins take your first one pull it
through<00:06:11.009> the<00:06:11.159> first<00:06:11.339> four<00:06:11.729> loops<00:06:12.120> and<00:06:13.250> then

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
through the first four loops and then

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.019 
through the first four loops and then
with<00:06:14.430> the<00:06:14.610> outside<00:06:14.969> one<00:06:16.399> take<00:06:17.399> another<00:06:17.729> band

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:18.029 
with the outside one take another band

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:20.839 
with the outside one take another band
through<00:06:18.539> the<00:06:18.629> first<00:06:18.870> to<00:06:19.219> lift<00:06:20.219> the<00:06:20.430> outside

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
through the first to lift the outside

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:22.999 
through the first to lift the outside
one<00:06:21.120> so<00:06:22.020> you're<00:06:22.110> going<00:06:22.259> to<00:06:22.379> continue<00:06:22.740> this

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
one so you're going to continue this

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:25.100 
one so you're going to continue this
process<00:06:23.250> until<00:06:23.520> it<00:06:24.149> is<00:06:24.270> long<00:06:24.479> enough<00:06:24.509> to<00:06:24.899> fit

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
process until it is long enough to fit

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.529 
process until it is long enough to fit
your<00:06:25.259> wrist<00:06:25.490> and<00:06:26.490> then<00:06:26.699> to<00:06:26.939> finish<00:06:27.089> it<00:06:27.270> off

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
your wrist and then to finish it off

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:30.260 
your wrist and then to finish it off
it's<00:06:28.199> really<00:06:28.439> simple<00:06:28.800> you<00:06:29.129> just<00:06:29.610> take<00:06:30.000> these

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
it's really simple you just take these

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.899 
it's really simple you just take these
eight<00:06:30.870> loops<00:06:31.229> here<00:06:31.589> and<00:06:31.770> you<00:06:32.399> take<00:06:32.580> one<00:06:32.789> more

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:32.909 
eight loops here and you take one more

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:35.290 
eight loops here and you take one more
bands<00:06:33.330> pull<00:06:33.839> all<00:06:34.080> eight<00:06:34.289> loops<00:06:34.500> on<00:06:34.770> and

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
bands pull all eight loops on and

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.360 
bands pull all eight loops on and
reattach<00:06:36.300> so<00:06:37.169> this<00:06:37.440> is<00:06:37.709> what<00:06:38.039> it<00:06:38.129> should<00:06:38.159> look

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
reattach so this is what it should look

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.129 
reattach so this is what it should look
like<00:06:38.550> once<00:06:39.000> you're<00:06:39.180> finished<00:06:39.360> obviously<00:06:40.110> a

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 
like once you're finished obviously a

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:40.850 
like once you're finished obviously a
lot<00:06:40.349> longer

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
lot longer

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.629 
lot longer
