are actually chords in the key of G and
again<00:03:49.630> this<00:03:49.870> is<00:03:50.020> what<00:03:50.140> I<00:03:50.170> like<00:03:50.380> to<00:03:50.470> work<00:03:50.620> on<00:03:50.800> in

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
again this is what I like to work on in

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.010 
again this is what I like to work on in
lessons<00:03:51.580> is<00:03:51.730> talk<00:03:51.940> about<00:03:52.210> the<00:03:52.330> theory<00:03:52.570> of<00:03:52.690> why

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
lessons is talk about the theory of why

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.690 
lessons is talk about the theory of why
these<00:03:53.080> chords<00:03:53.650> are<00:03:53.800> together<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.460> whether

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
these chords are together and whether

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.220 
these chords are together and whether
they're<00:03:54.940> in<00:03:55.030> a<00:03:55.090> key<00:03:55.270> together<00:03:55.600> or<00:03:55.810> not<00:03:55.959> and

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
they're in a key together or not and

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.840 
they're in a key together or not and
whether<00:03:57.010> they<00:03:57.220> shouldn't<00:03:57.550> be<00:03:57.610> played

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
whether they shouldn't be played

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.240 
whether they shouldn't be played
together<00:03:58.000> in<00:03:58.240> the<00:03:58.390> same<00:03:58.570> song<00:03:58.890> with<00:03:59.890> this<00:04:00.010> song

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
together in the same song with this song

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.610 
together in the same song with this song
I<00:04:00.550> would<00:04:01.060> tend<00:04:01.300> to<00:04:01.360> say<00:04:01.570> no<00:04:01.990> but<00:04:02.260> then<00:04:02.440> they<00:04:02.590> put

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
I would tend to say no but then they put

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.340 
I would tend to say no but then they put
this<00:04:03.010> great<00:04:03.490> melody<00:04:04.420> over<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:04.870> that<00:04:04.990> makes<00:04:05.230> it

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
this great melody over it that makes it

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.070 
this great melody over it that makes it
work<00:04:05.590> not<00:04:06.430> unlike<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.150> Beatles<00:04:07.480> did<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.720> lot<00:04:08.050> of

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
work not unlike the Beatles did a lot of

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.180 
work not unlike the Beatles did a lot of
their<00:04:08.290> stuff<00:04:08.470> a<00:04:08.650> lot<00:04:08.800> of<00:04:08.890> the<00:04:08.980> chord

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
their stuff a lot of the chord

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.190 
their stuff a lot of the chord
