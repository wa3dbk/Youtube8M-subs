second attempt what I recommend doing is
before<00:02:25.350> i<00:02:25.380> sleep<00:02:25.800> kind<00:02:26.160> of<00:02:26.220> pushing<00:02:26.640> down<00:02:26.790> nice

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
before i sleep kind of pushing down nice

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.360 
before i sleep kind of pushing down nice

going to keep pushing down on it there

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.380 
going to keep pushing down on it there
we<00:03:06.810> go<00:03:07.280> there<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.340> go<00:03:08.460> it's<00:03:08.790> then<00:03:09.000> installed

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
it and I must say it just it makes it

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.080

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
like that you can kind of do it

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.020
