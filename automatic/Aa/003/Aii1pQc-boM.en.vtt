quarter inch piece of scrap at the front
of<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.360> jig<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:13.260> simply<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.740> hold<00:01:13.890> your<00:01:14.189> stock

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
of the jig is simply to hold your stock

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.820 
of the jig is simply to hold your stock
at<00:01:14.760> an<00:01:14.880> angle<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.420> face<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.960> jig<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
at an angle to the face of the jig the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.499 
at an angle to the face of the jig the
very<00:01:17.040> first<00:01:17.250> thing<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.460> did<00:01:17.490> was<00:01:17.820> wrap<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.119> pencil

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
very first thing I did was wrap a pencil

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.149 
very first thing I did was wrap a pencil
mark<00:01:18.630> all<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.930> way<00:01:19.020> around<00:01:19.320> my<00:01:19.439> stock<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
mark all the way around my stock and

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.039 
mark all the way around my stock and
this<00:01:20.790> pencil<00:01:21.000> mark<00:01:21.270> will<00:01:21.420> serve<00:01:21.630> as<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
this pencil mark will serve as the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.039 
this pencil mark will serve as the
endpoint<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> indentation<00:01:23.960> once<00:01:24.960> you

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
endpoint of the indentation once you

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.960 
endpoint of the indentation once you
place<00:01:25.259> your<00:01:25.290> stock<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> jig<00:01:26.430> you're<00:01:26.850> gonna

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
place your stock in the jig you're gonna

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.399 
place your stock in the jig you're gonna
want<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.150> position<00:01:27.330> your<00:01:27.570> line<00:01:27.780> up<00:01:28.110> from<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
want to position your line up from the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.890 
want to position your line up from the
very<00:01:28.710> back<00:01:28.950> end<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.460> opening<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.450> order<00:01:30.780> to

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
very back end of the opening in order to

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.870 
very back end of the opening in order to
count<00:01:31.170> for<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.650> distance<00:01:32.220> between<00:01:32.430> your

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
count for the distance between your

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.840 
count for the distance between your
guide<00:01:33.090> bushing<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.750> your<00:01:34.290> router<00:01:34.500> bit<00:01:34.850> okay

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
guide bushing and your router bit okay

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.490 
guide bushing and your router bit okay
so<00:01:35.909> once<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.450> your<00:01:36.630> stock<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> jig

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
so once you have your stock in the jig

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.410 
so once you have your stock in the jig
and<00:01:37.710> you've<00:01:38.250> accounted<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.909> distance<00:01:39.299> in

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
and you've accounted for the distance in

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.910 
and you've accounted for the distance in
between<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.689> guide<00:01:39.930> bushing<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.710> router

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
between the guide bushing and the router

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.679 
between the guide bushing and the router
bid<00:01:41.189> go<00:01:41.820> ahead<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.180> flip<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.540> whole<00:01:42.630> thing

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
bid go ahead and flip the whole thing

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
over and make a pencil mark on the jig

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.300 
over and make a pencil mark on the jig
next<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> line<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.979> created

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
next to the line that you created

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.060 
next to the line that you created
earlier<00:01:48.079> this<00:01:49.079> way<00:01:49.290> when<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.619> go<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.799> make

earlier this way when you go to make

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.340 
earlier this way when you go to make
another<00:01:50.579> indication<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.479> another<00:01:51.780> face<00:01:52.079> of

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
another indication on another face of

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.620 
another indication on another face of
the<00:01:52.470> same<00:01:52.710> piece<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.070> stock<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:54.299> ease<00:01:54.479> it

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the same piece of stock you can ease it

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.990 
the same piece of stock you can ease it
more<00:01:54.810> easily<00:01:54.930> line<00:01:55.380> up<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.979> stock<00:01:56.399> inside<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
more easily line up the stock inside the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.910 
more easily line up the stock inside the
jig<00:01:57.270> okay<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.409> next<00:01:58.500> thing<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.740> want<00:01:58.890> to

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
jig okay so the next thing you want to

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.410 
jig okay so the next thing you want to
do<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.130> go<00:01:59.250> ahead<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.490> clamp<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.850> jig<00:01:59.880> with

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
do is go ahead and clamp the jig with

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.590 
do is go ahead and clamp the jig with
the<00:02:00.600> workpiece<00:02:01.490> inside<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.700> vise<00:02:05.540> okay<00:02:06.540> so

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
the workpiece inside of a vise okay so

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.819 
the workpiece inside of a vise okay so
what<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.960> want<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.229> do<00:02:07.350> before<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.770> start

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
interior portion of the indentation a

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.250 
interior portion of the indentation a
little<00:03:15.410> bit<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:15.830> eased<00:03:16.340> over<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:17.660> edges<00:03:18.080> of

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.810 
little bit and eased over the edges of
the<00:03:18.410> indentation<00:03:18.710> and<00:03:19.220> doesn't<00:03:19.730> look<00:03:19.790> too<00:03:19.940> bad
