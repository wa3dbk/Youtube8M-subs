-<00:00:20.520> already<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.090> got<00:00:21.359> 10<00:00:22.080> days<00:00:22.619> ago<00:00:23.180> or<00:00:24.180> maybe

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
- already I got 10 days ago or maybe

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.710 
- already I got 10 days ago or maybe
more<00:00:25.050> must<00:00:26.010> be<00:00:26.099> something<00:00:26.640> like<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> version<00:00:27.359> 2

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
more must be something like a version 2

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.810 
more must be something like a version 2
or<00:00:28.019> they<00:00:29.810> improved<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:31.859> production<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.640> this

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
or they improved the production of this

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.020 
or they improved the production of this
thing<00:00:33.149> because<00:00:34.309> the<00:00:35.309> gimbals<00:00:36.290> feels<00:00:37.290> much

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
thing because the gimbals feels much

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:46.930 
thing because the gimbals feels much
better<00:00:39.649> then<00:00:40.820> on<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.120> versions<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.930> my<00:00:43.800> friend

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:55.520 

so<00:00:48.530> they<00:00:49.530> are<00:00:49.739> very<00:00:50.100> smooth<00:00:53.239> no<00:00:54.350> scratching<00:00:55.350> or

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
so they are very smooth no scratching or

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.310 
so they are very smooth no scratching or
something<00:00:56.629> it's<00:00:57.629> very<00:00:57.930> good<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.680> I<00:01:00.199> want<00:01:01.199> to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
something it's very good so I want to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.960 
something it's very good so I want to
talk<00:01:01.590> about<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:03.000> battery<00:01:03.449> for<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.379> thing

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
talk about the battery for this thing

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.730 
talk about the battery for this thing
because<00:01:07.040> it's<00:01:08.040> better<00:01:08.369> without<00:01:08.760> light

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
because it's better without light

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.620 
because it's better without light
because<00:01:10.740> I'm<00:01:11.119> homemaking<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.270> selling<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
because I'm homemaking is selling a

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.660 
because I'm homemaking is selling a
battery<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.290> one<00:01:13.530> which<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.130> lipo

this<00:01:21.509> thing<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.930> voltage<00:01:22.259> regulator<00:01:23.810> most

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
this thing is a voltage regulator most

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.520 
this thing is a voltage regulator most
of<00:01:25.049> your<00:01:25.259> voltage<00:01:25.740> goes<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.490> heat<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.530> another

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
of your voltage goes to heat so another

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.980 
of your voltage goes to heat so another
thing<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.189> light<00:01:29.400> pole<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.880> had<00:01:30.659> no

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
thing is that the light pole I had no

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.300 
thing is that the light pole I had no
problems<00:01:32.270> until<00:01:33.270> now<00:01:34.140> with<00:01:34.560> my<00:01:34.770> life<00:01:35.009> force

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
problems until now with my life force

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.330 
problems until now with my life force
but<00:01:35.820> as<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.420> already<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.560> seen<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.979> videos

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
but as you already have seen the videos

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.160 
but as you already have seen the videos
in<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.670> internet<00:01:39.030> what<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.689> head<00:01:39.869> into<00:01:40.140> a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
in the internet what can head into a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.520 
in the internet what can head into a
lipo<00:01:40.619> now<00:01:41.780> imagine<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.350> your

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
lipo now imagine you have this in your

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.010 
lipo now imagine you have this in your
cheeks<00:01:44.070> near<00:01:44.490> your<00:01:44.640> face<00:01:44.970> or<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.869> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
cheeks near your face or you have to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.139 
cheeks near your face or you have to
transmitter<00:01:47.869> in<00:01:48.869> your<00:01:48.979> home<00:01:49.979> place<00:01:50.340> or<00:01:50.759> near

transmitter in your home place or near

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.580 
transmitter in your home place or near
something<00:01:52.100> because<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.340> have<00:01:54.380> run<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
something because you have run the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.200 
something because you have run the
simulation<00:01:56.369> or<00:01:56.899> have<00:01:57.899> some<00:01:58.200> medications<00:01:58.920> in

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
simulation or have some medications in

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.969 
simulation or have some medications in
simulators<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:01.229> get<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> problem<00:02:01.740> if

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
simulators and you get the problem if

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.590 
simulators and you get the problem if
you<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.369> oh<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.969> other<00:02:03.000> thing<00:02:03.360> so

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
you like oh this is the other thing so

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.020 
you like oh this is the other thing so
this<00:02:04.259> was<00:02:04.469> not<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.829> main<00:02:05.009> reason<00:02:05.430> for<00:02:05.460> me<00:02:05.820> to

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
this was not the main reason for me to

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.800 
this was not the main reason for me to
use<00:02:06.450> another<00:02:06.780> battery<00:02:07.229> but<00:02:08.539> after<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.569> had<00:02:09.780> a

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
use another battery but after I had a

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.860 
use another battery but after I had a
look<00:02:10.080> on<00:02:10.259> how<00:02:10.440> bikini

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
look on how bikini

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.860 
look on how bikini
I<00:02:12.010> decided<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:14.300> use<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.900> life<00:02:15.410> together<00:02:15.849> so<00:02:16.870> this

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
I decided to use a life together so this

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.589 
I decided to use a life together so this
one<00:02:18.140> is<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.290> nine<00:02:18.590> point<00:02:18.860> nine<00:02:19.220> volt<00:02:19.610> also<00:02:19.970> so<00:02:20.420> it

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
one is a nine point nine volt also so it

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:28.539 
one is a nine point nine volt also so it
means<00:02:20.870> two<00:02:21.319> cells<00:02:21.709> with<00:02:23.050> 1.5<00:02:24.050> amps<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:27.549> since

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
means two cells with 1.5 amps so since

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.520 
means two cells with 1.5 amps so since
the<00:02:28.940> life<00:02:29.150> we<00:02:29.420> are<00:02:29.650> very<00:02:31.330> secure<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:32.599> they

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
the life we are very secure so they

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.610 
the life we are very secure so they
cannot<00:02:33.920> explode<00:02:34.459> or<00:02:34.910> explode<00:02:35.810> or<00:02:36.049> overheat<00:02:36.590> or

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
cannot explode or explode or overheat or

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.250 
cannot explode or explode or overheat or
something<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:38.239> is<00:02:38.299> a<00:02:38.360> good<00:02:38.629> choice<00:02:38.900> for<00:02:38.959> a

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
something it is a good choice for a

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.650 
something it is a good choice for a
transmitter<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:40.700> battery<00:02:41.060> fits<00:02:41.360> very

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
transmitter and the battery fits very

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.600 
transmitter and the battery fits very
well<00:02:41.840> in<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.890> has<00:02:43.099> the<00:02:43.129> size<00:02:43.519> of<00:02:43.849> 8<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:45.610> IMH

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
well in it has the size of 8 and IMH

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.520 
well in it has the size of 8 and IMH
batteries<00:02:47.299> and<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:49.760> can<00:02:49.970> charge<00:02:50.299> this<00:02:50.569> almost

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
batteries and you can charge this almost

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.680 
batteries and you can charge this almost
with<00:02:51.769> normal<00:02:52.250> charge<00:02:52.579> mode<00:02:52.849> of<00:02:53.030> your<00:02:53.180> lippo

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
with normal charge mode of your lippo

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.530 
with normal charge mode of your lippo
charger<00:02:54.470> in<00:02:54.650> life<00:02:54.950> in<00:02:55.220> mode<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.299> don't

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
charger in life in mode and you don't

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.600 
charger in life in mode and you don't
have<00:02:56.750> to<00:02:56.959> balance<00:02:57.319> this<00:02:57.829> every<00:02:58.310> time<00:02:58.549> you

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
have to balance this every time you

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.839 
have to balance this every time you
charge<00:02:59.120> so<00:02:59.510> and<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.379> can<00:03:00.709> balance<00:03:01.040> this<00:03:01.430> but

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
charge so and you can balance this but

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.270 
charge so and you can balance this but
it's<00:03:02.030> not<00:03:02.269> necessary<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.290> do<00:03:03.410> on<00:03:03.620> every<00:03:03.950> charge

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
it's not necessary to do on every charge

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.539 
it's not necessary to do on every charge
you<00:03:04.459> can<00:03:04.640> balance<00:03:05.239> them<00:03:05.690> every<00:03:06.440> 10<00:03:06.680> charge<00:03:07.310> or

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
you can balance them every 10 charge or

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.069 
you can balance them every 10 charge or
something<00:03:08.349> so<00:03:09.489> I<00:03:10.489> will<00:03:11.269> have<00:03:11.450> a<00:03:11.480> look<00:03:11.629> how<00:03:11.930> this

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
something so I will have a look how this

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.589 
something so I will have a look how this
perform<00:03:12.739> but<00:03:13.129> when<00:03:13.549> I<00:03:13.579> have<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:13.940> look<00:03:14.239> at<00:03:14.450> the

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
perform but when I have a look at the

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.890 
perform but when I have a look at the
amps<00:03:14.989> drawing<00:03:15.560> without<00:03:15.799> light<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.700> lights<00:03:17.630> on

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
amps drawing without light and lights on

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.099 
amps drawing without light and lights on
it's<00:03:18.200> around<00:03:18.560> I<00:03:18.739> think<00:03:19.280> I<00:03:19.549> read<00:03:19.850> 30<00:03:20.389> milliamps

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
it's around I think I read 30 milliamps

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:27.250 
it's around I think I read 30 milliamps
to<00:03:22.480> 140<00:03:23.480> millions<00:03:23.840> or<00:03:24.220> 113<00:03:25.220> I'm<00:03:25.489> not<00:03:25.670> sure<00:03:26.260> so

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
to 140 millions or 113 I'm not sure so

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.589 
to 140 millions or 113 I'm not sure so
depends<00:03:28.250> on<00:03:28.340> this<00:03:28.459> calculation<00:03:29.209> it<00:03:29.359> should

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
depends on this calculation it should

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.259 
depends on this calculation it should
run<00:03:29.900> around<00:03:30.109> 10<00:03:30.769> hours<00:03:31.069> with<00:03:31.579> this<00:03:31.790> battery

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
run around 10 hours with this battery

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.680 
run around 10 hours with this battery
and<00:03:33.160> it's<00:03:34.160> super<00:03:34.639> light<00:03:34.940> super<00:03:35.540> small<00:03:35.989> and<00:03:37.690> I

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
and it's super light super small and I

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.909 
and it's super light super small and I
will<00:03:39.260> see<00:03:39.500> how<00:03:39.709> it<00:03:39.859> performs<00:03:40.489> when<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.790> use<00:03:41.090> this

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
will see how it performs when I use this

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:46.210 
will see how it performs when I use this
they'll<00:03:42.919> use<00:03:43.660> but<00:03:44.660> I'm<00:03:44.959> very<00:03:45.500> impressed<00:03:45.829> about

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
they'll use but I'm very impressed about

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.009 
they'll use but I'm very impressed about
this<00:03:46.400> little<00:03:46.700> small<00:03:46.940> pack<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:47.450> it's<00:03:47.630> only

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
this little small pack and it's only

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.740 
this little small pack and it's only
around<00:03:48.230> six<00:03:48.769> dollars<00:03:49.280> so<00:03:49.700> it's<00:03:49.880> def<00:03:50.150> almost

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
around six dollars so it's def almost

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.180 
around six dollars so it's def almost
half<00:03:51.200> of<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.829> battery<00:03:52.760> pack<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.359> they<00:03:54.250> will

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
half of the battery pack and they will

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.339 
half of the battery pack and they will
give<00:03:58.190> you<00:03:58.340> for<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.299> battery<00:03:59.690> this<00:03:59.810> is<00:03:59.870> made

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
give you for the battery this is made

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:06.699 
give you for the battery this is made
for<00:04:00.650> this<00:04:01.000> so<00:04:04.030> since<00:04:05.030> we<00:04:05.209> have<00:04:05.450> nine<00:04:06.349> point

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
for this so since we have nine point

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.530 
for this so since we have nine point
nine<00:04:07.040> volts<00:04:08.500> we<00:04:09.500> have<00:04:09.769> now<00:04:10.069> nine<00:04:10.790> point<00:04:11.090> ends

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
nine volts we have now nine point ends

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.659 
nine volts we have now nine point ends
because<00:04:11.780> I<00:04:12.139> already<00:04:12.769> use<00:04:12.919> this<00:04:13.130> a<00:04:13.190> little<00:04:13.459> bit

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:13.669 
because I already use this a little bit

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:19.060 
because I already use this a little bit
so<00:04:14.630> um<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:17.030> charged<00:04:17.539> voltage<00:04:18.079> of<00:04:18.349> a<00:04:18.620> life<00:04:18.829> is

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
so um the charged voltage of a life is

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.909 
so um the charged voltage of a life is
around<00:04:19.459> 2<00:04:19.909> volts<00:04:19.940> but<00:04:20.659> I<00:04:20.810> think<00:04:21.229> this<00:04:21.409> is<00:04:21.620> too

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
around 2 volts but I think this is too

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.850 
around 2 volts but I think this is too
deep<00:04:22.130> I<00:04:22.510> will<00:04:23.510> use<00:04:23.780> this

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
deep I will use this

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.589 
deep I will use this
until<00:04:25.460> each<00:04:25.669> cell<00:04:26.000> becomes<00:04:26.479> 2.5<00:04:27.409> walls<00:04:28.599> so

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
until each cell becomes 2.5 walls so

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:33.850 
until each cell becomes 2.5 walls so
which<00:04:30.259> means<00:04:30.560> on<00:04:31.009> a<00:04:31.220> three<00:04:31.610> years<00:04:31.819> on<00:04:32.860> 75%

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
which means on a three years on 75%

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.700 
which means on a three years on 75%
point<00:04:34.069> 5<00:04:34.310> volts<00:04:34.819> I<00:04:34.969> will<00:04:35.479> put<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:36.080> alarm<00:04:36.439> in

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
point 5 volts I will put the alarm in

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.619 
point 5 volts I will put the alarm in
and<00:04:37.750> so<00:04:38.750> I<00:04:38.780> know<00:04:39.020> that<00:04:39.439> battery's<00:04:39.889> going<00:04:40.789> empty

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:41.629 
and so I know that battery's going empty

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:45.189 
and so I know that battery's going empty
and<00:04:41.840> I<00:04:41.930> have<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.259> recharge<00:04:42.909> this<00:04:43.909> is<00:04:44.060> only<00:04:44.360> my

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
and I have to recharge this is only my

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.619 
and I have to recharge this is only my
opinion<00:04:45.229> but<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:45.830> think<00:04:46.159> if<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:47.030> batteries<00:04:47.599> are

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:47.629 
opinion but I think if the batteries are

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:52.390 
opinion but I think if the batteries are
better<00:04:48.500> to<00:04:49.099> use<00:04:49.340> on<00:04:50.259> transmitters<00:04:51.340> safety<00:04:52.340> is

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
better to use on transmitters safety is

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.119 
better to use on transmitters safety is
one<00:04:52.699> thing<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.509> voltage<00:04:54.080> and<00:04:55.389> the

00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:57.129 
one thing the voltage and the

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:01.270 
one thing the voltage and the
consumption<00:04:58.129> the<00:04:58.460> other<00:04:58.639> thing<00:04:59.000> I<00:04:59.240> hope<00:05:00.280> this

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
consumption the other thing I hope this

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.709 
consumption the other thing I hope this
video<00:05:01.460> will<00:05:01.699> help<00:05:01.879> you<00:05:02.060> to<00:05:02.360> make<00:05:02.659> your

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 
video will help you to make your

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.680 
video will help you to make your
decision<00:05:03.129> either<00:05:04.129> choose<00:05:04.610> a<00:05:04.879> life<00:05:05.210> here<00:05:05.509> or

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
decision either choose a life here or

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.260 
decision either choose a life here or
lipo<00:05:06.050> battery<00:05:07.479> I<00:05:08.479> will<00:05:09.199> do<00:05:09.490> another<00:05:10.490> video<00:05:10.819> of

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
lipo battery I will do another video of

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.899 
lipo battery I will do another video of
the<00:05:11.599> nynex<00:05:12.110> are<00:05:12.349> for<00:05:12.680> mixing<00:05:13.129> because<00:05:13.610> I<00:05:13.669> have

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:13.909 
the nynex are for mixing because I have

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:18.939 
the nynex are for mixing because I have
done<00:05:14.150> a<00:05:14.180> mix<00:05:14.889> for<00:05:15.889> the<00:05:16.129> KK<00:05:16.990> 2.0<00:05:17.990> board<00:05:18.349> in<00:05:18.620> which

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
done a mix for the KK 2.0 board in which

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.360 
done a mix for the KK 2.0 board in which
you<00:05:19.129> can<00:05:19.419> arm<00:05:20.419> the<00:05:20.629> board<00:05:21.050> with<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.919> momentary

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
you can arm the board with the momentary

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.939 
you can arm the board with the momentary
switch<00:05:23.919> but<00:05:24.919> I<00:05:25.159> will<00:05:25.599> make<00:05:26.599> this<00:05:26.779> video<00:05:27.740> for
