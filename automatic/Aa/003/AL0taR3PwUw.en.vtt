don't know guys look at that it's done

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:16.360 
don't know guys look at that it's done
that's<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.610> it's<00:02:11.390> over<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:14.260> don't<00:02:15.260> know<00:02:15.380> but<00:02:15.650> the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
that's it it's over I don't know but the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.100 
that's it it's over I don't know but the
thing<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.300> you're<00:02:17.480> not<00:02:17.630> having<00:02:18.080> to

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
thing is is that you're not having to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.949 
thing is is that you're not having to
fly<00:02:18.590> through<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.040> rings<00:02:19.459> on<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.450> one<00:02:20.750> which

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
fly through the rings on this one which

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.009 
fly through the rings on this one which
I<00:02:21.110> think<00:02:21.380> makes<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.459> huge<00:02:23.030> difference<00:02:23.600> because

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
I think makes a huge difference because

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.560 
I think makes a huge difference because
the<00:02:24.800> Rings<00:02:25.040> for<00:02:25.430> me<00:02:25.989> navigating<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:28.430> bird<00:02:28.790> to

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
the Rings for me navigating that bird to

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.180 
the Rings for me navigating that bird to
make<00:02:29.750> sure<00:02:30.019> that<00:02:30.620> you<00:02:30.739> were<00:02:30.860> going<00:02:31.160> through

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
make sure that you were going through

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.759 
make sure that you were going through
all<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.700> Rings<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:33.140> know<00:02:33.350> going<00:02:33.650> back

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
all the Rings and you know going back

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.290 
all the Rings and you know going back
and<00:02:34.130> forth<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.610> make<00:02:34.790> sure<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.209> were

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
and forth to make sure that you were

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.790 
and forth to make sure that you were
getting<00:02:35.420> them<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:35.810> getting<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.110> comet<00:02:36.530> metal

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
getting them and getting the comet metal

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.259 
getting them and getting the comet metal
that<00:02:36.950> was<00:02:37.190> probably<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.820> most<00:02:38.060> difficult

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
that was probably the most difficult

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.650 
that was probably the most difficult
part<00:02:38.630> so<00:02:39.280> this<00:02:40.280> is<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:40.610> know<00:02:40.760> I<00:02:40.790> guess<00:02:41.090> I<00:02:41.120> know

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
part so this is you know I guess I know

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.420 
part so this is you know I guess I know
just<00:02:41.900> having<00:02:42.110> it<00:02:42.320> be<00:02:42.440> a<00:02:42.470> race<00:02:42.769> really<00:02:43.190> it

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
just having it be a race really it

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.270 
just having it be a race really it
wasn't<00:02:43.670> too<00:02:44.060> bad<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.360> guess

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
wasn't too bad I guess

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.370 
wasn't too bad I guess
but<00:02:46.240> yeah<00:02:46.390> so<00:02:46.630> that's<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.930> hundred<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.319> three

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
but yeah so that's a hundred and three

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.460 
but yeah so that's a hundred and three
stars<00:02:47.770> now<00:02:48.069> and<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:49.300> completes<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.900> galaxy

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
stars now and that completes the galaxy

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.910 
stars now and that completes the galaxy
and<00:02:51.480> yeah<00:02:52.480> that's<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.440> we<00:02:53.709> got<00:02:53.860> another

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920
