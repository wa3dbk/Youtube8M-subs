00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.810
 hello friends the massive again here with 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.730
 a little review in between and 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.660
 Although the battle of solo channel 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.280
 shortly thereafter something a little 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.560
 get away before and in the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.180
 next few less reviews come 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.960
 because I'm the season's champion 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.670
 I'm pretty nearly through myself 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.320
 now more on apocalypse mmog star wars 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.039
 mmogs so concentrate there so be there 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.910
 we definitely 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.080
 cool things to face get this 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.450
 even now no video get 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.500
 so now here you want it with it 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.180
 not forever waiting for a content that 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.780
 So next video would either be something 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.690
 greater 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.340
 okay now for the set too long 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.140
 Introducing the set of five minifigures 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.539
 once two super fight truiden two 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.940
 normal fight of the systems after the step 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:00.230
 on it and gave a very very cool push 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.230
 there is a workshop with 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.210
 have the druids now location on the bottom 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.570
 on the fifth rank two plates with 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.619
 a flattened stone on top of it and 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:22.229
 they probably have something 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:23.189
 So do this little cover station 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.689
 to station 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:34.920
 and the dreba adjustable everything 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:37.680
 possible behind such small platforms 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.780
 so they are extra for that one 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.670
 The tablets can set there 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.450
 anyway a hearth orders 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.590
 but otherwise has not fallen over and 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.450
 stand relatively stable 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.399
 in combination with the money from the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.299
 speed makes power sometimes synonymous 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:01.890
 fun one around a bit bit too 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:05.479
 play and that's about it 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.479
 if you all stand in there from here 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:16.380
 Now there is extensive not think so 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:22.440
 he looks like he has his 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:26.490
 Protective position The step is in itself 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.140
 no new design and the 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.300
 stabilizing wing the laser cannon 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.370
 on top 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.800
 and yes, here's the thing about it 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.390
 a bit of ground floats and the fight 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.430
 turned this is not there 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.110
 Weapons but you hang in space on it 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.660
 yes and what would a step be without an opponent 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.740
 Although there are still the parks 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.780
 lift again 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.720
 which is not only one not some 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.750
 normal wax pictures are also the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.510
 old little battle pack knows there were 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:05.910
 yes, this again only in green 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.440
 and slightly less in any case stocked it 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.390
 Unfortunately there are no weapons that one has 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.730
 you have to set the mood with due respect and 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.560
 he had to drive with one hand 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.739
 The clubs can connect with others 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.500
 yes, this is the player he is ahead 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.480
 a small cannon 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.280
 You can do that here if you want that 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.600
 if you push the thing down or 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.320
 it is created from that already has one 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.340
 upped the ante bit power system, the 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.570
 you could always do about the rocket 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.130
 but I can demonstrate it once 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.790
 look so see if I meet the droid 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.590
 and already that has a bit 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.200
 power will be put on four of these 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.600
 do things while the set so that you too 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.410
 always a bit to load 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.030
 So I think it's very much 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.530
 cool and then you can on his 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.700
 really break something or 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.180
 umschmeiÃŸen 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.650
 depending on what you want to achieve yes that 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.730
 it was from this small is 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.470
 of course as I said now will be back 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.769
 max i may even have 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.709
 idea maybe something mediocre 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.610
 close 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.050
 so i have tons of every 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.760
 ideas so it will definitely be 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.010
 things are coming now is long 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.660
 a video came because i was with all sorts of things 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.609
 was busy 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.930
 well so i hope this will do that 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.820
 has let you thumb up 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.280
 if you liked it I have 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.120
 I 'm sure I'll be happy to know you 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.120
 on it and bye
