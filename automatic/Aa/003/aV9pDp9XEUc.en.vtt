00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
looking like this but you can really do

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.410 
looking like this but you can really do
some<00:00:55.320> powerful<00:00:55.590> things<00:00:56.000> within<00:00:57.000> quiz<00:00:57.300> maker

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
some powerful things within quiz maker

so<00:00:58.170> now<00:00:59.100> all<00:00:59.219> I've<00:00:59.460> done<00:00:59.579> is<00:01:00.109> with<00:01:01.109> these

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
so now all I've done is with these

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.680 
so now all I've done is with these
different<00:01:01.559> objects<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:02.579> make<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.090> link

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
different objects I then make the link

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.649 
different objects I then make the link
buttons<00:01:04.019> cover<00:01:04.409> those<00:01:04.650> objects<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.659> it's

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
buttons cover those objects and it's

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.380 
buttons cover those objects and it's
actually<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.770> still<00:01:07.979> leave<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
actually you can you can still leave the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.000 
actually you can you can still leave the
randomization<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.990> answers<00:01:10.680> where<00:01:10.920> it

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
randomization on of answers where it

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.399 
randomization on of answers where it
shuffles<00:01:11.310> them<00:01:11.549> as<00:01:12.479> long<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.020> make<00:01:13.260> sure

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
shuffles them as long as you make sure

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.320 
shuffles them as long as you make sure
that<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.770> boxes<00:01:14.159> are<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> same<00:01:14.580> size<00:01:14.820> it'll

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
that the boxes are the same size it'll

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.460 
that the boxes are the same size it'll
just<00:01:15.479> shuffle<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.930> different<00:01:16.229> answers

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
just shuffle the different answers

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.399 
just shuffle the different answers
through<00:01:16.740> there<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
through there so I have the the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.240 
through there so I have the the
background<00:01:19.799> image<00:01:21.590> put<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.680> there<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.040> in

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
background image put in there in the in

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.999 
background image put in there in the in
the<00:01:23.369> slide<00:01:23.700> master<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.479> then<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.590> characters

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
the slide master and then the characters

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.690 
the slide master and then the characters
are<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.520> there<00:01:26.670> as<00:01:26.930> individual<00:01:27.930> files<00:01:28.700> let's

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
are in there as individual files let's

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.539 
are in there as individual files let's
do<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> quick<00:01:29.970> preview<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:34.430> of<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:36.030> output

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
do a quick preview of the of the output

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.069 
do a quick preview of the of the output
okay<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.610> here<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:38.939> go<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.210> you'll<00:01:39.329> see<00:01:39.540> as<00:01:39.810> I

okay so here we go and you'll see as I

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.730 
okay so here we go and you'll see as I
mouse<00:01:40.290> over<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:41.040> highlights<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.790> text<00:01:42.210> box

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
mouse over it highlights the text box

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.270 
mouse over it highlights the text box
and<00:01:43.790> if<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.909> select<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.869> click<00:01:46.439> Submit<00:01:47.009> I

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
and if I select this and click Submit I

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.310 
and if I select this and click Submit I
get<00:01:47.790> feedback<00:01:48.180> based<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.689> answer<00:01:48.899> so

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
again you're getting a custom feedback

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.359 
again you're getting a custom feedback
in<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.750> challenge<00:01:52.259> choice<00:01:52.770> consequence

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
in the challenge choice consequence

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.330 
in the challenge choice consequence
model<00:01:53.759> here<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:55.350> then<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.799> have<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.130> set<00:01:56.280> so

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
model here and then I have it set so

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.450 
model here and then I have it set so
that<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.640> can<00:01:56.759> retry<00:01:58.250> because<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.369> is

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
that you can retry because this is

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.050 
that you can retry because this is
really<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.670> learning<00:02:00.030> experience<00:02:01.880> there's<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
really a learning experience there's the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.520 
really a learning experience there's the
right<00:02:03.210> answer<00:02:03.540> correct<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.229> would<00:02:04.409> then

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
right answer correct and that would then

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.440 
right answer correct and that would then
allow<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:05.040> advance<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:06.180> right<00:02:06.299> let's

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
allow you to advance all right let's

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.450 
allow you to advance all right let's
close<00:02:06.600> out<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.780> that

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
close out of that

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.700 
close out of that
the<00:02:08.910> power<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.300> quiz<00:02:09.480> maker<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.930> really<00:02:10.200> being

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
the power and quiz maker is really being

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.520 
the power and quiz maker is really being
able<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.980> duplicate<00:02:11.870> questions<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.230> string

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
able to duplicate questions and string

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.340 
able to duplicate questions and string
them<00:02:13.560> together<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:14.070> create<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.730> course<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.720> if<00:02:16.170> I

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
them together to create a course so if I

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.010 
them together to create a course so if I
just<00:02:16.380> go<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:17.130> first<00:02:17.340> question<00:02:17.930> let's<00:02:18.930> say

correct<00:03:02.760> answer<00:03:03.210> is<00:03:03.360> here<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.170> let's<00:03:04.350> say<00:03:04.440> we

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
correct answer is here so let's say we

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.140 
correct answer is here so let's say we
want<00:03:04.740> a<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:04.980> be<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.280> correct<00:03:05.430> answer<00:03:05.850> I<00:03:06.000> can

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
want a to be the correct answer I can

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.240 
want a to be the correct answer I can
also<00:03:06.300> do<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.600> in<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.780> slide<00:03:07.050> view<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:08.040> if<00:03:08.130> i<00:03:08.220> go

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
also do that in a slide view so if i go

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.690 
also do that in a slide view so if i go
back<00:03:08.490> and<00:03:08.820> then<00:03:08.910> i<00:03:09.030> say<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.600> is<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:11.040> correct<00:03:11.280> one

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
back and then i say a is the correct one

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.520 
back and then i say a is the correct one
you'll<00:03:11.970> see<00:03:12.120> i<00:03:12.150> go<00:03:12.300> back<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.480> form<00:03:12.810> view<00:03:12.960> it's

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
you'll see i go back to form view it's

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.640 
you'll see i go back to form view it's
now<00:03:13.710> switch<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.910> now<00:03:15.270> i<00:03:15.690> could<00:03:16.470> just

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
now switch to a and now i could just

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.930 
now switch to a and now i could just
change<00:03:16.860> that<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.490> say<00:03:20.510> night<00:03:21.680> nice<00:03:22.680> work
