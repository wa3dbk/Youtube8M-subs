00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
should be intolerably 17 because all the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.060 
should be intolerably 17 because all the

me that I think that the redstone update
the<00:01:21.270> 1.5<00:01:21.840> update<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> one<00:01:22.590> after<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.220> one

the 1.5 update the one after this one

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.609 
the 1.5 update the one after this one
they<00:01:24.299> knew<00:01:24.570> there<00:01:24.780> would<00:01:24.869> be<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.020> really<00:01:25.350> big

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
they knew there would be a really big

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.690 
they knew there would be a really big
deal<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.830> try<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.189> fit<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.430> will<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.610> one

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
deal to try and fit that will in one

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.399 
deal to try and fit that will in one
update<00:01:26.970> because<00:01:27.090> redstone<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.170> current

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
update because redstone on the current

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.319 
update because redstone on the current
consoles<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.979> little<00:01:29.549> bit<00:01:29.759> nerve<00:01:30.000> compared

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
consoles is a little bit nerve compared

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.390 
consoles is a little bit nerve compared
pc<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.079> i<00:01:31.110> assume<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.680> they're<00:01:31.799> gonna<00:01:32.009> split

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
pc so i assume that they're gonna split

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.710 
pc so i assume that they're gonna split
into<00:01:32.640> two<00:01:32.759> updates<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.360> they're<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.659> to

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
into two updates and they're going to

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.870 
into two updates and they're going to
put<00:01:33.990> one<00:01:34.290> home<00:01:34.470> fit<00:01:34.740> until<00:01:34.979> update<00:01:35.250> 17<00:01:35.700> and

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
put one home fit until update 17 and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.210 
put one home fit until update 17 and
then<00:01:36.329> one<00:01:36.509> half<00:01:36.720> until<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.259> big<00:01:37.470> 19<00:01:37.829> or<00:01:37.950> 20<00:01:38.189> or

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
then one half until a big 19 or 20 or

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.130 
then one half until a big 19 or 20 or
whatever<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.549> gets<00:01:38.700> called<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.479> one-off<00:01:39.840> tell

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
whatever it gets called the one-off tell

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.859 
whatever it gets called the one-off tell
update<00:01:40.380> 17<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.210> let's<00:01:42.210> quickly<00:01:42.570> talk<00:01:42.810> about

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
update 17 so let's quickly talk about

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.389 
update 17 so let's quickly talk about
wifing<00:01:43.320> there'll<00:01:43.470> be<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.680> case<00:01:43.860> because<00:01:44.040> if

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
wifing there'll be the case because if

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.920 
wifing there'll be the case because if
you<00:01:44.700> don't<00:01:44.790> know<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> lot<00:01:45.119> bow<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.570> might

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
you don't know a lot bow it that might

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.569 
you don't know a lot bow it that might
sound<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.799> logical<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:47.490> i'm

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
sound like it's just a logical but i'm

sound like it's just a logical but i'm
going<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.759> explain<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.240> redstone<00:01:48.540> update<00:01:48.600> now

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
going to explain the redstone update now

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.870 
going to explain the redstone update now
i'm<00:01:49.560> gonna<00:01:49.680> switch<00:01:49.770> over<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.070> pc<00:01:50.430> now<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:50.729> i<00:01:50.759> can

over<00:01:52.500> there<00:01:52.680> now<00:01:52.799> okay<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.520> now<00:01:53.790> we're<00:01:53.939> on<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
over there now okay so now we're on the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.969 
over there now okay so now we're on the
pc<00:01:54.509> i<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.869> explain<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.350> guys<00:01:55.530> why<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.770> think

pc i can explain to you guys why I think

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.380 
pc i can explain to you guys why I think
the<00:01:56.250> redstone<00:01:56.610> update<00:01:56.700> will<00:01:57.060> need<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.360> be

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
the redstone update will need to be

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.940 
the redstone update will need to be
split<00:01:57.689> into<00:01:57.810> two<00:01:57.960> updates<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.409> xbox<00:01:58.799> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
split into two updates on xbox and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.590 
split into two updates on xbox and
therefore<00:01:59.820> what<00:01:59.969> will<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.180> coming<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.570> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
therefore what will be coming in the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.719 
therefore what will be coming in the
first<00:02:00.869> half<00:02:01.170> or<00:02:01.469> tell<00:02:01.619> update<00:02:01.829> 17<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.430> update

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
first half or tell update 17 the update

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.609 
first half or tell update 17 the update
you'll<00:02:02.880> no<00:02:03.060> doubt<00:02:03.090> interested<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.500> we'll

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
you'll no doubt interested in so we'll

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.319 
you'll no doubt interested in so we'll
demonstrate<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.490> using<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.880> daylight

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
demonstrate this using the daylight

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.240 
demonstrate this using the daylight
sensor<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> daylight<00:02:07.170> sensor<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:08.009> block

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
sensor so the daylight sensor is a block

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.070 
sensor so the daylight sensor is a block
crafted<00:02:08.729> using<00:02:08.759> never<00:02:09.390> courts<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.020> the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
crafted using never courts so it's the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.750 
crafted using never courts so it's the
first<00:02:10.319> redstone<00:02:10.739> item<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.099> takes<00:02:11.250> use<00:02:11.550> of

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
first redstone item that takes use of

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.580 
first redstone item that takes use of
the<00:02:11.940> block<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.450> we've<00:02:12.569> had<00:02:12.720> for

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
the block that we've had for

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.559 
the block that we've had for
you<00:02:13.680> know<00:02:13.830> for<00:02:14.129> update<00:02:14.459> now<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.849> it'll<00:02:15.360> be<00:02:15.420> an

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
you know for update now and it'll be an

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.360 
you know for update now and it'll be an
update<00:02:15.720> we<00:02:16.080> apply<00:02:16.319> then<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.709> basically<00:02:17.099> what

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
update we apply then and basically what

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.670 
update we apply then and basically what
we<00:02:17.459> know<00:02:17.580> they<00:02:17.910> like<00:02:18.030> sensor<00:02:18.330> does<00:02:18.569> after<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
we know they like sensor does after the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.070 
we know they like sensor does after the
Reds<00:02:19.890> don't<00:02:20.010> change<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:21.209> basically<00:02:21.629> gives

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
Reds don't change is it basically gives

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.630 
Reds don't change is it basically gives
it<00:02:22.319> outputs<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.920> different<00:02:23.190> signal<00:02:23.310> strength

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
it outputs a different signal strength

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.820 
it outputs a different signal strength
based<00:02:23.910> on<00:02:24.060> how<00:02:24.180> light<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.540> outside<00:02:24.959> because

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
based on how light is outside because

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.500 
based on how light is outside because
before<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.370> update<00:02:26.730> red<00:02:26.940> stones<00:02:27.180> just<00:02:27.330> on

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
before this update red stones just on

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.059 
before this update red stones just on
Iran<00:02:27.750> itself<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.230> gives<00:02:28.379> you<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.530> full<00:02:28.680> 15

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
Iran itself it gives you a full 15

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.070 
Iran itself it gives you a full 15
blocks<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.400> power<00:02:29.550> but<00:02:30.060> after<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.599> there<00:02:30.959> are

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
blocks of power but after this there are

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.869 
blocks of power but after this there are
a<00:02:31.110> few<00:02:31.440> items<00:02:31.590> like<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.129> weighted<00:02:32.459> presh<00:02:32.640> play

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
a few items like the weighted presh play

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.550 
a few items like the weighted presh play
and<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.269> daylight<00:02:33.510> sensor<00:02:33.840> there<00:02:34.200> depending

and the daylight sensor there depending

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.960 
and the daylight sensor there depending
on<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.890> time<00:02:35.129> of<00:02:35.160> day<00:02:35.310> or<00:02:35.459> depend<00:02:35.819> on<00:02:35.910> the

different<00:02:42.330> applications<00:02:42.599> but<00:02:43.319> it<00:02:43.410> also<00:02:43.560> you

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
different applications but it also you

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.229 
different applications but it also you
know<00:02:44.010> might<00:02:44.250> be<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.400> difficult<00:02:44.879> thing<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.030> put

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
know might be a difficult thing to put

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.940 
know might be a difficult thing to put
in<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.900> might<00:02:46.140> be<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.319> reason<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.829> they're

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
in and it might be a reason that they're

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.160 
in and it might be a reason that they're
going<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.099> splints<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.519> update<00:02:47.819> sub<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.450> think

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
going to splints to update sub I think

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.360 
going to splints to update sub I think
the<00:02:49.230> daylight<00:02:49.500> sense<00:02:49.650> will<00:02:49.799> still<00:02:49.980> be<00:02:50.069> coming

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
the daylight sense will still be coming

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.130 
the daylight sense will still be coming
just<00:02:50.940> with<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.120> very<00:02:51.360> slight<00:02:51.660> caveat<00:02:52.110> that

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
just with a very slight caveat that

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.870 
just with a very slight caveat that
instead<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.620> being<00:02:52.739> you<00:02:53.370> know<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.489> natural

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
instead of being you know a natural

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.370 
instead of being you know a natural
sense<00:02:54.090> from<00:02:54.269> being<00:02:54.510> like<00:02:54.660> different<00:02:55.230> day

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
sense from being like different day

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.630 
sense from being like different day
light<00:02:55.560> levels<00:02:55.829> mean<00:02:56.010> different<00:02:56.250> things<00:02:56.280> I

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
light levels mean different things I

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.460 
light levels mean different things I
think<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.150> will<00:02:57.239> literally<00:02:57.510> just<00:02:57.780> be<00:02:57.959> on<00:02:58.200> or

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
think it will literally just be on or

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.020 
think it will literally just be on or
I'll<00:02:58.590> be<00:02:58.709> off<00:02:58.860> which<00:02:59.129> is<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.340> cool<00:02:59.640> enough<00:02:59.849> thing

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
I'll be off which is a cool enough thing

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.339 
I'll be off which is a cool enough thing
because<00:03:00.269> it<00:03:00.390> still<00:03:00.569> means<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.780> can<00:03:00.900> add<00:03:00.989> or<00:03:01.200> so

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
because it still means you can add or so

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.020 
because it still means you can add or so
that<00:03:01.440> only<00:03:01.560> open<00:03:01.829> at<00:03:01.890> night<00:03:02.040> time<00:03:02.250> or<00:03:02.459> doors

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
that only open at night time or doors

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.670 
that only open at night time or doors
only<00:03:03.209> have<00:03:03.390> daytime<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:03.959> can<00:03:04.230> have<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.470> whole

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
only have daytime you can have a whole

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.069 
only have daytime you can have a whole
bunch<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.250> useful<00:03:05.519> stuff<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.629> i<00:03:06.660> I'm

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
bunch of the useful stuff I i I'm

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.270 
bunch of the useful stuff I i I'm
looking<00:03:07.230> forward<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.829> daylight<00:03:08.069> since

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
looking forward to the daylight since

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.190 
looking forward to the daylight since
personally<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.690> think<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:09.959> will<00:03:10.079> be<00:03:10.140> in

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
personally and I think it will be in

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.680 
personally and I think it will be in
Thailand<00:03:10.440> 17<00:03:10.769> so<00:03:10.950> next<00:03:11.129> we<00:03:11.819> have<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.269> hopper

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
Thailand 17 so next we have the hopper

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.479 
Thailand 17 so next we have the hopper
this<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.049> a<00:03:13.079> feature<00:03:13.379> confirm<00:03:13.920> becoming<00:03:14.430> at

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
this is a feature confirm becoming at

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.460 
this is a feature confirm becoming at
some<00:03:14.730> point<00:03:14.940> soon<00:03:15.150> it's<00:03:15.959> live<00:03:16.110> on<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.319> few

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
some point soon it's live on the few

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.780 
some point soon it's live on the few
features<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.890> they<00:03:17.010> definitely<00:03:17.310> confirmed

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
features that they definitely confirmed

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.670 
features that they definitely confirmed
even<00:03:18.720> though<00:03:18.810> they<00:03:18.959> basically<00:03:19.290> confirmed

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
even though they basically confirmed

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.530 
even though they basically confirmed
loved<00:03:19.980> ones<00:03:20.160> but<00:03:20.549> basically<00:03:20.819> are<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.209> hopper

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
loved ones but basically are the hopper

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.930 
loved ones but basically are the hopper
is<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.989> item<00:03:22.530> which<00:03:22.829> is<00:03:23.040> useful<00:03:23.280> in<00:03:23.579> a<00:03:23.700> few

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
is a item which is useful in a few

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.819 
is a item which is useful in a few
contraptions<00:03:24.299> because<00:03:24.840> what<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.410> does<00:03:25.440> is

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
contraptions because what it does is

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.520 
contraptions because what it does is
just<00:03:26.310> when<00:03:26.519> it's<00:03:26.639> by<00:03:26.790> itself<00:03:27.230> when<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.350> throw

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
just when it's by itself when you throw

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.960 
just when it's by itself when you throw
items<00:03:28.739> into<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.160> like<00:03:29.220> this<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:29.400> drop<00:03:29.700> them<00:03:29.849> in

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
items into it like this you drop them in

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.849 
items into it like this you drop them in
it<00:03:30.269> absorbs<00:03:30.840> them<00:03:31.049> and<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.349> puts<00:03:31.590> them<00:03:31.739> into

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
it absorbs them and it puts them into

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.259 
it absorbs them and it puts them into
its<00:03:32.069> own<00:03:32.190> little<00:03:32.340> you<00:03:32.609> know<00:03:32.700> pouch<00:03:33.000> thing

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
its own little you know pouch thing

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.330 
its own little you know pouch thing
there<00:03:33.480> it's<00:03:33.660> kind<00:03:34.019> of<00:03:34.139> like<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.349> chest<00:03:34.709> except

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
there it's kind of like a chest except

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.710 
there it's kind of like a chest except
you<00:03:35.400> can<00:03:35.519> literally<00:03:35.700> job<00:03:35.970> items<00:03:36.329> into<00:03:36.510> it

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
you can literally job items into it

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.120 
you can literally job items into it
which<00:03:36.870> is<00:03:37.109> a<00:03:37.290> really<00:03:37.620> interesting<00:03:37.650> level

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
which is a really interesting level

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.370 
which is a really interesting level
mechanic<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:39.060> also<00:03:39.420> if<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.780> point<00:03:40.079> it<00:03:40.200> at<00:03:40.319> a

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
mechanic and also if you point it at a

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.309 
mechanic and also if you point it at a
block<00:03:40.620> so<00:03:40.859> if<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:41.040> point<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.459> at<00:03:41.609> this<00:03:41.910> blog<00:03:42.319> it

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
block so if I point it at this blog it

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.930 
block so if I point it at this blog it
will<00:03:43.470> help<00:03:43.590> put<00:03:43.799> things<00:03:43.829> into<00:03:44.280> that<00:03:44.549> blog<00:03:44.790> so

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
will help put things into that blog so

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.129 
will help put things into that blog so
if<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.060> then<00:03:45.150> replace<00:03:45.419> this<00:03:45.599> with<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.840> chest

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
if you then replace this with a chest

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.349 
if you then replace this with a chest
like<00:03:46.380> I've<00:03:46.919> done<00:03:47.010> in<00:03:47.130> front<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:47.400> here<00:03:47.549> as<00:03:48.239> you

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
like I've done in front of here as you

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:49.819 
like I've done in front of here as you
can<00:03:48.419> see<00:03:48.510> if<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:48.870> just<00:03:49.049> pick<00:03:49.230> this<00:03:49.410> up<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.769> then

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
can see if I just pick this up and then

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.490 
can see if I just pick this up and then
throw<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.579> sand<00:03:50.849> into<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.359> dropper<00:03:51.989> I'll

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
throw the sand into the dropper I'll

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.140 
throw the sand into the dropper I'll
actually<00:03:52.650> take<00:03:52.889> it<00:03:53.040> into<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.340> chest<00:03:53.639> and<00:03:53.849> this

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
actually take it into the chest and this

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.670 
actually take it into the chest and this
means<00:03:54.389> you<00:03:54.480> can<00:03:54.510> like<00:03:54.780> have<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.139> chest<00:03:55.380> hidden

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
means you can like have the chest hidden

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.199 
means you can like have the chest hidden
for<00:03:55.799> instance<00:03:56.099> so<00:03:56.250> we'll<00:03:56.340> use<00:03:56.370> these<00:03:56.849> redstone

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
for instance so we'll use these redstone

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.400 
for instance so we'll use these redstone
blocks<00:03:57.389> which<00:03:57.540> I'll<00:03:57.660> talk<00:03:57.780> about<00:03:57.840> in<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.049> second

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
blocks which I'll talk about in a second

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.289 
blocks which I'll talk about in a second
you<00:03:59.130> can<00:03:59.250> actually<00:03:59.340> hide<00:03:59.669> it<00:03:59.849> from<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.090> chest

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
you can actually hide it from the chest

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.300 
you can actually hide it from the chest

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
search just like oh you just drop it in

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.159 
search just like oh you just drop it in
there<00:04:02.459> or<00:04:02.669> you<00:04:02.730> can<00:04:02.849> even<00:04:02.940> make<00:04:03.120> it<00:04:03.299> so<00:04:03.540> it's<00:04:04.049> a

and then song gets a thing so you can

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.979 
and then song gets a thing so you can
also<00:04:08.639> then<00:04:08.849> make<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.060> redstone<00:04:09.329> signal<00:04:09.690> from

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
also then make a redstone signal from

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.839 
also then make a redstone signal from
this<00:04:10.169> so<00:04:10.530> you<00:04:10.620> can<00:04:10.739> make<00:04:10.799> suits<00:04:11.069> on<00:04:11.190> has<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:11.669> pay

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
this so you can make suits on has to pay

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.580 
this so you can make suits on has to pay
a<00:04:11.880> block<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.450> get<00:04:12.630> into<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:12.900> certain<00:04:13.109> place<00:04:13.380> and

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
a block to get into a certain place and

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.680 
a block to get into a certain place and
then<00:04:14.430> you<00:04:14.519> can<00:04:14.669> collect<00:04:14.849> that<00:04:15.090> block<00:04:15.359> and<00:04:15.540> use

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
then you can collect that block and use

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.479 
then you can collect that block and use
it<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.900> sound<00:04:16.049> fix<00:04:16.289> let's<00:04:16.650> it's<00:04:16.979> it's<00:04:17.310> a

next<00:04:20.760> let's<00:04:20.940> explain<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.359> redstone<00:04:21.719> block

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
next let's explain the redstone block

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.719 
next let's explain the redstone block
you<00:04:22.079> see<00:04:22.229> we<00:04:22.320> just<00:04:22.500> used<00:04:22.710> here<00:04:22.890> as<00:04:23.010> you<00:04:23.700> know

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
you see we just used here as you know

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.610 
you see we just used here as you know
decoration<00:04:24.270> block<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:25.050> wrist<00:04:25.200> on<00:04:25.349> block<00:04:25.500> is

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
decoration block the wrist on block is

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.440 
decoration block the wrist on block is
crafted<00:04:26.099> using<00:04:26.130> nine<00:04:26.669> redstone

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
crafted using nine redstone

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.940 
crafted using nine redstone
kind<00:04:27.540> of<00:04:27.570> like<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.750> diamond<00:04:28.020> block<00:04:28.470> at<00:04:28.650> emerald

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
kind of like a diamond block at emerald

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.410 
kind of like a diamond block at emerald
block<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.340> I<00:04:29.400> am<00:04:29.490> block<00:04:29.700> any<00:04:30.030> other<00:04:30.210> type

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
block and I am block any other type

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.110 
block and I am block any other type
block<00:04:30.660> and<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:32.430> thing<00:04:32.580> that<00:04:32.610> makes<00:04:32.790> this<00:04:32.880> one

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
block and the thing that makes this one

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.880 
block and the thing that makes this one
unique<00:04:33.360> versus<00:04:33.780> all<00:04:33.900> of<00:04:33.990> those<00:04:34.140> is<00:04:34.380> that<00:04:34.770> it

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
unique versus all of those is that it

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.650 
unique versus all of those is that it
actually<00:04:35.040> can<00:04:35.400> power<00:04:35.640> redstone<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:36.300> has<00:04:36.420> a<00:04:36.450> it

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
actually can power redstone it has a it

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.720 
actually can power redstone it has a it
sends<00:04:36.960> a<00:04:37.020> full<00:04:37.230> charge<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:37.650> redstone<00:04:37.860> along

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
sends a full charge of redstone along

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.250 
sends a full charge of redstone along
itself<00:04:39.090> so<00:04:39.270> let's<00:04:39.420> just<00:04:39.540> show<00:04:39.900> you<00:04:39.960> right<00:04:40.080> hip

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
itself so let's just show you right hip

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.400 
itself so let's just show you right hip
and<00:04:40.670> I<00:04:41.670> think<00:04:41.790> that's<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:42.120> really<00:04:42.150> cool<00:04:42.600> variety

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
block because first of all it's a really

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.610 
block because first of all it's a really
nice-looking<00:04:45.180> block<00:04:45.690> it's<00:04:45.900> already<00:04:46.020> deep

nice-looking block it's already deep
vibrant<00:04:46.980> red<00:04:47.340> and<00:04:47.660> because<00:04:48.660> everyone<00:04:48.900> has<00:04:48.990> so

block made from red stone the alp as a
signal<00:05:20.010> so<00:05:20.580> the<00:05:20.760> final<00:05:21.060> redstone<00:05:21.570> feature<00:05:21.780> I

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
signal so the final redstone feature I

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.270 
signal so the final redstone feature I
think<00:05:22.200> they'll<00:05:22.320> be<00:05:22.380> bringing<00:05:22.530> forward<00:05:23.040> from

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
think they'll be bringing forward from

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.030 
think they'll be bringing forward from
1.5<00:05:23.760> the<00:05:23.820> redstone<00:05:24.390> update<00:05:24.480> is<00:05:24.840> the<00:05:25.500> dropper

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
1.5 the redstone update is the dropper

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.160 
1.5 the redstone update is the dropper
as<00:05:26.220> you<00:05:26.430> can<00:05:26.610> see<00:05:26.820> just<00:05:26.850> here<00:05:27.510> so<00:05:27.930> you<00:05:27.990> might<00:05:28.110> be

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
as you can see just here so you might be

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.660 
as you can see just here so you might be
thinking<00:05:28.260> as<00:05:28.650> soon<00:05:28.860> as<00:05:28.950> you<00:05:29.040> see<00:05:29.220> this<00:05:29.370> wait<00:05:29.640> a

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
thinking as soon as you see this wait a

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.040 
thinking as soon as you see this wait a
minute<00:05:29.880> so<00:05:29.970> you<00:05:30.060> can<00:05:30.240> you<00:05:30.480> just<00:05:30.690> picked<00:05:30.930> out

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
minute so you can you just picked out

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.990 
minute so you can you just picked out
dispenser<00:05:31.530> that's<00:05:31.710> not<00:05:31.860> a<00:05:31.890> dropper<00:05:32.190> all<00:05:32.310> the

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
dispenser that's not a dropper all the

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.490 
dispenser that's not a dropper all the
dropper<00:05:33.270> is<00:05:33.330> actually<00:05:33.660> a<00:05:33.690> variant<00:05:34.140> of<00:05:34.200> the

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
dropper is actually a variant of the

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.560 
dropper is actually a variant of the
dispenser<00:05:35.100> and<00:05:35.250> it's<00:05:35.700> called<00:05:36.120> a<00:05:36.150> whole<00:05:36.330> bunch

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
dispenser and it's called a whole bunch

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.180 
dispenser and it's called a whole bunch
of<00:05:36.660> uses<00:05:36.990> especially<00:05:37.500> if<00:05:37.560> you're<00:05:37.650> making<00:05:37.980> maps

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
of uses especially if you're making maps

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.150 
of uses especially if you're making maps
in<00:05:38.340> that<00:05:38.460> type<00:05:38.640> deal<00:05:38.850> because<00:05:39.920> I'll<00:05:40.920> quickly

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
in that type deal because I'll quickly

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.950 
in that type deal because I'll quickly
show<00:05:41.250> you<00:05:41.430> what<00:05:41.580> it<00:05:41.670> does<00:05:41.790> right<00:05:41.970> now<00:05:42.000> so<00:05:42.300> we're

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
show you what it does right now so we're

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.090 
show you what it does right now so we're
going<00:05:43.050> to<00:05:43.140> put<00:05:43.200> some<00:05:43.260> redstone<00:05:43.530> in<00:05:43.800> there<00:05:43.950> just

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
going to put some redstone in there just

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.080 
going to put some redstone in there just
to<00:05:44.280> shoot<00:05:44.490> so<00:05:44.850> nine<00:05:45.390> redstone<00:05:45.840> simple<00:05:46.350> as<00:05:46.440> that

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
to shoot so nine redstone simple as that

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.880 
to shoot so nine redstone simple as that
basically<00:05:48.090> when<00:05:48.840> you<00:05:48.930> power<00:05:49.200> the<00:05:49.530> dropper

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
basically when you power the dropper

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.860 
basically when you power the dropper
using<00:05:50.790> redstone<00:05:51.060> I'll<00:05:51.300> use<00:05:51.390> this<00:05:51.540> redstone

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
using redstone I'll use this redstone

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.360 
using redstone I'll use this redstone
block<00:05:52.200> combine<00:05:52.590> two<00:05:52.740> things<00:05:52.950> at<00:05:53.040> once<00:05:53.190> here

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
block combine two things at once here

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.850 
block combine two things at once here
instead<00:05:54.240> of<00:05:54.300> firing<00:05:54.960> items<00:05:55.350> at<00:05:55.500> you<00:05:55.620> it<00:05:55.800> just

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
instead of firing items at you it just

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.220 
instead of firing items at you it just
drops<00:05:56.340> them<00:05:56.580> like<00:05:56.850> that<00:05:57.060> like<00:05:57.300> a<00:05:57.660> dispenser

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
drops them like that like a dispenser

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.050 
drops them like that like a dispenser
would<00:05:58.320> just<00:05:58.470> fire<00:05:58.950> the<00:05:59.220> item<00:05:59.520> way<00:05:59.640> over<00:05:59.820> there

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
would just fire the item way over there

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.790 
would just fire the item way over there
the<00:06:00.420> drop<00:06:00.600> is<00:06:00.630> just<00:06:00.900> like<00:06:01.050> yeah<00:06:01.230> hit<00:06:01.530> have<00:06:01.710> an

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
the drop is just like yeah hit have an

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.580 
the drop is just like yeah hit have an
item<00:06:02.100> which<00:06:02.310> is<00:06:02.460> a<00:06:02.490> lot<00:06:02.850> more<00:06:02.880> friendly<00:06:03.120> and

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
item which is a lot more friendly and

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.660 
item which is a lot more friendly and
it's<00:06:04.590> just<00:06:04.740> generally<00:06:05.070> better<00:06:05.250> for<00:06:05.520> if<00:06:05.580> you've

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
it's just generally better for if you've

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:06.710 
it's just generally better for if you've
given<00:06:05.880> people<00:06:06.090> like<00:06:06.180> some<00:06:06.330> swap<00:06:06.540> than

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
given people like some swap than

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.210 
given people like some swap than
throwing<00:06:06.900> them<00:06:07.050> at<00:06:07.140> them<00:06:07.320> and<00:06:07.710> on<00:06:07.890> top<00:06:08.070> of<00:06:08.100> that

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
throwing them at them and on top of that

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.980 
throwing them at them and on top of that
instead<00:06:08.790> of<00:06:08.850> firing<00:06:09.210> arrows<00:06:09.420> at<00:06:09.690> you<00:06:09.780> and

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
instead of firing arrows at you and

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.360 
instead of firing arrows at you and
instead<00:06:10.380> of<00:06:10.440> you<00:06:10.590> know<00:06:10.620> using<00:06:10.860> pockets<00:06:11.250> of

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
instead of you know using pockets of

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.710 
instead of you know using pockets of
Laura<00:06:11.670> buckets<00:06:11.940> water<00:06:12.150> and<00:06:12.330> just<00:06:12.390> pouring

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
to do it the new dropper block so all of

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.050 
to do it the new dropper block so all of
this<00:06:28.260> stuff<00:06:28.500> can<00:06:28.770> be<00:06:28.800> combined<00:06:29.280> of<00:06:29.400> course<00:06:29.640> you

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
this stuff can be combined of course you

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.870 
this stuff can be combined of course you
can<00:06:30.240> make<00:06:30.390> it<00:06:30.600> so<00:06:30.900> add<00:06:31.260> a<00:06:31.470> light<00:06:31.680> sensor<00:06:31.950> hooks

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
can make it so add a light sensor hooks

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.030 
can make it so add a light sensor hooks
up<00:06:33.060> to<00:06:33.090> a<00:06:33.240> redstone<00:06:33.600> block<00:06:33.990> which<00:06:34.230> then<00:06:34.530> makes

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.040 
up to a redstone block which then makes

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.130 
up to a redstone block which then makes
a<00:06:35.190> dropper<00:06:35.490> turn<00:06:35.730> on<00:06:35.910> after<00:06:36.150> you've<00:06:36.750> given<00:06:37.050> it

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
a dropper turn on after you've given it

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.710 
a dropper turn on after you've given it
an<00:06:37.380> item<00:06:37.830> in<00:06:37.920> the<00:06:38.010> hopper<00:06:38.340> or<00:06:38.550> something<00:06:38.970> and

an item in the hopper or something and

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.850 
an item in the hopper or something and
yeah<00:06:40.020> it's<00:06:40.680> good

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
yeah it's good

a whole<00:06:41.069> bunch<00:06:41.189> of<00:06:41.310> new<00:06:41.460> possibilities<00:06:41.610> to

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
a whole bunch of new possibilities to

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.939 
a whole bunch of new possibilities to
redstone<00:06:42.389> makers<00:06:42.840> I'm<00:06:43.199> looking<00:06:43.680> forward<00:06:43.860> to

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:43.949 
redstone makers I'm looking forward to

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:45.709 
redstone makers I'm looking forward to
