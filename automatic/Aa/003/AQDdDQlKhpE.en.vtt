obviously<00:03:26.400> if<00:03:26.549> you're<00:03:26.669> not<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.819> fan<00:03:26.879> of<00:03:27.090> goats

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
obviously if you're not a fan of goats

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.300 
obviously if you're not a fan of goats
cheese<00:03:27.659> you<00:03:27.900> can<00:03:28.019> simply<00:03:28.560> replace<00:03:28.889> it<00:03:29.159> with<00:03:29.280> a

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
cheese you can simply replace it with a

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.920 
cheese you can simply replace it with a
different<00:03:29.669> type<00:03:29.819> of<00:03:29.969> cheese<00:03:30.180> or<00:03:30.510> leave<00:03:30.719> it<00:03:30.840> out

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
different type of cheese or leave it out

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.689 
different type of cheese or leave it out
altogether<00:03:31.169> I<00:03:31.739> think<00:03:32.219> it<00:03:32.310> adds<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:32.669> great

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:32.699 
altogether I think it adds a great

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.789 
altogether I think it adds a great
contrast<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.629> the<00:03:33.719> pumpkin<00:03:34.079> but<00:03:34.469> that's<00:03:34.650> just

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
contrast to the pumpkin but that's just

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.099 
contrast to the pumpkin but that's just
me<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.669> this<00:03:35.819> could<00:03:36.000> either<00:03:36.209> be<00:03:36.449> a<00:03:36.569> main<00:03:36.870> meal

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
me so this could either be a main meal

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.899 
me so this could either be a main meal
or<00:03:37.379> you<00:03:37.469> could<00:03:37.620> serve<00:03:37.889> it<00:03:37.980> as<00:03:38.099> a<00:03:38.129> side<00:03:38.219> dish

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
or you could serve it as a side dish

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.270 
or you could serve it as a side dish
either<00:03:39.150> way<00:03:39.359> it's<00:03:39.659> absolutely<00:03:40.530> delicious<00:03:40.769> but

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
either way it's absolutely delicious but
