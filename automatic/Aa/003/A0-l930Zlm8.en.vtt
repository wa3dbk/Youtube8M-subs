00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
thing I wanted to talk about is the fact

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.070 
thing I wanted to talk about is the fact
that<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> monthly<00:00:28.800> manga<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.080> I

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
that this is a monthly manga and I

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.500 
that this is a monthly manga and I
actually<00:00:31.560> thought<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.640> wouldn't<00:00:33.030> like

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
actually thought that I wouldn't like

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.540 
actually thought that I wouldn't like
that<00:00:33.750> because<00:00:33.960> i<00:00:34.079> was<00:00:34.290> like<00:00:34.559> thinking<00:00:35.309> that

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
that because i was like thinking that

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.850 
that because i was like thinking that
that's<00:00:35.820> kind<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.300> silly<00:00:36.570> how<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:37.620> like

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
that's kind of silly how it's just like

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.310 
that's kind of silly how it's just like
some<00:00:38.129> separate<00:00:38.670> manga<00:00:39.180> from<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.809> anime

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
some separate manga from the anime

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.910 
some separate manga from the anime
because<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> anime<00:00:41.489> comes<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:42.000> weekly<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.989> i

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
because the anime comes on weekly and i

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.470 
because the anime comes on weekly and i
thought<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.370> would<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.579> just<00:00:44.820> kind<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.239> silly

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
thought it would be just kind of silly

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.450 
thought it would be just kind of silly
to<00:00:45.570> read<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.050> because<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.620> would<00:00:46.739> be<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.129> behind

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
to read it because it would be so behind

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.270 
to read it because it would be so behind
right<00:00:47.820> well<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:49.320> second<00:00:49.829> chapter<00:00:50.010> has

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
right well this second chapter has

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.060 
right well this second chapter has
proven<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.820> me<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.809> not<00:00:52.230> going<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.860> fall

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
proven to me that it's not going to fall

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.450 
proven to me that it's not going to fall
behind<00:00:53.309> because<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.570> already<00:00:54.960> ahead<00:00:55.460> it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
behind because it's already ahead it

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.869 
behind because it's already ahead it
looks<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.890> manga<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.370> going<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.699> be

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
looks like the manga is just going to be

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.429 
looks like the manga is just going to be
kind<00:01:00.739> of<00:01:01.739> very<00:01:02.579> separate<00:01:03.090> from<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.390> anime<00:01:03.780> but

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
kind of very separate from the anime but

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.330 
kind of very separate from the anime but
mostly<00:01:05.360> it's<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.510> going<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.950> very

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
mostly it's just going to be like a very

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.420 
mostly it's just going to be like a very
fast<00:01:08.729> version<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.510> assume<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.740> maybe<00:01:11.159> that's

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
fast version I assume so maybe that's

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.420 
fast version I assume so maybe that's
why<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.630> monthly<00:01:13.110> manga<00:01:13.530> instead<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.250> by

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
why it's a monthly manga instead so by

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.850 
why it's a monthly manga instead so by
the<00:01:14.460> time<00:01:14.610> we<00:01:15.390> read<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.960> next<00:01:16.140> chapter<00:01:16.320> will

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the time we read the next chapter will

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.730 
the time we read the next chapter will
have<00:01:17.100> seen<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:18.000> last<00:01:18.240> chapter<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.409> anime

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
have seen the last chapter in the anime

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.490 
have seen the last chapter in the anime
already<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.420> think<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.960> really<00:01:22.170> nice

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
already so I think it's a really nice

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.850 
already so I think it's a really nice
balance<00:01:23.220> between<00:01:23.509> monthly<00:01:24.509> manga<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.200> weekly

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
balance between monthly manga and weekly

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.460 
balance between monthly manga and weekly

just wants to fight period and that's
kind<00:04:03.500> of<00:04:03.590> how<00:04:03.769> Bureau<00:04:04.190> says<00:04:04.459> I<00:04:04.640> feel<00:04:05.080> it's<00:04:06.080> just

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
kind of how Bureau says I feel it's just

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.330 
kind of how Bureau says I feel it's just
he's<00:04:06.680> more<00:04:07.040> on<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.250> destructive<00:04:07.790> side<00:04:08.030> I

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
he's more on the destructive side I

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.039 
he's more on the destructive side I
wouldn't<00:04:10.340> really<00:04:10.459> call<00:04:10.580> him<00:04:11.000> evil<00:04:11.540> because

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
wouldn't really call him evil because

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.330 
wouldn't really call him evil because
it's<00:04:12.380> not<00:04:12.500> like<00:04:12.769> he<00:04:13.310> destroys<00:04:13.910> things<00:04:14.440> to<00:04:15.440> see

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
it's not like he destroys things to see

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.740 
it's not like he destroys things to see
them<00:04:16.580> die<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:17.359> like

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
them die and like

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.599 
them die and like
whatever<00:04:18.500> he<00:04:18.739> just<00:04:18.950> likes<00:04:19.130> to<00:04:19.250> destroy

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
whatever he just likes to destroy

planets he thinks it's fun is that

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.270 
planets he thinks it's fun is that
twisted<00:04:22.160> of<00:04:22.340> me<00:04:22.550> to<00:04:22.760> think<00:04:23.030> like<00:04:23.540> that

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
twisted of me to think like that

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.680 
twisted of me to think like that
honestly<00:04:25.280> there's<00:04:25.700> not<00:04:26.000> much<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.390> say<00:04:26.540> about
