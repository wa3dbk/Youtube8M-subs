October I'll probably plant some of
those<00:02:34.370> soon<00:02:35.200> well<00:02:36.200> it's<00:02:36.440> just<00:02:36.500> amazing<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.400> tell

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
those soon well it's just amazing I tell

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.180 
those soon well it's just amazing I tell
me<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.510> little<00:02:38.660> bit<00:02:38.810> about<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.380> age<00:02:39.620> of<00:02:40.010> these

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
me a little bit about the age of these

me a little bit about the age of these
plans<00:02:40.690> we<00:02:41.690> first<00:02:41.930> started<00:02:42.230> planting

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
plans we first started planting

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.069 
plans we first started planting
blueberries<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.190> 1979<00:02:44.060> my<00:02:44.329> dad<00:02:44.540> started<00:02:44.870> the

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
blueberries in 1979 my dad started the

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.300 
blueberries in 1979 my dad started the
project<00:02:45.260> there<00:02:45.709> weren't<00:02:45.920> many<00:02:46.010> blueberries

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
project there weren't many blueberries

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.240 
project there weren't many blueberries
raised<00:02:46.790> in<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.060> valley<00:02:47.150> at<00:02:47.510> that<00:02:47.690> time<00:02:48.130> but<00:02:49.130> he

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
raised in the valley at that time but he

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.830 
raised in the valley at that time but he
saw<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.670> there's<00:02:49.850> an<00:02:49.940> opportunity<00:02:50.209> in<00:02:50.690> that

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
saw that there's an opportunity in that

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.930 
saw that there's an opportunity in that
market<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:51.739> so<00:02:51.950> with<00:02:52.100> these<00:02:52.250> plants<00:02:52.640> having

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
market so so with these plants having

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.940 
market so so with these plants having
been<00:02:53.150> planted<00:02:53.750> in<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.900> late<00:02:54.079> 70s<00:02:54.680> early<00:02:54.769> 80s

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
been planted in the late 70s early 80s

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.280 
been planted in the late 70s early 80s
they're<00:02:55.430> approximately<00:02:56.060> thirty<00:02:56.329> years<00:02:57.140> old

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
they're approximately thirty years old

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.530 
they're approximately thirty years old
yes<00:02:57.650> all<00:02:58.579> right<00:02:58.700> man<00:02:58.820> I<00:02:58.910> see<00:02:59.060> that<00:02:59.209> most<00:02:59.390> of

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
yes all right man I see that most of

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.750 
yes all right man I see that most of
your<00:02:59.660> plants<00:03:00.049> are<00:03:00.170> roughly<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.560> same<00:03:00.709> size<00:03:01.370> in

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
your plants are roughly the same size in

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.640 
your plants are roughly the same size in
each<00:03:01.850> row<00:03:02.150> is<00:03:02.360> there<00:03:02.570> a<00:03:02.600> is<00:03:03.140> there<00:03:03.320> a<00:03:03.350> rule<00:03:03.560> of

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
each row is there a is there a rule of

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.819 
each row is there a is there a rule of
thumb<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:04.070> follow<00:03:04.100> on<00:03:04.609> on<00:03:04.880> pruning<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:05.570> height

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
thumb to follow on on pruning and height

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.020 
thumb to follow on on pruning and height
mostly<00:03:06.829> just<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:07.220> that<00:03:07.400> you<00:03:07.459> can<00:03:07.609> still<00:03:07.820> reach

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
mostly just so that you can still reach

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.910 
mostly just so that you can still reach
the<00:03:08.060> fruit<00:03:08.450> I've<00:03:08.989> seen<00:03:09.260> fields<00:03:09.620> where<00:03:09.799> the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
the fruit I've seen fields where the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.670 
the fruit I've seen fields where the
bushes<00:03:10.400> were<00:03:10.549> over<00:03:10.910> well<00:03:11.239> overhead<00:03:11.930> high<00:03:12.140> then

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
bushes were over well overhead high then

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.289 
bushes were over well overhead high then
of<00:03:12.799> course<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.160> can't<00:03:13.459> reach<00:03:13.700> anything<00:03:14.000> to

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
of course you can't reach anything to

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:15.880 
of course you can't reach anything to
pick<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:14.630> you'd<00:03:14.900> have<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.109> bring<00:03:15.320> a<00:03:15.440> ladder<00:03:15.620> out

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
pick it you'd have to bring a ladder out

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.250 
pick it you'd have to bring a ladder out
if<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.220> would<00:03:16.430> there<00:03:17.329> are<00:03:17.420> 13<00:03:17.810> acres<00:03:18.109> of

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
if you would there are 13 acres of

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.780 
if you would there are 13 acres of
blueberries<00:03:18.739> here<00:03:19.070> blueberries<00:03:19.700> are

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
blueberries here blueberries are

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.190 
blueberries here blueberries are
fertilized<00:03:20.420> with<00:03:20.630> what's<00:03:20.810> known<00:03:20.989> as<00:03:21.170> a

fertilized with what's known as a
balanced<00:03:21.680> mix<00:03:22.040> so<00:03:22.340> it's<00:03:22.459> an<00:03:22.579> equal<00:03:22.910> number<00:03:22.940> for

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
balanced mix so it's an equal number for

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.599 
balanced mix so it's an equal number for

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
case we use a triple 14 I see and how

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.580 
case we use a triple 14 I see and how
often<00:03:28.820> do<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.150> fertilize<00:03:29.540> three<00:03:30.109> times<00:03:30.380> a

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
often do you fertilize three times a

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.800 
often do you fertilize three times a

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
the last time as the blueberries

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.199 
the last time as the blueberries
themselves<00:03:37.040> are<00:03:37.160> starting<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.549> develop<00:03:37.670> and

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
themselves are starting to develop and

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.000 
themselves are starting to develop and
that's<00:03:38.630> important<00:03:39.200> I'm<00:03:39.380> sure<00:03:39.410> for<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:39.829> health

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
that's important I'm sure for the health

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.979 
that's important I'm sure for the health
of<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.250> plant<00:03:40.489> but<00:03:40.640> also<00:03:40.730> for<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.630> really

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
of the plant but also for a really

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.259 
of the plant but also for a really
generous<00:03:42.890> yield<00:03:43.160> they<00:03:43.760> tend<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.090> grow

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
generous yield they tend to grow

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.869 
generous yield they tend to grow
themselves<00:03:44.780> to<00:03:44.900> death<00:03:45.080> they<00:03:46.040> if<00:03:46.250> you<00:03:46.519> don't

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.400 
themselves to death they if you don't
prune<00:03:47.120> them<00:03:47.300> heavily<00:03:47.510> they<00:03:47.750> produce

prune them heavily they produce

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.190 
prune them heavily they produce
gajillion<00:03:49.130> zuv<00:03:49.700> berries<00:03:50.270> and<00:03:50.750> if<00:03:50.960> they're<00:03:51.110> you

gajillion zuv berries and if they're you

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.800 
gajillion zuv berries and if they're you
prune<00:03:51.440> them<00:03:51.470> heavy<00:03:51.830> that's<00:03:52.040> an<00:03:52.640> enormous<00:03:52.810> toys
