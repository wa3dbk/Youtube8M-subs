00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.690
 anxious as you see today I'm not in the 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:07.060
 usual place in the kitchen because it is 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:10.180
 alright sir do a diet or asylum to a 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.400
 diet a super super healthy pizza 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.590
 that you're really going to love and is 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:22.259
 very rich and the best thing is that it is not 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:22.259
 made with flour and therefore the dough 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 and the truth is that I'm not going to teach you 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.750
 how it is done 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.880
 good what we need is to have 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.040
 Well the improvement plan I explain and I'm going 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.890
 to make two pizzas, but if you want 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.630
 make one you will need a cauliflower that 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.260
 they take away the green and the game 100 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.940
 two eggs and you do or I will 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.050
 do two colleges so double here 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.519
 two collections here there are four eggs and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.480
 grated cheese that you can buy the 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.480
 grated cheese and the animal 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.610
 grate some cheese that I eat 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.290
 I found cheese grated light as I have 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.690
 then taken on line and I'm going to 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.510
 grate and good for the dough only 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.510
 we will need this and the first thing that 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.160
 we should do is put the cabbage in a 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.480
 crusher that in this case is going to be the 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.480
 of the mix and shred the 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.800
 yes 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.100
 Well, now he puts me in the microwave during 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.100
 4 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:05.820
 now we will add the two eggs after 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.920
 we will stir well and add the cheese 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.050
 that we had previously grated or 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.730
 we had bought grated 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.560
 you have to make a pretty mix 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.000
 homogeneous so that later they can be 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.000
 extend very well 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.040
 i 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.010
 Y 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.590
 now we will take a chalk tray or 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.810
 a tray oven cover it well 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.329
 olive so that it does not stick or 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.989
 we will put waxed family and we will put 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:45.720
 our dough at the base of the pizza 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.420
 We will adapt to the way we want 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.129
 and in this case I have been removing because 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.689
 I was dough very now I more and 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.040
 I was quite chubby I was 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:54.750
 I recommend that you make the dough what 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.290
 facilitates possible because much more will come out 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.450
 growing and much more good with our 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.069
 200 degree preheated oven 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.359
 we will put our pizza base 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.069
 approximately 20 minutes until 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.849
 let's see what is beginning to be put 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.849
 golden 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.290
 when we see that it is ready we take it out 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.340
 in our oven with care for 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.130
 encourage us and we will start high and 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.600
 we will start to put our our 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.950
 Toppings are the ingredients that 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.670
 we have on the track 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:40.019
 in this case in the first and so we have 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:43.230
 put tomato after we added tuna 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:51.810
 that is delicious and they do not have almost 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:53.610
 calories after we added 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.599
 comparable that we would go into what is 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.160
 and it will be written as foi or something like that in the 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.870
 next piece we have also put 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.849
 tomato that that can never be missing in 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.450
 the blackboard a little bit of cheese for a 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.400
 cold 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.860
 that almost nothing will die and a little bit of 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.890
 ham serrano after we have added the 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.290
 cheese and it's ready 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.970
 we have measured them five more minutes 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.920
 oven with all the ingredients for 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.970
 the cheese is melted and run out of 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:26.190
 do and this is how we have been 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:31.290
 the truth is that this is the tuna and the 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:35.070
 Chick and it came out delicious after here 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:38.040
 we have the other the ham and cheese that 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.860
 It is also incredibly good 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.720
 you can see it here and finally this 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.020
 has been the result the truth is that 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.320
 It's very rich and if you do it like that with the 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.490
 Very finite mass stays even better 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.220
 I hope you liked that the 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.320
 try and make it at home and I 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.430
