start of his hips mostly the way to show
muscles<00:00:30.390> underneath<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.230> skin<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:32.000> to

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
muscles underneath the skin is to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.889 
muscles underneath the skin is to
delineate<00:00:33.980> with<00:00:34.980> shadow<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:36.329> but<00:00:36.510> I'm<00:00:36.600> first

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
delineate with shadow so but I'm first

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.090 
delineate with shadow so but I'm first
gonna<00:00:37.050> start<00:00:37.440> out<00:00:37.559> with<00:00:37.590> just<00:00:37.950> some

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
gonna start out with just some

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.250 
gonna start out with just some
guidelines<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.760> show<00:00:39.030> me<00:00:39.290> where<00:00:40.290> I'm<00:00:40.530> starting

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
guidelines to show me where I'm starting

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.299 
guidelines to show me where I'm starting
where<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.500> general<00:00:43.710> they're<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.190> be

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
where in general they're going to be

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.670 
where in general they're going to be
placed<00:00:44.610> if<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.000> go<00:00:45.180> ahead<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.629> start<00:00:46.079> drawing

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
placed if I go ahead and start drawing

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.459 
placed if I go ahead and start drawing
out<00:00:46.829> all<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.100> shadows<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.960> one<00:00:48.960> little<00:00:49.230> area

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
out all the shadows in one little area

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.369 
out all the shadows in one little area
and<00:00:49.680> keep<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.399> may<00:00:50.610> find<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.379> have

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
and keep going I may find that I have

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.580 
and keep going I may find that I have
lost<00:00:53.510> lost<00:00:54.510> track<00:00:54.899> or<00:00:55.110> gotten<00:00:55.379> out<00:00:55.469> of

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
lost lost track or gotten out of

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.049 
lost lost track or gotten out of
proportion<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.160> then<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> go<00:00:56.820> and

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
proportion and then I have to go and

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.970 
proportion and then I have to go and
erase<00:00:57.300> heavy<00:00:57.800> dark<00:00:58.800> lines<00:00:59.300> rather<00:01:00.300> than<00:01:00.980> being

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
erase heavy dark lines rather than being

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.529 
erase heavy dark lines rather than being
able<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.340> erase<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.789> while<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.059> really<00:01:03.210> light

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
able to erase it while it's really light

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.109 
able to erase it while it's really light
so<00:01:04.229> when<00:01:04.559> after<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.070> know<00:01:05.189> when<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:05.850> really

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
so when after I know when it's really

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.660 
so when after I know when it's really
light<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:07.140> I've<00:01:07.260> got<00:01:07.500> gotten<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.250> blocked<00:01:08.490> in

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
light that I've got gotten it blocked in

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.460 
light that I've got gotten it blocked in
properly<00:01:09.150> then<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> can<00:01:09.869> go<00:01:09.990> ahead<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.290> start

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
properly then I can go ahead and start

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.070 
properly then I can go ahead and start
putting<00:01:10.619> my<00:01:10.830> shadows<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.520> still<00:01:12.390> start<00:01:12.720> putting

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
putting my shadows I still start putting

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.280 
putting my shadows I still start putting
in<00:01:13.229> shadows<00:01:13.740> lightly<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:15.240> not<00:01:15.509> start<00:01:15.960> with

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
in shadows lightly I do not start with

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.859 
in shadows lightly I do not start with
heavy<00:01:16.680> shadows<00:01:17.159> because<00:01:17.490> again<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.450> need<00:01:18.750> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
heavy shadows because again if I need to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.359 
heavy shadows because again if I need to
change<00:01:19.080> something<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.619> don't<00:01:19.799> want<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.250> to

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
change something I don't want to have to

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.710 
change something I don't want to have to
be<00:01:20.490> able<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.790> erase<00:01:20.939> something<00:01:21.180> heavy<00:01:21.479> and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
be able to erase something heavy and

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.020 
be able to erase something heavy and
indeed<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.530> might<00:01:22.860> not<00:01:23.130> be<00:01:23.340> able<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.640> erase<00:01:23.850> it

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
indeed I might not be able to erase it

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.730 
indeed I might not be able to erase it
if<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.240> too<00:01:24.299> heavy

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
if it's too heavy

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:32.569 
if it's too heavy
so<00:01:27.350> I'm<00:01:28.350> going<00:01:28.770> around<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.579> little<00:01:31.579> roundish

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
so I'm going around the little roundish

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:40.749 
so I'm going around the little roundish
shapes<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.420> made<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.960> represent<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:35.450> ABS

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.399 

some<00:01:41.759> six-packs<00:01:42.390> are<00:01:42.570> more<00:01:42.780> defined<00:01:42.930> than

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
some six-packs are more defined than

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.010 
some six-packs are more defined than
other<00:01:43.619> ones<00:01:44.060> but<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.360> one<00:01:45.420> I'm<00:01:45.750> trying<00:01:45.899> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
other ones but this one I'm trying to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.719 
other ones but this one I'm trying to
make<00:01:46.200> pretty<00:01:46.829> well-defined<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.970> see

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
make pretty well-defined so you can see

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.139 
make pretty well-defined so you can see
mostly<00:01:50.729> how<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.909> make<00:01:51.090> these<00:01:51.240> shadows<00:01:55.100> now

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
mostly how to make these shadows now

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.660 
mostly how to make these shadows now
after<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.180> do<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.780> can<00:01:57.810> see<00:01:58.229> okay<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.310> want

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
after I do this I can see okay I want

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.539 
after I do this I can see okay I want
more<00:02:00.200> shadows<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.350> certain<00:02:01.740> places<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.399> make

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
more shadows in certain places to make

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.539 
more shadows in certain places to make
it<00:02:02.700> even<00:02:02.939> more<00:02:03.110> three-dimensional<00:02:04.110> as<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:05.280> as

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
it even more three-dimensional as in as

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.369 
it even more three-dimensional as in as
when<00:02:05.790> I'm<00:02:05.909> drawing<00:02:06.119> anything

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.190 

and<00:02:12.379> I<00:02:13.159> can<00:02:13.370> sort<00:02:13.579> of<00:02:13.670> feather<00:02:14.030> with<00:02:14.900> lighter

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
and I can sort of feather with lighter

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.830 
and I can sort of feather with lighter
shadows<00:02:15.769> feather<00:02:16.609> between<00:02:17.120> darker<00:02:17.599> and

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
shadows feather between darker and

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.229 
shadows feather between darker and
lighter<00:02:17.900> shadows<00:02:18.650> so<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.579> I<00:02:19.609> get<00:02:19.849> a<00:02:19.879> smooth

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
lighter shadows so that I get a smooth

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:30.890 
lighter shadows so that I get a smooth
transition<00:02:20.780> between<00:02:21.140> shadows

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.920 

and<00:02:31.409> I<00:02:31.500> can<00:02:31.709> keep<00:02:31.920> taking<00:02:32.159> this<00:02:32.780> till<00:02:33.780> it's

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
and I can keep taking this till it's

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.680 
and I can keep taking this till it's
very<00:02:34.440> well<00:02:34.739> defined<00:02:35.099> or<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.640> can<00:02:36.120> leave<00:02:36.269> it<00:02:36.480> a

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
very well defined or I can leave it a

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:45.470
