hi everyone it's Lego builder 20 form
you've<00:00:02.460> probably<00:00:02.760> noticed<00:00:03.060> this<00:00:03.330> really<00:00:03.689> cool

one all right and by the way this bunker

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.260 
one all right and by the way this bunker
is<00:00:15.480> more<00:00:16.379> complex<00:00:16.949> than<00:00:17.160> other<00:00:17.520> bunkers<00:00:18.000> I've

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
is more complex than other bunkers I've

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.830 
is more complex than other bunkers I've
seen<00:00:19.140> on<00:00:19.320> YouTube<00:00:20.000> this<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.180> like<00:00:21.359> World<00:00:21.720> War

two<00:00:22.199> bunkers<00:00:22.760> so<00:00:23.760> what<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.300> need<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:25.550> well

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
two bunkers so what you need is well

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.029 
two bunkers so what you need is well
actually<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:27.060> sandbag<00:00:27.510> bunker<00:00:27.900> five<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.800> these

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
actually a sandbag bunker five of these

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.400 
actually a sandbag bunker five of these
so<00:00:30.140> these<00:00:31.140> are<00:00:31.199> actually<00:00:31.830> your<00:00:31.980> key<00:00:32.219> element

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
so these are actually your key element

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.840 
so these are actually your key element
so<00:00:34.410> here's<00:00:34.829> five<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.370> those<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:36.329> need<00:00:37.820> two<00:00:38.820> of

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
one one of these and two of these so

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.140 
one one of these and two of these so
here's<00:01:06.420> how<00:01:06.659> i<00:01:06.720> started<00:01:07.170> i<00:01:07.500> used<00:01:08.100> i<00:01:08.520> put<00:01:08.909> this

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
here's how i started i used i put this

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:17.719 
here's how i started i used i put this
down<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.810> then<00:01:10.710> i<00:01:10.740> went<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:13.369> um<00:01:14.369> i<00:01:16.490> went<00:01:17.490> like

down and then i went with um i went like
this<00:01:20.450> sideways<00:01:25.729> 12<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:28.909> sideways<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.420> now<00:01:30.630> i

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
this sideways 12 and sideways so now i

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.530 
this sideways 12 and sideways so now i
have<00:01:31.020> my<00:01:31.049> basic<00:01:31.740> frame<00:01:33.020> done<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:35.030> then<00:01:36.030> over

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
have my basic frame done and then over

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.870 
have my basic frame done and then over
the<00:01:36.689> top<00:01:36.930> i<00:01:37.170> had<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.560> cover<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:38.040> with<00:01:38.189> three<00:01:38.670> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the top i had to cover it with three and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.830 
the top i had to cover it with three and
you<00:01:39.720> might<00:01:40.079> want<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.470> adjust<00:01:41.299> well<00:01:42.299> here's

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.800 
here's what I just give you a quick tip
um<00:01:48.360> when<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.079> do<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.880> don't<00:01:51.240> want<00:01:51.540> them

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
um when you do that you don't want them

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.590 
um when you do that you don't want them
slanted<00:01:52.380> until<00:01:52.770> you've<00:01:53.009> placed<00:01:53.369> them<00:01:53.700> so

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
slanted until you've placed them so

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.800 
slanted until you've placed them so
after<00:01:55.110> you've<00:01:55.290> placed<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.610> tilt<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.299> to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
after you've placed it just tilt it to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.010 
after you've placed it just tilt it to
the<00:01:58.049> desired<00:01:58.469> length<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.149> tilts<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.750> and

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
the desired length that it tilts to and

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.219 
the desired length that it tilts to and
I'll<00:02:01.590> get<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.869> now<00:02:03.869> on<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:05.070> end<00:02:05.399> add

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
I'll get that and now on this end add

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.290 
I'll get that and now on this end add
that<00:02:07.229> now<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.950> really<00:02:08.220> looks<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.910> bunker

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
that now it really looks like the bunker

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.670 
that now it really looks like the bunker
so<00:02:09.989> now<00:02:10.530> what<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.370> want<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.640> do<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:13.080> now<00:02:13.470> you

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
so now what you want to do so now you

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.490 
so now what you want to do so now you
can<00:02:13.829> see<00:02:14.099> what<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.370> did<00:02:14.959> place<00:02:17.269> your<00:02:18.269> one<00:02:19.260> by<00:02:19.439> two

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
can see what I did place your one by two

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.099 
can see what I did place your one by two
of<00:02:19.980> these<00:02:20.430> on<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:22.140> edges<00:02:22.590> like<00:02:22.859> that<00:02:23.900> time<00:02:24.900> to

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:25.109 
of these on the edges like that time to

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.979 
of these on the edges like that time to
flip<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.469> over<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:26.359> what<00:02:27.359> you<00:02:27.510> don't<00:02:27.689> want<00:02:27.900> to

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
flip it over and what you don't want to

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.589 
flip it over and what you don't want to
do<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.260> touch<00:02:28.469> that<00:02:28.769> curve<00:02:29.269> because<00:02:30.269> that's

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
do is touch that curve because that's

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.530 
do is touch that curve because that's
what<00:02:31.079> keeps<00:02:31.349> it<00:02:31.560> together<00:02:32.030> so<00:02:33.030> now<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:33.329> have

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
what keeps it together so now you have

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.449 
what keeps it together so now you have
this<00:02:34.639> looks<00:02:35.639> nice<00:02:35.939> so<00:02:36.950> flip<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.219> over<00:02:38.459> again

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
this looks nice so flip that over again

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.979 
this looks nice so flip that over again
I<00:02:41.840> place<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.230> there<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.579> do<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.540> same<00:02:45.810> on

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
I place that there and do it the same on

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.569 
I place that there and do it the same on
the<00:02:46.109> other<00:02:46.139> end<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.970> right<00:02:47.970> there<00:02:48.629> yo<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.590> nice

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
the other end and right there yo a nice

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.030 
the other end and right there yo a nice
bunker<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:52.250> what<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.400> if<00:02:53.819> you<00:02:54.090> wanted

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
bunker and what you if you wanted

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.309 
bunker and what you if you wanted
actually<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.099> realized<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.389> can't<00:02:57.599> um

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
actually I realized that you can't um

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.530 
actually I realized that you can't um
it's<00:02:59.040> got<00:02:59.280> windows<00:02:59.519> that<00:02:59.909> you<00:03:00.060> can't<00:03:00.269> really

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
it's got windows that you can't really

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.349 
it's got windows that you can't really
fix<00:03:00.859> but<00:03:01.859> it's<00:03:02.419> more<00:03:03.419> detailed<00:03:04.549> so<00:03:05.549> I<00:03:05.609> can<00:03:06.030> like

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
fix but it's more detailed so I can like
