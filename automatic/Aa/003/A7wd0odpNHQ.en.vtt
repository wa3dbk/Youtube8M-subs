I<00:05:02.580> was<00:05:03.180> quite<00:05:03.390> confused<00:05:03.540> while<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:03.960> was<00:05:04.110> playing

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
I was quite confused while I was playing

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.190 
I was quite confused while I was playing
it<00:05:04.560> but<00:05:04.770> I<00:05:05.690> guess<00:05:06.690> watching<00:05:07.020> it<00:05:07.110> back

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
it but I guess watching it back

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:17.690 
it but I guess watching it back
afterwards<00:05:07.740> helps<00:05:08.040> out<00:05:14.750> and<00:05:16.580> some<00:05:17.580> people

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
afterwards helps out and some people

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
always check points so you can only

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.450 
always check points so you can only
start<00:05:31.080> on<00:05:31.230> almost<00:05:31.620> every<00:05:31.950> single<00:05:32.220> thing<00:05:32.250> you

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
start on almost every single thing you

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.130 
start on almost every single thing you
did<00:05:32.580> it<00:05:32.670> too<00:05:32.820> there's<00:05:33.450> always<00:05:33.630> check<00:05:33.930> points

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
did it too there's always check points

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.420 
did it too there's always check points
is<00:05:34.260> a<00:05:34.320> lot<00:05:34.350> of<00:05:34.560> safe<00:05:34.800> points<00:05:35.070> like<00:05:35.160> you<00:05:35.250> just

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
is a lot of safe points like you just

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.100 
is a lot of safe points like you just
saw<00:05:35.580> in<00:05:35.670> the<00:05:35.700> bottom<00:05:36.000> right<00:05:36.120> corner<00:05:36.150> that<00:05:37.020> was

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
saw in the bottom right corner that was

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.910 
saw in the bottom right corner that was
a<00:05:37.140> little<00:05:37.410> safe<00:05:37.560> point<00:05:38.930> now<00:05:39.930> here<00:05:40.440> I'm<00:05:40.650> sure<00:05:40.800> I

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
a little safe point now here I'm sure I

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.170 
a little safe point now here I'm sure I
know<00:05:40.980> there's<00:05:41.220> an<00:05:41.280> achievement<00:05:41.640> I<00:05:41.940> didn't

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
know there's an achievement I didn't

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.820 
know there's an achievement I didn't
earn<00:05:42.300> it<00:05:42.330> this<00:05:42.540> time<00:05:42.570> but<00:05:43.380> I<00:05:43.410> know<00:05:43.560> those<00:05:43.680> in

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
earn it this time but I know those in

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:44.900 
earn it this time but I know those in
achieving<00:05:44.130> that<00:05:44.280> you<00:05:44.370> can<00:05:44.490> get<00:05:44.640> by<00:05:44.850> doing

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
achieving that you can get by doing

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.380 
achieving that you can get by doing
something<00:05:45.690> I<00:05:46.560> think<00:05:47.070> it<00:05:47.190> was<00:05:47.280> 25<00:05:47.670> of<00:05:48.180> the

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
something I think it was 25 of the

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.210 
something I think it was 25 of the
special<00:05:48.810> attacks<00:05:49.110> that<00:05:49.260> they<00:05:49.380> just<00:05:49.650> taught

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
special attacks that they just taught

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.220 
special attacks that they just taught
you<00:05:50.430> let's<00:05:50.790> say<00:05:50.940> they<00:05:51.570> showed<00:05:51.780> you<00:05:51.900> like<00:05:52.020> what

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
you let's say they showed you like what

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.980 
you let's say they showed you like what
combos<00:05:52.650> suppressed<00:05:53.010> to<00:05:53.300> do<00:05:54.300> that<00:05:54.450> special

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
combos suppressed to do that special

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.930 
combos suppressed to do that special
attack<00:05:55.200> and<00:05:56.070> i<00:05:56.160> believe<00:05:56.340> the<00:05:56.460> achievement<00:05:56.850> is

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
attack and i believe the achievement is

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.810 
attack and i believe the achievement is
get<00:05:57.210> 25<00:05:57.660> kills<00:05:57.930> using<00:05:58.260> that<00:05:58.380> attack<00:05:58.680> there<00:05:58.890> so

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
get 25 kills using that attack there so

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.400 
get 25 kills using that attack there so
i<00:05:59.850> think<00:06:00.030> it's<00:06:00.210> just<00:06:00.270> reload<00:06:00.750> the<00:06:00.930> checkpoint

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
i think it's just reload the checkpoint

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.930 
i think it's just reload the checkpoint
once<00:06:01.710> you<00:06:01.830> kill<00:06:02.040> the<00:06:02.130> six<00:06:02.310> guys<00:06:02.460> every<00:06:02.910> time

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
once you kill the six guys every time

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.129 
once you kill the six guys every time
until<00:06:03.330> you<00:06:03.390> get<00:06:03.480> 25

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:12.820 

and<00:06:06.280> just<00:06:07.280> keep<00:06:07.490> going<00:06:07.729> right<00:06:11.650> here<00:06:12.650> I<00:06:12.710> believe

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
and just keep going right here I believe

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.320 
and just keep going right here I believe

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
I screwed up a little cutting goes far

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.360 
I screwed up a little cutting goes far
enough<00:06:14.360> yeah<00:06:15.229> you<00:06:15.650> got<00:06:15.800> to<00:06:15.830> be<00:06:15.979> careful<00:06:16.129> on

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
enough yeah you got to be careful on

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.469 
enough yeah you got to be careful on
that<00:06:16.430> when<00:06:16.610> you<00:06:16.699> got<00:06:16.849> to<00:06:16.939> go<00:06:16.999> all<00:06:17.210> the<00:06:17.240> way<00:06:17.360> to

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
that when you got to go all the way to

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.269 
that when you got to go all the way to
the<00:06:17.599> end<00:06:17.689> to<00:06:18.259> be<00:06:18.379> sure<00:06:18.409> to<00:06:18.740> make<00:06:18.889> it<00:06:19.039> if<00:06:19.219> not

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:19.279 
the end to be sure to make it if not

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:21.659 
the end to be sure to make it if not
you'll<00:06:19.639> do<00:06:19.909> what<00:06:20.029> I<00:06:20.060> just<00:06:20.270> didn't<00:06:20.509> screw<00:06:20.930> up

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
you'll do what I just didn't screw up

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.800 
you'll do what I just didn't screw up
yeah<00:06:22.669> sometimes<00:06:23.120> the<00:06:23.240> controls<00:06:23.569> are<00:06:23.689> a<00:06:23.719> little

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
yeah sometimes the controls are a little

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.269 
yeah sometimes the controls are a little
dodgy<00:06:24.020> like<00:06:24.319> you<00:06:24.439> see<00:06:24.620> right<00:06:24.650> here<00:06:24.979> it's<00:06:25.219> just

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:25.279 
dodgy like you see right here it's just

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:27.999 
dodgy like you see right here it's just
a<00:06:25.610> little<00:06:26.389> slow<00:06:26.719> on<00:06:26.779> them<00:06:27.020> to<00:06:27.469> kind<00:06:27.620> of<00:06:27.740> make

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:28.009 
a little slow on them to kind of make

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:40.809 
a little slow on them to kind of make
your<00:06:28.159> guy<00:06:28.340> just<00:06:28.610> jump<00:06:28.819> around<00:06:29.029> randomly<00:06:29.240> a<00:06:39.819> lot

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:40.819 
your guy just jump around randomly a lot

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:42.939 
your guy just jump around randomly a lot
of<00:06:40.969> running<00:06:41.210> yeah<00:06:41.779> that<00:06:42.139> gets<00:06:42.500> in<00:06:42.620> line<00:06:42.770> when

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:42.949 
of running yeah that gets in line when

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:44.619 
of running yeah that gets in line when
you<00:06:43.039> have<00:06:43.129> to<00:06:43.250> do<00:06:43.400> those<00:06:43.550> wall<00:06:43.759> runs<00:06:44.000> that<00:06:44.389> can

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:44.629 
you have to do those wall runs that can

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:46.330 
you have to do those wall runs that can
sometimes<00:06:44.870> happen<00:06:45.229> is<00:06:45.529> your<00:06:45.830> guy<00:06:45.979> will<00:06:46.159> just

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
sometimes happen is your guy will just

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.610 
sometimes happen is your guy will just
randomly<00:06:46.520> jump<00:06:47.000> down<00:06:47.120> like<00:06:47.419> that<00:06:47.599> and<00:06:48.529> you

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620 
randomly jump down like that and you

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.659 
randomly jump down like that and you
have<00:06:48.680> to<00:06:48.800> get<00:06:48.949> back<00:06:49.099> up<00:06:49.310> and<00:06:49.430> try<00:06:49.580> again

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669 
have to get back up and try again

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:51.519 
have to get back up and try again
sometimes<00:06:50.479> it'll<00:06:50.659> happen<00:06:50.810> a<00:06:50.990> few<00:06:51.020> times<00:06:51.169> in<00:06:51.469> a

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:51.529 
sometimes it'll happen a few times in a

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:54.399 
sometimes it'll happen a few times in a
row<00:06:51.650> which<00:06:52.550> can<00:06:52.819> get<00:06:53.000> a<00:06:53.029> little<00:06:53.210> knowing<00:06:53.449> and

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:54.409 
row which can get a little knowing and

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:55.659 
row which can get a little knowing and
right<00:06:54.590> here<00:06:54.710> i'm<00:06:54.800> just<00:06:54.979> trying<00:06:55.159> to<00:06:55.189> set<00:06:55.520> the

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:55.669 
right here i'm just trying to set the

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.360 
right here i'm just trying to set the
like<00:06:56.629> the<00:06:57.349> brightness<00:06:57.770> and<00:06:57.919> contrast<00:06:58.039> in

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
like the brightness and contrast in

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.350 
like the brightness and contrast in
everything<00:06:58.610> so<00:06:58.639> you<00:06:58.789> guys<00:06:58.939> can<00:06:59.029> see<00:06:59.089> better

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 
everything so you guys can see better

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.939 
everything so you guys can see better
because<00:06:59.629> i<00:06:59.719> realize<00:07:00.050> we<00:07:00.589> call<00:07:00.800> it<00:07:00.919> the

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:00.949 
because i realize we call it the

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:02.769 
because i realize we call it the
brightness<00:07:01.939> everything<00:07:02.240> wasn't<00:07:02.419> really<00:07:02.659> that

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:02.779 
brightness everything wasn't really that

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:05.519 
brightness everything wasn't really that
good<00:07:02.990> so<00:07:03.020> now<00:07:03.490> i<00:07:04.490> think<00:07:04.610> it<00:07:04.849> improved<00:07:05.150> a<00:07:05.210> little

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:05.529 
good so now i think it improved a little

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:07.360 
good so now i think it improved a little
that<00:07:06.529> when<00:07:06.620> you're<00:07:06.710> going<00:07:06.860> by<00:07:06.949> that<00:07:07.009> wall<00:07:07.249> you
