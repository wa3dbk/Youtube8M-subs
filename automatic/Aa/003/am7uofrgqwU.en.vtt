 risks and critical control points h seven ago 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.690
 seeks to demonstrate the ability to control security risks 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.040
 through the fulfillment of the requirements established by the 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.330
 current legislation and an analysis of both physical and 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.260

 any of them exceeds its established limits the stage of 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.310
 reception of raw materials is done in a physical space that is exclusive to 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.080
 such purpose 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.360
 and in it, product reviews are made regarding their 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.280

 there is a pre-process storage 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.529
 To control these storage mechanisms, a record of the 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:50.580
