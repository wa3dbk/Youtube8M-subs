00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.580
 and how are boys and girls my name 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:11.040
 is gavilleros today I bring you a video of 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:14.190
 gta 4 in a mode that is called the spd fr 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.840
 version 1.0 this is that you 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.180
 you are a policeman from the big city of 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.830
 liberty city and you have to do 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.380
 several jobs as policemen by 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.680
 example may be that you receive a 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.390
 called from the police headquarters 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.240
 requesting that go to an area 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.359
 verify to verify not, but rather 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.819
 that a group of people who form 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:38.190
 identified in the area are sleeping 

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:39.989
 in an alley they are drugging they are 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.339
 discussing are making noise and the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.109
 neighbors have called for that person 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:49.379
 be cleared of the area in this case I 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:51.929
 I arrive in this area of the city and I go 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.320
 towards that group and I make them leave 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:55.660
 area 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.600
 on many occasions it may be that 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.220
 the case that I do not want to leave and I 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.290
 I have to incur another type of 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.530
 more aggressive actions for example 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.880
 in stopping him and taking him to the station 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.430
 closest police to be 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.550
 processed 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.730
 but as in this case it did not happen it will be 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.820
 all agreed to leave without problems 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:21.570
 they just leave the place 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.320
 there are other types of missions in this mod 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.479
 where you have for example that you receive 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.260
 a police call to one and you have 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.400
 what to pursue 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.260
 or help a persecution in progress to 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.050
 stop those people who go to high 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.900
 speed may be that persecution 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.810
 it originated because it took a 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.230
 red light or because a 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.200
 drug transaction prior to your 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.510
 persecution or because it is to that group of 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.670
 person to person killed some 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.830
 person on the street some citizen 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.350
 that is, it is for a number of things 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.830
 that happens within the game that is 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.619
 initiate a persecution in this case there is 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.929
 a persecution that I'm going to attend 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.970
 where I get the call from the central 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:16.100
 the police where there is already a persecution 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.780
 in progress and I simply agree to go 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.160
 to the area also to attend the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.920
 other policemen who have already started that 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.200
 persecution 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.930
 in this persecution does not come with much 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.690
 with a lot of bone problem although the 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.030
 delinquents end up dejected because they 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.599
 they resisted the rest but there 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.010
 persecutions that might be from 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.319
 less intensity or they might be from 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.540
 greater intensity in this case I can 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.880
 I could consider it on average 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.160
 intensity but there is persecution where 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.560
 you even have to call luck the 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.849
 police to exist or call the 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.400
 air assistance by the police 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.420
 to help you stop a 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.420
 high speed chase 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.440
 and when they call the usual 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.540
 and the persecution on earth so 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.090
 intense and where the swat for example 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.100
 they manage to catch that delinquent 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.790
 they are simply going to eliminate it 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.090
 they will not ask you if they stop 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.380
 users simply start a shootout 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.300
 just one 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.180
 it is one of the things that we have 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.970
 as a policeman where we can not only 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.370
 immediately stop the person who 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.530
 is being persecuted but if it is not 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.500
 agree to stop its simply not having 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:42.410
 fire and already reports it when hoisting that 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.410
 person who were shot the central 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.430
 it can be for example to receive me 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.450
 admission 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.830
 go to an area 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.000
 verified such as up to the group of 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.340
 people who have been doing 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.170
 illegal transactions 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.000
 it may be that he makes a transaction of 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.040
 drug another type of illegal transaction 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.590
 there are also missions of all you I can 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.900
 stop at an intersection of the map in 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.740
 a corner of the map and make a corner 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.810
 where 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.680
 where there is a lot of trafficking of people and 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.360
 vehicles you can simply have there 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.590
 verify what is happening to you in that 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.109
 corner 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.470
 what is happening if they are taking 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.470
 the traffic lights 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.290
 if there has been a lot that if there 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.740
 but there is at high speed that can 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.150
 pursue it 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.150
 and put a fine 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.790
 and maybe that person wants 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.590
 resist receiving that fine and undertake 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:45.630
 the flight and well there is already one has to 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.550
 start practically a persecution already 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.890
 either on foot or by vehicle 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.610
 good for now this is what I bring you 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.280
 in this way 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.950
 the next video I will bring you 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.860
 in more detail of this world how 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.139
 install it even in the comments 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.639
 that you leave me here in the video 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.110
 I will see that you can ask me 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.780
 for example if they want me to stop in 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.400
 a corner see the traffic as a 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.200
 fine or that I dedicate to pursue 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.200
 delinquents that I dedicate myself there 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.210
 to those points where where are the van 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.260

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.600
 simply what he wants to live 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.980

 what it does intend to give you more details of 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.360
 this world that seems to me quite 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.750
 interesting 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.340
 that honestly this type of game does not 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.680
 are my main games for this me 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.680
 has attracted a lot of attention and good 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.469
 I intend to make the best videos 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.030
 better edited for the future and with 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:54.060
 better details as I say of the game 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.889
