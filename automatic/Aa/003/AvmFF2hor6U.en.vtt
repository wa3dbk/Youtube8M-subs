00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.870 

oh<00:01:30.600> there's<00:01:31.470> picture<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.040> picture<00:01:32.070> where<00:01:32.760> you

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
oh there's picture in picture where you

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.810 
oh there's picture in picture where you
can<00:01:33.090> work<00:01:33.330> with<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:34.230> two<00:01:34.470> computers<00:01:34.950> at<00:01:35.430> once

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
can work with the two computers at once

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.890 
can work with the two computers at once
on<00:01:36.150> one<00:01:36.450> screen<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.270> see<00:01:39.510> where<00:01:39.720> it's

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
on one screen you can see where it's

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.370 
on one screen you can see where it's
being<00:01:40.140> recorded<00:01:40.440> into<00:01:41.370> the<00:01:41.550> other<00:01:41.820> one<00:01:42.380> you

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
being recorded into the other one you

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.480 
being recorded into the other one you
can<00:01:43.590> swap<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.340> out<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:46.200> now<00:01:46.920> we<00:01:46.980> have<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
can swap it out and now we have the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.360 
can swap it out and now we have the
other<00:01:47.640> computer<00:01:48.120> in<00:01:48.660> one<00:01:49.200> small<00:01:49.530> corner<00:01:49.920> and

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
other computer in one small corner and

00:01:50.370 --> 00:02:01.400 
other computer in one small corner and
the<00:01:51.300> other<00:01:51.479> one<00:01:51.720> that's<00:01:51.900> recording<00:01:52.680> this<00:02:00.410> get

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
the other one that's recording this get

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:14.680 
the other one that's recording this get
your<00:02:01.620> long<00:02:01.800> picture

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.720 

this<00:02:15.260> definitely<00:02:15.890> speeds<00:02:16.430> up<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.820> increases

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
this definitely speeds up it increases

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.610 
this definitely speeds up it increases
production<00:02:19.730> as<00:02:20.240> you<00:02:20.630> have<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.960> ability<00:02:21.050> to

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
production as you have the ability to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.580 
production as you have the ability to
work<00:02:21.770> with<00:02:22.010> two<00:02:22.250> computers<00:02:22.880> at<00:02:23.240> once<00:02:23.540> on<00:02:23.840> the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
work with two computers at once on the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.340 
work with two computers at once on the
same<00:02:24.860> screen
