00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.440
 muscle tissue is composed of 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.719
 muscle cells to these cells are 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.110
 he knows them as myocytes or also 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.020
 muscle fibers with the help of atp 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.720
 Atp that energy will generate what 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.960
 it is strength heat movements and to provide 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.730
 protection the muscle tissue for your 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.880
 study is going to be divided into what is the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.269
 fluted and smooth the fluted is subdivided 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.430
 in what is cardiac and skeletal the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.219
 striated muscle contains a unit 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.530
 fundamental that is called zarco I look at the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.200
 melo fence is composed of filaments 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.540
 clear or thin I know it would be the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.420
 actin and the dark filaments or 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.090
 thick that is myosin will contain 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.030
 different types of elastic proteins 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.970
 contractile and accessory that can be 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.400
 titina mists 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.200
 the skeletal striated muscle is the 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.840
 responsible for the position and the 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.750
 movements that's why you're given this 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.030
 name this is possible thanks to 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.790
 it can be can transform the 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.600
 chemical energy in mechanical energy 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.560
 how the merits had been spoken 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.770
 they are called muscle fibers 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.540
 due to its elongated shape the muscle 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.020
 It is covered by a variety of 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.290
 connective tissue called the scoop the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.140
 muscle is made up of fascicles and 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.950
 the fascicles are covered by per 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.200
 started the rsi ass is composed by me 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.800
 fibrils and these are surrounded by 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.230
 dominion 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.690
 in muscle tissue we will use 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.030
 special terms to describe their 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.060
 components for example to the membrane 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.340
 we will call it cellular slogan 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.370
 cytoplasm we will know as zarco 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.950
 plasma to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.100
 to be the plastic sarko reticle and the 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.930
 mitochondria will be sarcos or more in the 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.110
 homeroom shark let's find the 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.840
 following elements that are going to be the 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.540
 discs zetas these are structures in 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.570
 zigzag composed of proteins from 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.690
 Anchorage for fine filaments each 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.330
 end of the sarcoma is missing 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.280
 bounded by a z disk also 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.490
 we will find what what are the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.890
 bands and are bands of bright color and 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.290
 these represent the region that is 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.830
 occupied only by fine filaments is 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.720
 say actin filaments the disk is 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.300
 it's going to be found in the middle of 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.400
 a band and because each half of a 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.840
 band and belongs to a being eat or 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.330
 different 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.450
 another important element of the mere bag 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.940
 is the band is the darkest band and 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.700
 corresponds to the length of filaments 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.650
 thick is to say from my office the area 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.129
 wide corresponds to the central portion 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.489
 of the band and is occupied only by 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.890
 Thick filaments super important 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.099
 is going to be the m line that will divide in 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.989
 two equal parts to the band and this one goes 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.390
 to serve as sonar insertion of the 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.640
 thick filaments as we had already 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.329
 mentioned muscle functions 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:17.670
 skeletal is to give support or give some 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:20.709
 function skeleton movements 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.930
 resistance to running dance etc. 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.660
 but all this is through the 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.549
 muscle contraction is the 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.040
 shrinkage is a process that is going to 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.590
 allow to generate force to move or 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.140
 resist a charge this is through 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.150
 the activation of muscle fibers 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.150
 It is usually prone to 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.549
 this shortens the force that is generated 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.510
 for the muscle is going to contract and this 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.489
 It is called 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.610
 good is known as muscle tension 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.260
 the load is going to be a weight or a force 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.010
 that opposes the contraction of 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.200
 muscle the tension in the muscle is a 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.599
 process that requires a contribution 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.549
 energy from atp as already 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.190
 we had mentioned before the atp is 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:06.190
 energy then if there is no atp we do not go 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.110
 to be able to generate a contraction for 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.150
 generate the contraction as we said 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.950
 the element is going to be needed 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.010
 fundamental that it will be atp 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.620
 during muscle contraction the 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.019
 Thin and thick filaments ie 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.050
 actina years and na are going to slide on 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.020
 others approaching the zetas lines towards 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.510
 the center of the sar eat this one of this 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.060
 way the actin filaments go to 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.110
 act like the rails by which 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.660
 myosin heads walk 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.820
 I feel that myosin heads are going 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.650
 push the actin filaments towards 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.750
 the center of the fence but that's why 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.880
 We wish there are going to be some lines of 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.520
 bands or zones that disappear 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.110
 and others remain the same process 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.009
 will repeat and repeat and repeat 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.020
 while muscle fiber contracts 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.879
 for this image we are going to see how the 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.949
 myosin heads are going to slide 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.819
 about actin to do what is the 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.819
 muscle contraction
