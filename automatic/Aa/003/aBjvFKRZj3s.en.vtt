00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:13.969
 Hello, Mr. Column is here again. 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:18.550
 This is 34 times. Look at the music. 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:21.380
 If you look at the sheet music, you really want me to play America 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:26.330
 There are a lot of strange symbols 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.529
 But at the bottom of this book, this dream is a description of them. 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.059
 I'm out. 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:37.730
 So you have to follow along well enough and this is number 34 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:42.559
 We are going to split the eight pants c and proceed with our Lecce. 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:46.640
 So, you have to prepare the panel and cut it by 8 bars , 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.659
 Partly go into practice. First of all, 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.369
 I will. 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:53.780
 This is the part you see jageuljageul to say below the top of the right-hand t 

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:58.040
 It's marked. 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.350
 Using your fingers to begin with high altitude, 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.670
 I'll play it in succession. 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:10.189
 They are all painted with small notes at the bottom. 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:12.679
 So, you can look at it with reference first. 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:18.799
 You'll play until 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:20.119
 We're playing by turning the middle as intently as referred to shoot par japsol same dream 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:25.789
 Itgoyo also part 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:29.780
 I just have a dream and there are so many people that you have this right hand in the left hand 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:33.499
 I know the mix of playing for the name eoneuge 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:37.299
 Please take a closer look at our performance. 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:37.299
 I'll go from one to eight. 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.830
 oao 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.830
 5 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.640
 U 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:57.899
 Allow 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.439
 5 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:15.640
 Oh, and listen to the first words in the first stared's first words are our teachers 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.830
 Because it is very difficult to go back to the right hand, too many Raredore 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.750
 I played with the part 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:28.840
 Instead, you do not have to play that note with a lot of parts. 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:32.770
 One eight minutes on the left hand , you can just hit four of them on the table . 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.410
 So please play it later quickly, regardless of the number is not that much 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:41.320
 It does not matter if you tear it up. 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:46.060
 And this time, I 'll see this from the Kuma school. 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:50.320
 You can check the flavor from 9 bars to 16 flavors, especially 14 bars and 16 bars 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:55.060
 Please be careful. So, we'll show you the performance of Mr. El Choi. 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:03:01.150
 13 That's your finger number. 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:04.030
 If you look up the word in the first 16 notes pleasure to taste following the invasion anmat 2 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:10.209
 You crossed the joint line in extension 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:14.769
 Then the seesaw to the left on the first sound of the right hand cocked and 16 bars in pro following 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:19.630
 Be sure to skip all 2 lines and then proceed. 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:23.400
 So that the meat can be beautifully'm presenter ball bar from 16 bars 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.400
 We will play until 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.060
 to 5 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.319
 wm 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.710
 Huh 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:54.160
 Ah 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:04:00.010
 Oh, he was very good. 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:06.340
 Especially in the 14th paragraph, you have to save that short, 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:07.060
 You have to do it, you touch the front part, and you actually get a little bit of accent. 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.690
 It is. 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:15.550
 If you put it on the back, you 'll make a pledge . 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:17.950
 So short on that part, you keep enough on your wrists. 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:22.300
 Please use it 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:27.450
 And then I'll jump over that part of the 16th and go over the 17th. 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:31.120
 From the seventeenth to the last, we will play eight words. 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:35.740
 Because there is a reappearance in the earlier part 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.520
 17 It does not matter if you are from Adi, but you have to be careful with 21 words. 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.250
 It's possible 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:48.490
 The middle of the left hand comes out with a higher degree on the 21st node 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:52.440
 You have to hit the stone and put the rest of the stone . 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.440
 Let me hear you play from the seventeenth paragraph. 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.400
 wow 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:20.729
 woo 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:26.309
 Oh, you were so good at it. 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:30.539
 21. welcomes in particular also stared well then chisigo left the next degree Les City State 

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:36.539
 You'll need a very fast toward the pubic bone to the city bream 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:40.409
 So it was that one second that all the time that 56 of those brief moments 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:41.999
 You need to put all of your 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:46.079
 It's very important. 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:51.869
 If this does not work well, please slowly pull out the part separately and play it 

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:52.709
 After exercising your right hand, you then join your left hand and then the whole 

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:57.029
 Put it together 

00:05:52.709 --> 00:06:02.879
 That's why you have to play this 34 times to be a master. 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:08.909
 Here are 34 and you are left-handed, because in addition to practicing tail and dreams 1 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:14.429
 Hasyeoseo how well you utilize the right meat is complete, depending on who put the beat 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:16.889

00:06:14.429 --> 00:06:22.009
 You need to be very careful.
