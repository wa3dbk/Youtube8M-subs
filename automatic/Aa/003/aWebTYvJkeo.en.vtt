00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
the world is becoming more and more an

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.320 
the world is becoming more and more an
urban<00:00:03.149> place<00:00:04.049> today<00:00:04.740> there's<00:00:05.069> 50%<00:00:05.879> of<00:00:06.240> the

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
urban place today there's 50% of the

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.310 
urban place today there's 50% of the
world's<00:00:06.569> population<00:00:07.069> living<00:00:08.069> in<00:00:08.460> urban<00:00:08.820> areas

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
world's population living in urban areas

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.140 
world's population living in urban areas
and<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.590> next<00:00:10.889> 30<00:00:11.099> years<00:00:11.190> will<00:00:11.519> add<00:00:11.670> two<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.059> a

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
and the next 30 years will add two and a

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.749 
and the next 30 years will add two and a
half<00:00:12.300> billion<00:00:12.660> people<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.440> so<00:00:13.650> by<00:00:13.860> 2050

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
half billion people to that so by 2050

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.750 
half billion people to that so by 2050
our<00:00:15.440> expectation<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.619> 70%<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.699> the

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
our expectation is that 70% of the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.970 
our expectation is that 70% of the
world's<00:00:18.029> population<00:00:18.720> will<00:00:19.020> be<00:00:19.560> living<00:00:19.859> in

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
world's population will be living in

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.189 
world's population will be living in
urban<00:00:20.189> areas<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.390> think<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.660> challenge

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
urban areas and I think the challenge

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.920 
urban areas and I think the challenge
for<00:00:22.350> all<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.740> us<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:24.119> use<00:00:24.449> this

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
for all of us is to use this

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.929 
for all of us is to use this
urbanization<00:00:25.439> as<00:00:25.890> an<00:00:26.010> opportunity<00:00:26.550> to

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
urbanization as an opportunity to

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.000 
urbanization as an opportunity to
address<00:00:27.660> some<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.930> real<00:00:28.080> challenges<00:00:28.109> that

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
address some of the real challenges that

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.859 
address some of the real challenges that
the<00:00:29.250> world<00:00:29.279> faces<00:00:29.609> economic<00:00:30.330> challenges

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the world faces economic challenges

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.020 
the world faces economic challenges
social<00:00:31.769> challenges<00:00:32.340> environmental

social challenges environmental

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.850

challenges<00:00:33.570> because<00:00:34.170> they<00:00:34.260> will<00:00:34.410> exist<00:00:34.739> in

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
challenges because they will exist in

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.620 
challenges because they will exist in
some<00:00:35.280> ways<00:00:35.430> they<00:00:35.610> have<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.880> potential<00:00:36.180> to

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
some ways they have the potential to

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.479 
some ways they have the potential to
expand<00:00:37.380> if<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.620> don't<00:00:37.770> get<00:00:37.890> ahead<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.219> them<00:00:38.309> I

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
expand if we don't get ahead of them I

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.270 
expand if we don't get ahead of them I
think<00:00:38.850> historically<00:00:39.530> we<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.680> assumed<00:00:41.129> that

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
think historically we have assumed that

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.970 
think historically we have assumed that
we<00:00:41.370> can<00:00:41.670> leave<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.239> all<00:00:43.170> these<00:00:43.350> challenges

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
we can leave this all these challenges

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.529 
we can leave this all these challenges
to<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> government<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:45.210> solve<00:00:45.360> these

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
to the government to solve these

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.959 
to the government to solve these
problems<00:00:45.600> or<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> nonprofit<00:00:46.440> community<00:00:47.129> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
problems or the nonprofit community to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.190 
problems or the nonprofit community to
solve<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> problems<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> business

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
solve the problems and the business

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.290 
solve the problems and the business
doesn't<00:00:49.440> need<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.890> get<00:00:50.070> involved<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:51.059> think

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
doesn't need to get involved and I think

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.639 
doesn't need to get involved and I think
that's<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.600> no<00:00:51.750> longer<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.170> case<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.500> think

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
that's just no longer the case I think

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.189 
that's just no longer the case I think
business<00:00:52.949> has<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.670> step<00:00:53.940> up<00:00:54.149> has<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.989> play<00:00:55.170> a

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
business has to step up has to play a

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.590 
business has to step up has to play a
much<00:00:55.500> more<00:00:55.710> active<00:00:55.949> role<00:00:56.160> not<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.210> replace<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
much more active role not to replace the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.689 
much more active role not to replace the
government<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.379> replace<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.010> nonprofit

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
government not to replace the nonprofit

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.970 
government not to replace the nonprofit
sector<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.660> bring<00:01:00.899> its<00:01:01.109> talents<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.829> its

of<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.559> solution<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.220> mean<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.460> reality<00:01:05.909> now

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
of the solution I mean the reality now

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.490 
of the solution I mean the reality now
is<00:01:06.090> government<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.720> able<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.049> do<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> lot<00:01:07.470> less

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
is government is able to do a lot less

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.890 
is government is able to do a lot less
they<00:01:07.950> don't<00:01:08.130> have<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> resources<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.270> many

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
they don't have the resources in many

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.530 
they don't have the resources in many
ways<00:01:10.080> they<00:01:10.290> don't<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.540> collaboration

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
ways they don't have the collaboration

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.240 
ways they don't have the collaboration
and<00:01:12.869> what's<00:01:13.140> interesting<00:01:13.500> right<00:01:13.920> now<00:01:14.070> is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
and what's interesting right now is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.210 
and what's interesting right now is
you're<00:01:14.400> seeing<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:15.240> cities<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.500> urban<00:01:16.650> areas

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
you're seeing in cities and urban areas

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.800 
you're seeing in cities and urban areas
not<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.490> all<00:01:17.939> these<00:01:18.060> people<00:01:18.119> we<00:01:18.540> talked

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
not just all these people we talked

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.510 
not just all these people we talked
about<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.619> you're<00:01:19.710> actually<00:01:19.860> seeing<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
about but you're actually seeing the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.030 
about but you're actually seeing the
kind<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.820> collaboration<00:01:21.630> between<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.560> public

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
kind of collaboration between the public

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.260 
kind of collaboration between the public
and<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> private<00:01:23.460> sector<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> nonprofit

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
and the private sector the nonprofit

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.600 
and the private sector the nonprofit
community<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.860> way<00:01:25.979> that's<00:01:26.189> addressing

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
community in a way that's addressing

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.310 
community in a way that's addressing
these<00:01:26.880> challenges<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.810> don't<00:01:28.080> always

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
these challenges that you don't always

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.410 
these challenges that you don't always
see<00:01:28.470> at<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.799> federal<00:01:29.159> level<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:30.000> think<00:01:30.210> the

see at the federal level and I think the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.730 
see at the federal level and I think the
private<00:01:30.600> sector<00:01:30.780> has<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> genuine

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
some of these challenges we can't thrive

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.539
