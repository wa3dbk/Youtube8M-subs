00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.199
 hello to all following the abba article 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.390
 going there actually had to talk about putting it well 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.060
 in place the system of notifications on 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.039
 the different elements and that made 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.880
 tilt actually I told myself this is 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.180
 true that it's been a while since 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.800
 I had not I'm not going to have the parks have 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.320
 figured actually since my passing from 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.719
 free to the hh the settings gave from 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.570
 notification on the nas so in fact there 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.969
 I will quickly introduce you 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.050
 how to put for mac the 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.070
 notics in place on your nas synology 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.480
 you simply go to the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.090
 control panel and in the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.210
 party notification you will be able 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.379
 prevent in fact either by mail or by 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.449
 sms either by push 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.219
 so me if what will interest me is going 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.210
 to be at first to configure 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:07.020
 the mails and to check that it's 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.270
 that the mails are well send it so to 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.290
 know that at ovh actually I have a little 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.330
 galley to find the address the 6th 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.159
 tpc in this case hassan tt point dsl 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.869
 points 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.060
 ovh for another him because you 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.310
 know that I'm at ovh at the level of 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.330
 provider of internet access and that 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.540
 blow I must not pass them 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.320
 service mtp the idea is going to be to know 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:40.540
 to send an email to another so 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:40.540
 @ gmail dot com is on fixed loan no 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.479
 tac tac tac normally it's good 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.700
 I 'm applying and I sent a mail from 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.250
 test 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.600
 we'll see if it happens so in fact the 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.009
 point of knows that his share in the 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.420
 spam box so we do not see the 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.780
 notifiers so it does not matter 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.940
 basically it's google that says attention 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.789
 many users have noticed as 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.530
 do not get me messages like that right there 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.080
 in this case it is not the case but 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.510
 is that for the part box is 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.099
 see you're not worried so what can 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.900
 to be nice too to set up and the 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:23.299
 party notification sms for example the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.650
 nas and waved and so in fact it is 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.760
 connected in usb to the inverter of the blow if 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.069
 I have a battery problem 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.230
 if I have a current problem it's me 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.620
 will automatically prevent by SMS as 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.320
 what I have a problem so hard 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.320
 so you may have a phone 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.350
 who hangs out under android that you know 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.019
 could I if I farted -3 so suddenly I 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.880
 use it as a sms and e gateway 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.579
 I will show you how to 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.930
 set it up and which one will activate 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:59.239
 SMS notification 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.720
 we will use sms gateway so to you 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.549
 see on the left side of the screen there 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.790
 is the party there is the party 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:11.870
 configuration so obviously there I had 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.739
 prepared trick so here I am going back 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.739
 at the base of 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.830
 at the base of the trick the base of the virus and 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.810
 sms gateway is actually it presents itself 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.630
 like that so in the party it's in 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.150
 we're going to use the http part so 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.520
 we'll say you listen you listen you 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.870
 http and sends an order testifies 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.610
 how is she is we will do that we 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.790
 will do that glee salt for the 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:42.480
 moment tap tap tap and in the game 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.960
 http setting we will tell him good 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.980
 listen you listen on port 90 90 you 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.400
 need a password 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.680
 so here that will be apt x6 and as 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.320
 lurette of call back that we do not care 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.690
 there is no need 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:02.790
 so once we've done that we see 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:06.200
 that there is here the example with with the 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:10.290
 what is the name of the url 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:13.200
 how is it going at the level of the nas 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.350
 the sign of synology in fact we go here to 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.370
 added a server to server is there when 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:24.840
 the gas we will call it and sleep 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.760
 at itway as the name of the software and 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.210
 we look at the tutorial to see what they 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.950
 ask 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.660
 she's actually going to see who are asking in 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.220
 does four fields so me what I 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:38.670
 offers you it's just 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:42.870
 copy it and put it in 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:47.970
 in the bottom here except that here we go 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:50.550
 put the ip address of the phone into 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:05:00.370
 the occurrence and I told you the address 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:05:03.560
 ip it's 180 88 on port 90 90 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:14.020
 tac tac tac and after he says what in 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:14.020
 the url says he says he said what 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:21.860
 device first run would remain center in 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.380
 big is that for the interrogation user 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:30.200

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.660
 it's not all his fans here is a mask 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:45.230

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:50.780
 fun and text is for a text not to 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:56.200

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.420
 will allow here are two meters of my 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.290
 pay so the username will put 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:29.120

 the password I had put a word 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:07:00.740

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:12.699
 of the screen 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:15.169

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:19.669
 ah yes before doing the test it takes 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:23.810
