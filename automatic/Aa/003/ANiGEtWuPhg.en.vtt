hi my name is sin in this video I'm
going<00:00:02.250> to<00:00:02.370> show<00:00:02.520> you<00:00:02.580> how<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.820> create<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.179> simple

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
going to show you how to create a simple

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.349 
going to show you how to create a simple
app<00:00:03.810> with<00:00:04.259> one<00:00:04.500> view<00:00:05.000> let's<00:00:06.000> start<00:00:06.210> with

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
app with one view let's start with

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.290 
app with one view let's start with
creating<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.779> new<00:00:06.930> project<00:00:06.960> in<00:00:07.500> Xcode<00:00:08.300> now

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
creating a new project in Xcode now

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.400 
creating a new project in Xcode now
typically<00:00:09.660> if<00:00:09.870> you're<00:00:09.990> going<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.170> create<00:00:10.290> an

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
typically if you're going to create an

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.410 
typically if you're going to create an
application<00:00:10.530> with<00:00:10.980> one<00:00:11.160> view<00:00:11.490> you'll<00:00:12.030> use<00:00:12.269> the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
application with one view you'll use the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.419 
application with one view you'll use the
view<00:00:12.599> based<00:00:12.809> application<00:00:13.440> but<00:00:14.219> put<00:00:14.370> the

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
view based application but put the

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.770 
view based application but put the
purposes<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:14.880> demonstration<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.630> for

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
purposes of this demonstration and for

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.180 
purposes of this demonstration and for
learning<00:00:16.109> we're<00:00:16.320> going<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.500> use<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.830> windows

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
learning we're going to use a windows

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.480 
learning we're going to use a windows
based<00:00:17.369> application<00:00:18.980> will<00:00:19.980> call<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.279> one

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
based application will call this one

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.450 
based application will call this one
simple<00:00:21.300> app

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.040 

okay<00:00:26.060> and<00:00:26.330> the<00:00:26.539> first<00:00:26.720> thing<00:00:26.810> we're<00:00:26.900> going<00:00:26.990> to

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
okay and the first thing we're going to

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.810 
okay and the first thing we're going to
do<00:00:27.199> is<00:00:27.439> create<00:00:27.679> a<00:00:27.769> class<00:00:28.039> that<00:00:28.220> will<00:00:28.339> drive<00:00:28.609> our

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
do is create a class that will drive our

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.220 
do is create a class that will drive our
new<00:00:29.000> view<00:00:29.300> and<00:00:30.339> it<00:00:31.339> will<00:00:31.460> be<00:00:31.609> a

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
new view and it will be a

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.380 
new view and it will be a
uiviewcontroller<00:00:33.309> class<00:00:34.309> will<00:00:34.970> call<00:00:35.149> this

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
uiviewcontroller class will call this

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.810 
uiviewcontroller class will call this
first<00:00:36.379> form<00:00:36.769> view<00:00:37.430> controller<00:00:39.699> we're<00:00:40.699> not

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
first form view controller we're not

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.130 
first form view controller we're not
really<00:00:40.969> going<00:00:41.120> to<00:00:41.180> write<00:00:41.329> any<00:00:41.449> code<00:00:41.540> in<00:00:41.900> first

really going to write any code in first
view<00:00:42.500> phone<00:00:42.769> controller<00:00:43.360> but<00:00:44.360> we<00:00:44.480> will<00:00:44.659> create

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
view phone controller but we will create

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.170 
view phone controller but we will create
a<00:00:45.170> new<00:00:45.230> resource<00:00:46.190> a<00:00:47.860> new<00:00:48.860> zip<00:00:49.640> file<00:00:49.850> that's<00:00:50.089> an

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
view control that we just created which

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.389 
view control that we just created which
is<00:01:11.939> first<00:01:12.149> one<00:01:12.360> view<00:01:12.570> controller<00:01:13.310> let's<00:01:14.310> go

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
is first one view controller let's go

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.580 
is first one view controller let's go
ahead<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.640> add<00:01:14.759> a<00:01:14.790> view<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.990> our<00:01:19.080> first<00:01:19.259> form

ahead and add a view to our first form

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.740 
ahead and add a view to our first form
view<00:01:19.830> zip<00:01:20.039> file<00:01:20.250> will<00:01:21.240> change<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> background

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
view zip file will change the background

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.719 
view zip file will change the background
of<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:23.299> different<00:01:24.299> color<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.750> maybe

what we need to do to actually get our

what we need to do to actually get our

form to show up is create a view

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.940 
form to show up is create a view
controller<00:02:59.420> tell<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.630> load<00:03:00.870> our<00:03:01.170> first

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.690 
controller tell it to load our first
form<00:03:02.280> view<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:03.000> view<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.180> we<00:03:03.360> created<00:03:04.700> will

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
form view the view that we created will

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.949 
form view the view that we created will
let's<00:03:06.450> see<00:03:06.780> here<00:03:08.390> change<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.540> class<00:03:09.780> you're

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
let's see here change the class you're

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.380 
let's see here change the class you're
the<00:03:10.050> first<00:03:10.290> form<00:03:10.590> view<00:03:10.980> controller

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.240 

and<00:03:13.480> since<00:03:14.230> our<00:03:14.380> delegate<00:03:14.860> has<00:03:15.370> a<00:03:15.400> form<00:03:15.940> one

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.650 

variable<00:03:21.180> will<00:03:21.570> match<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.840> there<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:23.660> that's

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
variable will match it there and that's

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.400 
variable will match it there and that's
it<00:03:25.190> so<00:03:26.190> really<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.520> trick<00:03:26.700> here<00:03:26.850> is<00:03:27.410> creating

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
it so really the trick here is creating

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.680 
it so really the trick here is creating
a<00:03:28.560> view<00:03:29.010> controller<00:03:29.100> within<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.970> main<00:03:30.210> window

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
a view controller within the main window

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.760 
a view controller within the main window
that<00:03:31.080> zib<00:03:31.700> have<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:33.000> view<00:03:33.470> view<00:03:34.470> controller

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
that zib have that view view controller

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.980 
that zib have that view view controller
reference<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.880> view<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.120> we<00:03:36.240> created<00:03:36.840> on

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
reference the view that we created on

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.920 
reference the view that we created on
the<00:03:37.200> external<00:03:37.470> file<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:38.390> then<00:03:39.390> tell<00:03:39.630> your<00:03:39.750> app

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
the external file and then tell your app

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.620 
the external file and then tell your app
delegate<00:03:42.140> about<00:03:43.140> that<00:03:43.320> view<00:03:43.530> controller<00:03:44.630> so

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
delegate about that view controller so

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.270 
delegate about that view controller so
if<00:03:45.690> we<00:03:45.810> are<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:46.080> if<00:03:46.380> we<00:03:46.650> were<00:03:46.740> to<00:03:46.860> exit

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
if we are to if we were to exit

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.730 
if we are to if we were to exit
interface<00:03:48.209> builder<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.750> run<00:03:49.620> our

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
interface builder and run our

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.050 
interface builder and run our
application<00:03:51.860> you'll<00:03:52.860> see<00:03:53.100> that<00:03:53.550> it<00:03:53.700> loaded

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
application you'll see that it loaded

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.959 
application you'll see that it loaded
first<00:03:54.690> form
