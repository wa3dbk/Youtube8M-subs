00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900
 if current coming only seventh episode and before the computer tips Voigt me 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.050
 a few 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.249
 Heike further introduces 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:11.549
 I can be first with 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.549
 the complementary thing clever 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.070
 Program can be done a lot 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.829
 it's probably best, too 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:24.130
 Cologne the best extensions program of Sky and 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.289
 There are more business customers and more professional 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.960
 who knows her without work as much as I can cost the AUVA at 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.660
 and per year 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.310
 on the one hand, it is possible to enter the program 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.690
 first of all, make an answering machine 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.120
 laterally next to one 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.640
 You click on Answering machine and goes uphill a spam message 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.470
 they would play if somebody called them and did not mention them 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.480
 have that 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.480
 the first thing is very well planned 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.490
 you can here 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.490
 around 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.610
 So Dantewada Prof 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.610
 Mandatory event even comes out a lot 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.400
 Car come 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.090
 Conference large credit murder 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.090
 then the tour goes through game for the enforcement 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.540
 Editor for personal message 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.710
 Furthermore, there are still talks on 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.550
 we take them seriously bathing couple of conversations recorded for example 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.350
 be at the answering machine 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.220
 this style again 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.210
 the negotiations became easy 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.340
 identified 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.350
 but now he comes guided tours 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.260
 back by standing when someone calls you 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.910
 then you can just 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.690
 continues through 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.550
 this means 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.980
 This is a small window 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.190
 and then you have clicked through them and then could deliver 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.850
 who they want to be here of course only an animal becomes contacts 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.089
 so for eternity this extension is 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.689
 here they were off 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:21.989
 do we still have 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.989
 context 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.749
 The law did not open because it was still open 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.709
 they have one here 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.709
 because managed opens 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:38.419
 they can then play a file 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.059
 So an audio file legally which 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:44.969
 I had not chosen one time 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.969
 and hike promptly 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.909
 to see her say promptly 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.959
 where she might once again continue in the evening 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.289
 will be online as soon as this person goes online 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:00.829
 Dieter parts played 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.810
 also a very useful extensions because they know immediately 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:05.960
 Online is 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.029
 Hansa has 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:10.029
 you have to say that actually would be too 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.279
 Live here 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.359
 Wewer TrustCenter the taskbar here 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.009
 to become too 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:21.309
 then the contacts the Gratkorn come in indicated 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.519
 Anette's still there 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.969
 an extension is what's called percent Rolf Sabolic 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:36.359
 they can play with someone, bowling 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:40.729
 and percent 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.780
 He can send his invitations to the respective ones 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.409
 people 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.429
 and I used to do it again and again 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.429
 repro 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.139
 Now we have to wait until Cagdas 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:00.759
 I avoid it 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:04.099
 Public Value does not know if the contract of the other 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.009
 so if you want to play dumb we are now 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.099
 As the name indicates 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.079
 and she's a bit stupid at times but I think so too 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.709
 found relatively good play 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.709
 Keith, there are not many and most are 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.400
 it is worth turning on Prof 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:38.209
 and then we did not have the choice between holding strongly 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.760
 shooting under the title so that in actually everything is done quite well 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.389
 and how he already tried it 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.100
 In many I can sat down but it is quite funny that too 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.520
 do 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.509
 the doctors calculate
