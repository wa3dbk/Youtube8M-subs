00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.270
 hello good all physically there are 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.740
 people in this video I will teach you 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.990
 each and every one of the guns there 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.380
 in this extinction mode first is this 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:27.310
 is the 226 gun after it would be the 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:31.000
 magnum of 44 after would be the 91 m and 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.890
 finally it would be the crack mp 443 let's 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.070
 try each one of them starting with 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.510
 the p 226 this is the first gun that 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.120
 they also give us that we started the game in 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.760
 level 1 kills pretty well to do 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.309
 the first weapon has 100 bullets in total 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.900
 and 12 in the charger you have to kill there 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.729
 to shoot enough times to kill 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.680
 to the alien but good considering 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:52.030
 which is the first weapon because it's not bad 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.379
 not bad 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.460
 now let's go to the second one that would be the 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.440
 magnum of 44 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.930
 this gun we will not get it in 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.180
 level 7 and at level 7 we are going to 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.150
 give almost practically a shot like 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.520
 you are seeing has fewer bullets is 64 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.280
 bullets total 16 in the charger but 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.500
 kills more and already looks good already 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.330
 Let no difference nonconforming 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.790
 going up in level as we improve 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.850
 of weapon and this would be the second weapon a 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.200
 magnum of 44 we go to the next weapon 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.539
 that would be the 9 to 1 m 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.369
 from now on the good starts 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.979
 This is semi-automatic and they will not give it 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.490
 at level 13 it has a 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.979
 total of 144 bullets and 18 in the charger 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.369
 goes a lot better than the machine and the 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.649
 first and it kills a lot easier to be a thousand 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.600
 times better than the other cough you know 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:49.399
 level 13 and it is the m 9 to 1 the perfect me 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.679
 love it but now you must know the 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:56.360
 last that is the akrach mp 443 this is 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.310
 undoubtedly the best of all and that's why 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.240
 they leave it for the last one you get in 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.849
 level 16 and have 105 bullets in total 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.369
 and 15 in the charger is totally 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:09.799
 automatic as you are seeing for me the 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.000
 better a piece of guns and although yes 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.630
 It is true that you have less for those who 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.370
 the m9 to one kills much better and in addition to 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.650
 to be automatic is that it goes a thousand times 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.500
 better than the other one, you'll check it 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.670
 from level 16 and you know these 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.319
 lacras mp 443 the best of all 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.420
 people here I leave you with everything that has 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.310
 been the test of the pistols all the 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.380
 pistols that are in extinction and I hope 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.359
 that you like that you check it and that 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.200
 go far to like your videos and 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.200
