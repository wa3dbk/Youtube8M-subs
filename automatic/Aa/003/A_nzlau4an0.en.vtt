00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.680
 hello to all today go to Morocco with a tajine recipe 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.439
 lamb with almonds and prunes 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:16.439
 so for the little recipe we are going to need dexia 5 types of meat 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.759
 lamb so rather of the combat shoulder previously cut into 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:20.699
 parts 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.169
 kato color range 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:23.810
 five grams of blanched almonds 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.890
 four unions so the equivalent of 500 grams pretty much 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.509
 two cloves of garlic 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.239
 three tablespoons of honey 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.239
 cinnamon legs and a little saffron 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.670
 from the barracks and dug 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.680
 olive oils for cooking 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.360
 a little salt a little pepper 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.680
 so now we have two ingredients we have not done the 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.250
 preparation so first step we will take care of the lambs and so we go 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.580
 start by peeling the minced 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.950
 so the new suitor so cook them so if you have a 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.110
 plated gines do not hesitate to use it we chose the casserole 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.040
 so in which we will cook the onions in the hot oil 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.520
 we gave are golden brown so we will continue cooking by adding the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.770
 ingredients 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.250
 so to start we will take the manager so we will ask gently 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.250
 In the caserole 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.910
 then we continue with the garlic and so we will have previously achi 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.290
 finely 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.710
 we added tourists so cinnamon ginger saffron 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.980
 and a little bit of korian months 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.650
 then we put fines 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.990
 here you go see in decoration it's really nice too 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.990
 a little salt a little pear 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.570
 we mix everything 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.110
 we have to cover with the water so we're going to use the height and we 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.940
 will terro perform a soft gun 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.640
 so while our regime is fleeing we are going to take care of 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.280
 prunes 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.229
 so there you need about 500 grams of prunes so we go 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.030
 listen 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.030
 we go and add in a pan with honey to caramelize 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.780
 and you will see 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.780
 succulent 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.750
 so now we have taken a caramelized meaning we will be able to add them 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.750
 at tj -nd and cook for another 5 to 10 minutes 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.389
