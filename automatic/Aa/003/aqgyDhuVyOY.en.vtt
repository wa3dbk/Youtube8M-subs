00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.870
 despite the sharp tone of the Russian debate 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.730
 United States and the EU and the interim government in 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.400
 Kiev still managed to outline a solution 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.080
 Ukrainian crisis all illegal 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.740
 armed forces must be 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.190
 disarmed 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.029
 all illegally occupied buildings must be 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.910
 returned by the legitimate owner all 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.210
 occupied street square others 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.410
 public places in all cities of Ukraine 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.660
 should be released the government 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.090
 Ukraine has confirmed that it grants amnesty 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.040
 protesters and those who leave the building and 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.379
 other public places lay down 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.489
 except for the guilty 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.260
 offenses to assist by 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.789
 fulfillment of the planned steps to the country 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.480
 a special mission will be sent 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.160
 international observers and russia usa 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.870
 the European Union is already involved in this 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.460
 monitoring missions composition will 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.010
 expand according to the accepted 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.680
 earlier decision we b with e and and permanent 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.460
 advice and we will support the work 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.119
 this mission 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:11.159
 once again stressed on setting up 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.760
 dialogue between the parties so that the step 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.229
 by step and in a complex based on 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.080
 reciprocity unlock different 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.670
 situations and longitude 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.950
 however despite all the diplomatic 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:29.100
 efforts to ease tensions on 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:31.229
 Ukraine, USA continue to make threats I 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.479
 made it clear to the Minister of Laurel that if we 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.880
 see no immediate progress no 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.930
 will see the accomplishments achieved 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.299
 We will not have an agreement 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.479
 choice but to introduce additional 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.640
 sanctions against Russia according to many 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.530
 experts it is unlikely that such 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.180
 rhetoric can help diplomatic 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.570
 effort 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.369
 ellen and this will alienate russia leaving us in 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.680
 while they need russia 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.360
 much more than they think beyond that 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.130
 will not defuse the situation in Ukraine 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.659
 the United States imposes responsibility on Russia 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.520
 for riots in Ukraine at the same time 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.290
 Washington actively supports Kiev 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.640
 government which is fighting with 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.250
 protesters in the east 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.170
 President Obama approved an additional 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.550
 non-lethal military assistance to Ukraine 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.349
 including system medications 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.500
 life support and other material 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.690
 means the excitement in the east of Ukraine 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.010
 started after two months ago 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.050
 in a coup d'Ã©tat 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.000
 was dismissed from his post legally 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.739
 elected president of the country millions 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.720
 Russian-speaking Ukrainians have felt 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.950
 that they could lose their rights to weaken 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.170
 tension interim government 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.489
 Ukraine promised to consider 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.840
 granting eastern regions 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.840
 greater autonomy 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.940
 resolution of the crisis in Ukraine in 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:50.010
 interests of both europe and the us and russian and 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.810
 Ukrainian governments to meet in 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.400
 Geneva, the West sought 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.470
 to place all responsibility for 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.799
 settlement of the Ukrainian crisis on 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.360
 Russia meanwhile members of the national

 militias in the east 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.769
 hope that when world leaders 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.250
 say the Ukrainians themselves must decide their 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.400
 fate 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.390
