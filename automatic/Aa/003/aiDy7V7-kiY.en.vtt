the<00:00:14.280> first<00:00:14.490> part<00:00:14.820> here<00:00:15.320> this<00:00:16.320> section<00:00:16.590> right

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
the first part here this section right

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.359 
the first part here this section right
here<00:00:16.890> I'm<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:18.530> pointing<00:00:19.530> out<00:00:19.860> that<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.850> found

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
here I'm just pointing out that I found

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.210 
here I'm just pointing out that I found
documentation<00:00:23.369> here<00:00:23.790> that<00:00:24.060> shows<00:00:24.830> what<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
documentation here that shows what the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.700 
documentation here that shows what the
roller<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.940> roller<00:00:27.150> dimension<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.960> for<00:00:28.680> a

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
roller to roller dimension is for a

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.569 
roller to roller dimension is for a
series<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:30.439> DB<00:00:31.460> GFC<00:00:32.460> pumps<00:00:33.350> so<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> DB<00:00:34.680> GFC

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
series of the DB GFC pumps so the DB GFC

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.290 
series of the DB GFC pumps so the DB GFC
629<00:00:36.540> that's<00:00:37.470> a<00:00:37.950> pump<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.910> has<00:00:38.940> larger<00:00:39.900> OD

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
629 that's a pump that has larger OD

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.479 
629 that's a pump that has larger OD
pistons<00:00:42.300> those<00:00:42.540> little<00:00:42.840> Pistons<00:00:43.470> in<00:00:43.620> there<00:00:43.860> so

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
pistons those little Pistons in there so

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.910 
pistons those little Pistons in there so
that's<00:00:44.880> obviously<00:00:45.120> gonna<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:45.840> for<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> bigger

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
that's obviously gonna be for a bigger

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.830 
that's obviously gonna be for a bigger
engine<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.580> it<00:00:47.820> says<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.240> was<00:00:48.360> used<00:00:48.540> on<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
engine and it says that was used on the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:58.190 
engine and it says that was used on the
Oliver<00:00:49.020> 880<00:00:51.050> so<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.260> DB<00:00:52.530> G<00:00:54.020> 627<00:00:55.910> -<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.720> H<00:00:57.900> and

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
Oliver 880 so the DB G 627 - to be H and

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.100 
Oliver 880 so the DB G 627 - to be H and
-<00:00:58.470> 3<00:00:58.890> P<00:00:59.100> H<00:00:59.250> both<00:00:59.700> say<00:01:00.060> that<00:01:00.090> they're<00:01:00.420> for<00:01:00.810> the

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
- 3 P H both say that they're for the

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.960 
- 3 P H both say that they're for the
Oliver<00:01:02.060> 770<00:01:03.060> and<00:01:03.619> they<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.970> dimension

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
Oliver 770 and they have a dimension

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.929 
Oliver 770 and they have a dimension
given<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.509> 1.9<00:01:07.259> 75<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.520> that's<00:01:08.700> five

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
given of 1.9 75 so that's five

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.330 
given of 1.9 75 so that's five
thousandths<00:01:09.630> less<00:01:09.869> than<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.830> dimension<00:01:11.310> that

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
thousandths less than the dimension that

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.730 
thousandths less than the dimension that
I<00:01:11.490> had<00:01:11.850> been<00:01:12.119> given<00:01:12.450> by<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.630> suppliers<00:01:13.259> so

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
I had been given by the suppliers so

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.710 
I had been given by the suppliers so
that<00:01:14.369> kind<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.670> makes<00:01:14.820> me<00:01:14.909> think<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.299> yeah

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
that kind of makes me think that yeah

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.359 
that kind of makes me think that yeah
that<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.259> know<00:01:16.380> at<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.799> point<00:01:17.039> I'm<00:01:17.249> starting

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
that you know at this point I'm starting

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.370 
that you know at this point I'm starting
to<00:01:17.549> figure<00:01:17.700> out<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.179> the<00:01:18.689> one<00:01:18.899> point<00:01:19.200> nine

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
to figure out that the one point nine

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.399 
to figure out that the one point nine
eight<00:01:19.649> zero<00:01:19.679> is<00:01:20.249> probably<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.299> correct<00:01:21.509> OD

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
eight zero is probably the correct OD

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.200 
eight zero is probably the correct OD
for<00:01:22.770> my<00:01:22.890> pump<00:01:23.219> which<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.670> DB<00:01:24.119> GFC<00:01:25.490> 627<00:01:26.490> -<00:01:26.670> one

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
for my pump which is a DB GFC 627 - one

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.059 
for my pump which is a DB GFC 627 - one
IDI<00:01:28.789> so<00:01:29.789> at<00:01:29.939> first<00:01:29.969> I<00:01:30.359> contemplate<00:01:31.049> using<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
IDI so at first I contemplate using the

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.539 
IDI so at first I contemplate using the
one<00:01:32.819> point<00:01:33.119> nine<00:01:33.299> seven<00:01:33.630> five<00:01:34.460> dimension<00:01:35.460> that

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
one point nine seven five dimension that

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.149 
one point nine seven five dimension that
I<00:01:35.609> found<00:01:35.909> here<00:01:36.179> for<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.630> 770<00:01:37.409> tractor<00:01:37.859> pump

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
I found here for the 770 tractor pump

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.910 
I found here for the 770 tractor pump
but<00:01:39.149> then<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.719> realized<00:01:40.200> since<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.560> only<00:01:40.619> five

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
but then I realized since it's only five

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.039 
but then I realized since it's only five
thousands<00:01:41.549> less<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.179> might<00:01:42.539> as<00:01:42.659> well<00:01:42.689> just

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
thousands less I might as well just

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.749 
thousands less I might as well just
stick<00:01:43.289> with<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:43.770> point<00:01:44.039> nine<00:01:44.369> eight<00:01:44.399> zero

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
stick with the one point nine eight zero

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.629 
stick with the one point nine eight zero
that<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.740> got<00:01:46.740> from<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.069> distributor

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:47.639 
that I that I got from the distributor

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:49.639 
that I that I got from the distributor
and<00:01:47.759> figure<00:01:48.329> out<00:01:48.450> what<00:01:48.659> I'm<00:01:48.780> doing<00:01:49.109> wrong<00:01:49.289> as

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
and figure out what I'm doing wrong as

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.639 
and figure out what I'm doing wrong as
far<00:01:49.679> as<00:01:50.069> trying<00:01:50.609> to<00:01:50.700> set<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.030> thing<00:01:51.560> now<00:01:52.560> at

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
far as trying to set this thing now at

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.639 
far as trying to set this thing now at
this<00:01:52.829> point<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.490> actually<00:01:54.329> used<00:01:54.719> dial<00:01:55.020> caliper

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
this point I actually used dial caliper

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.559 
this point I actually used dial caliper
and<00:01:55.859> then<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.159> suddenly<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:57.179> know<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.389> light

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
and then I suddenly you know the light

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.359 
and then I suddenly you know the light
bulb<00:01:57.810> goes<00:01:58.049> on<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.530> figure<00:01:58.829> out<00:01:58.859> what<00:01:59.219> wait

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
bulb goes on and I figure out what wait

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.099 
bulb goes on and I figure out what wait
a<00:01:59.429> minute<00:01:59.670> that's<00:01:59.819> only<00:02:00.090> five<00:02:00.329> thousandths<00:02:01.020> of

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 
a minute that's only five thousandths of

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.219 
a minute that's only five thousandths of
an<00:02:01.259> inch<00:02:01.350> smaller<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.880> 975<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.840> only<00:02:03.990> five

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
an inch smaller the 975 is only five

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.599 
an inch smaller the 975 is only five
thousandths<00:02:04.709> of<00:02:04.740> an<00:02:04.859> inch<00:02:04.950> smaller<00:02:05.159> than

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
thousandths of an inch smaller than

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:08.330 
thousandths of an inch smaller than
ninety<00:02:05.939> eight<00:02:06.259> so<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.289> might<00:02:07.530> as<00:02:07.649> well<00:02:07.679> you<00:02:08.310> know

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
ninety eight so I might as well you know

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.210 
ninety eight so I might as well you know
figure<00:02:08.880> out<00:02:08.970> what<00:02:09.149> I'm<00:02:09.240> doing<00:02:09.479> wrong<00:02:09.660> here

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.760 

so<00:02:14.370> then<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.060> grab<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.690> camera<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.380> install<00:02:16.740> a

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
so then I grab the camera and install a

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.740 
so then I grab the camera and install a
camera<00:02:17.160> temporarily<00:02:17.970> just<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.420> get<00:02:18.540> an<00:02:18.630> idea

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
camera temporarily just to get an idea

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.130 
camera temporarily just to get an idea
of<00:02:19.020> how<00:02:19.260> far<00:02:19.890> off<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.490> am<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.930> quickly

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
of how far off I am and I quickly

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.050 
of how far off I am and I quickly
realized<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:23.010> those<00:02:23.400> rollers<00:02:23.790> are<00:02:23.880> going<00:02:24.000> to

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
realized that those rollers are going to

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.790 
realized that those rollers are going to
need<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.300> come<00:02:24.450> out<00:02:24.570> quite<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.870> bit<00:02:24.990> more<00:02:25.350> in

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
need to come out quite a bit more in

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.540 
need to come out quite a bit more in
order<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.300> even<00:02:27.300> contact<00:02:28.050> any<00:02:29.010> parts<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.460> the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
order to even contact any parts of the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.000 
order to even contact any parts of the
camera<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:30.810> that's<00:02:31.080> when<00:02:31.320> I<00:02:31.350> start<00:02:31.710> to<00:02:31.830> realize

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
camera so that's when I start to realize

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.830 
camera so that's when I start to realize
that<00:02:32.220> I'm<00:02:32.550> just<00:02:32.910> not<00:02:34.640> not<00:02:35.720> adjusting<00:02:36.720> that

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
that I'm just not not adjusting that

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.190 
that I'm just not not adjusting that
leaf<00:02:37.080> spring<00:02:37.440> correctly<00:02:38.600> now<00:02:39.600> at<00:02:39.780> this<00:02:39.930> point

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
leaf spring correctly now at this point

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.710 
leaf spring correctly now at this point
I<00:02:40.440> realized<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.730> probably<00:02:41.880> just<00:02:42.540> don't

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
I realized that I probably just don't

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.980 
I realized that I probably just don't
have<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.020> leaf<00:02:43.200> spring<00:02:43.530> tight<00:02:44.100> enough<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.990> I

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
have the leaf spring tight enough and I

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.530 
have the leaf spring tight enough and I
decide<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.350> tighten<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:46.920> some<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:48.030> see<00:02:48.390> what

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
decide to tighten it some and see what

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.290 
decide to tighten it some and see what
happens<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:50.310> I'm<00:02:50.490> talking<00:02:50.790> about<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.240> I

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
happens and I'm talking about that I

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.420 
happens and I'm talking about that I
think<00:02:51.570> that<00:02:51.990> as<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.350> tighten<00:02:52.800> it<00:02:52.920> it's<00:02:53.160> going<00:02:53.370> to

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
think that as I tighten it it's going to

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.790 
think that as I tighten it it's going to
spread<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.330> spring<00:02:54.780> apart<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.410> allow<00:02:55.590> those

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
spread that spring apart and allow those

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:05.950 
spread that spring apart and allow those
rollers<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.430> come<00:02:56.610> out<00:02:56.760> further

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:13.759 

you

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.080 

so<00:03:14.769> then<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:14.950> take<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.340> screwdriver<00:03:15.849> and<00:03:16.060> I

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
so then I take the screwdriver and I

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.089 
so then I take the screwdriver and I
push<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.510> rollers<00:03:16.870> out<00:03:17.019> a<00:03:17.080> little<00:03:17.470> bit<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:17.860> I

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
push the rollers out a little bit and I

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.680 
push the rollers out a little bit and I
double-check<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:18.940> make<00:03:18.970> sure<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.360> they<00:03:19.510> can

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
double-check to make sure that they can

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.500 
double-check to make sure that they can
no<00:03:19.810> longer<00:03:20.190> come<00:03:21.190> out<00:03:21.310> all<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.670> way<00:03:21.819> that<00:03:22.330> the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
no longer come out all the way that the

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.690 
no longer come out all the way that the
leaf<00:03:22.690> spring<00:03:22.989> is<00:03:23.140> actually<00:03:23.319> doing<00:03:23.769> it<00:03:23.890> doing<00:03:24.549> a

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
leaf spring is actually doing it doing a

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.850 
leaf spring is actually doing it doing a
job<00:03:25.000> of<00:03:25.209> keeping<00:03:25.360> them<00:03:25.659> captive<00:03:26.200> or<00:03:26.470> keeping

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
job of keeping them captive or keeping

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:35.050 
job of keeping them captive or keeping
the<00:03:26.950> shoe<00:03:27.190> captive

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.100 

and<00:03:36.160> he

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
and he

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:46.800 
and he
take<00:03:38.260> a<00:03:38.290> measurement<00:03:38.680> see<00:03:39.040> how<00:03:39.130> close<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.610> am

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.310 

you

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.420 

so<00:03:50.320> first<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.710> try<00:03:50.890> and<00:03:50.950> take<00:03:51.160> a<00:03:51.190> measurement

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
so first I try and take a measurement

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.850 
so first I try and take a measurement
but<00:03:51.970> then<00:03:52.330> I<00:03:52.360> realize<00:03:52.810> what<00:03:53.170> I'll<00:03:53.320> do<00:03:53.500> is<00:03:53.710> I'll

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
but then I realize what I'll do is I'll

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.770 
but then I realize what I'll do is I'll
just<00:03:54.120> set<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.270> dial<00:03:55.630> calipers<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.730> 1.98

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
just set the dial calipers to the 1.98

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.240 
just set the dial calipers to the 1.98
zero<00:03:58.920> setting<00:03:59.920> and<00:04:00.750> see<00:04:01.750> how<00:04:02.020> wide<00:04:02.830> that<00:04:02.860> is

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
zero setting and see how wide that is

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.770 
zero setting and see how wide that is
compared<00:04:03.700> to<00:04:03.820> where<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.090> rollers<00:04:04.390> are<00:04:04.570> right

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
compared to where the rollers are right

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.530 
compared to where the rollers are right
now

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.240 

and<00:04:10.959> I<00:04:11.200> discover<00:04:11.620> that

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
and I discover that

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:22.410 
and I discover that
they<00:04:12.850> need<00:04:13.030> to<00:04:13.120> come<00:04:13.300> out<00:04:13.450> quite<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.720> bit<00:04:13.810> more

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.850 

you

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.310 

and<00:04:25.860> at<00:04:25.980> this<00:04:26.130> point<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:26.550> just<00:04:26.580> decide

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
and at this point I just decide

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.930 
and at this point I just decide
what<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:28.590> should<00:04:28.860> try<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.190> do<00:04:29.430> is<00:04:29.670> find

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
what I should try and do is find

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.940 
what I should try and do is find
something<00:04:30.390> that<00:04:30.540> I<00:04:30.630> can<00:04:30.840> put<00:04:31.110> in<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.710> gap

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
something that I can put in the gap

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.090 
something that I can put in the gap
behind<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.700> shoe<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.780> help<00:04:33.960> keep<00:04:34.200> the<00:04:34.440> rollers

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
behind the shoe to help keep the rollers

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.330 
behind the shoe to help keep the rollers
pushed<00:04:35.940> out<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.570> their<00:04:36.690> maximum<00:04:37.290> limit<00:04:37.680> so<00:04:38.310> I

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
pushed out to their maximum limit so I

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.000 
pushed out to their maximum limit so I
can<00:04:38.550> try<00:04:38.730> and<00:04:38.850> get<00:04:38.970> a<00:04:39.000> better<00:04:39.270> measurement<00:04:40.010> so

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
can try and get a better measurement so

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.770 
can try and get a better measurement so
my<00:04:41.160> first<00:04:41.400> attempt<00:04:41.910> I<00:04:42.000> try<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.420> use<00:04:42.600> these

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
my first attempt I try and use these

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.620 
my first attempt I try and use these
small<00:04:43.650> precision<00:04:44.190> screwdriver<00:04:45.000> blades

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
small precision screwdriver blades

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.000 
small precision screwdriver blades
because<00:04:48.630> they<00:04:48.750> have<00:04:48.870> a<00:04:48.900> nice<00:04:49.140> wedge<00:04:49.440> shape<00:04:49.770> to

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
because they have a nice wedge shape to

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.490 
because they have a nice wedge shape to
them<00:04:50.130> but<00:04:50.880> what<00:04:51.360> I<00:04:51.390> quickly<00:04:51.780> realize<00:04:52.140> is<00:04:52.350> that

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
them but what I quickly realize is that

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.230 
them but what I quickly realize is that
they're<00:04:52.830> just<00:04:53.070> too<00:04:53.250> top-heavy<00:04:53.640> with<00:04:54.090> the

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
they're just too top-heavy with the

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.460 
they're just too top-heavy with the
handles<00:04:54.600> and<00:04:54.750> they<00:04:54.840> just<00:04:55.050> kind<00:04:55.230> of<00:04:55.290> want<00:04:55.440> to

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
handles and they just kind of want to

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.640 
handles and they just kind of want to
keep<00:04:55.590> falling<00:04:56.040> out<00:04:56.720> and<00:04:57.720> then<00:04:58.020> I<00:04:58.050> talked<00:04:58.350> about

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
keep falling out and then I talked about

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.980 
keep falling out and then I talked about
how<00:04:58.860> this<00:04:59.160> is<00:04:59.220> normally<00:05:00.000> supposed<00:05:00.510> to<00:05:00.660> be<00:05:00.780> done

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
how this is normally supposed to be done

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.080 
how this is normally supposed to be done
is<00:05:01.320> that<00:05:01.500> there's<00:05:01.680> a<00:05:01.740> special<00:05:02.010> fixture<00:05:02.820> that

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
is that there's a special fixture that

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.460 
is that there's a special fixture that
you're<00:05:03.240> mount<00:05:03.420> and<00:05:03.540> advice<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:04.170> then<00:05:04.380> you

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
you're mount and advice and then you

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.340 
you're mount and advice and then you
slide<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:05.220> rotor<00:05:05.730> you<00:05:06.270> take<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:06.840> rotor<00:05:07.050> up

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
slide the rotor you take the rotor up

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.090 
slide the rotor you take the rotor up
out<00:05:08.160> of<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.790> head<00:05:09.540> you<00:05:09.840> slide<00:05:10.530> it<00:05:10.710> into<00:05:10.860> this

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
out of the head you slide it into this

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.310 
out of the head you slide it into this
fixture<00:05:11.640> the<00:05:12.150> fixture<00:05:12.570> is<00:05:12.630> gonna<00:05:12.780> pour<00:05:13.080> it<00:05:13.200> on

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
fixture the fixture is gonna pour it on

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.560 
fixture the fixture is gonna pour it on
it<00:05:13.530> that<00:05:13.740> you<00:05:13.860> actually<00:05:14.400> hook<00:05:15.150> up<00:05:15.300> your

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
it that you actually hook up your

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.620 
it that you actually hook up your
compressed<00:05:15.990> air<00:05:16.260> to<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:17.030> what<00:05:18.030> happens<00:05:18.420> is

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
compressed air to and what happens is

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.380 
compressed air to and what happens is
you<00:05:19.320> charge<00:05:20.160> it<00:05:20.340> with<00:05:20.430> compressed<00:05:20.820> air<00:05:21.120> and

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
you charge it with compressed air and

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.750 
you charge it with compressed air and
the<00:05:22.020> air<00:05:22.230> pressure<00:05:22.740> will<00:05:23.040> actually<00:05:23.460> push

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
the air pressure will actually push

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.420 
the air pressure will actually push
those<00:05:24.000> little<00:05:24.330> Pistons<00:05:24.900> out<00:05:25.110> on<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:26.040> back<00:05:26.220> to

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
those little Pistons out on the back to

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.560 
those little Pistons out on the back to
the<00:05:26.550> shoes<00:05:26.820> and<00:05:27.120> keep<00:05:27.510> those<00:05:27.860> shoes<00:05:28.860> out<00:05:29.570> to

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
the shoes and keep those shoes out to

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.840 
the shoes and keep those shoes out to
their<00:05:30.690> maximum<00:05:30.870> limit<00:05:31.530> so<00:05:31.800> that<00:05:31.830> you<00:05:32.100> can<00:05:32.250> make

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
their maximum limit so that you can make

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.360 
their maximum limit so that you can make
that<00:05:33.000> adjustment<00:05:33.150> I<00:05:33.920> think<00:05:34.920> I<00:05:35.010> did<00:05:35.190> actually

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
that adjustment I think I did actually

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.720 
that adjustment I think I did actually
find<00:05:35.580> that<00:05:36.410> that<00:05:37.410> jig<00:05:37.710> for<00:05:37.890> sale<00:05:38.160> somewhere

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
find that that jig for sale somewhere

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.850 
find that that jig for sale somewhere
but<00:05:39.000> it<00:05:39.180> was<00:05:39.360> pretty<00:05:39.690> expensive<00:05:40.140> it<00:05:40.470> was<00:05:40.590> a<00:05:40.650> few

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
but it was pretty expensive it was a few

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.400 
but it was pretty expensive it was a few
hundred<00:05:41.490> bucks<00:05:41.760> and<00:05:42.120> so<00:05:42.960> I'm<00:05:43.020> certainly<00:05:43.290> not

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
hundred bucks and so I'm certainly not

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.350 
hundred bucks and so I'm certainly not
going<00:05:43.620> to<00:05:43.680> invest<00:05:43.920> that<00:05:44.130> because<00:05:44.850> I'm<00:05:45.000> not<00:05:45.150> in

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
going to invest that because I'm not in

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:55.519 
going to invest that because I'm not in
the<00:05:45.540> business<00:05:45.750> of<00:05:46.110> repairing<00:05:46.950> pumps

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:55.529 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:07.190 

you

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.690 

so<00:06:08.200> since<00:06:08.470> those<00:06:08.590> largest<00:06:09.100> screwdrivers<00:06:09.580> were

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700 
so since those largest screwdrivers were

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.760 
so since those largest screwdrivers were
giving<00:06:10.000> me<00:06:10.120> fits<00:06:10.450> I<00:06:10.750> decided<00:06:11.200> to<00:06:11.380> grab<00:06:11.560> my

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
giving me fits I decided to grab my

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.680 
giving me fits I decided to grab my
jeweler's<00:06:12.250> screwdrivers<00:06:13.000> because<00:06:13.390> the

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
jeweler's screwdrivers because the

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.930 
jeweler's screwdrivers because the
jeweler's<00:06:14.200> screwdriver<00:06:14.230> blades<00:06:15.220> also<00:06:15.610> have<00:06:15.910> a

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
jeweler's screwdriver blades also have a

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.120 
jeweler's screwdriver blades also have a
little<00:06:16.210> wedge<00:06:16.420> action<00:06:16.750> to<00:06:17.170> them<00:06:17.350> but<00:06:17.950> they're

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
little wedge action to them but they're

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.920 
little wedge action to them but they're
smaller<00:06:18.490> and<00:06:18.730> I<00:06:19.150> figured<00:06:19.450> that<00:06:19.600> might<00:06:19.750> be<00:06:19.900> a

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
smaller and I figured that might be a

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.749 
smaller and I figured that might be a
little<00:06:20.140> more<00:06:20.290> stable

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:25.859 

so<00:06:24.759> I<00:06:24.789> take<00:06:25.089> my<00:06:25.119> measurement<00:06:25.689> with<00:06:25.779> the

00:06:25.859 --> 00:06:25.869 
so I take my measurement with the

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:29.399 
so I take my measurement with the
calipers<00:06:26.439> and<00:06:26.649> I<00:06:26.710> get<00:06:27.059> 1.9<00:06:28.059> 32<00:06:28.869> now<00:06:29.139> at<00:06:29.229> this

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:29.409 
calipers and I get 1.9 32 now at this

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:31.409 
calipers and I get 1.9 32 now at this
point<00:06:29.740> what<00:06:30.069> I<00:06:30.099> didn't<00:06:30.369> realize<00:06:30.399> was<00:06:30.909> I<00:06:31.149> just

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
point what I didn't realize was I just

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:33.089 
point what I didn't realize was I just
took<00:06:31.509> that<00:06:31.719> measurement<00:06:32.080> down<00:06:32.439> about<00:06:32.860> halfway

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:33.099 
took that measurement down about halfway

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:33.989 
took that measurement down about halfway
on<00:06:33.309> the<00:06:33.520> roller

00:06:33.989 --> 00:06:33.999 
on the roller

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:36.359 
on the roller
but<00:06:34.539> because<00:06:34.869> I'm<00:06:35.020> wedging<00:06:35.469> near<00:06:35.649> the<00:06:35.800> top<00:06:36.039> I

00:06:36.359 --> 00:06:36.369 
but because I'm wedging near the top I

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:37.649 
but because I'm wedging near the top I
really<00:06:36.669> need<00:06:36.819> to<00:06:36.849> take<00:06:37.059> the<00:06:37.240> measurement<00:06:37.599> at

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:37.659 
really need to take the measurement at

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:43.700 
really need to take the measurement at
the<00:06:37.689> very<00:06:37.779> top

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.860 

so<00:06:44.710> then<00:06:44.890> I<00:06:44.920> tighten<00:06:45.370> the<00:06:45.460> screw<00:06:45.820> in<00:06:46.030> a<00:06:46.420> little

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
so then I tighten the screw in a little

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.380 
so then I tighten the screw in a little
further<00:06:47.140> and<00:06:47.850> decide<00:06:48.850> to<00:06:48.970> take<00:06:49.150> another

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:49.390 
further and decide to take another

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:57.390 
further and decide to take another
measurement

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:15.660 

you

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:15.670 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.280 

then<00:07:16.670> I<00:07:16.700> realized<00:07:17.180> that<00:07:17.300> my<00:07:17.420> little

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:18.290 
then I realized that my little

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.900 
then I realized that my little
screwdrivers<00:07:19.130> are<00:07:19.160> gonna<00:07:19.310> keep<00:07:19.460> falling<00:07:19.670> out

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:19.910 
screwdrivers are gonna keep falling out

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:27.820 
screwdrivers are gonna keep falling out
on<00:07:19.970> me<00:07:20.270> and<00:07:20.360> driving<00:07:20.660> me<00:07:20.750> crazy

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:27.830 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.010 

I've<00:07:27.920> got<00:07:28.130> the<00:07:28.280> right<00:07:28.460> idea<00:07:29.090> I<00:07:29.360> just<00:07:29.720> need<00:07:29.930> to

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.020 
I've got the right idea I just need to

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.750 
I've got the right idea I just need to
find<00:07:30.200> a<00:07:30.350> better<00:07:30.530> way<00:07:30.890> to<00:07:30.950> keep<00:07:31.310> the<00:07:31.460> shoes

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:31.760 
find a better way to keep the shoes

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.210 
find a better way to keep the shoes
wedged<00:07:32.150> out<00:07:32.450> so<00:07:33.320> that<00:07:33.530> I<00:07:33.560> can<00:07:33.950> get<00:07:34.100> my

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:34.220 
wedged out so that I can get my

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.730 
wedged out so that I can get my
measurement
