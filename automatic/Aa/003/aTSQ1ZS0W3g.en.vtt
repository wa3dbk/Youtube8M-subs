00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
to say they're free to your classic is

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.639 
to say they're free to your classic is
because<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.600> their<00:01:48.780> actually<00:01:49.470> their

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
because of their actually their

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.800 
because of their actually their

pull<00:04:15.419> the<00:04:15.479> case<00:04:15.659> back<00:04:15.870> off<00:04:15.989> or<00:04:16.169> anything<00:04:16.349> but

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
pull the case back off or anything but

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.370 
pull the case back off or anything but
out<00:04:17.280> but<00:04:17.430> if<00:04:17.519> you<00:04:17.609> look<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:17.940> up<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.359> one<00:04:19.199> one

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
out but if you look it up the one one

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.140 
out but if you look it up the one one
tool<00:04:19.560> movement<00:04:20.010> is<00:04:20.219> just<00:04:20.519> a<00:04:20.609> sharp<00:04:20.880> movement

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
tool movement is just a sharp movement

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.709 
tool movement is just a sharp movement
and<00:04:22.669> so<00:04:23.669> at<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:23.880> end<00:04:23.940> of<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.150> day<00:04:24.330> I<00:04:24.360> mean<00:04:24.570> this

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:24.719 
and so at the end of the day I mean this

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:25.879 
and so at the end of the day I mean this
watch<00:04:24.930> maybe

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
watch maybe

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.490 
watch maybe
yeah<00:04:26.340> it<00:04:26.550> isn't<00:04:26.729> a<00:04:26.940> submariner<00:04:27.660> it<00:04:28.080> doesn't

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
yeah it isn't a submariner it doesn't

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.469 
yeah it isn't a submariner it doesn't
have<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:29.720> incredible<00:04:31.970> level<00:04:32.970> of<00:04:33.240> fit<00:04:33.449> and

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
have the incredible level of fit and

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.969 
have the incredible level of fit and
finish<00:04:33.630> that<00:04:34.259> the<00:04:34.440> new<00:04:34.880> omegas<00:04:35.880> have<00:04:36.590> it<00:04:37.590> isn't

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
finish that the new omegas have it isn't

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:44.650 
finish that the new omegas have it isn't
a<00:04:40.039> horrible<00:04:41.039> masterpiece<00:04:42.919> as<00:04:43.919> far<00:04:44.160> as<00:04:44.340> the

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
a horrible masterpiece as far as the

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.520 
a horrible masterpiece as far as the
complications<00:04:45.660> or<00:04:45.840> anything<00:04:46.020> like<00:04:46.259> that<00:04:46.289> go

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
complications or anything like that go

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.950 
complications or anything like that go
but<00:04:46.680> it's<00:04:46.800> just<00:04:46.949> a<00:04:47.009> good<00:04:47.220> watch<00:04:47.490> and<00:04:47.960> and

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
but it's just a good watch and and

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.930 
but it's just a good watch and and
brings<00:04:49.919> to<00:04:50.009> the<00:04:50.099> table<00:04:50.250> a<00:04:50.430> lot<00:04:50.460> of<00:04:50.610> kind<00:04:50.910> of

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
brings to the table a lot of kind of

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.529 
brings to the table a lot of kind of
classic<00:04:51.449> omega<00:04:51.889> elements<00:04:53.150> it's<00:04:54.150> far<00:04:54.330> from

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
classic omega elements it's far from

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.210 
classic omega elements it's far from
perfect<00:04:54.750> I<00:04:55.080> agree<00:04:55.380> you<00:04:55.560> know<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:55.710> think<00:04:55.919> the

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
perfect I agree you know I think the

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.010 
perfect I agree you know I think the
helium<00:04:56.669> release<00:04:57.000> valve<00:04:57.300> up<00:04:57.479> here<00:04:57.750> is<00:04:57.870> this

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
helium release valve up here is this

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.400 
helium release valve up here is this
kind<00:04:58.199> of<00:04:58.320> overkill<00:04:58.889> I<00:04:59.849> also<00:05:00.690> think<00:05:01.110> that<00:05:01.169> the

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
kind of overkill I also think that the

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.469 
kind of overkill I also think that the
scalloped<00:05:02.009> bezel<00:05:02.400> is<00:05:02.610> I<00:05:03.440> even<00:05:04.440> though<00:05:04.590> I<00:05:04.970> the<00:05:05.970> I

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
scalloped bezel is I even though I the I

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.990 
scalloped bezel is I even though I the I
think<00:05:07.229> the<00:05:07.470> idea<00:05:07.800> was<00:05:08.070> to<00:05:08.310> kind<00:05:08.520> of<00:05:08.669> create<00:05:08.970> a

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
think the idea was to kind of create a

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.999 
think the idea was to kind of create a
wave<00:05:09.330> pattern<00:05:09.630> in<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.020> bezel<00:05:10.199> that<00:05:10.590> matches

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:11.009 
wave pattern in the bezel that matches

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.480 
wave pattern in the bezel that matches
the<00:05:11.160> dial<00:05:11.400> that's<00:05:11.699> my<00:05:12.419> conjecture<00:05:13.370> but<00:05:14.370> it

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
the dial that's my conjecture but it

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.860 
the dial that's my conjecture but it
isn't<00:05:14.820> super<00:05:14.970> functional<00:05:15.389> there<00:05:15.780> are

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
isn't super functional there are

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.870 
isn't super functional there are
definitely<00:05:16.500> better<00:05:16.830> designs<00:05:17.250> and<00:05:17.490> bezels<00:05:17.789> in

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
definitely better designs and bezels in

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.879 
definitely better designs and bezels in
the<00:05:17.970> new<00:05:18.090> plant<00:05:18.389> oceans<00:05:18.750> kind<00:05:19.500> of<00:05:19.560> toothy

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
the new plant oceans kind of toothy

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.629 
the new plant oceans kind of toothy
bezel<00:05:20.220> is<00:05:20.340> definitely<00:05:20.729> more<00:05:20.909> functional<00:05:22.639> but

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
bezel is definitely more functional but

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.629 
bezel is definitely more functional but
uh<00:05:23.669> but<00:05:24.800> the<00:05:25.800> other<00:05:25.860> thing<00:05:26.130> is<00:05:26.250> about<00:05:26.370> this

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
uh but the other thing is about this

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:27.740 
uh but the other thing is about this
watch<00:05:26.819> is<00:05:27.030> that<00:05:27.180> you<00:05:27.300> can<00:05:27.419> get<00:05:27.539> it<00:05:27.630> for

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
watch is that you can get it for

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.260 
watch is that you can get it for
relatively<00:05:28.110> cheap<00:05:28.229> now<00:05:28.620> I<00:05:29.159> would<00:05:29.759> say<00:05:29.970> around

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
relatively cheap now I would say around

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.020 
relatively cheap now I would say around
a<00:05:30.360> thousand<00:05:30.720> bucks<00:05:30.870> and<00:05:31.550> that<00:05:32.550> is<00:05:32.789> not

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
a thousand bucks and that is not

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.550 
a thousand bucks and that is not
something<00:05:33.389> you're<00:05:33.509> going<00:05:33.690> to<00:05:33.780> find<00:05:34.050> for<00:05:34.349> long

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
something you're going to find for long

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.140 
something you're going to find for long
with<00:05:34.830> these<00:05:34.949> a<00:05:35.009> mega<00:05:35.280> dive<00:05:35.430> watches<00:05:35.699> they<00:05:36.030> are

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
with these a mega dive watches they are

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.760 
with these a mega dive watches they are
trying<00:05:36.509> to<00:05:36.599> compete<00:05:36.900> with<00:05:36.960> Rolex

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
trying to compete with Rolex

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.589 
trying to compete with Rolex
they're<00:05:38.099> going<00:05:38.400> to<00:05:38.490> get<00:05:38.610> more<00:05:38.789> expensive<00:05:39.060> and

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
they're going to get more expensive and

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:45.499 
they're going to get more expensive and
so<00:05:40.409> the<00:05:41.070> days<00:05:41.370> of<00:05:41.729> a<00:05:42.150> cheap<00:05:43.280> nice<00:05:44.280> Omega<00:05:44.909> die

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
so the days of a cheap nice Omega die

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.990 
so the days of a cheap nice Omega die
watch<00:05:46.490> relatively<00:05:47.490> speaking<00:05:47.759> I<00:05:47.969> mean

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
watch relatively speaking I mean

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.649 
watch relatively speaking I mean
thousand<00:05:48.449> bucks<00:05:48.570> isn't<00:05:48.750> cheap<00:05:49.050> of<00:05:49.199> course<00:05:50.659> but

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
thousand bucks isn't cheap of course but

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:55.490 
thousand bucks isn't cheap of course but
anyway<00:05:52.289> those<00:05:52.440> days<00:05:52.740> are<00:05:52.949> numbered<00:05:53.130> and<00:05:53.550> so<00:05:54.500> 9i

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
anyway those days are numbered and so 9i

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.270 
anyway those days are numbered and so 9i
in<00:05:56.070> my<00:05:56.280> opinion<00:05:56.669> the<00:05:56.960> Bond<00:05:57.960> watch<00:05:58.199> will<00:05:58.500> become

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
in my opinion the Bond watch will become

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.730 
in my opinion the Bond watch will become
more<00:05:59.580> and<00:05:59.880> more<00:06:00.000> appreciated<00:06:00.990> as<00:06:01.169> time<00:06:01.530> goes

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
more and more appreciated as time goes

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.279 
more and more appreciated as time goes
on<00:06:01.889> because<00:06:02.130> it<00:06:02.699> is<00:06:02.729> unique<00:06:03.030> has<00:06:04.020> a<00:06:04.050> lot<00:06:04.259> of

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
on because it is unique has a lot of

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.589 
on because it is unique has a lot of
good<00:06:04.469> things<00:06:04.620> going<00:06:04.860> for<00:06:04.979> it<00:06:05.250> and<00:06:05.490> well<00:06:06.419> it

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
good things going for it and well it

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:08.629 
good things going for it and well it
might<00:06:06.750> not<00:06:06.780> be<00:06:06.900> the<00:06:07.680> cutting<00:06:07.979> edge<00:06:08.130> anymore

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
might not be the cutting edge anymore

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.300 
might not be the cutting edge anymore
and<00:06:09.570> it<00:06:09.659> might<00:06:09.840> be<00:06:09.990> plenty<00:06:10.530> second<00:06:10.860> fiddle<00:06:11.130> to

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
and it might be plenty second fiddle to

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.760 
and it might be plenty second fiddle to
the<00:06:11.340> the<00:06:12.120> extremely<00:06:12.870> excellent<00:06:13.110> planet<00:06:13.530> ocean

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
the the extremely excellent planet ocean

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.760 
the the extremely excellent planet ocean
I<00:06:13.830> hope<00:06:14.009> land<00:06:14.250> ocean<00:06:14.550> don't<00:06:14.729> get<00:06:14.820> me<00:06:14.940> wrong<00:06:15.770> but

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
I hope land ocean don't get me wrong but

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.670 
I hope land ocean don't get me wrong but
it's<00:06:17.490> still<00:06:18.030> got<00:06:18.270> a<00:06:18.509> lot<00:06:18.900> going<00:06:19.169> on<00:06:19.289> in<00:06:19.469> its<00:06:19.560> own

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
it's still got a lot going on in its own

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.639 
it's still got a lot going on in its own
right<00:06:19.860> there<00:06:20.370> you<00:06:20.490> go
