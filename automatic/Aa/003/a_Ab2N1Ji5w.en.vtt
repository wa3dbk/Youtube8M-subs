00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.930 
card sticks to the index finger what
they<00:04:13.500> don't<00:04:13.770> see<00:04:14.040> is<00:04:14.070> that<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.490> pinky<00:04:14.910> is

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
they don't see is that the pinky is

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.610 
they don't see is that the pinky is
touching<00:04:15.510> their<00:04:15.660> card<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.080> bringing<00:04:16.410> it<00:04:16.500> up

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
touching their card and bringing it up

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.729 
touching their card and bringing it up
with<00:04:17.520> that<00:04:18.239> finger<00:04:18.570> so<00:04:19.109> it's<00:04:19.260> a<00:04:19.320> very<00:04:19.620> easy

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
with that finger so it's a very easy

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.170 
with that finger so it's a very easy
effect<00:04:20.370> it'll<00:04:20.580> take<00:04:20.700> a<00:04:20.730> little<00:04:20.940> bit<00:04:21.060> of

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
effect it'll take a little bit of

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.670 
effect it'll take a little bit of
practice<00:04:21.390> just<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:21.900> get<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.169> angles<00:04:22.500> right

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
practice just to get the angles right

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.380 
practice just to get the angles right
but<00:04:23.310> again<00:04:23.550> it's<00:04:23.700> one<00:04:23.760> of<00:04:23.910> those<00:04:24.000> tricks<00:04:24.300> that

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
but again it's one of those tricks that

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.510 
but again it's one of those tricks that
you<00:04:24.600> can<00:04:24.780> do<00:04:24.960> probably<00:04:25.770> with<00:04:26.070> about<00:04:26.280> ten

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
you can do probably with about ten

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.030 
you can do probably with about ten
minutes

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
minutes

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.800 
minutes
this<00:04:27.250> in<00:04:27.340> front<00:04:27.580> of<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.700> mirror<00:04:27.940> so<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:28.420> rub

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
this in front of the mirror so you rub

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.170 
this in front of the mirror so you rub
you<00:04:29.410> rub<00:04:29.680> nothing<00:04:30.430> happens

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
rub rub nothing happens and this is what

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.260 
rub rub nothing happens and this is what
makes<00:04:34.900> it<00:04:35.170> this<00:04:35.950> nothing<00:04:36.340> happens<00:04:36.790> part<00:04:37.090> is

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
makes it this nothing happens part is

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.360
