first with clickable touch screen now

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.160 
first with clickable touch screen now
that's<00:00:35.610> very<00:00:35.820> hard<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.090> explain<00:00:36.420> unless<00:00:36.989> you

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
that's very hard to explain unless you

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.160 
that's very hard to explain unless you
feel<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.559> but<00:00:37.980> essentially<00:00:38.750> beneath<00:00:39.750> this

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
feel it but essentially beneath this

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.560 
feel it but essentially beneath this
display<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.980> flexible<00:00:41.940> dome<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.390> when<00:00:42.540> I

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
display is a flexible dome so when I

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.139 
display is a flexible dome so when I
actually<00:00:42.989> push<00:00:43.500> down<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.010> button<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.550> moves

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
actually push down on a button it moves

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.479 
actually push down on a button it moves
down<00:00:45.270> with<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.809> actually<00:00:45.960> feel<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.590> click<00:00:46.860> now

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
down with it I actually feel a click now

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.029 
down with it I actually feel a click now
this<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.059> very<00:00:48.300> satisfying<00:00:48.989> obviously<00:00:49.739> but

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
this is very satisfying obviously but

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.860 
this is very satisfying obviously but
also<00:00:50.070> pretty<00:00:50.640> handy<00:00:51.239> when<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.510> comes<00:00:51.719> to

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
also pretty handy when it comes to

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.619 
also pretty handy when it comes to
navigation<00:00:52.320> no<00:00:53.070> more<00:00:53.340> as<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:54.059> very<00:00:54.239> common

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
navigation no more as is very common

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.510 
navigation no more as is very common
