00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
getting into something so large when

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.530 
getting into something so large when
really<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.409> new<00:01:22.590> grill<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.340> new

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
really just a new grill and a new

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.929 
really just a new grill and a new
surface<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> area<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.070> had<00:01:26.250> would<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.610> okay

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
surface to the area we had would be okay

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.859

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
but in the long run it's going to be

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.480 
but in the long run it's going to be
worth<00:01:31.049> everything<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.250> went<00:01:32.369> through

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
