00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.299
 assure me that you have aligned yourself well and I 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.070
 leave out for the moment I have 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.770
 need a strap that makes a drop 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.780
 I spent on each side here the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.939
 middle segments I have to flip it 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.320
 the mythos for better placed with 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:25.110
 kiel others here is just hanging

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.140
 horse and I place it I make sure 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.609
 my ring and of course the simon top 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.439
 rings and on the side of sir of 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.030
 my horse is here I'm going to ruin the 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.100
 wood quickly so this 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.549
 importance assured that the ring is on 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.680
 the top 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.140
 here simply repeat the operation 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.670
 our needs a horse love and I 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.350
 go with the upsetting I make 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.570
 in the ring in horse and so on 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.179
 in the ring until I have a 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.090
 tension henri ii take turns so I 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.740
 I was careful to do this I can 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.390
 put on foot like that on the sambre 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.130
 like that I can use my hands to 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.250
 come in between my luck in my click 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.719
 we will go between the two defenders 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.440
 get inside the little crack 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:09.849
 here and we're going to shoot the whole 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.200
 sambre until we have a tension 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.060
 click some times are coming 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.010
 with a strap that is already installed 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.900
 like that which is made to be used 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.120
 with trees when if I replaced 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.380
 this apart a little strap look 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.170
 blood like that there are several options 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.599
 this one is very economical 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:30.610
 the important thing here to align but two 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.300
 straps side by side on my 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.299
 piece of metal 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.920
 if they are the 2 1 a over the other 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.860
 montcuq and valentin sleeve go a 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.880
 little bit of the verse to avoid that 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.560
 I pull in a direction with a hand in 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.239
 the other way with the other hand for 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:52.329
 that there is a tension here 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:53.380
 I could start before serris Mali 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.569
 put too much tension I come 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.790
 check my horse's tongue is so 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.780
 no need to adjust it give us a 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.450
 certain angle for kaka 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.940
 he stands up when we're done but the 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.560
 tension we want to finish with an easel 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.290
 who right to need it must be adjusted 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.200
 both sides when I finished I do 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.750
 just pull the trigger on the click and 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.030
 to come and support him completely and 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.190
 close the trigger to lock my 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.620
 click and that's how it is 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.840
 installs a slackline with piles and 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.799
 the easels when we need 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.799
 to settle without trees 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.840
 to undo the mechanism you will have 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.630
 finished we just pulled the trigger 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.590
 with the push again we admit 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.660
 fully depressed 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.240
 here we come to the end some 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.980
 tension this pole jump it's going to make a 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.390
 noise the easel will fall to the ground 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.390
 like what we remove the tension
