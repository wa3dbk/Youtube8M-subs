 which help us chew food

 for a good digestion the tooth 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.269
 performed the first stage of digestion 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.509
 and also participates in communication

 what if 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.350
 within the diseases that attack in 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.600
 the teeth is the decay affects 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.540
 any age and it happens when the acid

 time they destroy the enamel and produce 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.530
 the charges 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.110
 with age the gum retracts 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.990
 exposing the roots to the application of 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.450
