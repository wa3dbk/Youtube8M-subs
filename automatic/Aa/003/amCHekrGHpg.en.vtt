00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
in its way now before I get to the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.810 
in its way now before I get to the
actual<00:02:27.410> figure<00:02:27.800> that<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.040> course<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:28.670> could

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
actual figure that of course you could

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.330 
actual figure that of course you could
see<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.060> here<00:02:29.300> but<00:02:29.750> one<00:02:30.350> thing<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:31.070> of<00:02:31.160> course

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
see it here but one thing that of course

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.040 
see it here but one thing that of course
you<00:02:31.520> have<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.790> keep<00:02:31.940> in<00:02:32.120> mind<00:02:32.300> is<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.600> fact<00:02:32.810> of

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
you have to keep in mind is the fact of

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.920 
you have to keep in mind is the fact of
scale<00:02:33.410> yes<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.580> series<00:02:35.210> does<00:02:35.420> have<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.630> problem

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
scale yes the series does have a problem

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.870 
scale yes the series does have a problem
of<00:02:36.320> scale<00:02:36.650> because<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.190> mean<00:02:37.400> if<00:02:37.490> you<00:02:37.580> look<00:02:37.730> at

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
of scale because I mean if you look at

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.820 
of scale because I mean if you look at
Baxter<00:02:38.390> Stockman<00:02:38.840> here<00:02:39.050> I<00:02:39.200> don't<00:02:39.410> have<00:02:39.590> the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
Baxter Stockman here I don't have the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.320 
Baxter Stockman here I don't have the
turtles<00:02:40.220> actually<00:02:40.400> near<00:02:40.790> me<00:02:40.970> because<00:02:41.090> they're

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
turtles actually near me because they're

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.710

get them out they'll be here but as you
can<00:02:49.640> see<00:02:49.760> here<00:02:49.910> shredder<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:50.630> I<00:02:50.840> always<00:02:50.930> see

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
can see here shredder and I always see

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.050 
can see here shredder and I always see
the<00:02:51.290> show<00:02:51.500> this<00:02:51.890> suit<00:02:52.400> they're<00:02:52.580> supposed<00:02:52.970> to

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
the show this suit they're supposed to

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.390 
the show this suit they're supposed to
be<00:02:53.210> like<00:02:53.390> somewhere<00:02:53.930> way<00:02:54.380> way<00:02:54.650> way<00:02:54.860> up<00:02:55.040> there

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
be like somewhere way way way up there

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.530 
be like somewhere way way way up there
and<00:02:56.680> that's<00:02:57.680> not<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:58.190> case<00:02:58.430> here<00:02:58.790> which<00:02:59.360> is

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
and that's not the case here which is

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.730 
and that's not the case here which is
why<00:02:59.870> in<00:03:00.800> order<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:02.030> kind<00:03:02.450> of<00:03:02.660> fairly<00:03:03.650> evaluate

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
why in order to kind of fairly evaluate

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.230 
why in order to kind of fairly evaluate
the<00:03:04.130> figure<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:04.430> got<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.640> keep<00:03:04.730> in<00:03:04.880> mind<00:03:05.060> that

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
the figure you got to keep in mind that

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.960 
the figure you got to keep in mind that
yes<00:03:05.660> it's<00:03:05.900> at<00:03:06.020> a<00:03:06.050> scale<00:03:06.410> but<00:03:07.040> as<00:03:07.340> far<00:03:07.760> as<00:03:07.790> the

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
yes it's at a scale but as far as the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.240 
yes it's at a scale but as far as the
armor<00:03:08.420> goes<00:03:08.630> they<00:03:09.110> did<00:03:09.320> do<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.500> pretty<00:03:10.010> gosh

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
course painting this which would have

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.240 
course painting this which would have
been<00:03:17.840> way<00:03:18.020> more<00:03:18.260> expensive<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:18.800> coat<00:03:19.040> the

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
been way more expensive to coat the

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
whole thing in silver paint but instead

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.750 
whole thing in silver paint but instead
they<00:03:21.650> chose<00:03:21.680> this<00:03:22.010> really<00:03:22.310> nice<00:03:22.430> kind<00:03:22.640> of

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
they chose this really nice kind of

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.240 
they chose this really nice kind of
gunmetal<00:03:23.180> gray<00:03:23.600> which<00:03:24.350> works<00:03:24.620> really<00:03:25.130> really

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
gunmetal gray which works really really

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.840 
gunmetal gray which works really really

like<00:03:33.110> feel<00:03:33.830> which<00:03:34.100> is<00:03:34.250> really<00:03:34.670> really<00:03:34.820> cool<00:03:34.970> I

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
like feel which is really really cool I

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.510 
like feel which is really really cool I
also<00:03:35.750> like<00:03:36.020> the<00:03:36.230> choice<00:03:36.560> of<00:03:36.860> red<00:03:37.190> that<00:03:37.400> they

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
also like the choice of red that they

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.340 
also like the choice of red that they
went<00:03:37.730> with<00:03:37.820> a<00:03:37.970> bit<00:03:38.480> of<00:03:38.510> a<00:03:38.600> different<00:03:38.900> red<00:03:39.110> this

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
went with a bit of a different red this

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.190 
went with a bit of a different red this
isn't<00:03:39.620> not<00:03:40.280> painted<00:03:40.820> but<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.690> could<00:03:41.870> see<00:03:42.020> kind

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
isn't not painted but you could see kind

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.510 
isn't not painted but you could see kind
of<00:03:42.290> like<00:03:42.350> all<00:03:42.590> four<00:03:42.860> these<00:03:42.950> like<00:03:43.190> tread

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
of like all four these like tread

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.250 
of like all four these like tread
fingers<00:03:43.940> would<00:03:44.180> have<00:03:44.270> been<00:03:44.360> fantastic<00:03:44.870> if

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
fingers would have been fantastic if

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.140 
fingers would have been fantastic if
they<00:03:45.380> could<00:03:45.620> have<00:03:45.740> somewhat<00:03:46.310> articulated

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
they could have somewhat articulated

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.610 
they could have somewhat articulated
these<00:03:47.270> but<00:03:47.870> obviously<00:03:48.290> that<00:03:48.440> would<00:03:48.530> have

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
these but obviously that would have

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.620 
these but obviously that would have
added<00:03:48.860> to<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.340> price<00:03:49.580> I'm<00:03:49.970> really<00:03:50.330> hoping

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
added to the price I'm really hoping

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.320 
added to the price I'm really hoping
that<00:03:50.810> if<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.350> Ninja<00:03:51.860> Turtle<00:03:52.160> line<00:03:52.340> continues

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
that if the Ninja Turtle line continues

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.630 
that if the Ninja Turtle line continues
to<00:03:53.450> be<00:03:53.540> successful<00:03:53.720> maybe<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.890> one<00:03:55.190> at<00:03:55.430> one

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
to be successful maybe the one at one

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.000 
to be successful maybe the one at one

Stockman<00:03:58.520> figure<00:03:58.820> maybe<00:03:59.209> for<00:03:59.450> $30<00:04:00.080> or<00:04:00.290> so<00:04:00.500> that

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
Stockman figure maybe for $30 or so that

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.770 
Stockman figure maybe for $30 or so that
would<00:04:01.100> be<00:04:01.220> like<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.490> know<00:04:01.520> like<00:04:01.850> a<00:04:01.880> big<00:04:02.180> big

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
would be like you know like a big big

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.930 
would be like you know like a big big
figure<00:04:03.260> maybe<00:04:03.740> with<00:04:03.950> even<00:04:04.190> like<00:04:04.340> a<00:04:04.370> removable

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
figure maybe with even like a removable

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.850 
figure maybe with even like a removable
Baxter<00:04:05.480> Stockman<00:04:05.990> I<00:04:06.080> think<00:04:06.260> that<00:04:06.530> would<00:04:06.709> be<00:04:06.830> a

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
Baxter Stockman I think that would be a

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.100 
Baxter Stockman I think that would be a
really<00:04:07.310> neat<00:04:07.459> idea<00:04:07.640> if<00:04:08.030> they<00:04:08.450> would<00:04:08.600> ever<00:04:08.810> ever

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
really neat idea if they would ever ever

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.420 
really neat idea if they would ever ever
consider<00:04:09.620> that<00:04:09.770> that<00:04:09.830> would<00:04:10.100> be<00:04:10.220> certainly

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
consider that that would be certainly

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.310 
consider that that would be certainly
cool<00:04:10.760> I<00:04:11.060> love<00:04:11.480> a<00:04:11.540> lot<00:04:11.750> of<00:04:11.840> these<00:04:11.959> school<00:04:12.170> to

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
cool I love a lot of these school to

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.750 
cool I love a lot of these school to
detail<00:04:12.680> as<00:04:12.830> you<00:04:12.920> can<00:04:13.100> see<00:04:13.220> right<00:04:13.340> here<00:04:13.430> with

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
detail as you can see right here with

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.160 
detail as you can see right here with
all<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.030> lines<00:04:14.330> and<00:04:14.540> everything<00:04:14.840> so<00:04:14.959> if<00:04:15.050> you

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
all the lines and everything so if you

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.080 
all the lines and everything so if you
have<00:04:15.410> like<00:04:15.590> our<00:04:15.770> sharpie<00:04:16.640> or<00:04:16.669> something<00:04:17.030> like

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
have like our sharpie or something like

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.610 
have like our sharpie or something like
that<00:04:17.150> you<00:04:17.359> could<00:04:17.480> fill<00:04:17.750> those<00:04:17.930> in<00:04:17.989> with<00:04:18.440> some

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
that you could fill those in with some

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.110 
that you could fill those in with some
paint<00:04:18.890> and<00:04:19.040> that<00:04:19.220> would<00:04:19.370> obviously<00:04:19.489> bring<00:04:19.940> the

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
paint and that would obviously bring the

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.960 
paint and that would obviously bring the
figure<00:04:20.960> to<00:04:21.140> life<00:04:21.290> even<00:04:21.620> more<00:04:22.250> so<00:04:22.490> but<00:04:22.640> the<00:04:22.760> one

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
figure to life even more so but the one

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:23.740 
figure to life even more so but the one
thing<00:04:23.180> that<00:04:23.330> I<00:04:23.360> was

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
thing that I was

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.440 
thing that I was
super<00:04:24.110> uber<00:04:24.350> uber<00:04:24.740> and<00:04:25.250> pressed<00:04:25.580> by<00:04:25.820> that's

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
super uber uber and pressed by that's

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.870 
super uber uber and pressed by that's
not<00:04:26.570> even<00:04:26.750> a<00:04:26.810> word<00:04:26.840> but<00:04:27.620> it's<00:04:28.280> still<00:04:28.490> indeed<00:04:28.850> I

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
not even a word but it's still indeed I

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.090 
not even a word but it's still indeed I
was<00:04:29.120> impressed<00:04:29.450> by<00:04:29.690> was<00:04:30.260> the<00:04:30.410> articulation

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
was impressed by was the articulation

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.010 
was impressed by was the articulation
this<00:04:31.250> is<00:04:31.340> a<00:04:31.370> really<00:04:31.880> well<00:04:32.030> articulated<00:04:32.690> figure

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
this is a really well articulated figure

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.840 
this is a really well articulated figure
especially<00:04:33.260> for<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.800> Ninja<00:04:34.070> Turtles<00:04:34.100> line<00:04:34.610> I

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
especially for the Ninja Turtles line I

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.550 
especially for the Ninja Turtles line I
mean<00:04:35.240> we've<00:04:35.480> got<00:04:35.630> a<00:04:35.690> lot<00:04:35.780> of<00:04:36.140> maneuverability

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
mean we've got a lot of maneuverability

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.370 
mean we've got a lot of maneuverability
in<00:04:36.920> the<00:04:37.040> shoulders<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:37.490> can<00:04:37.640> see<00:04:37.970> nice<00:04:38.840> elbow

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
in the shoulders you can see nice elbow

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.830 
in the shoulders you can see nice elbow
joint<00:04:39.650> which<00:04:39.890> is<00:04:39.920> kind<00:04:40.340> of<00:04:40.370> a<00:04:40.520> rare<00:04:40.940> sight<00:04:41.630> at

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
joint which is kind of a rare sight at

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.050 
joint which is kind of a rare sight at
this<00:04:42.020> point<00:04:42.260> so<00:04:42.500> that's<00:04:42.710> really<00:04:43.040> cool<00:04:43.310> I<00:04:43.610> like

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
this point so that's really cool I like

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.540 
this point so that's really cool I like
that<00:04:44.090> I<00:04:44.600> really<00:04:45.320> love<00:04:45.530> this<00:04:45.680> hip<00:04:46.190> joint<00:04:46.460> I

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
that I really love this hip joint I

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.310 
that I really love this hip joint I
don't<00:04:46.730> know<00:04:46.790> it<00:04:46.910> really<00:04:46.940> really<00:04:47.660> works<00:04:47.930> well

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
don't know it really really works well

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.860 
don't know it really really works well
the<00:04:49.160> joint<00:04:49.430> here<00:04:49.610> really<00:04:50.180> does<00:04:50.330> help<00:04:50.510> quite<00:04:50.840> a

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
the joint here really does help quite a

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.150 
the joint here really does help quite a
bit<00:04:50.960> but<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.380> thing<00:04:51.530> that<00:04:51.560> I<00:04:51.740> love<00:04:51.980> the<00:04:52.130> most

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
bit but the thing that I love the most

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.880 
bit but the thing that I love the most
is<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.880> leg<00:04:53.750> articulation<00:04:54.350> so<00:04:54.470> first<00:04:54.650> of<00:04:54.770> all

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
is the leg articulation so first of all

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.159 
is the leg articulation so first of all
you<00:04:55.310> get<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.490> bend<00:04:55.910> at<00:04:56.180> the<00:04:56.210> knee<00:04:56.540> but<00:04:57.020> then

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
you get the bend at the knee but then

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.380 
you get the bend at the knee but then
you<00:04:57.290> also<00:04:57.530> get<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:57.919> ball<00:04:58.220> joint<00:04:58.610> and<00:04:58.760> hip<00:04:59.000> which

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
you also get a ball joint and hip which

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.140 
you also get a ball joint and hip which
really<00:04:59.960> allows<00:05:00.200> for<00:05:00.560> a<00:05:00.590> nice<00:05:00.980> pose<00:05:01.280> ability<00:05:01.760> so

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
really allows for a nice pose ability so

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.510 
really allows for a nice pose ability so
that's<00:05:02.330> just<00:05:02.660> fantastic<00:05:03.590> and<00:05:03.680> I<00:05:04.160> mean<00:05:04.400> it

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
that's just fantastic and I mean it

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.800 
that's just fantastic and I mean it
really<00:05:04.790> does<00:05:04.940> allow<00:05:05.060> you<00:05:05.210> to<00:05:05.330> put<00:05:05.570> them<00:05:05.660> in

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
really does allow you to put them in

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
did a great job on the figure itself I

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.900 
did a great job on the figure itself I
mean<00:05:26.419> yours<00:05:27.050> shredder<00:05:27.440> he's<00:05:28.070> still<00:05:28.550> a<00:05:28.580> pretty

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
mean yours shredder he's still a pretty

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.060 
mean yours shredder he's still a pretty
bulky<00:05:29.300> figure<00:05:29.630> which<00:05:29.960> is<00:05:30.110> really<00:05:30.590> nice<00:05:30.740> so<00:05:30.800> you

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
bulky figure which is really nice so you

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.950 
bulky figure which is really nice so you
do<00:05:31.220> feel<00:05:31.250> like<00:05:31.940> he's<00:05:32.150> a<00:05:32.180> little<00:05:32.570> bit<00:05:32.780> of<00:05:32.870> a

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
do feel like he's a little bit of a

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.670 
do feel like he's a little bit of a
larger<00:05:33.490> presence<00:05:34.490> then<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:36.110> turtles<00:05:36.560> are

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
larger presence then the turtles are

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.650 
larger presence then the turtles are
which<00:05:36.950> is<00:05:37.100> really<00:05:37.460> nice<00:05:37.610> because<00:05:38.090> it

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
which is really nice because it

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.270 
which is really nice because it
obviously<00:05:38.840> kind<00:05:39.380> of<00:05:39.440> allows<00:05:39.680> them<00:05:39.890> to<00:05:40.010> still

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
obviously kind of allows them to still

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.700 
obviously kind of allows them to still
stand<00:05:40.520> out<00:05:40.790> now<00:05:41.390> the<00:05:42.050> one<00:05:42.229> thing<00:05:42.380> that<00:05:42.560> you're

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
stand out now the one thing that you're

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.650 
stand out now the one thing that you're
gonna<00:05:42.830> have<00:05:42.979> to<00:05:43.160> do<00:05:43.340> when<00:05:43.580> you<00:05:43.760> get<00:05:44.270> the<00:05:44.390> figure

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
gonna have to do when you get the figure

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.659 
gonna have to do when you get the figure
is<00:05:44.780> that<00:05:44.810> this<00:05:45.229> part<00:05:45.590> is<00:05:45.770> actually<00:05:45.919> I<00:05:46.340> was

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
is that this part is actually I was

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.159 
is that this part is actually I was
trying<00:05:46.910> to<00:05:46.940> get<00:05:47.060> it<00:05:47.180> off<00:05:47.300> carefully<00:05:47.540> but<00:05:47.930> I

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
trying to get it off carefully but I

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.050 
trying to get it off carefully but I
don't<00:05:48.560> want<00:05:48.680> to<00:05:48.770> break<00:05:48.950> this<00:05:49.130> is<00:05:49.310> that<00:05:49.850> the

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
don't want to break this is that the

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.840 
don't want to break this is that the
feet<00:05:50.450> don't<00:05:50.840> come<00:05:51.110> along<00:05:51.380> attached<00:05:52.310> in<00:05:52.700> the

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
feet don't come along attached in the

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.580 
feet don't come along attached in the
package<00:05:53.240> so<00:05:53.419> you<00:05:53.510> just<00:05:53.690> have<00:05:53.840> to<00:05:53.870> Clank<00:05:54.350> those

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
package so you just have to Clank those

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.890 
package so you just have to Clank those
in<00:05:54.800> and<00:05:55.100> once<00:05:55.640> you<00:05:55.760> do<00:05:55.910> so<00:05:56.090> then<00:05:56.540> you've<00:05:56.720> got<00:05:56.870> a

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
in and once you do so then you've got a

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.620 
in and once you do so then you've got a
completed<00:05:57.350> figure<00:05:58.180> other<00:05:59.180> than<00:05:59.450> a<00:05:59.570> few

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
completed figure other than a few

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.600 
completed figure other than a few
doesn't<00:06:00.050> come<00:06:00.169> with<00:06:00.290> any<00:06:00.350> accessories<00:06:00.979> which

yeah<00:06:43.060> we'll<00:06:43.330> be<00:06:43.360> a<00:06:43.449> nine<00:06:43.780> out<00:06:43.960> of<00:06:44.020> ten<00:06:44.199> because

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
yeah we'll be a nine out of ten because

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.030 
yeah we'll be a nine out of ten because
honestly<00:06:45.970> he<00:06:46.300> surpassed<00:06:46.810> my<00:06:47.050> expectations<00:06:47.410> of

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
honestly he surpassed my expectations of

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.340 
honestly he surpassed my expectations of
what<00:06:48.280> he<00:06:48.490> will<00:06:48.699> be<00:06:48.940> like<00:06:49.180> and<00:06:49.419> he's<00:06:49.990> a<00:06:50.020> nine

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.350 
what he will be like and he's a nine

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.310 
what he will be like and he's a nine
really<00:06:50.740> just<00:06:51.100> because<00:06:51.400> he's<00:06:51.580> within<00:06:51.850> this<00:06:52.330> toy

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.320 
really just because he's within this toy

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.370 
really just because he's within this toy
line<00:06:53.620> and<00:06:54.240> this<00:06:55.240> particular<00:06:55.720> line<00:06:56.020> of<00:06:56.050> toys

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
line and this particular line of toys

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.110 
line and this particular line of toys
does<00:06:56.770> not<00:06:56.919> particularly<00:06:57.520> stand<00:06:57.790> out<00:06:57.940> for

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
does not particularly stand out for

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.000 
does not particularly stand out for
articulation<00:06:58.540> so<00:06:59.050> I<00:06:59.080> was<00:06:59.229> super<00:06:59.500> impressed<00:06:59.590> by

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010 
articulation so I was super impressed by

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.770 
articulation so I was super impressed by
the<00:07:00.070> amount<00:07:00.460> of<00:07:00.580> articulation<00:07:01.120> that<00:07:01.510> he<00:07:01.660> was

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780 
the amount of articulation that he was

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.300 
the amount of articulation that he was
given<00:07:02.050> and<00:07:02.169> more<00:07:02.380> importantly<00:07:02.830> the

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.310 
given and more importantly the

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.129 
given and more importantly the
articulation<00:07:03.910> that<00:07:04.060> was<00:07:04.180> actually<00:07:04.690> useful

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:05.139 
articulation that was actually useful

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:06.719 
articulation that was actually useful
because<00:07:05.350> a<00:07:05.440> lot<00:07:05.620> of<00:07:05.650> times<00:07:05.919> toys<00:07:06.490> get

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:06.729 
because a lot of times toys get

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:09.360 
because a lot of times toys get
articulation<00:07:07.479> that<00:07:07.660> is<00:07:07.810> kind<00:07:08.110> of<00:07:08.229> like<00:07:08.410> wow<00:07:08.830> we

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.370 
articulation that is kind of like wow we

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.650 
articulation that is kind of like wow we
don't<00:07:09.550> need<00:07:09.700> that<00:07:09.880> that<00:07:10.120> doesn't<00:07:10.360> accomplish

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:10.660 
don't need that that doesn't accomplish

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.659 
don't need that that doesn't accomplish
anything<00:07:10.950> just<00:07:11.950> like<00:07:12.010> a<00:07:12.070> little<00:07:12.220> leather<00:07:12.430> had

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:12.669 
anything just like a little leather had

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:14.460 
anything just like a little leather had
a<00:07:12.700> figure<00:07:13.000> that<00:07:13.030> I<00:07:13.240> had<00:07:13.450> where<00:07:13.990> songs

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:14.470 
a figure that I had where songs

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.230 
a figure that I had where songs
articulation<00:07:15.160> kind<00:07:15.430> of<00:07:15.550> doesn't<00:07:15.820> make<00:07:15.910> a<00:07:15.970> lot

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 
articulation kind of doesn't make a lot

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.969 
articulation kind of doesn't make a lot
of<00:07:16.300> sense<00:07:16.690> and<00:07:17.080> you're<00:07:17.500> just<00:07:17.770> kind<00:07:17.950> of

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:17.979 
of sense and you're just kind of

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:19.200 
of sense and you're just kind of
scratching<00:07:18.400> your<00:07:18.490> head<00:07:18.610> and<00:07:18.639> thinking<00:07:19.000> well

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
scratching your head and thinking well

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.909 
scratching your head and thinking well
why<00:07:19.419> didn't<00:07:19.660> you<00:07:19.720> instead<00:07:20.169> articulate<00:07:20.740> this

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:20.919 
why didn't you instead articulate this

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:24.180 
why didn't you instead articulate this
point<00:07:21.310> versus<00:07:21.820> this<00:07:22.060> so<00:07:22.840> in<00:07:23.200> my<00:07:23.470> mind<00:07:23.800> all<00:07:24.130> of

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.190 
point versus this so in my mind all of

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.370 
point versus this so in my mind all of
his<00:07:24.610> articulation<00:07:24.880> is<00:07:25.300> really<00:07:25.810> well<00:07:25.960> done

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:26.380 
his articulation is really well done

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.960 
his articulation is really well done
I<00:07:26.410> love<00:07:26.950> that<00:07:27.130> it's<00:07:27.310> called<00:07:27.520> the<00:07:27.610> kind<00:07:27.940> of

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:27.970 
I love that it's called the kind of

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.820 
I love that it's called the kind of
unimpressed<00:07:28.510> face<00:07:28.780> that<00:07:28.990> he's<00:07:29.200> got<00:07:29.470> going<00:07:29.740> on

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:29.830 
unimpressed face that he's got going on

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.400 
unimpressed face that he's got going on
there<00:07:30.100> and<00:07:30.280> it<00:07:30.910> is<00:07:31.060> an<00:07:31.210> accurate<00:07:31.600> suit<00:07:32.020> to<00:07:32.380> the

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:32.410 
there and it is an accurate suit to the

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.920 
there and it is an accurate suit to the
series<00:07:33.280> and<00:07:33.460> overall<00:07:34.060> I<00:07:34.270> really<00:07:34.690> really

series and overall I really really
really<00:07:35.080> love<00:07:35.380> this<00:07:35.560> figure<00:07:35.919> indeed<00:07:36.400> so<00:07:36.850> that

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:36.970
