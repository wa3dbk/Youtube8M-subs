00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.139
 hello to all and all these words 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.049
 rigor and so today we get 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.580
 find for a glitch on destiny so 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.310
 a glitch that will actually allow you 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.359
 of lighthouses but in an infinite way and 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.330
 especially that will allow you to 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.420
 recover a lot a lot in rare g 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.519
 or legendary and so weapons too 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.439
 since the drop of dan graham at this 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.449
 place is higher and that in addition to 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.250
 enemies reappear infinitely 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.630
 work you can kill them very 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.820
 quickly especially if you are two or 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.770
 three so that's the one we'll start 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.360
 by the way to go of course so 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.989
 it's at the cosmodrome that you leave in 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.809
 free mode and you actually go through the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.730
 lunar complex so you cross 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.530
 the whole building and you arrive 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.219
 directly on the area that we 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.770
 interested which is a place where there is a 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.690
 vessel of fallen planted in the ground at 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.820
 you will see it well and so you 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.410
 have a little cavern next door so at 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.049
 first you have to clean the first time 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.000
 area in fact and then the enemies your 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.220
 response is caves important things 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.680
 they will not respawn if you are more 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.330
 too close to the cave do you 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.010
 pay attention to words what I advise 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.549
 this week actually on the species of 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.600
 rocks promontory that we have not far 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.770
 it's the right distance so I 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.380
 advise to put yourself there like that 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.619
 you're sure it's good I advise 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.259
 also to do it at 2 or even 3 2 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.479
 minimum to clean very quickly the 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.430
 waves and 3 because I had 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.740
 the impression that the drop of a gram 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.579
 rare were more important to three 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.650
 but I could be wrong 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.530
 finally rare legendary you know this the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.149
 blue the green 300 in europe is enough 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.009
 easily also for those slips 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.350
 I advise you to use the rifle 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.780
 scouts can like that you go 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.090
 to do almost a ball to death so 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.180
 you have what to do to chain 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.649
 the frags since after obviously it goes 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.060
 have to go get some ammo 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.170
 do not worry about ammo 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.990
 and you 're going to drop thousands in 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.910
 doing that and so then you 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.319
 you can recover all your g 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.340
 went 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.439
 see your park cry at the tower that is going 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.689
 you decrypt all that so also 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:21.049
 positive point with this glitch finally 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:22.760
 glitch in quotation marks is that you 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.450
 will increase the level of your 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.599
 crypt arch 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.609
 so that's good worse is also 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.159
 your experience but hey that depends 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.540
 what level are you obviously if you 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.280
 are not bad there I'm doing them at the level 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.659
 24 it did not give me anything or your experiences 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.719
 but it improves the experience of 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.609
 my weapons but that's it's always 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:44.469
 pleasure 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:47.900
 and then also bah have disarmed 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:49.969
 interesting armor elements so 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.859
 this glitch Thursday in quotation marks glitch 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:52.989
 because finally we do not work the 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.639
 game huh 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.930
 the church normally we spend a little 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.609
 besides the rules 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.230
 here it is simply 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.659
 we put ourselves in the right place at the right place 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.939
 trigger for the spawn to be done 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.560
 to infinity so it's just the game 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.840
 which is done like that and we do not cheat 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.629
 really good but I think it'll be 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.620
 set by bungie I do not know but 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.900
 it's true that it's something that has 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.299
 circulated on the canvas myself I have 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.519
 discovered like that in fact and suddenly I 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.319
 went to see on the internet how 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.479
 did that and that's why I'm doing 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.220
 this video in french it's true he 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.569
 there is not much content in French 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.489
 on destiny there are some who earned him 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.409
 Moreover, at least 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.650
 tutos of things that hold the road 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.419
 and here and so I hope that you 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.650
 will help a little bit and then I 'll bah you 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:39.040
 found quickly on the channel for 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.040
 other videos
