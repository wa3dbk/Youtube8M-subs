I did figure out the audio channel stuff
it<00:01:19.950> basically<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:21.060> an<00:01:21.270> expletive<00:01:21.780> right<00:01:22.080> now

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
it basically is an expletive right now

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.060 
it basically is an expletive right now
xsplit<00:01:22.650> isn't<00:01:22.890> set<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.600> enable<00:01:25.070> multiple

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
xsplit isn't set up to enable multiple

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.609 
xsplit isn't set up to enable multiple
or<00:01:26.490> single<00:01:26.820> audio<00:01:26.970> channels<00:01:27.450> into<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:28.080> go<00:01:28.470> from

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
or single audio channels into to go from

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.160 
or single audio channels into to go from
single<00:01:28.979> de<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.729> duel<00:01:30.180> basically<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
single de to duel basically that is the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.530 
single de to duel basically that is the
problem<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:32.130> it's<00:01:32.520> an<00:01:32.640> expedition<00:01:33.210> currently

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
problem so it's an expedition currently

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.940 
problem so it's an expedition currently
that<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.079> software<00:01:34.290> isn't<00:01:34.619> quite<00:01:34.799> been

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
that the software isn't quite been

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.399 
that the software isn't quite been
developed<00:01:35.310> enough<00:01:35.520> enough<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.840> basically<00:01:37.320> if

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
developed enough enough so basically if

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.510 
developed enough enough so basically if
you<00:01:37.500> use<00:01:37.590> professional<00:01:37.920> over<00:01:38.220> microphone

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
you use professional over microphone

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.690 
you use professional over microphone
either<00:01:38.880> need<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.119> get<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> splitter<00:01:39.689> or<00:01:40.700> wait

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
either need to get a splitter or wait

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.889 
either need to get a splitter or wait
for<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.939> software<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.360> fix<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.630> i<00:01:42.689> think<00:01:42.840> i

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
for the software to fix so i think i

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:43.999 
for the software to fix so i think i
might<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.079> wait<00:01:43.320> for<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.500> software<00:01:43.799> defects

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
might just wait for the software defects

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.160 
might just wait for the software defects
that's<00:01:44.280> what<00:01:44.399> I'm<00:01:44.490> cutting<00:01:44.790> aiming<00:01:44.939> for<00:01:45.170> other

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
that's what I'm cutting aiming for other

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.389 
that's what I'm cutting aiming for other
than<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.560> I'm<00:01:46.680> still<00:01:46.829> working<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> guide

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
than that I'm still working on the guide

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.039 
than that I'm still working on the guide
stuff<00:01:47.640> very<00:01:47.790> slowly<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.479> occasionally<00:01:48.990> I

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
stuff very slowly like occasionally I

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.200 
stuff very slowly like occasionally I
work<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.560> every<00:01:49.680> couple<00:01:50.549> days<00:01:50.790> I'm<00:01:51.030> kind<00:01:51.180> of

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
work on it every couple days I'm kind of

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.609 
work on it every couple days I'm kind of
getting<00:01:51.329> lazy<00:01:51.570> about<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.020> which<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.140> problem

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
getting lazy about it which the problem

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.469 
getting lazy about it which the problem
but<00:01:52.740> at<00:01:53.640> some<00:01:53.790> point<00:01:53.820> if<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.149> expect<00:01:54.450> to

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
but at some point if you expect to

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.789 
but at some point if you expect to
finish<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.780> have<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> friend<00:01:55.140> who<00:01:55.229> has<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.409> really

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
finish I have a friend who has a really

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.170 
finish I have a friend who has a really
nice<00:01:55.920> camera<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.520> might<00:01:56.700> wait<00:01:56.850> till<00:01:57.030> he<00:01:57.149> comes

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
nice camera so might wait till he comes

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.910 
nice camera so might wait till he comes
over<00:01:57.479> before<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:58.229> record<00:01:58.380> because<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.799> can

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
over before we record because this can

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.069 
over before we record because this can
be<00:01:59.040> like<00:01:59.219> at<00:02:00.030> least<00:02:00.090> sixty<00:02:00.719> percent<00:02:00.810> me

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
be like at least sixty percent me

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.420 
be like at least sixty percent me
talking<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.619> that's<00:02:01.799> kind<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.100> lot<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.250> work

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
subscription boxes don't work that's the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.040 
subscription boxes don't work that's the
best<00:02:29.950> way<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.190> keep<00:02:30.520> track<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.900> where<00:02:31.900> this

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
best way to keep track of where this

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.270 
best way to keep track of where this
stuff<00:02:32.260> is<00:02:32.410> that<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:32.890> I<00:02:33.070> think<00:02:33.430> that's<00:02:33.580> about<00:02:33.730> it

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
stuff is that so I think that's about it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.830 
stuff is that so I think that's about it
yes<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.490> think<00:02:36.640> that's<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.330> oh<00:02:37.420> yeah<00:02:37.570> and<00:02:37.750> I'm

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.340 
people can come play with me we'll just
follow<00:02:46.120> an<00:02:46.300> entire<00:02:46.540> stack<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:46.960> people<00:02:47.200> that

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.290 
follow an entire stack of people that
are<00:02:47.950> from<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.430> channel<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:48.850> I<00:02:48.940> think<00:02:49.150> that

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
are from the channel and I think that

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.080 
are from the channel and I think that
shouldn't<00:02:49.570> be<00:02:49.630> too<00:02:49.660> hard<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.760> anybody<00:02:51.760> in<00:02:52.030> the

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
shouldn't be too hard so anybody in the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.280 
shouldn't be too hard so anybody in the
world<00:02:52.120> can<00:02:52.300> play<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.630> has<00:02:52.750> dota<00:02:52.960> 2<00:02:53.110> is

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
world can play that has dota 2 is

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.190 
world can play that has dota 2 is
basically<00:02:53.740> what<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.940> consensus<00:02:55.810> would

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
basically what the the consensus would

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.020 
basically what the the consensus would
be<00:02:56.350> easier<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.010> do<00:02:57.190> kissena<00:02:57.520> can<00:02:57.670> just<00:02:57.790> host<00:02:57.910> a

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
be easier to do kissena can just host a

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.670 
be easier to do kissena can just host a
game<00:02:58.150> lobby<00:02:58.390> I<00:02:58.540> don't<00:02:58.660> have<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.870> add<00:02:58.960> like<00:02:59.230> 40

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.820 
think that's a right thing you guys for
watching<00:03:06.010> appreciate<00:03:06.640> it<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:06.910> I<00:03:07.500> guess<00:03:08.500> it's

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830
