00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 This is a game of geometry indicated 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.719
 for children from third grade 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.740
 There are two stages to play. 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.570
 This game 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.029
 first each with his piano still 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.830
 child can play up to four children 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:25.289
 then each with your point of departure 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:30.210
 played for example in this case left 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.430
 number 5 he will advance yes home and he 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.340
 will say the name of this figure 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.280
 then this is a triangular prism 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.460
 If he hits it, he's still here to 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.340
 then continue the game if he misses it 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.829
 missing a house, only this 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.039
 in a scene if this first rule of 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.530
 prohibition on the child's contact with 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.050
 figures of men 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.980
 The second stage of the game 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.939
 the stage at a later stage to 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.240
 rule it will change quite well 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.340
 more elaborate 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:16.049
 so if team play falls for 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:20.070
 example in number 2 and number 2 if he 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.920
 fall into the world 2 or yes it should go to 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.850
 the flat shape designer or more 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:31.350
 next 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:34.170
 the u2 must go to the flat region more 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:40.200
 close ahead 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.460
 then the flat region would be the one from here is 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.909
 a circus that has 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.010
 the painted region is the title but the 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.840
 people said it's a circus is a figure 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.670
 flat contour 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.670
 this one is already a figure 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.800
 this here with the singer is already a 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.750
 circumference 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:11.000
 this is already a circus that is a figure 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:15.660
 plane falling 2 or yes follow 3 or 6 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.989
 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.580
 it should go to the shape drawing 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:26.700
 nearest or three-dimensional space 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:30.900
 then it should go dimensional safe 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.420
 space would be the cube is 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.730
 here he has that fell I do not know if 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.680
 another had 3 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.660
 the rule would be the same if it fell in the world 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.620
 that is a triangle is a flat figure o 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.230
 training 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.290
 So you have to put a teacher more 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.410
 a contour plane figure 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.700
 control would be the square is a figure 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.700
 flat contour 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.989
 the names of the figures 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:04.980
 so here is a triangle set up 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:08.370
 flat is a square has contour cure 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.980
 contour square a cone that is a 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.930
 space 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:20.970
 here is a prism circumference 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:23.570
 triangle waits rectangle that the 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.570
 circle 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:36.340
 the eighth cylinder in the rectangle cube 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:40.780
 white square on the triangle or 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:46.620
 outline contour and outline 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:51.130
 the outline for pyramid pipe 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:54.700
 pentagon not this is an example hexagon 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:58.480
 rectangle triangle for the 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.750
 team of this water and a triangle 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:06.520
 rectangle 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:11.140
 contour sphere pentagon hexagon 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:17.459
 square pyramid square figure of 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:20.459
 outline and there cylinder and so on. 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.459
 repeat
