water pulse and nita rain dance and

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:25.230 
water pulse and nita rain dance and
earthquake<00:01:23.319> watch<00:01:24.069> out<00:01:24.340> cuz<00:01:24.550> this<00:01:24.759> thing<00:01:25.030> has

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
earthquake watch out cuz this thing has

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.359 
earthquake watch out cuz this thing has
water<00:01:25.569> absorbs<00:01:26.229> so<00:01:26.500> if<00:01:26.560> you<00:01:26.770> use<00:01:26.920> any<00:01:27.130> water

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
water absorbs so if you use any water

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.529 
water absorbs so if you use any water
that<00:01:27.520> means<00:01:27.880> it<00:01:28.450> will<00:01:28.569> get<00:01:28.720> colder<00:01:30.360> alright<00:01:31.360> so

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
that means it will get colder alright so

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:32.850 
that means it will get colder alright so
i'm<00:01:31.660> going<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:31.869> manage<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.259> put<00:01:32.440> it<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.679> sleep

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
i'm going to manage to put it to sleep

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.330 
i'm going to manage to put it to sleep
now<00:01:33.399> um<00:01:34.090> in<00:01:34.780> my<00:01:35.020> former<00:01:35.080> takes<00:01:35.740> i<00:01:36.390> use<00:01:37.390> em<00:01:37.599> yeah

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
now um in my former takes i use em yeah

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.150 
now um in my former takes i use em yeah
so<00:01:39.340> um<00:01:39.819> now<00:01:40.750> this<00:01:41.050> will<00:01:41.200> be<00:01:41.349> easier<00:01:41.800> because<00:01:41.979> it

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
so um now this will be easier because it

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.309 
so um now this will be easier because it
lived<00:01:42.459> a<00:01:42.550> little<00:01:42.729> bit<00:01:42.970> now<00:01:43.360> since<00:01:43.750> it<00:01:43.899> didn't

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319
