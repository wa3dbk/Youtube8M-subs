it more visible what you got to do just

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.259 
it more visible what you got to do just
one<00:03:16.100> person's<00:03:16.489> everything<00:03:16.970> like<00:03:17.120> it's

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
one person's everything like it's

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.640 
one person's everything like it's
opening<00:03:17.540> something<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.930> has<00:03:18.080> or<00:03:18.290> something<00:03:18.560> or

opening something it has or something or
whatever<00:03:18.890> and<00:03:19.790> you<00:03:19.850> can<00:03:20.000> cut<00:03:20.269> this<00:03:20.420> up<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:20.959> the

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
whatever and you can cut this up so the

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.780 
whatever and you can cut this up so the
same<00:03:21.590> will<00:03:21.739> flow<00:03:21.890> over<00:03:22.100> it<00:03:22.280> so<00:03:22.459> it<00:03:22.610> looks

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
same will flow over it so it looks

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.880 
same will flow over it so it looks
completely<00:03:23.209> disguise<00:03:23.980> just<00:03:24.980> like<00:03:25.489> that<00:03:26.890> so
