00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 can not do a self interview to me 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.410
 I do not mind but we're here at the coffee shop 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.030
 the train station 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:13.259
 the place where you started with with 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.500
 dieudonnÃ© had been in 80 years 92 I 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.500
 think 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.160
 and that's where our success broke 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.510
 that is to say, I remember 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.900
 besides arriving there in the yard 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.970
 paved 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.500
 I remember we were amazed because 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.119
 that there was a tail but monstrous 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.099
 although she has almost 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.750
 the street and we said but shit but 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.790
 it's amazing for us 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.059
 but suddenly I always come back 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.059
 not 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.610
 it is true that I see it with a little 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.470
 j because in fact the memory that I have 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.410
 it's like when we remember 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:51.370
 old high school friends we see them again 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:54.070
 cute little boy with little satchel on the 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.960
 back good me I do not have this image of god 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.739
 certainly does not have but I have a 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.350
 picture of an extremely funny mac with 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.750
 which I have never been so well 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.860
 finally with which ever so much laughed with 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.560
 which I have never had so many 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.200
 complicity and cse dieudonnÃ© the one of which I 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.650
 speak in the book after another 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.320
 diode the one who is anti-Semitic racist 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.350
 I do not know what kind of people are around people 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.490
 weird a little creepy that I know 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.350
 not actually in the book you there are 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.580
 a new woman who tries him when 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.930
 even to keep contact seemed all to 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.190
 made me text messages regularly 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.900
 by the way I received it there is no 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.220
 long time 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.310
 yes yes it is she who keeps the contact 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.900
 it's nice of him maybe 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.009
 that if I had the opportunity we will meet again 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.509
 but it is true that there is at least 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.119
 it's been at least two years since we 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.790
 not seen we'll see maybe who me 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.390
 will make a lawsuit after him this will be 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.390
 the opportunity to see us again 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:57.829
 it's true that if my mother was not 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:59.000
 died so quickly and it was very 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.670
 fast it was very violent 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.859
 it was a hepatitis b disease that 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.090
 won in three weeks and that's 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:10.190
 true that if there had not been this 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.590
 tragic event that destroyed me but 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.060
 who also build me these countries this 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.090
 event maybe I would not have 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.610
 to search 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.330
 humor as a refuge and it's true that 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.069
 it's a refuge it was say that a 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.980
 months later I go back to school and 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.720
 it was vital for me to exist in 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.010
 making others laugh and that's it 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.660
 again so here I advise it's not 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.250
 not because we are not humoristic 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.549
 because we had misfortunes in his 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.650
 life obviously but it's true that it 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:45.730
 I was going to say that help to his ears 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:49.120
 but everyone has flaws we all have 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.480
 canyon cracks injuries to 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.500
 self-esteem and we try to fill them 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.500
 me it was making people laugh 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.879
 brother so laurent who unfortunately 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:04.519
 died of AIDS a decade ago 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.650
 of years and that's partly for him 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.180
 also that I made this circle book 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.090
 I think he has a real talent 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:16.790
 literary texts he writes his 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.470
 sublime and at one point I have more 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.090
 wanted to stop the book I told myself 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.430
 it'll no interest is a modest 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.370
 it's disgusting I balance all that 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.060
 is used for nothing etc and re-reading the 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.400
 texts of laurent I told myself when 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.989
 even for him I'll do it and at 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.359
 least for these texts to be published 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.560
 black on white in a book is 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.739
 maybe in the future 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.909
 these texts will also be published 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.239
 flammarion because they really have a 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.860
 very great artistic value 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.240
 tomorrow precisely where 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.520
 written in any case in the island this is a 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:54.200
 creek and I saw that we had to bandage 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.780
 illness as new life yes what 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.250
 courage against AIDS 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.380
 a gain that reaches an illness 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.000
 deadly but as smart as 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.070
 that he 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.090
 how do we react are we 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.630
 does not want to get fucked by the 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.550
 window 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.380
 is not what we cry about 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.570
 his soc shot it does not go up on his lot 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.330
 perpetually what courage it takes 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.359
 it's crazy it's amazing so he has 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.930
 took it close to the body and then I know 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.760
 that during his agony in quotation marks at 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.570
 the hospital he never told us about the 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.570
 never died 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.650
 I feel a little guilty but we feel 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.820
 all a little guilty to people who 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:36.670
 are who died prematurely that's 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.130
 true that after after you say shit 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.340
 I should have helped him more I should have 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.360
 to say that I loved him 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.639
 he is no longer present for him the dice 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.430
 so financially so that they have 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:54.590
 a life a little bit better but good 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.300
 that's it it's too late yes yes 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.820
 I can live with but it's true 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.729
 that it was a difficult moment in 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.620
 the book is that tell it re-read 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.229
 the texts you were not far from 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.270
 whinging what because it's cccc force 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.250
 going back is good to go keenly 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.820
 likewise its on the same altitude 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.610
 you actually stir things that you 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.200
 you settle for years to 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:23.260
 not to stir up the return to the world 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.260
 so that's a bit hard
