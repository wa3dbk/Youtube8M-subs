00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
for air and I realized right then and

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.370 
for air and I realized right then and
there<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:11.069> could

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
there that we could

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.560 
there that we could
that<00:02:11.530> again<00:02:11.800> we<00:02:11.980> were<00:02:12.460> given<00:02:12.880> a<00:02:12.970> one<00:02:13.180> free<00:02:13.390> pass

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
more element of danger for the dog the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.660 
more element of danger for the dog the
