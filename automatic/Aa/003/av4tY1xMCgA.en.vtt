00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.020
 juli people so today we get 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.589
 found for a glitch or rather a 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.779
 hack 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.610
 so I would like to show you how 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.769
 will explain very quickly and have 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.590
 really a lot of money then coming 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.480
 of network settings here it is necessary that 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.890
 cable networks and cable networks 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.810
 I do not know if it works for the fault 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.420
 but I thought rather cable networks 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.160
 then you have the parameters 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:30.210
 or should be established 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:35.780
 parameters of the sinn support man is 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.780
 manual and so main dsm servers 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:46.280
 excuse me you write I think 185 way 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.970
 1.12 and 15-year points in the not say 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.550
 whatever 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.550
 46 and 49 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.869
 we want to finish I'm not that okay 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.119
 hide until I admit and 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.500
 you m secondary write nothing in 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.350
 the tax parameters are used for 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.300
 borrowing candor retrieve a worker 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.190
 back you connect there I 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:28.910
 am not so sure ps3 if the same thing 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:33.130
 but I do not think at all then we get 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:36.190
 then connect it to make a little lips 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.690
 so I'll be back in a few moments 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.610
 so here or dvd we can first year 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.950
 by the solo and then go right away 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.210
 in India it is pro - time and in addition to 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.600
 the more that's how it works 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.320
 then you go to indre your 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.729
 character I do not know what then 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.920
 provence the agent be you do some 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.840
 missions as usual combat 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.189
 useful when you are going to have money at 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.479
 does anything to take money 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.920
 at warm climates xi so here I have 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.479
 cut the sound of the gameplay because there is 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.580
 music starts after me I had 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:12.260
 forgot to remove and 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:17.350
 and the new systems all the hard bit 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.350
 so it's like that then 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.990

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:27.930

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.160
 the more the sensation as a genre 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.120
