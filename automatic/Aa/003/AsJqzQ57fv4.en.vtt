is<00:04:17.890> my<00:04:18.010> major<00:04:18.220> problem<00:04:18.580> with<00:04:18.670> the<00:04:18.760> gameplay

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
is my major problem with the gameplay

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.000 
is my major problem with the gameplay
it's<00:04:19.330> not<00:04:19.510> that<00:04:19.570> actually<00:04:20.350> when<00:04:20.500> you<00:04:20.620> beat<00:04:20.860> the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
it's not that actually when you beat the

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.500 
it's not that actually when you beat the
shit<00:04:21.250> have<00:04:21.400> an<00:04:21.549> enemy<00:04:21.820> you<00:04:21.940> feel<00:04:22.180> like<00:04:22.360> you're

shit have an enemy you feel like you're

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.970 
shit have an enemy you feel like you're
ripping<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:23.170> shit<00:04:23.410> out<00:04:23.530> of<00:04:23.560> them<00:04:23.740> especially

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
ripping the shit out of them especially

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.920 
ripping the shit out of them especially
when<00:04:24.310> monkey<00:04:24.580> goes<00:04:24.730> into<00:04:24.970> is<00:04:25.120> you<00:04:25.480> know<00:04:25.600> close

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
when monkey goes into is you know close

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.320 
when monkey goes into is you know close
view<00:04:26.200> of<00:04:26.260> rawr<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:26.830> some<00:04:27.640> of<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:27.880> finishers

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
view of rawr and some of the finishers

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:38.580 
view of rawr and some of the finishers
are<00:04:28.770> amazing

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.500 

but<00:04:39.590> I<00:04:39.949> would<00:04:40.430> have<00:04:40.580> to<00:04:40.730> say<00:04:40.760> the<00:04:40.940> things<00:04:41.120> I

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
but I would have to say the things I

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.909 
but I would have to say the things I
didn't<00:04:41.870> like<00:04:41.900> about<00:04:42.020> to<00:04:42.290> combat<00:04:42.560> as<00:04:42.650> it<00:04:42.770> feels

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
didn't like about to combat as it feels

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.159 
didn't like about to combat as it feels
very<00:04:43.160> repetitive<00:04:43.460> after<00:04:43.880> a<00:04:44.090> while<00:04:44.270> basically

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
very repetitive after a while basically

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.480 
very repetitive after a while basically
just<00:04:45.199> clicking<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:45.740> X<00:04:45.919> and<00:04:46.070> Y<00:04:46.220> button

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
just clicking the X and Y button

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.969 
just clicking the X and Y button
repeatedly<00:04:46.790> and<00:04:47.720> it<00:04:48.050> just<00:04:48.470> never<00:04:48.620> feels

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
repeatedly and it just never feels

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.850 
repeatedly and it just never feels
exciting<00:04:49.669> and<00:04:49.850> the<00:04:50.240> combo<00:04:50.720> DEP<00:04:50.960> is<00:04:51.169> not<00:04:51.590> there

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
exciting and the combo DEP is not there

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.210 
exciting and the combo DEP is not there
it's<00:04:52.160> literally<00:04:52.850> like<00:04:53.000> four<00:04:53.389> moves<00:04:53.660> so<00:04:54.620> while

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
it's literally like four moves so while

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.250 
it's literally like four moves so while
I<00:04:55.250> didn't<00:04:55.550> make<00:04:55.669> the<00:04:55.790> combat<00:04:56.240> was<00:04:56.510> terrible<00:04:57.139> in

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
I didn't make the combat was terrible in

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.360 
I didn't make the combat was terrible in
terms<00:04:57.440> of<00:04:57.530> the<00:04:57.650> feel<00:04:57.830> of<00:04:57.860> it<00:04:58.100> and<00:04:58.280> you

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
terms of the feel of it and you

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.890 
terms of the feel of it and you
definitely<00:04:58.550> taken<00:04:59.000> out<00:04:59.090> a<00:04:59.120> bunch<00:04:59.360> enemies<00:04:59.750> in

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
definitely taken out a bunch enemies in

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.200 
definitely taken out a bunch enemies in
you<00:05:00.139> know<00:05:00.260> super<00:05:00.590> strong<00:05:00.949> fashion<00:05:01.220> it<00:05:01.940> just

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
you know super strong fashion it just

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.939 
you know super strong fashion it just
wasn't<00:05:02.389> enough<00:05:02.630> for<00:05:03.080> me<00:05:03.199> so<00:05:03.500> those<00:05:03.680> are<00:05:03.710> really

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
wasn't enough for me so those are really

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.379 
wasn't enough for me so those are really
that's<00:05:04.400> my<00:05:04.550> really<00:05:04.880> negative<00:05:05.240> in<00:05:05.360> the

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
that's my really negative in the

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.360 
that's my really negative in the
gameplay<00:05:05.780> section<00:05:06.199> is<00:05:06.320> the<00:05:06.800> combo<00:05:07.190> system

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
gameplay section is the combo system

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.950 
gameplay section is the combo system
just<00:05:07.669> could<00:05:07.880> have<00:05:07.970> been<00:05:08.090> so<00:05:08.270> much<00:05:08.330> more<00:05:08.479> and

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
just could have been so much more and

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.780 
just could have been so much more and
the<00:05:09.500> combat<00:05:09.860> itself<00:05:10.100> just<00:05:10.340> could<00:05:10.490> have<00:05:10.520> been<00:05:10.610> a

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
the combat itself just could have been a

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.520 
the combat itself just could have been a
lot<00:05:11.030> better<00:05:11.090> so<00:05:11.810> that's<00:05:12.020> my<00:05:12.139> only<00:05:12.290> really

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
lot better so that's my only really

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.170 
lot better so that's my only really
negative<00:05:12.860> thing<00:05:13.040> is<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.310> combat<00:05:13.669> just<00:05:13.880> didn't

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
negative thing is the combat just didn't

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.520 
negative thing is the combat just didn't
live<00:05:14.300> up<00:05:14.330> to<00:05:14.510> the<00:05:14.750> rest<00:05:14.960> of<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.139> game<00:05:15.290> like<00:05:15.500> the

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
live up to the rest of the game like the

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.409 
live up to the rest of the game like the
platform<00:05:16.070> and<00:05:16.310> the<00:05:16.370> shooting<00:05:16.970> sections

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
platform and the shooting sections

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:18.550 
platform and the shooting sections
aren't<00:05:17.630> really<00:05:17.870> one<00:05:17.990> of<00:05:18.020> my<00:05:18.169> favorite<00:05:18.500> I

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
aren't really one of my favorite I

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.870 
aren't really one of my favorite I
didn't<00:05:18.800> really<00:05:18.979> love<00:05:19.160> the<00:05:19.310> shooting<00:05:19.610> you<00:05:19.700> can

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
didn't really love the shooting you can

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.700 
didn't really love the shooting you can
upgrade<00:05:20.090> it<00:05:20.330> to<00:05:20.450> make<00:05:20.660> it<00:05:20.690> better<00:05:20.840> like<00:05:21.200> faster

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
upgrade it to make it better like faster

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.620 
upgrade it to make it better like faster
shooting<00:05:22.070> rates<00:05:22.280> and<00:05:22.490> all<00:05:22.610> that<00:05:22.790> but<00:05:23.270> I<00:05:23.330> just

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
shooting rates and all that but I just

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.120 
shooting rates and all that but I just
wasn't<00:05:23.870> feeling<00:05:24.020> the<00:05:24.260> shooting<00:05:24.590> section<00:05:24.919> at

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
wasn't feeling the shooting section at

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.830 
wasn't feeling the shooting section at
all<00:05:25.400> I<00:05:25.669> think<00:05:25.880> they<00:05:25.970> kind<00:05:26.120> of<00:05:26.210> incorporated

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
all I think they kind of incorporated

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.510 
all I think they kind of incorporated
the<00:05:27.050> shooting<00:05:27.440> in<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:27.650> combat<00:05:28.010> a<00:05:28.070> lot<00:05:28.250> better

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
the shooting in the combat a lot better

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.129 
the shooting in the combat a lot better
instead<00:05:29.000> of<00:05:29.030> going<00:05:29.210> into<00:05:29.419> third<00:05:29.630> person<00:05:30.020> and

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
instead of going into third person and

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.290 
instead of going into third person and
Amy<00:05:30.320> just<00:05:30.979> a<00:05:31.100> way<00:05:31.220> to<00:05:31.250> shoot<00:05:31.520> the<00:05:31.700> staff<00:05:31.940> quick

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
Amy just a way to shoot the staff quick

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.790 
Amy just a way to shoot the staff quick
and<00:05:32.479> then<00:05:32.570> hit<00:05:32.900> the<00:05:33.050> enemy<00:05:33.200> would<00:05:33.530> have<00:05:33.650> been<00:05:33.770> a

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
and then hit the enemy would have been a

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.260 
and then hit the enemy would have been a
lot<00:05:34.039> better<00:05:34.070> would<00:05:34.460> have<00:05:34.550> made<00:05:34.639> a<00:05:34.669> combat<00:05:35.090> more

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
lot better would have made a combat more

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.840 
lot better would have made a combat more
fun<00:05:35.479> but<00:05:35.990> as<00:05:36.139> it<00:05:36.320> stands<00:05:36.650> didn't<00:05:37.580> love<00:05:37.699> the

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
fun but as it stands didn't love the

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.370 
fun but as it stands didn't love the
shooting<00:05:38.180> it's<00:05:38.360> not<00:05:38.479> that's<00:05:38.660> terrible<00:05:39.229> it

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
shooting it's not that's terrible it

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:46.739 
shooting it's not that's terrible it
does<00:05:39.650> work<00:05:39.889> just<00:05:40.520> not<00:05:40.699> feeling

00:05:46.739 --> 00:05:46.749 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:49.149 

so<00:05:47.749> this<00:05:47.929> game<00:05:48.139> is<00:05:48.169> actually<00:05:48.439> hard<00:05:48.799> for<00:05:48.979> me<00:05:49.069> to

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
so this game is actually hard for me to

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:51.489 
so this game is actually hard for me to
rate<00:05:49.339> in<00:05:49.549> terms<00:05:49.610> of<00:05:50.269> story<00:05:50.629> and<00:05:50.929> the<00:05:51.110> look<00:05:51.349> of

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:51.499 
rate in terms of story and the look of

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:53.199 
rate in terms of story and the look of
it<00:05:51.649> and<00:05:51.829> the<00:05:51.889> design<00:05:52.279> and<00:05:52.669> everything<00:05:52.819> like

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:53.209 
it and the design and everything like

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:55.329 
it and the design and everything like
that<00:05:53.269> the<00:05:53.899> game<00:05:54.110> is<00:05:54.259> phenomenal<00:05:54.799> this<00:05:55.129> game

00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:55.339 
that the game is phenomenal this game

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:56.559 
that the game is phenomenal this game
actually<00:05:55.579> probably<00:05:55.969> would<00:05:56.299> have<00:05:56.360> worked

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:56.569 
actually probably would have worked

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:58.779 
actually probably would have worked
better<00:05:56.689> as<00:05:57.079> a<00:05:57.110> freaking<00:05:57.679> movie<00:05:58.039> it<00:05:58.249> is<00:05:58.549> that

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
better as a freaking movie it is that

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:01.809 
better as a freaking movie it is that
kick-ass<00:05:59.179> as<00:05:59.899> far<00:06:00.259> as<00:06:00.289> it<00:06:00.439> being<00:06:00.649> a<00:06:00.979> game<00:06:01.249> not

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:01.819 
kick-ass as far as it being a game not

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:03.699 
kick-ass as far as it being a game not
that<00:06:01.969> the<00:06:02.119> gameplay<00:06:02.479> is<00:06:02.629> bad<00:06:02.869> but<00:06:03.379> it<00:06:03.529> never

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:03.709 
that the gameplay is bad but it never

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:05.499 
that the gameplay is bad but it never
reaches<00:06:04.129> up<00:06:04.249> to<00:06:04.369> the<00:06:04.459> quality<00:06:04.909> that<00:06:04.939> the<00:06:05.209> story

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:05.509 
reaches up to the quality that the story

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:07.059 
reaches up to the quality that the story
or<00:06:05.719> the<00:06:05.749> graphics<00:06:06.259> are<00:06:06.439> and<00:06:06.649> that's<00:06:06.799> a<00:06:06.889> major

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:07.069 
or the graphics are and that's a major

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:09.249 
or the graphics are and that's a major
problem<00:06:07.399> especially<00:06:08.239> when<00:06:08.629> it's<00:06:08.839> a<00:06:08.929> video

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:09.259
