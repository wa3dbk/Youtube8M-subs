spotlight today we're going to be taking
a<00:00:11.170> look<00:00:11.469> at<00:00:11.740> the<00:00:12.160> climate<00:00:12.700> Iser<00:00:13.030> from<00:00:13.360> extra

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.750 
a look at the climate Iser from extra

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.440 
a look at the climate Iser from extra
bees<00:00:13.950> now<00:00:14.950> this<00:00:15.250> is<00:00:15.459> it's<00:00:15.969> quite<00:00:16.209> a<00:00:16.240> handy

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450 
bees now this is it's quite a handy

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.200 
bees now this is it's quite a handy
block<00:00:16.869> in<00:00:17.170> that<00:00:17.230> it<00:00:17.619> will<00:00:17.860> help<00:00:18.430> you<00:00:18.820> adjust

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
block in that it will help you adjust

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.170 
block in that it will help you adjust
which<00:00:20.050> biomes<00:00:20.710> your<00:00:21.039> bees<00:00:21.280> are<00:00:21.610> able<00:00:21.760> to<00:00:21.940> work

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
which biomes your bees are able to work

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.290 
which biomes your bees are able to work
in<00:00:22.450> so<00:00:23.320> it<00:00:24.130> can<00:00:25.710> basically<00:00:26.710> if<00:00:27.220> you<00:00:27.460> hover<00:00:28.000> over

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
in so it can basically if you hover over

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.940 
in so it can basically if you hover over
your<00:00:28.420> B<00:00:28.660> you'll<00:00:28.990> see<00:00:29.640> you've<00:00:30.640> got<00:00:30.970> the<00:00:31.270> T<00:00:31.950> line

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
your B you'll see you've got the T line

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.150 
your B you'll see you've got the T line
and<00:00:33.309> the<00:00:33.370> H<00:00:33.550> line<00:00:33.790> in<00:00:33.969> green<00:00:34.120> there<00:00:34.620> at<00:00:35.620> the

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
and the H line in green there at the

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160 
and the H line in green there at the
moment<00:00:36.430> the<00:00:36.730> acclimatizing<00:00:37.329> will<00:00:37.600> only<00:00:37.840> work

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
moment the acclimatizing will only work

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.490 
moment the acclimatizing will only work
with<00:00:38.470> that<00:00:38.650> T<00:00:38.920> line<00:00:39.190> and<00:00:39.460> what<00:00:40.210> it<00:00:40.329> will<00:00:40.480> do<00:00:40.780> is

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
with that T line and what it will do is

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.450 
with that T line and what it will do is
it<00:00:41.860> will<00:00:41.890> allow<00:00:42.310> you<00:00:42.370> to<00:00:43.950> adjust<00:00:44.950> the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
it will allow you to adjust the

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.380 
it will allow you to adjust the
tolerances<00:00:46.270> that<00:00:46.650> it<00:00:47.650> can<00:00:47.800> work<00:00:47.980> so<00:00:48.550> this<00:00:49.329> is

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
tolerances that it can work so this is

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.160 
tolerances that it can work so this is
now<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:51.370> tropical<00:00:51.790> princess<00:00:52.360> is<00:00:52.540> saying<00:00:52.810> it

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
now this tropical princess is saying it

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.190 
now this tropical princess is saying it
will<00:00:53.410> do<00:00:53.649> both<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:55.120> which<00:00:55.510> means<00:00:55.780> that<00:00:55.989> it

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
will do both one which means that it

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.870 
will do both one which means that it
will<00:00:56.910> go<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:59.320> temperature<00:00:59.800> higher<00:01:00.340> than<00:01:00.640> warm

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
will go one temperature higher than warm

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.940 
will go one temperature higher than warm
and<00:01:01.210> also<00:01:01.360> one<00:01:01.720> temperature<00:01:02.170> lower<00:01:02.470> than<00:01:02.590> warm

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
and also one temperature lower than warm

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.420 
and also one temperature lower than warm
now<00:01:03.850> by<00:01:04.629> using<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.229> acclimatize<00:01:05.860> ur<00:01:05.890> we<00:01:06.219> could

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
now by using the acclimatize ur we could

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.430 
now by using the acclimatize ur we could
make<00:01:06.640> that<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:07.390> both<00:01:08.229> two<00:01:09.479> eventually<00:01:10.479> it's

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
make that to both two eventually it's

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.620 
make that to both two eventually it's
not<00:01:11.710> a<00:01:11.740> straightforward<00:01:12.520> process<00:01:13.060> it<00:01:13.479> does

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
not a straightforward process it does

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.690 
not a straightforward process it does
take<00:01:13.810> a<00:01:13.840> bit<00:01:13.930> of<00:01:14.049> time<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:14.830> quite<00:01:15.400> a<00:01:15.430> bit<00:01:15.610> of

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
take a bit of time and quite a bit of

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.789 
take a bit of time and quite a bit of
resources<00:01:16.740> but<00:01:17.740> it's<00:01:18.040> possible<00:01:18.460> now<00:01:19.240> as<00:01:20.080> far

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
resources but it's possible now as far

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.730 
resources but it's possible now as far
as<00:01:20.860> I<00:01:21.100> know<00:01:21.159> at<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.700> moment<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.990> H<00:01:23.200> line<00:01:23.500> which

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
as I know at the moment the H line which

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.880 
as I know at the moment the H line which
is<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.100> humidity<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:25.200> can't<00:01:26.200> adjust<00:01:26.380> in<00:01:26.770> the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
is the humidity you can't adjust in the

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.010 
is the humidity you can't adjust in the
acclimatize<00:01:27.460> er<00:01:27.490> so<00:01:27.880> you<00:01:28.450> are<00:01:28.659> still

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
acclimatize er so you are still

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.140 
acclimatize er so you are still
restricted<00:01:29.799> to<00:01:32.369> your<00:01:33.369> crossbreeding<00:01:34.000> and

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
restricted to your crossbreeding and

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.810 
restricted to your crossbreeding and
bringing<00:01:34.510> in<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.630> white<00:01:34.869> genomes<00:01:35.350> for<00:01:35.820> your

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
bringing in the white genomes for your

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.660 
bringing in the white genomes for your
humidity<00:01:37.360> tolerance<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.850> bear<00:01:40.119> that<00:01:40.150> in<00:01:40.360> mind

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
humidity tolerance so bear that in mind

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.130 
humidity tolerance so bear that in mind
you<00:01:42.670> might<00:01:42.880> not<00:01:43.090> necessarily<00:01:43.270> be<00:01:43.689> able<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:43.930> get

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
you might not necessarily be able to get

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.260 
you might not necessarily be able to get
and<00:01:44.560> be<00:01:44.770> working<00:01:45.250> in<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.430> biome<00:01:45.760> you<00:01:45.790> want<00:01:46.150> it

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
and be working in the biome you want it

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.100 
and be working in the biome you want it
to<00:01:46.479> just<00:01:46.810> because<00:01:47.470> humidity<00:01:48.369> as<00:01:48.430> well<00:01:49.110> so

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
to just because humidity as well so

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.640 
to just because humidity as well so
let's<00:01:50.680> just<00:01:50.799> have<00:01:51.009> a<00:01:51.040> look<00:01:51.189> at<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.850> GUI<00:01:52.030> for

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
let's just have a look at the GUI for

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.499 
let's just have a look at the GUI for
for<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:53.740> acclimatize<00:01:54.340> ER<00:01:54.369> and<00:01:54.729> then<00:01:55.270> we'll<00:01:55.390> go

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
for the acclimatize ER and then we'll go

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.050 
for the acclimatize ER and then we'll go
over<00:01:55.720> how<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:55.960> works<00:01:56.200> how<00:01:56.439> it's<00:01:56.590> made<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.100> you

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
over how it works how it's made and you

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.609 
over how it works how it's made and you
power<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:59.070> so<00:02:00.070> if<00:02:00.850> we<00:02:01.030> have<00:02:01.180> a<00:02:01.210> look<00:02:01.420> it's<00:02:02.320> a

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
power it so if we have a look it's a

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.090 
power it so if we have a look it's a
really<00:02:03.280> really<00:02:03.430> simple<00:02:03.700> interface<00:02:05.100> you

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
really really simple interface you

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.880 
really really simple interface you
basically<00:02:06.549> have<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:06.909> slot<00:02:07.420> for<00:02:07.659> your<00:02:07.720> B<00:02:07.960> right

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
basically have a slot for your B right

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.569 
basically have a slot for your B right
the<00:02:09.069> middle<00:02:09.780> like<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:11.319> then<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.370> have<00:02:12.549> a

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579 
the middle like so and then you have a

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:14.790 
the middle like so and then you have a
slot<00:02:12.909> on<00:02:12.939> the<00:02:13.060> left<00:02:13.120> hand<00:02:13.540> side<00:02:13.780> for<00:02:14.349> whatever

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
slot on the left hand side for whatever

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.710 
slot on the left hand side for whatever
item<00:02:15.520> you're<00:02:15.790> going<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.030> use

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
item you're going to use

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.770 
item you're going to use
to<00:02:18.380> try<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:18.860> adjust<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:20.600> temperature

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
to try and adjust the temperature

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.710 
to try and adjust the temperature
tolerance<00:02:21.410> of<00:02:21.590> your<00:02:21.740> B<00:02:21.920> now<00:02:22.730> there<00:02:23.180> I've<00:02:23.450> got

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
tolerance of your B now there I've got

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.480 
tolerance of your B now there I've got
quite<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.200> few<00:02:24.260> things<00:02:24.620> in<00:02:24.770> here<00:02:24.830> some<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.400> these

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
quite a few things in here some of these

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.600 
quite a few things in here some of these
workers<00:02:25.970> some<00:02:26.150> of<00:02:26.240> them<00:02:26.330> don't<00:02:26.630> but<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:28.400> can

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
workers some of them don't but you can

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.480 
workers some of them don't but you can
for<00:02:28.790> instance<00:02:28.820> use<00:02:29.180> ice<00:02:29.570> in<00:02:29.870> there<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.490> what

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
for instance use ice in there and what

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.100 
for instance use ice in there and what
it<00:02:31.610> will<00:02:31.700> do<00:02:31.850> is<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.180> will<00:02:32.240> process<00:02:32.510> out<00:02:32.900> it's

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
it will do is it will process out it's

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.690 
it will do is it will process out it's
going<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.320> use<00:02:33.500> our<00:02:33.710> build<00:02:33.950> craft<00:02:34.220> energy

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
going to use our build craft energy

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.130 
going to use our build craft energy
which<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.180> currently<00:02:35.840> stored<00:02:36.320> in<00:02:36.530> here

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
which is currently stored in here

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.780 
which is currently stored in here
because<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.350> had<00:02:39.560> this<00:02:39.710> set<00:02:39.950> up<00:02:40.070> a<00:02:40.220> little<00:02:40.610> while

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
because I had this set up a little while

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.750 
because I had this set up a little while
ago<00:02:40.820> testing<00:02:41.510> stuff<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.200> as<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:43.370> see<00:02:43.580> it

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
ago testing stuff and as you see it

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.490 
ago testing stuff and as you see it
hasn't<00:02:44.060> actually<00:02:44.390> changed<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:45.110> tolerance

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
hasn't actually changed the tolerance

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.980 
hasn't actually changed the tolerance
and<00:02:46.160> that's<00:02:46.310> because<00:02:46.640> it's<00:02:46.850> only<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.120> small

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
and that's because it's only a small

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.720 
and that's because it's only a small
chance<00:02:48.290> or<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.650> chance<00:02:48.920> builds<00:02:49.310> up<00:02:49.430> over<00:02:49.580> time

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
chance or the chance builds up over time

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.290 
chance or the chance builds up over time
so<00:02:50.270> you<00:02:50.330> need<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.810> run<00:02:51.880> quite<00:02:52.880> a<00:02:52.910> bit<00:02:53.060> of<00:02:53.180> ice

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
so you need to run quite a bit of ice

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.040 
so you need to run quite a bit of ice
through<00:02:53.660> there<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:55.640> get<00:02:55.850> your<00:02:56.030> B<00:02:56.270> these

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
through there to get your B these

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.890 
through there to get your B these
tolerance<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:57.890> little<00:02:58.190> bit<00:02:58.340> higher<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.690> you

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
tolerance a little bit higher and you

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.240 
tolerance a little bit higher and you
probably<00:03:00.230> have<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.530> do<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:00.770> the<00:03:00.860> other<00:03:01.010> way<00:03:01.190> as

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
probably have to do it the other way as

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.100 
probably have to do it the other way as
well<00:03:01.550> to<00:03:01.940> get<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.880> higher<00:03:05.110> temperature

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
well to get the the higher temperature

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.940 
well to get the the higher temperature
tolerance<00:03:06.500> as<00:03:06.620> well<00:03:07.780> so<00:03:09.310> how<00:03:10.310> do<00:03:10.370> we<00:03:10.459> make<00:03:10.670> this

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
tolerance as well so how do we make this

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.980 
tolerance as well so how do we make this
fantastic<00:03:12.950> little<00:03:13.070> V<00:03:13.340> machine<00:03:13.760> as<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:14.690> might

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
fantastic little V machine as you might

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.510 
fantastic little V machine as you might
expect<00:03:15.110> you're<00:03:15.590> going<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:15.770> start<00:03:16.040> off<00:03:16.190> with<00:03:16.400> an

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
expect you're going to start off with an

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.240 
expect you're going to start off with an
aps<00:03:16.940> machine<00:03:17.390> so<00:03:18.140> you're<00:03:18.380> gonna<00:03:18.500> have<00:03:18.830> steady

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
aps machine so you're gonna have steady

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.180 
aps machine so you're gonna have steady
case<00:03:19.550> in<00:03:19.820> with<00:03:20.360> copper<00:03:20.810> ingots<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:21.680> redstone

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
case in with copper ingots and redstone

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.120 
case in with copper ingots and redstone
and<00:03:22.610> a<00:03:23.209> steady<00:03:23.480> casing<00:03:23.989> it's<00:03:24.110> just<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.590> bronze

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
and a steady casing it's just a bronze

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.620 
and a steady casing it's just a bronze
in<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:26.239> chest<00:03:26.540> shape<00:03:27.070> now<00:03:28.239> that<00:03:29.239> a<00:03:29.269> pious

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
in a chest shape now that a pious

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.620 
in a chest shape now that a pious
machine<00:03:30.080> you<00:03:30.860> put<00:03:30.890> three<00:03:31.760> water<00:03:32.000> cans<00:03:32.360> on<00:03:32.600> the

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
machine you put three water cans on the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.600 
machine you put three water cans on the
left<00:03:32.900> side<00:03:33.110> through<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.800> lava<00:03:33.980> cans<00:03:34.370> on<00:03:34.580> the

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
left side through the lava cans on the

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.940 
left side through the lava cans on the
right<00:03:34.850> side<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.140> redstone<00:03:36.530> above<00:03:36.830> and

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
right side and the redstone above and

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:37.360 
right side and the redstone above and
below<00:03:37.190> it

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
below it

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.750 
below it
and<00:03:37.519> that<00:03:37.850> gives<00:03:38.090> you<00:03:38.269> your<00:03:38.420> acclimatize<00:03:39.110> err

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
and that gives you your acclimatize err

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.270 
and that gives you your acclimatize err
now<00:03:41.440> this<00:03:42.440> power<00:03:42.709> bar<00:03:43.010> here<00:03:43.280> you<00:03:43.310> can<00:03:43.670> see<00:03:44.260> says

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
now this power bar here you can see says

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.360 
now this power bar here you can see says
holding<00:03:46.280> a<00:03:46.340> thousand<00:03:46.910> MJ<00:03:47.950> with<00:03:48.950> a<00:03:48.980> maximum

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
holding a thousand MJ with a maximum

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.400 
holding a thousand MJ with a maximum
input<00:03:49.489> of<00:03:49.790> 3<00:03:49.970> and<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.540> usage<00:03:50.840> of<00:03:50.930> two<00:03:51.110> and<00:03:51.200> a<00:03:51.260> half

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
input of 3 and a usage of two and a half

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.610 
input of 3 and a usage of two and a half
now<00:03:51.830> what<00:03:52.670> that<00:03:52.700> means<00:03:53.120> is<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:53.989> basically

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
now what that means is that basically

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.150 
now what that means is that basically
you<00:03:55.010> are<00:03:55.100> going<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.370> need<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:55.700> use<00:03:56.650> an<00:03:57.650> engine

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
you are going to need to use an engine

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.820 
you are going to need to use an engine
with<00:03:58.640> it<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:59.230> anything<00:04:00.230> other<00:04:00.500> than<00:04:00.769> a

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
with it and anything other than a

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.770 
with it and anything other than a
redstone<00:04:01.100> engine<00:04:01.610> which<00:04:01.760> it's<00:04:02.209> never<00:04:02.630> going

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
redstone engine which it's never going

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.320 
redstone engine which it's never going
to<00:04:02.810> give<00:04:02.989> you<00:04:03.110> enough<00:04:03.320> power<00:04:03.790> but<00:04:04.790> you<00:04:04.910> can<00:04:05.150> use

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
to give you enough power but you can use

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.780 
to give you enough power but you can use
any<00:04:05.600> of<00:04:05.690> these<00:04:05.840> other<00:04:05.900> ones<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:09.610> that<00:04:10.610> is

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
any of these other ones and that is

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.509 
any of these other ones and that is
going<00:04:10.970> to<00:04:11.030> give<00:04:11.239> you<00:04:11.890> well<00:04:12.890> if<00:04:13.160> you<00:04:13.280> use<00:04:13.310> a

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
going to give you well if you use a

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.060 
going to give you well if you use a
Stirling<00:04:14.030> engine<00:04:14.150> there<00:04:14.600> 1<00:04:14.959> MJ<00:04:15.440> so<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.830> might

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
Stirling engine there 1 MJ so you might

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.699 
Stirling engine there 1 MJ so you might
need<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.340> use<00:04:16.430> two<00:04:16.729> of<00:04:16.850> those<00:04:17.060> in<00:04:17.330> here<00:04:17.510> just<00:04:18.380> to

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
need to use two of those in here just to

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.009 
need to use two of those in here just to
make<00:04:19.700> it<00:04:19.850> go<00:04:20.000> a<00:04:20.030> little<00:04:20.180> easier<00:04:20.600> if<00:04:20.660> you<00:04:20.810> want

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
make it go a little easier if you want

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.120 
make it go a little easier if you want
to<00:04:21.080> run<00:04:21.260> it<00:04:21.380> constantly<00:04:21.890> you're<00:04:22.160> gonna<00:04:22.280> need

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
to run it constantly you're gonna need

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.740 
to run it constantly you're gonna need
one<00:04:25.130> of<00:04:25.160> these<00:04:25.310> engine<00:04:25.729> it's<00:04:26.300> gonna<00:04:26.419> give<00:04:26.630> you

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
one of these engine it's gonna give you

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.140 
one of these engine it's gonna give you
at<00:04:26.960> least<00:04:27.020> two<00:04:27.500> and<00:04:27.620> a<00:04:27.650> half<00:04:27.800> MJ

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
at least two and a half MJ

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.850 
at least two and a half MJ
which<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:30.930> probably<00:04:31.080> going<00:04:31.320> to<00:04:31.410> be<00:04:31.500> three

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
which is probably going to be three

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:40.280 
which is probably going to be three
Stirling<00:04:32.340> engines<00:04:32.790> or<00:04:36.290> biogas<00:04:37.290> engine<00:04:39.229> at<00:04:40.229> the

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
Stirling engines or biogas engine at the

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.800 
Stirling engines or biogas engine at the
moment<00:04:40.650> I'm<00:04:40.830> just<00:04:40.919> using<00:04:41.250> a<00:04:41.790> redstone<00:04:42.389> energy

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
moment I'm just using a redstone energy

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.110 
moment I'm just using a redstone energy
cell<00:04:43.080> that's<00:04:43.590> going<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:43.860> give<00:04:44.040> me<00:04:44.160> the<00:04:44.910> power

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
cell that's going to give me the power

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.050 
cell that's going to give me the power
that<00:04:45.389> we<00:04:45.479> need<00:04:45.800> just<00:04:46.800> so<00:04:47.580> I<00:04:47.610> can<00:04:47.910> demonstrate

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
that we need just so I can demonstrate

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.990 
that we need just so I can demonstrate
this<00:04:48.449> so<00:04:48.960> just<00:04:49.560> drop<00:04:49.770> our<00:04:49.979> tropical<00:04:50.400> princess

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
this so just drop our tropical princess

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.540 
this so just drop our tropical princess
in<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.960> we'll<00:04:52.169> see<00:04:52.440> we'll<00:04:52.830> try<00:04:53.100> each<00:04:53.280> of<00:04:53.460> these

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
in and we'll see we'll try each of these

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.250 
in and we'll see we'll try each of these
things<00:04:53.850> just<00:04:54.090> so<00:04:54.210> you<00:04:54.300> can<00:04:54.510> see<00:04:54.780> which<00:04:54.990> one's

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
things just so you can see which one's

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.330 
things just so you can see which one's
work<00:04:55.380> and<00:04:55.650> which<00:04:55.740> ones<00:04:55.830> don't

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
work and which ones don't

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.300 
work and which ones don't
now<00:04:57.150> we<00:04:57.210> have<00:04:57.630> a<00:04:57.930> water<00:04:58.290> sail<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:59.040> the<00:04:59.130> water

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
now we have a water sail and the water

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.490 
now we have a water sail and the water
cell<00:04:59.580> is<00:04:59.760> not<00:05:00.090> going<00:05:00.270> to<00:05:00.360> go<00:05:00.449> in<00:05:00.630> there<00:05:00.780> at<00:05:01.110> all

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
cell is not going to go in there at all

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.029 
cell is not going to go in there at all
so<00:05:02.370> industrial<00:05:03.120> craft<00:05:03.389> water<00:05:03.660> cells<00:05:04.039> don't

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
so industrial craft water cells don't

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.570 
so industrial craft water cells don't
work<00:05:05.690> this<00:05:06.690> one<00:05:06.900> here<00:05:07.169> is<00:05:07.500> a<00:05:07.800> water<00:05:08.039> container

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
work this one here is a water container

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.490 
work this one here is a water container
now<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.330> water<00:05:09.630> container<00:05:10.169> is<00:05:11.150> from<00:05:12.500> it's

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
now the water container is from it's

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.980 
now the water container is from it's
basically<00:05:13.800> as<00:05:14.370> I<00:05:14.550> craft<00:05:14.940> aluminium<00:05:15.630> cans

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
basically as I craft aluminium cans

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.800 
basically as I craft aluminium cans
filled<00:05:16.410> with<00:05:16.680> water<00:05:16.919> and<00:05:17.310> they<00:05:18.270> won't<00:05:18.630> work

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
filled with water and they won't work

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.980 
filled with water and they won't work
either<00:05:19.520> the<00:05:20.520> water<00:05:20.729> cans<00:05:21.300> which<00:05:21.660> are<00:05:21.840> from

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
either the water cans which are from

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.629 
either the water cans which are from
forestry<00:05:22.500> will<00:05:23.100> work

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
forestry will work

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.430 
forestry will work
and<00:05:24.330> now<00:05:24.449> I'll<00:05:24.600> help<00:05:24.840> you<00:05:24.990> adjust<00:05:25.110> the

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
and now I'll help you adjust the

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.159 
and now I'll help you adjust the
tolerance<00:05:25.620> down<00:05:29.240> so<00:05:30.240> as<00:05:30.570> you<00:05:30.750> see<00:05:30.990> that's

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
tolerance down so as you see that's

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:38.810 
tolerance down so as you see that's
going<00:05:31.560> a<00:05:31.710> little<00:05:31.740> bit<00:05:32.220> slower<00:05:32.810> so<00:05:36.380> that<00:05:37.820> will

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
going a little bit slower so that will

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.719 
going a little bit slower so that will
work<00:05:39.030> now<00:05:39.930> we<00:05:40.050> have<00:05:40.349> a<00:05:40.380> lava<00:05:40.710> cans<00:05:41.130> again<00:05:41.430> this

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
work now we have a lava cans again this

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.500 
work now we have a lava cans again this
is<00:05:41.910> using<00:05:42.120> forestry<00:05:42.780> cans<00:05:43.080> and<00:05:44.300> that's<00:05:45.300> going

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
is using forestry cans and that's going

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.330 
is using forestry cans and that's going
to<00:05:45.570> work<00:05:45.720> as<00:05:45.930> well<00:05:45.960> and<00:05:46.530> they<00:05:46.860> will<00:05:46.950> help<00:05:47.190> you

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
to work as well and they will help you

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.520 
to work as well and they will help you
adjust<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.880> temperature<00:05:48.180> tolerance<00:05:48.750> up<00:05:51.530> now

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
adjust the temperature tolerance up now

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.089 
adjust the temperature tolerance up now
we<00:05:52.590> have<00:05:53.539> lava<00:05:54.539> containers<00:05:55.260> again<00:05:55.380> as<00:05:55.620> I<00:05:55.710> craft

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
we have lava containers again as I craft

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:58.370 
we have lava containers again as I craft
and<00:05:56.789> again<00:05:57.300> not<00:05:57.630> going<00:05:57.750> to<00:05:57.870> work

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
and again not going to work

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.100 
and again not going to work
love<00:05:59.070> sell<00:05:59.990> dust<00:06:00.990> your<00:06:01.169> craft<00:06:01.440> not<00:06:02.070> gonna<00:06:02.250> work

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
love sell dust your craft not gonna work

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.040 
love sell dust your craft not gonna work
lava<00:06:04.110> capsule<00:06:04.710> for<00:06:05.010> forestry<00:06:05.460> will<00:06:06.000> work<00:06:06.270> so

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
lava capsule for forestry will work so

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.659 
lava capsule for forestry will work so
it<00:06:07.320> appears<00:06:07.710> to<00:06:07.889> only<00:06:08.070> be<00:06:08.310> working<00:06:08.490> with

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669 
it appears to only be working with

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:14.560 
it appears to only be working with
forestry<00:06:11.669> containers<00:06:12.539> at<00:06:12.990> the<00:06:13.199> moment

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
forestry containers at the moment

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.909 
forestry containers at the moment
whether<00:06:15.570> that<00:06:15.870> will<00:06:16.020> change<00:06:16.289> in<00:06:16.500> time<00:06:16.680> I<00:06:16.740> don't

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
whether that will change in time I don't

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.260 
whether that will change in time I don't
know<00:06:17.599> it<00:06:18.599> may<00:06:18.840> well<00:06:18.990> do<00:06:19.490> I<00:06:20.490> don't<00:06:20.970> think<00:06:21.150> you

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
know it may well do I don't think you

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.659 
know it may well do I don't think you
can<00:06:21.510> pump<00:06:21.750> it<00:06:21.930> in<00:06:22.080> there's<00:06:22.289> no<00:06:22.440> tank<00:06:22.800> in<00:06:23.160> this

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
can pump it in there's no tank in this

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.180 
can pump it in there's no tank in this
machine<00:06:24.349> so<00:06:25.349> you<00:06:25.380> wouldn't<00:06:25.680> be<00:06:25.770> able<00:06:25.830> to<00:06:25.979> pump

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
machine so you wouldn't be able to pump

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.689 
machine so you wouldn't be able to pump
pump<00:06:26.820> in<00:06:27.000> a<00:06:27.150> load<00:06:27.300> of<00:06:27.419> water<00:06:27.570> or<00:06:28.020> a<00:06:28.050> load<00:06:28.349> of

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:28.699 
pump in a load of water or a load of

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:35.029 
pump in a load of water or a load of
lava<00:06:30.889> it<00:06:31.889> will<00:06:32.039> also<00:06:32.160> take<00:06:32.520> ice<00:06:33.680> if<00:06:34.680> you<00:06:34.740> have

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 
lava it will also take ice if you have

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:38.540 
lava it will also take ice if you have
it<00:06:36.139> just<00:06:37.139> plain<00:06:37.410> old<00:06:37.620> ice<00:06:37.770> that<00:06:38.400> will

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
it just plain old ice that will

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.360 
it just plain old ice that will
obviously<00:06:39.050> help<00:06:40.050> you<00:06:40.440> adjust<00:06:41.070> the<00:06:41.190> tolerance

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
obviously help you adjust the tolerance

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.680 
obviously help you adjust the tolerance
down

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
down

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.719 
down
you<00:06:44.080> also<00:06:44.229> have<00:06:44.620> ice<00:06:44.889> cans<00:06:45.419> ice<00:06:46.419> capsules<00:06:47.729> of

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:48.729 
you also have ice cans ice capsules of

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:50.580 
you also have ice cans ice capsules of
both<00:06:49.030> types<00:06:49.330> none<00:06:49.990> of<00:06:50.110> those<00:06:50.229> are<00:06:50.409> going<00:06:50.500> to

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590 
both types none of those are going to

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.529 
both types none of those are going to
work<00:06:50.740> and<00:06:50.949> this<00:06:51.039> is<00:06:51.099> icy<00:06:51.580> water<00:06:51.819> and<00:06:52.240> I<00:06:52.300> think

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:52.539 
work and this is icy water and I think

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:55.409 
work and this is icy water and I think
you<00:06:52.599> get<00:06:52.750> the<00:06:52.780> icy<00:06:53.139> water<00:06:53.349> from<00:06:54.030> from<00:06:55.030> some<00:06:55.300> of

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:55.419 
you get the icy water from from some of

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:57.899 
you get the icy water from from some of
the<00:06:55.479> beasts<00:06:55.690> but<00:06:56.650> and<00:06:56.889> that<00:06:57.009> will<00:06:57.460> not<00:06:57.639> work

00:06:57.899 --> 00:06:57.909 
the beasts but and that will not work

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:01.550 
the beasts but and that will not work
so<00:06:58.509> they<00:06:58.629> won't<00:06:58.870> help<00:06:59.139> you<00:06:59.639> with<00:07:00.639> this<00:07:00.759> machine

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
so they won't help you with this machine
