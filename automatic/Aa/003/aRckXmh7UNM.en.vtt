00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
sounds like a guitar and I play most of

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.220 
sounds like a guitar and I play most of
the<00:02:25.880> leads<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.300> it's<00:02:26.540> not<00:02:26.660> like<00:02:26.810> having<00:02:26.990> two

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
the leads so it's not like having two

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.150 
the leads so it's not like having two
guitars<00:02:27.590> in<00:02:27.740> the<00:02:27.770> band

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
guitars in the band

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.760 
guitars in the band
okay<00:02:28.790> yeah<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.360> we<00:02:29.630> we<00:02:30.170> started<00:02:30.440> about<00:02:30.530> five

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
okay yeah and we we started about five

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.710 
okay yeah and we we started about five
months<00:02:31.070> ago<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:31.850> it's<00:02:32.000> pretty<00:02:32.180> more<00:02:32.420> awkward

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
months ago so it's pretty more awkward

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.870 
months ago so it's pretty more awkward
in<00:02:32.840> here<00:02:32.960> yeah<00:02:33.230> it's<00:02:33.560> amazing<00:02:33.800> yeah<00:02:34.280> do<00:02:34.790> you

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
find that there's a big difference

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.830 
find that there's a big difference
between<00:02:36.050> playing<00:02:37.040> something<00:02:37.970> extreme<00:02:38.510> like

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
between playing something extreme like

between playing something extreme like
metal<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.830> then<00:02:40.130> go<00:02:40.340> back<00:02:40.550> all<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:40.850> way

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
metal and then go back all the way

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.590 
metal and then go back all the way

like a you know a little miniskirt and
just<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.570> bra<00:03:19.750> like<00:03:20.140> sparkly<00:03:20.710> so<00:03:20.920> yeah<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:22.030> I

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
just a bra like sparkly so yeah and I

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.910 
just a bra like sparkly so yeah and I
think<00:03:22.540> sometimes<00:03:22.750> my<00:03:23.080> classical<00:03:23.500> patrons

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
think sometimes my classical patrons

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.530 
think sometimes my classical patrons
might<00:03:24.160> have<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.370> heart<00:03:24.580> attack<00:03:24.640> you<00:03:25.180> know<00:03:25.300> die

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
might have a heart attack you know die

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.670 
might have a heart attack you know die
if<00:03:25.780> they<00:03:25.930> see<00:03:25.990> me<00:03:26.350> yeah<00:03:26.530> yeah<00:03:27.510> it's<00:03:28.510> uh<00:03:28.930> it's

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
if they see me yeah yeah it's uh it's

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.900 
if they see me yeah yeah it's uh it's
very<00:03:29.770> different<00:03:30.160> but<00:03:30.370> it's<00:03:30.520> fun<00:03:30.730> and

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
very different but it's fun and

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.120 
very different but it's fun and
musically<00:03:31.510> though<00:03:31.690> I<00:03:31.720> think<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.530> classical

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
musically though I think that classical

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.710 
musically though I think that classical
music<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:34.210> metal<00:03:35.200> are<00:03:35.380> really<00:03:35.710> heavy<00:03:35.950> rock<00:03:36.280> is

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
music and metal are really heavy rock is

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.740 
music and metal are really heavy rock is
actually<00:03:37.720> very<00:03:38.200> similar<00:03:38.850> in<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:40.210> level<00:03:40.570> of

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
actually very similar in the level of

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.560 
actually very similar in the level of
depth<00:03:41.740> you<00:03:42.010> know<00:03:42.160> or<00:03:42.490> emotion<00:03:42.970> that<00:03:43.120> it<00:03:43.270> holds

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
depth you know or emotion that it holds

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.760 
depth you know or emotion that it holds
some<00:03:44.020> and<00:03:44.380> that<00:03:44.800> way<00:03:44.980> it's<00:03:45.160> very<00:03:45.430> similar<00:03:45.670> but

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
some and that way it's very similar but

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.340 
some and that way it's very similar but
yeah<00:03:47.770> it's<00:03:48.280> but<00:03:48.550> is<00:03:49.390> there<00:03:49.660> a<00:03:49.690> other<00:03:49.870> websites
