00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.450
 You 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:13.450
 Highest peak of it is today is that road method man cooking 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:20.200
 I would like a whole, I'd made ginger grilled I pig to challenge the Tamori flow recipe 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:23.300
 It's easy and delicious. It is boom rice and rice omelet rice to make this time . 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:27.080
 In addition, 3 different from the usual way of making 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.240
 This is not good in Thailand 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.350
 I would like to make it immediately 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:37.550
 Ingredients are annual mix vegetables 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:40.700
 Kecak Boo eggs After that I salt and pepper 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:46.280
 Let's go for dinner from the beginning 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:49.230
 Mixed vegetables that answered to the rice that it is up to all 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.180
 Ketchup salt 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.850
 Competition that would put Consumable 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.500
 Salt and pepper 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.500
 Stir this well 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:07.480
 I wonder how 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.480
 If you mix it like this, I will add eggs like this already 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:16.910
 Put the eggs 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.760
 If this is mixed well, eggs will be put in first 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.550
 Hey 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:27.370
 That's not peace of mind this 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:30.080
 Fry in olive oil After stirring until the eggs in it a something like Torottoro 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.370
 I will give up this 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.350
 The point is that not too stir-fry it 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.350
 I wonder if too little put olive oil 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.760
 Egg I do still feel of soft-boiled 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.760
 Let's make a shape of omrise 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.480
 It may be such a feeling 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:58.400
 OK 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:03.110
 Tamori style omelette rice is a fresh form 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:08.000
 This novelty of being in the middle of saying that the egg is not on 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:11.760
 I say Shokon ketchup that you will ne over ketchup and still 2 softening 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.390
 Omelet But Well I've got Ppoku 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.110

 Good indeed Hey, things like that 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:39.230
 Soft-boiled egg is simmering in a roll of bullets 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:40.250
 It's really serious, it's really sweet, it's sweet and it's so sweet it's great 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.950
 Yup 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:48.530
 No, eggs are included in Nakajima rice but white 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.590

 About four terms remains buried 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:08.380
 You know this, I guess that the content of the 5 drafts is a soft-boiled Toro Toro 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:12.400
 It is sweet from now on because still eggs of the state are included 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:19.030
 It is Tamori style Oyama and this can go 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:23.760
 It's a horse pattern and I like it originally is a spice-based sound entertainment but I 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:27.569

 Magic say whether the way I'm rowing in the mean is contained in this rice was 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.670
