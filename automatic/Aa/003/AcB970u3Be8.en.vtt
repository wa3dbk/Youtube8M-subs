00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.890 
it's worth it if they ran that through
the<00:02:28.470> process<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.310> they<00:02:29.459> should<00:02:29.730> like<00:02:30.450> with

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
the process that they should like with

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.600 
the process that they should like with
the<00:02:30.990> Machine<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:31.950> strained<00:02:32.310> out<00:02:32.459> the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
the Machine and like strained out the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.780 
the Machine and like strained out the
chips<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.090> whatnot<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:34.010> could<00:02:35.010> be<00:02:35.100> an<00:02:35.190> A+<00:02:35.430> I

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
chips and whatnot that could be an A+ I

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.480 
chips and whatnot that could be an A+ I
mean<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:37.440> he<00:02:37.620> takes<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.040> mountain<00:02:38.340> dew

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
mean that that he takes the mountain dew

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.010 
mean that that he takes the mountain dew
and<00:02:38.700> again<00:02:39.180> we<00:02:39.330> did<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.690> little<00:02:39.870> differently

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
and again we did it a little differently

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.320 
and again we did it a little differently
than<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:41.100> duo<00:02:41.280> gummy<00:02:41.730> we<00:02:41.850> made<00:02:42.000> we<00:02:42.150> went

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
than the the duo gummy we made we went

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.810 
than the the duo gummy we made we went
chip<00:02:42.540> heavy<00:02:42.750> for<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.440> for<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.280> gummy<00:02:44.459> itself

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
chip heavy for the for the gummy itself

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.420 
chip heavy for the for the gummy itself
but<00:02:45.060> for<00:02:45.209> this<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:46.020> flavors<00:02:46.410> perfect<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.130> bet

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
but for this that flavors perfect I bet

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.530 
but for this that flavors perfect I bet
this<00:02:47.580> would<00:02:47.670> taste<00:02:47.880> really<00:02:48.090> good<00:02:48.300> if<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.510> was

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
this would taste really good if it was

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.110 
this would taste really good if it was
like<00:02:48.660> half<00:02:48.870> frozen<00:02:49.230> oh<00:02:49.500> yeah<00:02:52.610> yeah<00:02:53.610> we<00:02:53.970> may
