00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.800
 to start 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.750
 here is fixed on start and there we go 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.850
 we said it remains cheaper than I 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.520
 will download the mandate firmware 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.559
 Vice therefore me it is an ipod touch 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.510
 I want to go under the ios 5 points 1 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.100
 point 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.799

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.580
 skip this step for download at 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.939
 prerequisite say before can download 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.299

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.759
 etc. 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.619
 so here I accelerated video the video 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.270
 the download is soon over 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.479
 I remind you that you must download 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.930
 the firmware tell me of the ios 5 points 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.610
 a point you have to leave 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.170
 know to do - otherwise we could not 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.420
 no nails ed me I have them 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.259

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.020
 those who would like to go under the ios 5 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.740
 point-to-point or 5.0.1 or five points or 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.810
 5.0 you need to have messages 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.439
 that you have back up before so 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.509
 here 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.829
 the download is completed put itself 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.079
 on the desktop so here we click on 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:57.299
 ok and here he will recognize my ipod 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.950
 touch I click on next 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:06.750
 and then we will click on ifat mode here 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.220
 where to click on ok we select the ssh of 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.209
 the ios that you want me was 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.410
 in these documents and settings 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.670
 ssh administrators 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.260
 you may be in another 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.900
 folder but that's it but I put them on 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.530
 my office so I get the file 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.440
 that's it on my desk it's the file 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.760
 ssh of my 5.1 points as it was 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.670
 marked on it so there we will click on 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.400
 bild ip sw 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.420
 we like to be on next and there you 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.640
 see a small loading bar 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.210
 just down that will fill up as and 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.340
 with the demos that go 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.160
 appear on the top during these 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.840
 two taffings must not be removed 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.220
 your ipod iphone or ipad 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.140
 unplug it from your computer so 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.570
 let him plug us touch anything 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.770
 it will be done alone 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.950
 here is crimes shy road is that 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:59.190
 where we serve you but between 5 and 10 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.420
 minutes may not be so fast 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.740
 with you but it's because I have 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.500
 accelerated the video so worry 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.770
 do not you always play pac man on the 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.270
 o play games and it's good we get tired 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.890
 quickly but well it makes time pass if 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.040
 do you want to play 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.860
 do as you want so that's it 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.390
 it's the process is running 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.900
 hadji dia so that's going to add directly 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.180
 cydia at your age city ie 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.890
 that it will be jay lighter directly finally 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.780
 I did it with you with me 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.480
 so maybe with you it will not be 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.290
 this is a new step to sexy dean 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.260
 kernel exploits mostly does not touch anything 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.670
 that's normal it's the process that's 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.860
 running the loading bar and has 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.160
 little by little in the middle 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.530
 here is the building at tfc so it's 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.910
 normal does not disturb your device 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:53.310
 rob bowling patching ib ib 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.510
 soon the end there we are at the three 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.750
 quarter of the loading bar 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.480
 so it's soon over if neither nor ps w 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.920
 is adding the signature of 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:08.340
 the sw sw sw to your ip sw sees the creatine 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.230
 guip swc creating another ip sw 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.540
 so its added value on your desk 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.650
 you end up with this ip sw 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.239
 surugue office it was psw signed by the 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:24.419
 signature of apple cousin save 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:26.880
 before so here it is giving psw a 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.990
 been saved was done 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.610
 so there you go and another one to 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.640
 waves are still pressing the button 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.280
 locking and pulling the barouge 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.470
 so there you go push the button 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.440
 home and power button at the same time 10 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:44.580
 seconds 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.290
 if to put in dfu mode with ireb if 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.330
 you put in dfu mode would go ben 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.510
 it will not work so here you are 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.860
 release the top button and you 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:05:01.920
 keep pressing the locked button 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:03.930
 as shown on the screen, this is it 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.880
 will stop here maybe it does not 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.310
 often in fact often it stops 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.210
 around 13 14 seconds 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.850
 so here it is because I have 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:20.190
 missed in actually put in dfu mode so 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:22.650
 that I 'm going to hand over after that here it goes 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.200
 put smokers detected good this is 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.610
 normal I redid the stage just after 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.290
 so you will not do that if you do 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.600
 correctly you can click on 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.310
 start 1 here itunes it's dictation in one 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.780
 ipad in recovery mode or click 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.790
 ok there you are the one to press on 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.120
 keys up our keyboard then get 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.980
 restore with the left click and there you 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.720
 has sectioned the ip sw that this number is 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.920
 sacred and so he is on the desk 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.290
 as I told you earlier 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.810
 this is the longest as many 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:52.790
 ipod touch restores express w here and 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.790
 there is software extraction 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.590
 as you can see right here 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.100
 itunes ma 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.810
 the ipod so its charge especially do not touch 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.170
 nothing to unplug him especially not 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:23.540
 the ipod as long as it is still 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.510
 not restored sees the preparation of 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.440
 ipod software for restoration 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.510
 verification of the restoration of a 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.060
 ipod ipod software restore 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.940
 so here you do not worry 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.530
 works perfectly 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.680
 especially do not touch anything i'm going 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.570
 speed up a little video there that you do not 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.770
 may not have this step 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.480
 so I had them I do not know 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.920
 why normally we have it at all 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.450
 beginning but I had in the middle I 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.280
 do not know why so especially do not 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.660
 touch anything here I accelerated the 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.500
 video as you can see my ipod 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:57.230
 has been restored under two under the ios 5 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.340
 up to ios 5 points 1 point like 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.260
 you can see right here 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.430
 so I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.030
 and we'll see each other soon for a 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.660
 new video 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.660
 Hi
