 [Music] 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.970
 soon tired blow of a blow I 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.170
 think I'm going to take a nap 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.719
 me who thought that my stew 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.490
 will give you lots of energy and that does not matter 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.260
 nothing rests on you if you're tired I can 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.150
 even sing you a lullaby if you want 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.410
 and no need for a lullaby thanks to 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.150
 young and what do I deserve after 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.210
 all that will teach me to make secrets 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.740
 I do not understand what you're saying 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.050

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.570
 that she throw you on everything and lightning 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.000
 it's because of my ultra buffon site 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.710
 [Music] 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:46.890

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:48.510
 let's see I was cinema proved 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.550
 that it will not be turned into a bubble 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.079
 she has matured so much 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.460
 time she knows too well what she 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.850
 exposes himself by opening his heart to 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.079
 chuck hope why is this 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.670
 that you stop a man 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.019
 look at it there what is a how 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.360
 I did not think about it earlier 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.190
 the princes and mermaids mocks arias hold 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.899
 as soon as they sing their melodies 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.360
 I'm going to music enough 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.940

 jÃ©go for paris 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.430
 the problem is that the connections 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.930
 it's the horror I would never have 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.120
 would be curious to know what she's going 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.590
 me gans know erin I bet 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.570
 that she still seeks a little tender a 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.960
 trap in this case we will not let ourselves 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.520
 make 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.670
 if we hear rings too

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.960
 I hope for you that your trap is at 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.539
 point because we are ready 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.550

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.170
 what are you waiting for is not the 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.830
 first time we kiss if not 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.720
 of course 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.580

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.680
 it's you who stole my everything 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.870

 goal of these is not important to me 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.880
 is that I let my words speak
