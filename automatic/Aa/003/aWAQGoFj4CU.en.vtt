major difference between there's

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.970 
major difference between there's
actually<00:00:14.250> really<00:00:14.969> looking<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.289> best<00:00:16.800> of

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
actually really looking to the best of

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.410 
actually really looking to the best of
my<00:00:17.039> knowledge<00:00:17.130> there's<00:00:17.550> only<00:00:17.670> one<00:00:17.970> major

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
my knowledge there's only one major

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.529 
my knowledge there's only one major
difference<00:00:18.960> between<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.590> Japanese<00:00:20.100> RPG<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:21.150> a

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
difference between a Japanese RPG and a

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.500 
difference between a Japanese RPG and a
Western<00:00:21.960> RPG<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:23.250> difference<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.880> random

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
Western RPG and the difference is random

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:36.229 
Western RPG and the difference is random
battles<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:26.630> I<00:00:34.370> do<00:00:35.370> think<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:35.880> should<00:00:35.910> pull

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
battles and I do think we should pull

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.630 
battles and I do think we should pull
away<00:00:36.360> from<00:00:36.480> random<00:00:37.050> battles<00:00:37.440> but<00:00:38.010> there

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
away from random battles but there

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.360 
away from random battles but there
should<00:00:38.969> be<00:00:39.149> response<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:40.020> don't<00:00:40.800> really<00:00:41.040> think

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
should be response I don't really think

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.790 
should be response I don't really think
an<00:00:41.610> RPG<00:00:42.120> can<00:00:42.390> be<00:00:42.480> considered<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.960> true<00:00:43.410> full<00:00:44.450> RPG

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
an RPG can be considered a true full RPG

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.529 
an RPG can be considered a true full RPG
unless<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.950> has<00:00:47.100> responds<00:00:47.670> because<00:00:47.969> responds

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
unless it has responds because responds

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.420 
unless it has responds because responds
give<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> option<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.469> repeating<00:00:50.070> an<00:00:50.160> area

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
give the option of repeating an area

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.250 
give the option of repeating an area
getting<00:00:51.090> more<00:00:51.270> powerful<00:00:51.480> getting<00:00:51.870> more<00:00:52.050> gear

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
getting more powerful getting more gear

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.500 
getting more powerful getting more gear
and<00:00:52.640> being<00:00:53.640> more<00:00:53.879> prepared<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.960> head<00:00:55.559> into<00:00:56.510> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
and being more prepared to head into the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.720 
and being more prepared to head into the
next<00:00:57.809> area<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.590> i<00:00:58.770> think<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.280> next<00:00:59.520> area

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
next area and i think that the next area

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.939 
next area and i think that the next area
should<00:00:59.850> be<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.210> challenging<00:01:00.300> enough<00:01:00.989> to

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
should be just challenging enough to

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.840 
should be just challenging enough to
kind<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.489> give<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.570> incentive<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.949> kill

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
kind of give you the incentive to kill

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.969 
kind of give you the incentive to kill
up<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.060> few<00:01:06.240> responds<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.049> then<00:01:07.439> go<00:01:07.650> into<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
up a few responds and then go into the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.830 
up a few responds and then go into the
area<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.340> you'll<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.790> ok<00:01:09.390> now<00:01:09.630> i<00:01:09.659> think

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
went there twice um by the end of the

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.280 
went there twice um by the end of the
second<00:02:28.430> time<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:29.000> realized<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:29.780> was<00:02:29.870> just<00:02:30.170> a

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
second time I realized it was just a

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.460 
second time I realized it was just a
basic<00:02:31.480> basically<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.570> was<00:02:32.630> just<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.960> game<00:02:33.170> all

it<00:02:54.560> just<00:02:54.620> became<00:02:55.070> a<00:02:55.130> knowledge<00:02:55.550> fast<00:02:55.820> it's

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
it just became a knowledge fast it's

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.090 
it just became a knowledge fast it's
like<00:02:56.330> if<00:02:56.660> just<00:02:57.200> imagine<00:02:57.320> if<00:02:57.590> there<00:02:57.710> was<00:02:57.800> a<00:02:57.830> star

a<00:03:29.470> flux<00:03:30.470> capacitor<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:32.060> like<00:03:32.300> oh<00:03:32.450> it's<00:03:32.930> a

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
a flux capacitor and like oh it's a

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.100 
a flux capacitor and like oh it's a
great<00:03:33.380> idea<00:03:35.410> it's<00:03:36.410> just<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:37.370> yes<00:03:37.640> that's<00:03:37.880> a

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
great idea it's just and yes that's a

Back<00:03:39.110> to<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.290> Future<00:03:39.380> thing<00:03:39.830> I<00:03:40.250> think<00:03:40.519> I<00:03:40.640> think

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
Back to the Future thing I think I think

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.070 
Back to the Future thing I think I think
that's<00:03:40.970> where<00:03:41.120> that's<00:03:41.180> from<00:03:41.350> um<00:03:42.350> a<00:03:43.840> tech<00:03:44.840> talk

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
that's where that's from um a tech talk

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.990 
that's where that's from um a tech talk
all<00:03:45.290> that<00:03:45.500> so<00:03:45.830> it's<00:03:46.489> just<00:03:46.730> know<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:48.320> I<00:03:48.910> mean<00:03:49.910> if

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
all that so it's just know it I mean if

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.479 
all that so it's just know it I mean if
you<00:03:50.090> really<00:03:50.120> like<00:03:50.959> showing<00:03:51.410> off<00:03:51.590> knowledge<00:03:52.250> on

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
you really like showing off knowledge on

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.690 
you really like showing off knowledge on
some<00:03:52.880> sort<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.300> field<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:55.160> think<00:03:55.340> tabletop

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
some sort of field and I think tabletop

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.040 
some sort of field and I think tabletop
games<00:03:55.910> are<00:03:56.090> for<00:03:56.209> you<00:03:56.360> but<00:03:56.630> since<00:03:56.810> there's

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
games are for you but since there's

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.530 
games are for you but since there's
there's<00:03:57.470> no<00:03:57.620> aspect<00:03:58.070> of<00:03:58.250> skill<00:03:58.970> and<00:03:59.300> there's

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
there's no aspect of skill and there's

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.870 
there's no aspect of skill and there's
kind<00:04:00.290> of<00:04:00.410> actually<00:04:00.769> not<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.130> much<00:04:01.190> aspect<00:04:01.760> of

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
kind of actually not so much aspect of

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.210 
kind of actually not so much aspect of
luck<00:04:02.120> then<00:04:02.840> they<00:04:02.989> do<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.769> rolling<00:04:04.100> of<00:04:04.160> the

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
luck then they do the rolling of the

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.420 
luck then they do the rolling of the
dice<00:04:04.310> every<00:04:04.610> once<00:04:04.850> a<00:04:04.970> while<00:04:05.000> but<00:04:05.300> doesn't<00:04:06.140> make

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
dice every once a while but doesn't make

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.380 
dice every once a while but doesn't make
doesn't<00:04:07.430> make<00:04:07.519> a<00:04:07.550> big<00:04:07.790> difference<00:04:08.000> because

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
doesn't make a big difference because

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.390 
doesn't make a big difference because
usually<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:09.110> gym<00:04:09.290> gets<00:04:09.620> with<00:04:09.800> the<00:04:09.890> GM<00:04:10.130> won't

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
usually the gym gets with the GM won't

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.309 
usually the gym gets with the GM won't
sigh<00:04:10.640> mean<00:04:10.820> of<00:04:10.910> course<00:04:11.060> it<00:04:11.269> matter<00:04:11.810> GM's<00:04:12.170> for

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
sigh mean of course it matter GM's for

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.040 
sigh mean of course it matter GM's for
worse<00:04:12.470> jams<00:04:12.770> but<00:04:13.490> um<00:04:14.110> when<00:04:15.220> you

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
preferences let's just put it that way

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.170 
preferences let's just put it that way
but<00:05:47.990> there<00:05:48.170> are<00:05:48.260> certain<00:05:48.560> games<00:05:48.800> where<00:05:49.220> one

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
but there are certain games where one

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.850

another person has very valid reasons

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.150 
another person has very valid reasons
why<00:05:53.540> they<00:05:53.750> don't<00:05:54.050> but<00:05:54.380> they<00:05:54.440> like<00:05:54.680> a<00:05:54.710> different

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
why they don't but they like a different

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.620 
why they don't but they like a different
game<00:05:55.340> um<00:05:56.290> that<00:05:57.290> that<00:05:57.740> happens<00:05:58.180> half<00:05:59.180> is<00:05:59.330> all<00:05:59.480> I

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
game um that that happens half is all I

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.240 
game um that that happens half is all I
mean<00:05:59.780> and<00:06:00.020> that<00:06:00.260> happens<00:06:00.440> for<00:06:00.650> legitimate

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
mean and that happens for legitimate

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.390 
mean and that happens for legitimate
reasons<00:06:01.280> half<00:06:01.850> as<00:06:02.000> often<00:06:02.180> as<00:06:02.480> it<00:06:02.630> happens<00:06:03.400> so

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
reasons half as often as it happens so

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.490 
reasons half as often as it happens so
it<00:06:04.760> is<00:06:04.970> a<00:06:05.000> real<00:06:05.390> thing<00:06:05.660> I<00:06:05.840> don't<00:06:06.020> hopefully

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
it is a real thing I don't hopefully

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.710 
it is a real thing I don't hopefully
that<00:06:06.620> made<00:06:06.800> some<00:06:06.950> sense<00:06:07.120> but<00:06:08.120> basically<00:06:08.510> how

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
that made some sense but basically how

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.740 
that made some sense but basically how

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
to write a video review is compare it to

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.710 
to write a video review is compare it to

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
other games um that is really the best

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.990 
other games um that is really the best
way<00:06:15.670> because<00:06:16.670> your<00:06:17.000> goal<00:06:17.210> is<00:06:17.480> to<00:06:17.510> tell<00:06:17.990> them
