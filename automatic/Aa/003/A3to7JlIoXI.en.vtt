00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
 the 

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.950
 the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.059
 monkey 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.059
 Hey 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.230
 people who have been with each other for a while 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.010
 the employee 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.279
 they have been wondering for some time 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.279
 he remains the five-legged sheep 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.480
 a sheep with five legs means such a device was there both before the car was 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.939
 found bicycles if the engine can be used with the long AKU service life 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.160
 easy to read screens world of possibilities 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.890
 then now a sheep with five legs loses the successor of which is now in the room 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.460
 montana montanes 6 because she writes that they are opposed 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.640
 and there we go in this video what after watching it is still free 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.980
 superficial we just have a device may still have a job in the device 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.900
 will be drawn up in mid-June 2011 and then we will elaborate on that 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.770
 but is the first to see that I hope the device 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.540
 more fun than the countless ones 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.280
 and the large compared to the third with the smaller the author and also in 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.600
 comparison with the order comes you see that quite a big boy is 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.410
 put the right and the gps with 62 next to anp on the road actually again 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.070
 proven with it 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.260
 I'll be next 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:34.040
 and then you will see that the device 62 is actually around 600 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.600
 pixels montana 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.850
 every time went from mouth to mouth 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.830
 there i have much larger so say the width of montana screen is or there 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.290
 rarely if we are aware of the trip with 62 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.390
 is therefore important 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.630
 the screens have feasibility states about both on up to him is at the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.970
 montana also according to 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.560
 he mentioned the thickness of devices more similarly than it appears that montana I am comfortable with 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.420
 but it doesn't matter as much as it will put in particular and the weight 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.520
 Comparing with the 60 ton they may be the differences are much smaller and 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.019
 there too, at most, the thickness that is larger is 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:18.349
 go outside and that is of course the important one 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.999
 readability in sunlight then you can also see there between these outdoor devices 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:25.979
 the relative little difference 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:31.319
 excellent legibility good legibility excellent legibility although we know 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.399
 that after 62 minutes once the all is the best of all old village appliances 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:40.509
 montana is not even that good, but it is also quite significant in the 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:44.119
 direction and although that is hard to see the video is really better 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:45.300
 readable 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.689
 save as the cordon 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:51.750
 even if you look at this picture you will see that the contrast is very high 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:55.499
 and even in the so-called hoover shadow situation 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:59.620
 which they screen quite shiny and you see, for example, the clouds above you 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.809
 clearly reflected on the screen 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:06.760
 room still comes with a specially intended for oil remedy reflection 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:08.339
 can reduce 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:11.339
 to understand it already or read montana 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:15.370
 then we compare with 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.349
 also now the jungle because expect from montana definitely a place at the 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.390
 motorcycle rider to find holes then you clearly see the montana 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.870
 much better if they are sixty 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.780
 which wasn't bad either, but if you look at it this way, then I see 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.749
 little contrast they have mole and much contrast both montana 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:39.389
 and also if I briefly hold the hand in the air you see from a distance 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.299
 that it is also much larger in viewing angle and that also applies when you enter the dishes 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.169
 looks 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:48.379
 will certainly be an important fact and certainly also for the motorcyclist and the 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.600
 reason for the criterion 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.979
 especially if you drive without sound 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:57.839
 all in all a derijck of a device the assembly also in a literal sense because 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:00.000
 he is then must be honest about it 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.319
 can do Volkskrant 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.229
 It's a smart device among other things that you can see back to the fact that 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:07.749
 was a battery in can 

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:11.019
 as the three per slate batteries instead 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.929
 but especially from the bottom in the back is off the screen 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:20.419
 dio dome screen at least for outdoor device that is also extremely good 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:21.659
 readable 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:25.669
 we sometimes get the question where would follow up on the 72 we issue 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.060
 said it to you though we think you have seen this as the successor to 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:33.939
 yes a bit bigger than the coast it is 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.710
 or liveability in sunlight that they have just seen 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.710
 there are very impressed 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:44.060
 one for last will mainly use as 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.070
 there is especially walking 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.419
 it might be a bit on the hefty side 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.050
 however, you want to buy mia s for a combination of application that is it 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.699
 again interesting and in particular could also counts because that as the only car device 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.750
 Also gives voice prompts that makes him suitable 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.420
 for in the car in the jeep for big driving for use on the motorcycle for the 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.600
 giro persie for walking for cyclists on the boat of the plane 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.620
 the sheep with five legs maybe six or seven 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.770
 9 The comments are also there 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.330
 we have really looked at the functionality over some 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.930
 seen options that we did not know before 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.720
 the other old by devices 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.789
 more on that later 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:30.119
 heat but that also has its limitations, in particular from a motorcyclist 

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:31.610
 there is tons to realize 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.430
 a 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.530
 if you make a route in the b stamp, the match sometimes has an overview of your own 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.449
 device 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:40.190
 then per device like many one is now 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.600
 that route always in the device 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.539
 I have to count 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:48.219
 intimates know what that means and that it is somewhat disadvantaged 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.370
 he gets with the engine 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.639
 then that is a disadvantage 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:53.460
 harvested less in the world 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.780
 And indeed it buys a point to be able to turn off the automatic 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.750
 calculate the pilot 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.169
 it knows the montana 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.949
 as well as the other car devices 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:06.539
 He makes a lot of difference to people because that route actually becomes whole 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.099
 calculating device they always on the road calculating the route 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:12.710
 be the same as that 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.360
 though he calculated route in the device itself complicated story not so 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.360
 important 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.469
 Ultimately, paying is our first ever impression 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.100
 very customers even a device 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.230
 and in any case, I think that it will soon be my zoom 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.740
 already 55 points richer at least on the engine replaced by the montana and 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.480
 the next day they want to jeroen with the children with the montana for the first time 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.809
 persie 

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:43.459
 thanks for sweeping attention and as soon as we know more and more recordings 

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:45.169
 and have done more tests 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:46.589
 let's approach
