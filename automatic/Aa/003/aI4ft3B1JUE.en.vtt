00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 hello greetings to all who see this video on this table we see two groups of 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.440
 letters the group of the black red letters month 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:12.550
 clearly the four red cards also I do not care if they think there are 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.479
 more letters because it's not 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:16.029
 you yourselves are 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.589
 the four letters or 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.629
 then went on to show them the four black cards so that they are 

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:23.679
 insurance 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.550
 we put together the four letters 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.289
 as if we open a fan 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.130
 the dye that the red cards that are on the table can be placed between the 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:34.550
 blacks that are in my hand 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.860
 look what I do so they do not think I cheat 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.360
 together the letters as you can see that they are interspersed 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.730
 we make the magical pass and they will realize that it would be stupid 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.980
 ovaciÃ³n we separated the first four letters of the following 4 mar 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.980
 we will see below the four 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.100
 and four black cards and we put them on the table I hope they do not say what 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.980
 pussies 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.400
 because I do not know we'll see the other four letters and we'll see that they're all 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.810
 red 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.590
 so that they do not remain with the doubt of what I did 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.120
 can do it again 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.120
 but this time with the red cards in my hand 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.710
 and we put the cards on the table 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.990
 the red one and another black one 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.140
 that look good 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.640
 that love letters 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.910
 we return the letters 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.830
 nor to notice that I'm placing 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.830
 the black letters 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.789
 this time we put together the letters seeing them and make sure that if they are well 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.450
 I think I'm doing 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.200
 lampa we take the letters and separate again 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.610
 the four letters that are above that the four that are annual 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.490
 we see that the letters are separated one 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.520
 it's called water and doing it 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.639
 pique I have nothing but the eight letters of a good start I hope you leave your 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:12.769
