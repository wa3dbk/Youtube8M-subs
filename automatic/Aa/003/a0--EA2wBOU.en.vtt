00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
everyone else's fractions you go F list

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.499 
everyone else's fractions you go F list
its<00:01:51.450> usual<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> fractions<00:01:52.439> are<00:01:52.560> online<00:01:53.509> you

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
its usual the fractions are online you

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.109 
its usual the fractions are online you
can<00:01:54.689> also<00:01:54.930> do<00:01:56.360> let<00:01:57.360> me<00:01:57.390> think<00:01:57.860> f2<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.850> look<00:02:00.000> at

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
can also do let me think f2 to look at

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.289 
can also do let me think f2 to look at
your<00:02:00.270> fraction<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.369> whoops<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.180> see

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
your fraction so whoops as you can see

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.600 
your fraction so whoops as you can see
it<00:02:03.390> says<00:02:03.540> land<00:02:03.810> power<00:02:04.200> max<00:02:04.500> power<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.100> I've<00:02:05.340> got

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
it says land power max power so I've got

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.520 
it says land power max power so I've got
no<00:02:06.000> land<00:02:06.299> because<00:02:06.750> I've<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:07.020> created<00:02:07.200> it

no land because I've just created it

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.139 
no land because I've just created it
powers<00:02:07.920> minus<00:02:08.340> five<00:02:08.550> because<00:02:08.819> I've<00:02:08.940> died

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.030 
loads of times and max power I can have
at<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.310> moment<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.879> 10<00:02:12.480> because

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
at the moment is 10 because
