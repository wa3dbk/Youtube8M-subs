00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
because these things often beginners

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.670 
because these things often beginners
make<00:02:06.270> mistakes<00:02:06.720> it's<00:02:06.960> not<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.320> much<00:02:07.500> about

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
make mistakes it's not so much about

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
engine then they make mistakes so so

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.480 
engine then they make mistakes so so

actually just then I pulled the pull
start<00:02:28.049> just<00:02:28.379> uh<00:02:28.590> something<00:02:29.159> I<00:02:29.400> always<00:02:29.609> just

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
start just uh something I always just

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:31.729 
start just uh something I always just
have<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:30.749> do<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.109> know<00:02:31.230> it's<00:02:31.409> one<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.650> those

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.670 
have to do you know it's one of those
things<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:33.060> thought<00:02:33.719> hey<00:02:34.079> that's<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.499> bit

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
things and I thought hey that's a bit

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.589 
things and I thought hey that's a bit
loose<00:02:34.859> then<00:02:35.159> I<00:02:35.189> realized<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.819> obviously<00:02:36.299> as

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
loose then I realized that obviously as

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.140 
loose then I realized that obviously as
man<00:02:37.290> don't<00:02:37.560> include<00:02:37.920> glow<00:02:38.459> plugs<00:02:38.760> with<00:02:38.969> this

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
man don't include glow plugs with this

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.789 
man don't include glow plugs with this
so<00:02:39.389> you've<00:02:39.540> got<00:02:39.689> to<00:02:39.810> purchase<00:02:40.230> your<00:02:40.349> own<00:02:40.409> glow

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
so you've got to purchase your own glow

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.670 
so you've got to purchase your own glow
plug<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.670> go<00:02:41.819> into<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.180> engine<00:02:42.569> they<00:02:42.750> send

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
plug so go into the engine they send

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.089 
plug so go into the engine they send
engines<00:02:44.099> out<00:02:44.400> without<00:02:45.359> glow<00:02:45.930> plugs<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.530> so

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
engines out without glow plugs and so

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.449 
engines out without glow plugs and so
you've<00:02:47.250> got<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.459> provide<00:02:47.639> one<00:02:48.030> yourself<00:02:49.459> okay

this one is doing so this is our water
proof<00:04:10.280> receiver<00:04:11.280> box<00:04:11.459> you<00:04:11.909> can<00:04:12.060> set<00:04:12.409> sitting

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
proof receiver box you can set sitting

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.129 
proof receiver box you can set sitting
there<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:14.009> on/off<00:04:14.370> switch<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:15.000> 2.4<00:04:15.599> g<00:04:15.780> radio

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
there the on/off switch and 2.4 g radio

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.310 
there the on/off switch and 2.4 g radio
antenna<00:04:16.829> sitting<00:04:17.280> there<00:04:18.469> here<00:04:19.469> we've<00:04:19.680> got

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
antenna sitting there here we've got

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.649 
antenna sitting there here we've got
sweet<00:04:22.320> steering<00:04:23.280> servo<00:04:23.639> not<00:04:24.210> sure<00:04:24.419> if<00:04:24.539> it's

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
sweet steering servo not sure if it's

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.529 
sweet steering servo not sure if it's
metal<00:04:24.840> geared<00:04:25.199> but<00:04:25.590> hopefully<00:04:26.099> it<00:04:26.190> is<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.699> of

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
metal geared but hopefully it is and of

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:28.550 
metal geared but hopefully it is and of
course

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
course

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.770 
course
stay<00:04:28.860> with<00:04:29.040> servo<00:04:29.370> right<00:04:30.060> so<00:04:30.360> I<00:04:30.389> think<00:04:30.480> really

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
stay with servo right so I think really

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.930 
stay with servo right so I think really
that<00:04:31.050> is<00:04:31.200> all<00:04:31.650> what<00:04:32.160> I'm<00:04:32.280> gonna<00:04:32.400> do<00:04:32.580> is<00:04:32.700> put<00:04:32.880> the

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
that is all what I'm gonna do is put the

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.490 
that is all what I'm gonna do is put the
shell<00:04:33.150> on<00:04:33.330> and<00:04:33.480> we'll<00:04:33.570> just<00:04:33.750> take<00:04:33.990> quick<00:04:34.350> look
