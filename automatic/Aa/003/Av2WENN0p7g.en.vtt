00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.689
 the cursor itself le bourget represents 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.490
 a lake of glacial origin which 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.810
 are among the mountains 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.960
 about depth there is 170 150 maximum there is 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.180
 places where from the coast 50 meters depth 50 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.220
 meters if of course we had small 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.989
 three meters there are 2 of them very little everything 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:50.559
 the lake has a relief which is from the center to 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:53.410
 the coast goes aground here present 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:56.320
 in plenty of kerch like his 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.270
 call everyone here not otherwise on a plate 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:04.479
 perch very small very large 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:06.520
 the amount of pike and allegedly zander which 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.070
 declared by the organizers but none 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.000
 they are caught in training not in the Dima tour 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.830
 literally a few words about what 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.950
 bait caught what montage 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.460
 used what turned out to be more 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.459
 effective today 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.280
 used silicone bait on 

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:29.470
 axes and defined training that 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.750
 necessarily need abdominal tee because 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.450
 that a lot of empty bites that is 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.640
 pike attacks from below and bites enough 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.160
 gently and gently that is necessarily 23 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.929
 Nick about lures can say that 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.149
 worked very well 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.700
 silicone lures provided 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.649
 farms secu and fish in stock 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.380
 in training we determined which 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.520
 lures work best and 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.619
 turned to those companies that 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.239
 represent these trading firms they are us 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.020
 gladly met for what he 

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:58.270
 thank you very much 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.020
 de monaco from predator number three is yours 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.690
 loved well here he is not favore here 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.090
 the main secret of this reservoir is how we 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.750
 identified by the results of 6 of our 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.239
 workouts 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.080
 was that the pike is here 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.670
 thicker than water 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.370
 caught basically all as it were 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.190
 uniform wiring ie cast 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.780
 we put on the bottom and then goes uniform 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.450
 slow wiring ie lure 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.940
 slowly comes off one and soars 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.390
 horizon 45 meters we 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.400
 experimented on training 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.819
 for training soon carbon and in 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.590
 In principle, we have concluded that this is not 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.170
 a very significant factor in catching 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.580
 today everything is on a metal leash 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.930
 Specific us us us now from 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.020
 metal leash stood 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:49.370
 half-meter stretch the rest acquired 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:58.690
 for personally always what multiple akif 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:03:01.450
 a pioneer, how about you? 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.010
 set up so that they win 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.830
 today's modules for the planned three days and 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.080
 all three different today are disappointing 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.610
 impressions are very we caught at 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.780
 least very bad but at the same time others 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.209
 for example Ukraine 5 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:23.269
 I have the protocols of the first day 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:25.040
 which for us came out a good reservoir like 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.100
 I said it is very difficult to confirm 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.730
 14 zeros that is almost half 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.230
 boat failed to catch defensive fish 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.720
 when I received the information for a half 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.110
 hours from our crews that we have three one 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.410
 fish honestly I thought it was 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.540
 failure but when met on the ground on 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.590
 Pierce learned the news I realized that the principle 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.630
 this is a good result 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.590
 our crew are our basket leaders 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.890
 miller with five fish takes second 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.650
 unexpectedly the Germans managed to throw their place 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.380
 championship debutants with three pike minutes 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:04.220
 lives that were bonus following 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:07.450
 they are the French four hands and 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.790
 one and two two therefore of course 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.400
 This is a good result. Those who look into 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.680
 Internet protocols should not be afraid 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.720
 that is, the organizer encountered an error and 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.880
 need to swap the crew and basket 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.320
 miller brought 5 fish they are in second place 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.880
 and Demenko beauty with two 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:29.410
 at 8 well I so the French turned out 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.630
 athletes and bass for centuries guys very 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:36.289
 literate focused and it is clear that 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.920
 athletes first about one and a half 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.500
 almost two hours 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.520
 they did not have the fish and felt 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.840
 big were unnerving and but then somewhere on 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.510
 4 points 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.500
 was caught pike was 1 next 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.490
 seventy seven centimeters 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.890
 yes well done strength and he took and literally 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.630
 next pike last was taken 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:10.080
 literally in the last minutes 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:14.600
 only 4 went to say the national team of Latvia are big 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.600
 wrote guy 52 records
