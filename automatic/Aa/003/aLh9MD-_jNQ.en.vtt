Baywatch<00:03:29.010> with<00:03:29.280> swords<00:03:29.609> so<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:30.840> decided<00:03:31.680> that

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
Baywatch with swords so I decided that

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.180 
Baywatch with swords so I decided that
we<00:03:32.220> would<00:03:32.400> go<00:03:32.639> see<00:03:33.209> something<00:03:33.569> else<00:03:33.810> um<00:03:34.500> that

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
we would go see something else um that

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.440 
we would go see something else um that

has been your wrist now because Zack

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.170

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
strong I'm just hoping that the script

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.900 
strong I'm just hoping that the script
is<00:03:45.450> so<00:03:45.690> good<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.019> you<00:03:46.680> can't<00:03:46.709> really<00:03:47.099> screw

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910

supporting<00:04:19.930> this<00:04:20.020> guy<00:04:20.200> who<00:04:20.260> yes<00:04:20.739> he's<00:04:20.920> in<00:04:21.070> the

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
supporting this guy who yes he's in the

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.790 
supporting this guy who yes he's in the
tutors<00:04:21.459> and<00:04:21.640> if<00:04:21.730> you<00:04:21.850> were<00:04:21.910> a<00:04:22.320> few<00:04:23.320> few<00:04:23.620> other

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
tutors and if you were a few few other

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.130 
tutors and if you were a few few other
films<00:04:24.160> but<00:04:24.430> for<00:04:24.730> the<00:04:24.820> most<00:04:25.030> part<00:04:25.180> he<00:04:25.690> isn't<00:04:26.110> a

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
films but for the most part he isn't a

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.170 
films but for the most part he isn't a
household<00:04:26.560> name<00:04:26.680> at<00:04:27.040> all<00:04:27.160> so<00:04:27.670> I<00:04:27.700> think<00:04:27.820> this

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
household name at all so I think this

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.750 
household name at all so I think this
movie<00:04:28.540> yes<00:04:29.230> Superman<00:04:29.800> was<00:04:30.160> going<00:04:30.280> to<00:04:30.340> make<00:04:30.520> him

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
movie yes Superman was going to make him

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.700 
movie yes Superman was going to make him
a<00:04:30.970> household<00:04:31.480> name<00:04:31.600> but<00:04:31.930> it<00:04:32.020> didn't<00:04:32.200> really<00:04:32.350> do

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
a household name but it didn't really do

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.260 
a household name but it didn't really do
much<00:04:32.920> for<00:04:33.130> Brandon<00:04:33.400> Ralph<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:36.270> maybe

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
much for Brandon Ralph and and maybe

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.020 
much for Brandon Ralph and and maybe
that's<00:04:37.570> because<00:04:38.100> he<00:04:39.100> didn't<00:04:39.340> have<00:04:39.400> quite<00:04:39.970> the

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
that's because he didn't have quite the

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.090 
that's because he didn't have quite the
supporting<00:04:40.780> cast<00:04:40.960> that<00:04:41.440> it<00:04:41.710> sounds<00:04:42.010> like

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
supporting cast that it sounds like

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.640 
supporting cast that it sounds like
Henry<00:04:42.400> Cavill<00:04:42.790> cavil<00:04:43.210> will<00:04:43.540> have<00:04:43.840> in<00:04:44.200> this

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
Henry Cavill cavil will have in this

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.890 
Henry Cavill cavil will have in this
movie<00:04:45.040> so<00:04:45.370> super<00:04:45.880> excited<00:04:45.970> for<00:04:46.300> that<00:04:46.540> I'm

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
thought-provoking question here and why

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.460 
thought-provoking question here and why
is<00:04:51.580> it<00:04:51.970> that<00:04:52.000> in<00:04:52.150> the<00:04:52.240> mid-90s<00:04:52.960> like<00:04:53.140> they'll

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
is it that in the mid-90s like they'll

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.320 
is it that in the mid-90s like they'll
turn<00:04:53.680> in<00:04:53.860> rock<00:04:54.160> scene<00:04:54.460> there<00:04:54.640> was<00:04:54.730> never<00:04:55.030> a

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
turn in rock scene there was never a

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.510 
turn in rock scene there was never a
song<00:04:55.600> about<00:04:55.870> Lois<00:04:56.410> Lane<00:04:56.590> doesn't<00:04:56.920> make

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
song about Lois Lane doesn't make

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.310 
song about Lois Lane doesn't make
perfect<00:04:57.760> sense<00:04:58.240> that<00:04:58.510> there<00:04:58.660> should<00:04:58.840> be<00:04:59.020> like

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
perfect sense that there should be like

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.400 
perfect sense that there should be like
a<00:04:59.350> song<00:05:00.010> called<00:05:00.430> you<00:05:00.850> are<00:05:01.090> my<00:05:01.330> Lois<00:05:01.750> Lane<00:05:02.050> right
