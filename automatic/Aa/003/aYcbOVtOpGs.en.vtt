 played in 30 minutes the following topics 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.370
 on the one hand a Vockel de RL the wolves 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.370
 while most 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.209
 Hans Baldi 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.209
 there is in the second Bundesliga against TSG Friesenheim 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.250
 she has to be out of the Verbandsliga of Offenburger FV at FC 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.060
 stones-Höllstein 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.630
 Bones almost everywhere where they are since the beginning of the second Bundesliga 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.240
 Wehrheim 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.420
 It was a very bitter weekend for the newly promoted Wölfe Freiburg am 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.370
 Friday was a good one 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.470
 7-clap 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.180
 in Nuremberg and the St on Sunday then you like first in the race against 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.030
 the favorite Eisbären Berlin but at the end there are not even one 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.150
 point gain 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.220
 Thomas Dolak faces the disappointment in the face 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.160
 Press conference after the game against Berlin, it applies to the coach again 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.470
 once to declare a defeat 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.610
 this time his wolves start looking pretty annoying with 14.5 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.030
 Actually, everything had started so well for a full minute and a half 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.280
 played as quality okay the chaos in front of the guest gate uses and to one 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.790
 Zero dust 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.070
 Freiburg plays cheeky self-confident goes with the first shot on goal in the lead and 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.410
 can not be overcome by the quick compensation of the polar bears 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.600
 TJ her tool 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.810
 because in direct return, it is again top de 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.290
 who uses the template of Peter Maurus 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.150
 2 2 1 earned the leadership 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.410
 because the wolves play concentrated and Besic year and that though with Sterba and 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.780
 Dana and she was Jack for three regular defenders 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.560
 Injuries or illnesses a lot 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.579
 Valparaiso in defense with young inexperienced players doing their thing 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:47.620
 but do well 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.040
 and if not like here in the second third then there is still the 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.400
 mating 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.000
 So it's most important for Freiburg's twenty-fifth minute 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.710
 clothes often even three-to-one that the stand after 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.820
 the second third 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.720
 with which the guests were served even better than nearly Altis lift 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.359
 Janko can still increase to 4 to 1 but only hits the crossbar here 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.599
 so that in the second third in which the guests the Freiburg Hintermannschaft 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.860
 disassemble properly 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.360
 The polar bears make up a 1 2 3 residue within the last one 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.809
 20 minutes a 5 to 4 7 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.099
 while the polar bears benefit 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.950
 of hair-raising mistakes in the Freiburg defense 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.589
 in the final third is completely off the roll 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.830
 the reason for the hopelessness of the wolves defenders 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.300
 she also prefers in the injury of another important player 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.659
 Service DAX 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:43.799
 we want to 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.619
 the defender had been to his team 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:50.739
 Paschally that also children have been abused and injured 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.169
 Parents help battered players 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:55.369
 in the last third it was not with him 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:57.039
 next year under 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.939
 all the young boys have made a mistake and it has us 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.939
 Points have been tasted and you have to see that as a harassment team has 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:08.659
 Miramar that they apply with so few people in the market one has thought it 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.169
 Pages unfortunately it does not have this 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.229
 This time is not enough and I'm very sorry 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:15.779
 it just sucks 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:19.500
 the disappointment of Peter Maar is she is understandable 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.510
 the intermediate 4 to 2 lead he pulls himself and two hits 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.660
 he prepared in the end but it was not enough again 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.160
 the world of coach Thomas Doll remain so bottom of the table in the 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.009
 DRS 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:36.819
 clean but take a fresh start to success already next Friday 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.779
 is the next home game on the program then meet the wolves 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:43.369
 on the table third the Hamburg Freezers and we take a look 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:44.979
 the table and 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:48.799
 there are the wolves Freiburg in last place is in Schaan four points 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.399
 Back to the thirteenth PRC in Neustadt
