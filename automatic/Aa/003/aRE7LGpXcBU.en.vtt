00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
the Year and that's the problem they put

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.509 
the Year and that's the problem they put
too<00:03:25.819> much<00:03:26.000> emphasis<00:03:26.260> into<00:03:27.260> just<00:03:27.530> a<00:03:27.680> few<00:03:28.069> stats

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
too much emphasis into just a few stats

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.190 
too much emphasis into just a few stats
your<00:03:29.269> batting<00:03:29.750> average<00:03:29.870> home<00:03:30.349> runs<00:03:30.379> and<00:03:30.980> RBIs

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
right now I have a pretty good batting

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.059 
right now I have a pretty good batting
average<00:03:35.150> but<00:03:35.330> my<00:03:35.450> home<00:03:35.720> runs<00:03:36.049> and<00:03:36.200> RBIs<00:03:36.590> aren't

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
average but my home runs and RBIs aren't

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.369 
average but my home runs and RBIs aren't
where<00:03:37.250> they<00:03:37.400> need<00:03:37.430> to<00:03:37.610> be<00:03:37.930> but<00:03:38.930> here's<00:03:39.200> the

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
where they need to be but here's the

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.220 
where they need to be but here's the
problem<00:03:39.879> they<00:03:40.879> don't<00:03:41.180> put<00:03:41.510> enough<00:03:41.989> emphasis

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
problem they don't put enough emphasis

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.180 
problem they don't put enough emphasis
into<00:03:42.980> per<00:03:43.549> at-bat<00:03:44.120> stats<00:03:44.629> what<00:03:45.530> I<00:03:45.560> mean<00:03:45.829> it<00:03:46.040> by

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
into per at-bat stats what I mean it by
