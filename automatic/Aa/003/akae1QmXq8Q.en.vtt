than some black spots here and there and
some<00:01:33.610> silver<00:01:33.970> bits<00:01:35.910> but<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.180> scope<00:01:37.660> wise<00:01:37.930> is

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
some silver bits but the scope wise is

some silver bits but the scope wise is
completely<00:01:39.370> the<00:01:39.520> same<00:01:41.190> so<00:01:42.190> let's<00:01:42.490> get<00:01:42.730> a

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
completely the same so let's get a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
and articulation is exactly the same so

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.620 
and articulation is exactly the same so
don't<00:01:52.280> plan<00:01:52.460> on<00:01:52.610> going<00:01:52.910> over<00:01:53.120> that<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:56.390> chest
