 Crush location information between trees and two countries to this Patrick Chan 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.609
 something like 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.609
 There is much 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.090
 Strong 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.090
 at homeplaza 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
 Yup 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.780
 It was completed in two years 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.520
 I understood a big applause 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.570
 There was no problem with living alone 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.160
 The 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
 Also recorded 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.200
 It is good that it is Hamamatsu professional soccer federation 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.020
 Sent in 2004 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.130
 But that's right 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.229
 I brought a unique rhythm firmly 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.170
 But I remember 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:17.499
 That is not all 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:21.499
 Take off 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.029
 Change price rise 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:27.029
 It was rolling back 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:33.119
 The US Congress topped the podium 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:35.559
 It is this France tournament 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:38.559
 Also to take command after the cup 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.169
 I will appear on the first day 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.559
 I will say that I will attach to the refined refining fraud 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:33.620
 At the same time the government and illustrations and disasters are released one after another, and vegetables are burned 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.619
 Was 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.719
 I think that there is a failure of anti-disaster measures 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:44.659
 It is still the main point of many 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.119
 Answered easily 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:49.119
 In making this effort 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:56.219
 Ironically perfect 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:59.609
 Have transparency 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.060
 It is other 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.479
 The walking assistance has taken part in childcare, which was the case 

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:10.539
 I took a visit to Japan next month on a very large swimming under the long-awaited umbrella 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:12.679
 did 

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:15.679
 I am the same gold medalist all over the world 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:19.239
 New tone of structure 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.349
 And it feels like 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.349
 It's just a little bit of difference between Tiny 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:30.039
 2 minutes and 50 seconds short program 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.039
 Is it difficult to make an actor business 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.220
 I'm doing a set, but the difference in speed between left and right is 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.620
 There is not much race 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.360
 renewable resource 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.030
 There is also a left jump so the clockwise turned out 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.500
 However, that narrative is not to go to the album 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.150
 The surroundings were also thrown away and it was very clean and impressive 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.150
 was 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.719
 I finished seventh in the US tournament 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:11.719
 So Takahashi Daisuke Sekidai is third after the check 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:14.719
 This Patrick Chan who left a grade 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:17.569
 Also a chance for the finals 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:20.330
 It is awakened a lot 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
 This French tournament that we met in such 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.839
 Lee 

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:29.029
 Patrick Chan of Canada 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:32.029
 I get a bonus such as a collision 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:35.779
 1000 people 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:36.740
 3 O'clock 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.000
 Tanaka is the best at his own homepage 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.920
 Making use of the immediate force involved in 2 points is 3.315 billion 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.909
 This was flat 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:52.020
 Own 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.860
 test 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.120
 I'm back 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.069
 Registration is free but you need a ticket 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:58.710
 Details will open later 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.030
 I was at the top there
