00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.930
 a news expresses a quick news 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.060
 but the less curious also 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.580
 related to the apple world because 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.950
 surely many of you are moviegoers 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.390

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.539
 movies that you like a lot of everything 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.710
 kind of entertainment but also 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.059
 some I suppose you have known and 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.100
 you will have seen the movie that 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.230
 starred ashton kutcher about life 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.180
 of steve jobs for good you know that 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.949
 are and is also producing a new 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.559
 movie related to the life of the 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.920
 fantastic visionary that in the end all 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.879
 we love how is steve jobs not well 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.390
 attention because as you will have read in the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.370
 title leonardo dicaprio could 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.489
 star in this movie the truth 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.440
 to summarize a bit there is a lot of movement 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.600
 behind this movie is watching 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.320
 much hodgepodge much whisper 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.210
 because there have been moves first I was 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.020
 in front of this movie david fincher 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.720
 as a director and his let's say protagonist 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.460
 was going to be christian bale the hitcher was going 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.049
 to direct this film everything was fine 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.710
 routed with everything even if it's like 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.869
 actor 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.940
 but it seems that as they have been 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.659
 advancing the dates to start having 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.270
 disputes and certain nonconformities 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.759
 with the producer with sonny due to the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.619
 wages and above all the rights that 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.540
 he wanted to acquire about production 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.340
 of the movie is david fincher 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.259
 practically put conditions of 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.490
 that I wanted to pretty much control everything 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.720
 what refers to the promotion of the 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.060
 movie something they are and did not want to 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.950
 give in that aspect then they are and what 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.050
 what he has done has been to find another 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.060
 director this movie I have to say 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.979
 is written by aaron sorkin and is 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.600
 based on the official biography so 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.539
 you see a movie maybe 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.229
 maybe something more real than what we could 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.800
 see a year ago about about the life of 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.990
 jobs 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.750
 starring ashton kutcher we will see 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.030
 how is the movie will consist in 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.009
 three parts is worth three parts of 30 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.630
 minutes each one that will narrate three of 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.120
 the most important events of 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.500
 the life of steve jobs which for good 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.269
 it can be interesting especially 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.489
 because the movie we saw a year ago 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.290
 we are a little short good once 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.160
 we have reviewed how the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.740
 movie and what happens 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.450
 also played with sonny and with christian 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.700
 So, well, to the one that makes the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.740
 another part because he leonardo dicaprio 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.440
 well I have here pointed 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.480
 the name of the new director or at least 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.480
 which is testing Sony are being 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.070
 I 'm testing daniel boy 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.190
 singing a well-known director has directed 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.410
 movies like it 's lockdown sorry 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.840
 slumdog millionaire syndrome set 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.630
 with that word is the two million and already 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.330
 I would say in theory with leonardo 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.580
 dicaprio as the protagonist of this film 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.440
 Of course it is not crazy either 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.910
 think this the lord up a catcher 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.660
 before seeing him in the role of jobs 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.670
 anyone imagined him dressed 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.860
 with the steve clothing and with the 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.330
 aspect of steve is to say today the 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.130
 characterization of the characters is 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.260
 very accomplished in these movies and they are and 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.030
 it is not a novice nor a 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.490
 sony production sure would give the 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.560
 level to a story that we all expect 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.570
 that comes out very good about the life of 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.340
 this man so I do not know what you think 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.220
 you about this news the less 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.750
 it's funny we 'll see how it goes 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.370
 developing everything because I already say that 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.200
 there is business 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.060
 you have complicated with sony and his 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.159
 director we'll see if he really gets 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.319
 short and tie danny boyle as director 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.340
 of the movie we tried a movie that 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.019
 the moment this year we would not see 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.480
 we could wait for the best for 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.950
 mid end of next year but 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.659
 It's not good that you know it too 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.250
 you because 1.5 for some crazy 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.680
 We count the news and things too 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.700
 anecdotal like this in short I 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.290
 dismissal of guys I hope that I have 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.640

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.010

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.079
