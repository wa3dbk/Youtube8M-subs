then<00:01:41.549> his<00:01:41.729> cab<00:01:42.439> also<00:01:44.119> flipping<00:01:45.119> them<00:01:45.210> around

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
then his cab also flipping them around

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.300 
then his cab also flipping them around
no<00:01:45.689> detail<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.409> back<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.070> bit

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
no detail on the back a little bit

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.069 
no detail on the back a little bit
surprised<00:01:47.640> by<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.970> thought<00:01:48.509> learning<00:01:48.869> curve

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
surprised by that thought learning curve

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.590 
surprised by that thought learning curve
well<00:01:49.829> then<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.040> think<00:01:50.189> always<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.329> learning

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
well then I think always that learning

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.149 
well then I think always that learning
curve<00:01:51.780> should<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.350> done<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> lot<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.740> stuff<00:01:53.009> as

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
curve should have done a lot of stuff as

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.469 
curve should have done a lot of stuff as
well<00:01:53.509> so<00:01:54.950> you<00:01:55.950> know<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.430> symmetrical<00:01:57.180> which

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
well so you know it's symmetrical which

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.310 
well so you know it's symmetrical which
means<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> same<00:01:59.159> thing<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.520> both<00:01:59.640> sides

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
means it's the same thing the both sides

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.620 
means it's the same thing the both sides
and<00:02:01.320> it's<00:02:01.500> true<00:02:01.770> what<00:02:02.640> one<00:02:02.759> outside<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.329> does

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
and it's true what one outside a does

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.539 
and it's true what one outside a does
mine<00:02:03.869> does<00:02:04.079> say<00:02:04.259> Frank<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.070> also<00:02:05.369> has<00:02:05.520> a

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
mine does say Frank and also has a

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.529 
mine does say Frank and also has a
number<00:02:05.759> for<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> recall<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.799> then<00:02:08.420> let<00:02:09.420> me

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
number for a recall and so then let me

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.690 
number for a recall and so then let me
check<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.080> date<00:02:10.319> again<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.590> believe<00:02:10.739> it's<00:02:11.099> 2003

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
check the date again I believe it's 2003

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.250 
check the date again I believe it's 2003
yeah<00:02:11.849> it's<00:02:12.000> 2003

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
yeah it's 2003

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.450 
yeah it's 2003
I'm<00:02:14.260> taking<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.680> look<00:02:14.830> at<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.980> wheels<00:02:15.130> there

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
I'm taking a look at the wheels there

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.790 
I'm taking a look at the wheels there
then<00:02:16.240> again<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.540> was<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:16.870> also<00:02:17.020> said<00:02:17.380> member

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
then again I was I also said member

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
yearbook so aka maybe a learning the

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.700 
yearbook so aka maybe a learning the
state<00:02:27.040> learning<00:02:27.370> curve<00:02:27.520> mistake<00:02:27.970> or<00:02:28.710> maybe

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
state learning curve mistake or maybe

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.680 
state learning curve mistake or maybe
they<00:02:30.070> just<00:02:30.370> made<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.760> for<00:02:30.910> another<00:02:31.120> year<00:02:31.240> and

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
they just made it for another year and

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.180 
they just made it for another year and
learning<00:02:32.020> curve<00:02:32.200> doesn't<00:02:32.470> want<00:02:32.710> to<00:02:32.830> admit<00:02:32.950> it

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
learning curve doesn't want to admit it

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.670 
learning curve doesn't want to admit it
that<00:02:33.220> they<00:02:33.460> did<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.870> that's<00:02:35.140> pretty<00:02:35.290> much<00:02:35.380> it

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
that they did so that's pretty much it

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.350 
that they did so that's pretty much it
was<00:02:35.860> Frank<00:02:36.190> he's<00:02:36.520> just<00:02:36.700> pretty<00:02:36.910> rare<00:02:37.180> because

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
was Frank he's just pretty rare because

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.300 
was Frank he's just pretty rare because
they<00:02:37.450> only<00:02:37.630> made<00:02:37.930> him<00:02:38.050> a<00:02:38.230> couple<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.680> years<00:02:38.980> the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310

um of course the excitement has now gone

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.710 
um of course the excitement has now gone
down<00:04:02.290> as<00:04:02.830> you<00:04:02.950> can<00:04:03.070> tell<00:04:03.250> but<00:04:04.060> let's<00:04:04.480> take<00:04:04.690> a

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
down as you can tell but let's take a

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.560 
down as you can tell but let's take a
look<00:04:05.080> at<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.190> similarities<00:04:07.000> between<00:04:07.030> these

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
look at the similarities between these

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.380 
look at the similarities between these
two<00:04:07.959> I<00:04:08.459> find<00:04:09.459> that<00:04:09.549> always<00:04:09.880> kind<00:04:10.120> of<00:04:10.209> weird

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
two I find that always kind of weird

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.750 
two I find that always kind of weird
that<00:04:10.720> they<00:04:10.840> both<00:04:11.049> have<00:04:11.440> red<00:04:12.070> stripes<00:04:12.489> in<00:04:12.670> the

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
that they both have red stripes in the

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.640 
that they both have red stripes in the
front<00:04:13.000> there<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:13.450> Frank<00:04:14.080> has<00:04:14.230> them<00:04:14.440> all<00:04:14.530> the

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
front there and Frank has them all the

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.909 
front there and Frank has them all the
way<00:04:14.739> around<00:04:15.100> actually<00:04:15.220> Butler<00:04:15.910> just<00:04:16.150> has<00:04:16.330> the

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
way around actually Butler just has the

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.130 
way around actually Butler just has the
stripe<00:04:17.919> right<00:04:18.130> there<00:04:18.630> kind<00:04:19.630> of<00:04:19.720> weird<00:04:19.930> I<00:04:20.049> think

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
stripe right there kind of weird I think

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.589 
stripe right there kind of weird I think
and<00:04:20.560> then<00:04:20.950> turn<00:04:21.190> them<00:04:21.340> sideways<00:04:21.609> I'll<00:04:22.270> scoop

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
and then turn them sideways I'll scoop

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.240 
and then turn them sideways I'll scoop
Frank<00:04:23.020> up<00:04:23.169> here

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
Frank up here

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.560 
Frank up here
looks<00:04:25.250> like<00:04:25.460> Frank<00:04:25.850> doesn't<00:04:26.210> want<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.389> balance

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
looks like Frank doesn't want to balance

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.030 
looks like Frank doesn't want to balance
oh<00:04:27.080> well<00:04:28.720> okay<00:04:29.720> so<00:04:29.930> that's<00:04:30.290> kind<00:04:30.470> of<00:04:30.590> weird<00:04:30.830> but

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
oh well okay so that's kind of weird but

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.830 
oh well okay so that's kind of weird but
that's<00:04:31.699> what<00:04:31.940> they<00:04:32.030> both<00:04:32.180> look<00:04:32.389> like<00:04:32.600> like

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
that's what they both look like like

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.740 
that's what they both look like like
that<00:04:33.080> and<00:04:33.560> um<00:04:34.479> hmm

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
that and um hmm

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.780 
that and um hmm
like<00:04:36.169> I'm<00:04:36.440> just<00:04:36.710> too<00:04:36.889> kind<00:04:37.070> of<00:04:37.190> looking<00:04:37.580> at<00:04:37.669> it

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
like I'm just too kind of looking at it

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.090 
like I'm just too kind of looking at it
here<00:04:38.120> but<00:04:38.990> I<00:04:39.020> guess<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:39.440> red<00:04:39.620> stripes<00:04:39.889> are

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
here but I guess the red stripes are

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.770 
here but I guess the red stripes are
really<00:04:40.340> only<00:04:40.460> seen<00:04:40.790> because<00:04:41.090> Mulder<00:04:41.630> is<00:04:41.750> a

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
really only seen because Mulder is a

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.520 
really only seen because Mulder is a
steam<00:04:42.110> engine

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
steam engine

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.550 
steam engine
Frank<00:04:42.889> Frank<00:04:43.520> is<00:04:43.729> a<00:04:43.760> diesel<00:04:44.199> yes<00:04:45.199> so<00:04:45.350> pretty

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
Frank Frank is a diesel yes so pretty

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.790 
Frank Frank is a diesel yes so pretty
much<00:04:45.650> that's<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:46.010> only<00:04:46.250> similarity<00:04:48.100> so<00:04:50.800> Frank

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
much that's the only similarity so Frank

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.219 
much that's the only similarity so Frank
is<00:04:51.919> pretty<00:04:52.160> rare<00:04:52.400> um<00:04:52.669> you<00:04:53.120> can<00:04:53.330> find<00:04:53.630> both
