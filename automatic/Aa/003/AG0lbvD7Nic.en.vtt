continue stirring okay and what we're

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.039 
continue stirring okay and what we're
going<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.700> add<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:07.939> non<00:01:08.939> tablespoons<00:01:09.869> of

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
going to add here is non tablespoons of

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.560 
going to add here is non tablespoons of
chia<00:01:10.290> gel<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.830> she<00:01:11.610> gel<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.240> an<00:01:12.390> egg

chia gel and she gel is an egg

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.679 
chia gel and she gel is an egg
substitute<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.860> three<00:01:14.250> tablespoons<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.299> GH<00:01:15.570> l

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
substitute so three tablespoons of GH l

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.130 
substitute so three tablespoons of GH l
equals<00:01:16.110> 1<00:01:16.170> egg<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.310> we've<00:01:17.460> got<00:01:17.729> nine<00:01:18.150> divided

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
equals 1 egg so we've got nine divided

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.760 
equals 1 egg so we've got nine divided
by<00:01:19.350> three<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:20.330> 38<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.900> if<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.140> wanted<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.619> use

consistency<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:29.659> x<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.780> makes<00:01:31.320> everything

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
consistency of x that makes everything

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.730 
consistency of x that makes everything
stick<00:01:32.130> together<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.540> looks<00:01:33.780> weird<00:01:34.079> but<00:01:34.409> it

really doesn't affect taste at all and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.600 
really doesn't affect taste at all and
it<00:01:37.890> adds<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.759> ton<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.119> health<00:01:39.479> benefits<00:01:40.400> easy<00:01:41.400> on

it adds a ton of health benefits easy on

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.430 
it adds a ton of health benefits easy on
the<00:01:41.729> digestion<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:43.590> meat<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.829> going<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.220> be

tablespoon of tomato juice so we're

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.479 
tablespoon of tomato juice so we're
going<00:02:47.770> to<00:02:47.890> take<00:02:48.360> we<00:02:49.360> actually<00:02:50.160> spun<00:02:51.160> this<00:02:51.310> up

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
going to take we actually spun this up

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.120 
going to take we actually spun this up
ourselves<00:02:51.640> in<00:02:52.420> our<00:02:52.630> blender<00:02:53.080> but<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:53.980> can

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
ourselves in our blender but you can

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.449 
ourselves in our blender but you can
obviously<00:02:54.250> use<00:02:54.610> any<00:02:54.940> kind<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.270> tomato<00:02:55.600> juice

obviously use any kind of tomato juice

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.300 
obviously use any kind of tomato juice
again<00:02:57.459> we're<00:02:57.640> going<00:02:57.760> for<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.150> natural<00:02:58.570> way

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
again we're going for the natural way

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.530 
again we're going for the natural way
okay<00:03:00.310> so<00:03:00.580> we're<00:03:00.670> going<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.850> add<00:03:00.970> that<00:03:01.000> tomato

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
okay so we're going to add that tomato

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.690 
okay so we're going to add that tomato
juice<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:03.070> then<00:03:04.800> after<00:03:05.800> that<00:03:05.980> you're<00:03:06.550> going

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
juice and then after that you're going

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.979 
juice and then after that you're going
to<00:03:06.760> chop<00:03:07.600> up<00:03:07.720> some<00:03:07.780> parsley<00:03:08.200> or<00:03:08.860> maybe<00:03:09.730> them

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
to chop up some parsley or maybe them

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.110 
to chop up some parsley or maybe them
mm-hmm<00:03:10.989> or<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:12.040> can<00:03:12.250> do<00:03:12.489> it<00:03:12.610> while<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.910> strip

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
mm-hmm or I can do it while you strip

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:21.870 
mm-hmm or I can do it while you strip
yeah<00:03:19.860> so<00:03:20.860> we're<00:03:20.980> going<00:03:21.070> to<00:03:21.160> preheat<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.730> oven

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
yeah so we're going to preheat the oven

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:30.300 
yeah so we're going to preheat the oven
to<00:03:22.860> 375<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:27.070> get<00:03:27.220> that<00:03:27.340> warming<00:03:27.790> up<00:03:28.709> okay<00:03:29.709> so

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
to 375 and get that warming up okay so

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.210 
to 375 and get that warming up okay so
that<00:03:30.459> is<00:03:30.489> about<00:03:30.850> 3<00:03:31.360> tablespoons<00:03:31.750> I<00:03:32.680> think<00:03:33.130> we

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
that is about 3 tablespoons I think we

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.009 
that is about 3 tablespoons I think we
should<00:03:33.250> measure<00:03:33.580> it<00:03:33.790> out<00:03:33.880> just<00:03:34.150> in<00:03:34.360> case<00:03:34.420> no

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
should measure it out just in case no

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.970 
should measure it out just in case no
it's<00:03:35.170> fine<00:03:35.320> i'll<00:03:35.620> just<00:03:35.650> put<00:03:35.950> it<00:03:36.040> in<00:03:36.209> ok<00:03:37.800> maybe<00:03:38.800> a

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
it's fine i'll just put it in ok maybe a

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.449 
it's fine i'll just put it in ok maybe a
little<00:03:39.010> bit<00:03:39.280> less<00:03:40.860> alright<00:03:41.860> so<00:03:42.130> now<00:03:42.250> we<00:03:42.310> want

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
little bit less alright so now we want

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.150 
little bit less alright so now we want
to<00:03:42.640> add<00:03:42.730> some<00:03:43.120> salt<00:03:43.330> and<00:03:43.420> pepper<00:03:44.040> just<00:03:45.040> to

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160

taste<00:03:45.519> so<00:03:46.239> don't<00:03:47.140> worry<00:03:47.230> about<00:03:47.380> measurements

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
taste so don't worry about measurements

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.810 
taste so don't worry about measurements

mix all right we're going to take our
loaf<00:04:31.650> pan<00:04:31.980> and<00:04:32.250> we're<00:04:32.340> going<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:32.520> oil<00:04:32.760> it<00:04:34.160> so

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
loaf pan and we're going to oil it so

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.610 
loaf pan and we're going to oil it so
that<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.430> dish<00:04:35.610> doesn't<00:04:35.850> stick<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.210> it<00:04:36.620> so

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
that the dish doesn't stick to it so

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.770 
that the dish doesn't stick to it so
right<00:04:37.890> now<00:04:37.920> it's<00:04:38.310> out<00:04:38.430> of<00:04:38.540> consistency<00:04:39.540> so<00:04:39.690> we

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
right now it's out of consistency so we

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.170 
right now it's out of consistency so we
can<00:04:39.930> go<00:04:40.080> ahead<00:04:40.170> and<00:04:40.560> pour<00:04:41.550> it<00:04:41.640> into<00:04:41.730> our<00:04:41.970> loaf

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
can go ahead and pour it into our loaf

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.650 
can go ahead and pour it into our loaf
pan<00:04:46.310> I'm<00:04:47.310> going<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:47.610> train<00:04:47.850> a<00:04:48.090> little<00:04:48.330> bit<00:04:48.540> of
