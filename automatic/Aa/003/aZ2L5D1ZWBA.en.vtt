hi this is Jeff from obedia and today
I'm<00:00:32.250> gonna<00:00:32.340> talk<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.759> about<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.000> two<00:00:33.180> main

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
I'm gonna talk to you about the two main

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.389 
I'm gonna talk to you about the two main
ways<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:34.079> sequence<00:00:34.530> drum<00:00:34.800> beats<00:00:35.010> with<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
ways to sequence drum beats with the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.610 
ways to sequence drum beats with the
boom<00:00:35.790> drum<00:00:36.239> machine<00:00:36.570> virtual<00:00:37.020> instrument<00:00:37.469> in

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
boom drum machine virtual instrument in

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.680 
boom drum machine virtual instrument in
Pro<00:00:37.950> Tools<00:00:37.980> now<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.820> first<00:00:39.120> way<00:00:39.300> involves

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
Pro Tools now the first way involves

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.740 
Pro Tools now the first way involves
simply<00:00:40.200> using<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.520> boom<00:00:41.730> plug-in<00:00:42.239> itself

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
simply using the boom plug-in itself

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.360 
simply using the boom plug-in itself
without<00:00:43.050> any<00:00:43.320> sort<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.649> external<00:00:43.890> MIDI

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
without any sort of external MIDI

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.430 
without any sort of external MIDI
keyboard<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.510> second<00:00:45.899> way<00:00:45.989> we<00:00:46.260> will

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
keyboard and the second way we will

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.770 
keyboard and the second way we will
check<00:00:46.860> out<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.340> using<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:48.000> MIDI<00:00:48.210> keyboard<00:00:48.420> to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
check out is using a MIDI keyboard to

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.619 
check out is using a MIDI keyboard to
trigger<00:00:49.079> drum<00:00:49.530> patterns<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.160> boom<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.270> first

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
trigger drum patterns in boom so first

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.439 
trigger drum patterns in boom so first
let's<00:00:51.989> check<00:00:52.079> out<00:00:52.350> using<00:00:52.829> boom<00:00:53.219> by<00:00:53.430> itself<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
let's check out using boom by itself the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.389 
let's check out using boom by itself the
things<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.809> want<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.050> check<00:00:55.320> right<00:00:55.800> away<00:00:56.039> are

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
things we want to check right away are

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.299 
things we want to check right away are
is<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.570> pattern<00:00:57.989> select<00:00:58.410> mode<00:00:58.649> okay<00:00:59.129> and

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
is it in pattern select mode okay and

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.799 
is it in pattern select mode okay and
that's<00:00:59.460> right<00:00:59.699> here<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.090> either<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.420> pattern

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
that's right here we either have pattern

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.080 
that's right here we either have pattern
edit<00:01:01.109> which<00:01:01.559> lets<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.920> edit<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.550> beats<00:01:02.760> of

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
edit which lets you edit the beats of

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.600 
edit which lets you edit the beats of
individual<00:01:03.690> patterns<00:01:03.840> or<00:01:04.140> pattern<00:01:04.470> select<00:01:04.890> so

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
individual patterns or pattern select so

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.550 
individual patterns or pattern select so
we've<00:01:05.760> got<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.150> there<00:01:06.420> we're<00:01:07.229> gonna<00:01:07.320> go<00:01:07.470> to

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
we've got that there we're gonna go to

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.140 
we've got that there we're gonna go to
our<00:01:07.619> preferences<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.369> boom<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.030> do

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
our preferences for a boom and to do

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.250 
our preferences for a boom and to do
that<00:01:09.299> we<00:01:09.390> click<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.810> little<00:01:10.080> wrench

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
that we click on this little wrench

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.920 
that we click on this little wrench
right<00:01:10.530> here<00:01:11.030> we<00:01:12.030> want<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> make<00:01:12.390> sure<00:01:12.600> that

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
right here we want to make sure that

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.260 
right here we want to make sure that
pattern<00:01:13.590> chaining<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.580> because<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.119> is

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
pattern chaining is on because this is

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.760 
pattern chaining is on because this is
gonna<00:01:15.420> enable<00:01:15.689> us<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:16.170> more<00:01:16.439> than<00:01:16.619> one

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
gonna enable us to have more than one

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.429 
gonna enable us to have more than one
pattern<00:01:17.070> play<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.850> succession<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:19.020> also<00:01:19.200> may

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
pattern play in succession you also may

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.230 
pattern play in succession you also may
want<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.680> check<00:01:19.860> out<00:01:20.040> whether<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.460> prefer<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
want to check out whether you prefer the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
when and how patterns change now that

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.230 
when and how patterns change now that
we're<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.040> pattern<00:01:32.369> select<00:01:32.729> mode<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.150> way

we're in pattern select mode the way

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.819 
we're in pattern select mode the way
we're<00:01:33.420> going<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.630> do<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.229> we're<00:01:34.590> going<00:01:34.710> to

we're going to do that is we're going to

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.469 
we're going to do that is we're going to
just<00:01:34.920> simply<00:01:35.280> click<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> first<00:01:36.119> pattern

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
just simply click on the first pattern

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.120 
just simply click on the first pattern
we<00:01:36.600> want<00:01:37.369> check<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.549> out

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
we want check that out

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.490 
we want check that out
and<00:01:41.130> then<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.939> PC<00:01:42.329> we'll<00:01:42.570> hit<00:01:42.720> control<00:01:43.200> or

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
and then on the PC we'll hit control or

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.350 
and then on the PC we'll hit control or
on<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> Mac<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.189> hit<00:01:44.310> command<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.329> that

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
on the Mac you can hit command and that

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.399 
on the Mac you can hit command and that
will<00:01:45.630> enable<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.110> select<00:01:48.409> different

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
will enable you to select different

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.160 
will enable you to select different
patterns<00:01:50.060> so<00:01:51.060> if<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.299> decided<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.750> liked<00:01:51.990> all

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
patterns so if I decided I liked all

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.789 
patterns so if I decided I liked all
these<00:01:53.600> it's<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.960> now<00:01:55.110> switch<00:01:55.170> between

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
these it's going to now switch between

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.899 
these it's going to now switch between
them

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.969 

as<00:02:03.909> you<00:02:04.390> can<00:02:04.479> see<00:02:04.720> by<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:04.930> numbers<00:02:05.320> advancing

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
as you can see by the numbers advancing

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.920 
as you can see by the numbers advancing
it's<00:02:06.580> showing<00:02:06.970> you<00:02:07.030> which<00:02:07.210> patterns<00:02:07.659> are<00:02:07.810> now

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
it's showing you which patterns are now

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.440 
it's showing you which patterns are now
playing<00:02:08.700> another<00:02:09.700> thing<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.090> remember<00:02:10.300> about

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
playing another thing to remember about

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.229 
playing another thing to remember about
this<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.230> I<00:02:11.620> just<00:02:11.890> hit<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.520> alt<00:02:12.730> or<00:02:13.030> option

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
this and I just hit the alt or option

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.260 
this and I just hit the alt or option
key<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:14.310> take<00:02:15.310> all<00:02:15.550> those<00:02:15.730> patterns<00:02:15.970> off

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
key to take all those patterns off

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.720 
key to take all those patterns off
another<00:02:16.959> thing<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.260> remember<00:02:17.290> is<00:02:17.709> they<00:02:18.580> will

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
another thing to remember is they will

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.340 
another thing to remember is they will
play<00:02:18.910> back<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.330> order<00:02:19.690> in<00:02:19.870> which<00:02:19.900> you

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
play back in the order in which you

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.340 
play back in the order in which you
select<00:02:20.800> them<00:02:21.160> so<00:02:21.520> if<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:21.819> have<00:02:22.300> one<00:02:22.569> that<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.170> want

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
using a MIDI keyboard and we have a MIDI

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.190 
using a MIDI keyboard and we have a MIDI
track<00:03:29.950> here<00:03:30.340> set<00:03:30.640> up<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.480> I've<00:03:31.570> opened<00:03:31.780> up<00:03:32.019> the

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
track here set up and I've opened up the

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.330 
track here set up and I've opened up the
MIDI<00:03:32.380> editor<00:03:32.709> when<00:03:32.829> they're<00:03:32.950> just<00:03:33.100> so<00:03:33.190> we<00:03:33.250> can

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
MIDI editor when they're just so we can

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.400 
MIDI editor when they're just so we can
see<00:03:33.579> better<00:03:33.790> what<00:03:34.000> we're<00:03:34.150> doing<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.660> in<00:03:35.290> this

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
see better what we're doing and in this

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.150 
see better what we're doing and in this
case<00:03:35.680> we<00:03:36.310> want<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:36.609> pay<00:03:36.790> attention<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.890> C<00:03:38.890> 3

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
case we want to pay attention to the C 3

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.120 
case we want to pay attention to the C 3
2<00:03:39.519> D<00:03:39.700> sharp<00:03:39.970> 4<00:03:40.299> keys<00:03:40.600> on<00:03:40.959> your<00:03:41.079> keyboard

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.380 

these<00:03:46.130> are<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.340> ones<00:03:46.550> that<00:03:46.700> if<00:03:46.910> you<00:03:47.030> just<00:03:47.209> hit

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
these are the ones that if you just hit

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.150 
these are the ones that if you just hit
one<00:03:47.599> key<00:03:47.870> it'll<00:03:48.110> actually<00:03:48.560> trigger<00:03:48.830> a<00:03:48.920> whole

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
one key it'll actually trigger a whole

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.940 
one key it'll actually trigger a whole
pattern<00:03:49.580> so<00:03:50.209> now<00:03:50.330> at<00:03:50.450> this<00:03:50.540> point<00:03:50.780> we'll<00:03:51.739> just

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
pattern so now at this point we'll just

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.890 
pattern so now at this point we'll just
rewinds<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.459> beginning<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:52.970> we'll<00:03:53.599> start

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
rewinds the beginning and we'll start

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.840 
rewinds the beginning and we'll start
recording<00:03:54.290> in<00:03:54.349> Pro<00:03:54.500> Tools

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.630 

as<00:04:00.850> you<00:04:01.780> see<00:04:01.960> I'm<00:04:02.170> just<00:04:02.430> triggering<00:04:03.430> different

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
as you see I'm just triggering different

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.210 
as you see I'm just triggering different
patterns<00:04:05.850> and<00:04:07.260> they<00:04:08.260> will<00:04:08.410> start<00:04:08.710> on<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.070> beat

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
patterns and they will start on the beat

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:16.560 
patterns and they will start on the beat
that<00:04:09.370> I<00:04:09.490> happen<00:04:09.820> to<00:04:09.910> hate<00:04:10.090> that<00:04:10.450> pattern<00:04:10.810> on<00:04:15.570> so

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
that I happen to hate that pattern on so

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.240 
that I happen to hate that pattern on so
now<00:04:16.720> we<00:04:16.780> can<00:04:16.959> play<00:04:17.140> that<00:04:17.320> back

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
now we can play that back

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.430 
now we can play that back
and<00:04:19.489> not<00:04:20.299> only<00:04:20.329> do<00:04:20.600> we<00:04:20.660> have<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.200> maybe

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
and not only do we have the maybe

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.950 
and not only do we have the maybe
performance<00:04:22.070> we<00:04:22.970> also<00:04:23.120> have<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.480> recorded<00:04:23.900> as

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
performance we also have it recorded as

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.140 
performance we also have it recorded as
audio<00:04:24.290> if<00:04:24.590> we<00:04:24.740> need<00:04:24.890> to<00:04:25.040> go<00:04:25.190> somewhere<00:04:25.610> else<00:04:25.730> to

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
audio if we need to go somewhere else to

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.510 
audio if we need to go somewhere else to
