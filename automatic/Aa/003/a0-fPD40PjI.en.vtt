00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
usually I think that's like an 88 or

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.939 
usually I think that's like an 88 or
above<00:06:03.539> i'm<00:06:03.750> ninety<00:06:04.169> percent<00:06:04.349> sure<00:06:04.710> i<00:06:04.740> don't

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:04.949 
above i'm ninety percent sure i don't

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:06.499 
above i'm ninety percent sure i don't
know<00:06:05.009> why<00:06:05.190> if<00:06:05.250> the<00:06:05.490> packs<00:06:05.729> like<00:06:05.909> good<00:06:06.240> chin<00:06:06.419> out

know why if the packs like good chin out
or<00:06:06.690> what<00:06:06.960> but<00:06:07.110> usually<00:06:07.590> it's<00:06:08.130> an<00:06:08.280> 88<00:06:08.729> plus<00:06:09.030> i

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
or what but usually it's an 88 plus i

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.360 
or what but usually it's an 88 plus i
think<00:06:09.719> that's<00:06:09.990> what<00:06:10.229> these<00:06:10.409> are<00:06:10.620> so<00:06:10.860> hopefully
