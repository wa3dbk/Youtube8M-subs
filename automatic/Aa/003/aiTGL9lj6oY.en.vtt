00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.110 

you<00:01:56.380> know<00:01:56.500> he<00:01:56.830> says<00:01:57.010> I<00:01:57.130> aspired<00:01:57.610> him<00:01:57.850> but<00:01:58.030> I

you know he says I aspired him but I

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.960 
you know he says I aspired him but I
think<00:01:58.510> that's<00:01:58.750> like<00:01:59.290> the<00:02:00.070> reverse<00:02:00.550> is

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
think that's like the reverse is

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.470 
think that's like the reverse is
actually<00:02:01.510> true<00:02:01.870> he<00:02:02.140> is<00:02:02.410> as<00:02:03.040> his<00:02:03.820> work<00:02:04.090> ethic

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
actually true he is as his work ethic

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.390 
actually true he is as his work ethic
and<00:02:04.600> his<00:02:04.780> Drive<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:05.170> his<00:02:05.410> never<00:02:05.890> giving<00:02:06.310> up

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
and his Drive and his never giving up
