00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello there gta 5 congratulations to all 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.180
 who expected I understood this cooperative 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.400
 addition to the saddle that was only on 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.920
 I'm close to the fans of the series not 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.850
 I will note some interesting ones on 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.180
 my mind to the moment 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.570
 but the exclusivity of this view 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.030
 This is the first requirement for a horse 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.490
 one side was expected on the other 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.289
 after the unit is not particularly impressive for 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.570
 comfortable playing at max speeds and with 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.909
 anti-aliasing need top graphics cards 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.690
 at the same time the games start falsely and 

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:35.730
 old maps 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.989
 tenth derek when using 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.199
 which requirements should be 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.909
 significantly lower so on processors on 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.030
 stream optimization is present 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:48.269
 Karel quite uneven load 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.789
 highly dependent on the location of the game 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.549
 capable of using up to 16 threads we 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.469
 use only 4 tight 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:57.089
 the load is distributed over the large layer 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.639
 lira but with less percent of them 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.010
 use that wnd that the cops 

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:04.250
 actually therefore by the ratio 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.590
 the cherries are sitting in their usual place 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.469
 level of the initial rows and respectively 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.219
 masthead cards do not reveal but about 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:16.590
 level 780 matrix before the 290 radical 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.479
 Fits very well for 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.750
 processor which ledge am and through 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.960
 years more powerful apartments needed one 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.030
 thin statue of dirt 3 5 hertz higher than that 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.090
 just about we are watching the situation 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.009
 with the previous and superfluous magic is not worth 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.659
 hurry with conclusions and panic 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.119
 if in a new game in advance 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.530
 impressive it is possible that now 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.619
 a bunch of bugs will come out 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.310
 pour 3-4 patch can be re 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.200
 test 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.359
 Recently on the channel there was a video where 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.550
 celebrated liked the words of cats and years 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.620
 new driver 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.190
 and here on the day of the game’s release not only on 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.810
 videos but these are posting fresh versions 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.850
 if anyone does not know the signal site model 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.430
 bt lies 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.440
 15.4 of april 13 actually situations 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.520
 did not change at all and even with 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.470
 fresh drivers 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.530
 because of the tanks looks pale to this 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.450
 networks me down windows top ten jboss so 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.710
 what's worth the wait in the upgrade price 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.660
 drivers and the situation will be clearer won 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.940
 memory game with anti-aliasing confident 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.190
 passes for triggers 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.110
 one for one city ​​or one half 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.130
 this is already a problem for cards with 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.060
 three gigabytes 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.120
 like my dough card 776 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.850
 gigabytes 3 fps faster than usual 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.460
 and brelochek 30k second or 10 percent 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.920
 which is pretty much the third 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.230
 Witcher situation with wheel elder so 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.080
 what for owners like from the question 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.220
 brad is quite matured itself that concerns 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.640
 random access memory 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.520
 hail terrible laid 66 half 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.130
 his entry as hello very similar very 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.320
 soon 8 gigabytes of RAM will be 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.330
 enough for a gaming computer this is not 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.090
 a problem for fans of poil these forums 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.530
 they are worth a penny RAM but 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.600
 preferably own full size on 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.660
 motherboard with four varieties add 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.310
 no problem added in the end no 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.940
 revolution technical terms the game is not 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.560
 produced 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.080
 which is not surprising because 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.980
 used by the former rage engine so 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.920
 apple 34 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.410
 He judging by reviews gameplay brought 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.050
 many new interesting pieces that neither 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.670
 in one game and carry through and it seems 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.739
 co-flow delivers a lot 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.739
 positive of what all and wish
