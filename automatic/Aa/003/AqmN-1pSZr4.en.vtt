00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.400
 then the girls who milk us 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.200
 and now it's up to us we want it 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.470
 to know absolutely what is there 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.110
 behind the gift so let's go all of 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.400
 Following Chamonix I tried to make you 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.779
 the gift that would make you the most 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.429
 pleasure so I looked into your 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.019
 comments and if there is anything 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.609
 which was redundant 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.019
 it's the gift that I offer you so 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.480
 I hope you enjoy it 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.860
 play a water the water that yes dear 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.020
 subscribers I have the pleasure of you 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.640
 present the labyrinth of zephyr the map 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.620
 that I have completely recreated for you 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.060
 to please you because they 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.530
 did not really work actually 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.420
 I had not planned for someone 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.490
 the chip download it and now yes 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.010
 it works and I hope you 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.630
 will appreciate it so in fact the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.290
 labyrinth of zephyr for those who do not 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.680
 can not follow this is the creation remains 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.540
 waves that was the subject of my special 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.880
 2222 subscribers without it's really a 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.890
 the exceptional blessing because they 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.600
 are all built at every moment 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.040
 so at every moment you have a 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.840
 new labyrinth you have a 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.030
 new part in front of you is 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.500
 really random so for some that 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.150
 can be easy going at any time and 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.640
 for others it may just be 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.740
 impossible really happened 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.350
 random what they inspired me the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.830
 alone to be well launched jk rowling with 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.380
 harry potter I thought in the cut of 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.620
 fire that's when Harry Potter 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.610
 happens in a maze does that they 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.050
 have a conscience and who self 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.760
 which self builds at each 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.710
 second he undoes himself he makes almost 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.900
 so that people get lost in 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.610
 inside and I recreated this little 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.290
 marvel of with red stone 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.970
 so I'll explain it to you 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.920
 the moment how it works 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.960
 the labyrinth is made up of hundreds 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.430
 cells like that it's cells 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.750
 who are always the same why and 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.000
 to have a labyrinth 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.159
 is always straw and the cells have 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.830
 a logic system that's there edge 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.420
 just here and there edge justice there is a 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.009
 random system that is just in 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.330
 below there are several systems 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.159
 random redstone 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.060
 in fact there are some who kill 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:16.810
 sponsors of the items 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.700
 of water also redstone clubs and 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.560
 all this can be pretty much the range especially 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.390
 because every cell must have a 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.580
 clean brain that is to say each 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.459
 cell to randomly decide to 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.560
 change is not a big technology 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.120
 behind or below that handles all the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.970
 the plane is at once it's really 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.760
 every cell who think when 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.090
 she wants to change or when she wants to change 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.560
 wants to block the road of a character 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.840
 so how does it work 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.790
 well it is simple in the minecraft 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.500
 animals runs randomly 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.630
 so they walk randomly 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.110
 it's for what's a chicken here that 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.930
 five cars each with boxes 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.090
 except one activates the mechanism of 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.640
 logic that makes open three door is 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.489
 closed one so here what is more 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.959
 of that it's really that chickens 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.299
 are random one creates not a lot of 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.280
 lag and if you are too far so if 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.049
 you're here the maze will not change 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.360
 not the chickens out there so you 're 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.950
 sure you will have almost no lag 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.690
 to play in his direct struggle for 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.480
 carve extremely functional and you 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.160
 is going to work anytime well 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.390
 that this cell and their little one believe 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.590
 me it made me a lot of time 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.510
 develop for it to be so 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.970
 compact as practical is also the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.840
 concept itself of the cell that 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.519
 think by themselves 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.920
 so I hope you will appreciate 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.450
 this mini game how to play is very 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.030
 simple you come face to face yourself 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.769
 read this you click here it changes 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.720
 your game mode and it prevents the most 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.609
 prudes exploded why are we going to see 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.690
 sometimes you will arrive here you 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.190
 take what in the trunk 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.040
 if you are really a lot to play 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.230
 so if he wanted to have food 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.459
 for 8 people who would play at the same 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.450
 time in the maze and well you 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.730
 can see is getting food 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.180
 but that's planned for one or two 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.650
 people 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.000
 so you can leave the 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.870
 food if you want even more 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.540
 intensity but 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.700
 here it is really dependent at end and 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.620
 after that you just have to go 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.319
 towards the labyrinth is also for 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.569
 the mood you can put the video 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.370
 2222 subscribers behind and after that you 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:19.760
 wait for it to open and you go back 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:22.820
 in the labyrinth smiles she has everything 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.580
 just stuck from the beginning and then there 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.169
 and in short you start your adventure 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.389
 was going from labyrinth 2 and 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:34.490
 faye years I remind you then that it is 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.960
 a mini game so he could not do it 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.130
 really a big adventure map with 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.440
 full of situational 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.820
 it's more of a mini game than it is 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.900
 really very interesting because you 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.970
 can do it in the race 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.470
 fake write down your result or first 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.150
 video of your result send them to me 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.370
 me and I'll put it on video 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.100
 answer of this video or if I'm going 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.139
 surely make a top 3 people 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.820
 who managed to do it faster 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.500
 so it'll be really interesting if 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.169
 you see me of course you 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.150
 result if you try to add it 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.860
 of the intensity what I did is 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.500
 that you have just right here level 1 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.270
 and by that you also have level 2 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.860
 so if if you have a small 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.530
 gateway is what is interesting 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.270
 is that at that moment it is the 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.479
 blackness the labyrinth is entirely 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.300
 in the dark of which you have almost no 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.130
 sense of direction and especially the 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.990
 mobs can walk around and elsewhere 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.139
 which believe me that makes the game very 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:30.979
 interesting I advise you so 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:32.960
 really to put your you man 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.520
 smiles I really advise you to 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.750
 put your amber setting has everything 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.000
 just because it can be very 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.520
 useful but at the same time know that the 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.500
 treasure room and lit up so we know 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:47.090
 you never know then that's all 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.770
 is said i hope you will like 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.389
 have fun in this maze where so much 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.370
 that I had fun with friends 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:54.530
 to play indoors while we 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.010
 was filming so thank you 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.660
 a lot 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.729
 it was effect yesterday for the chain 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.440
 minecraft effect yesterday for his gifts from 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:02.120
 christmas of the year 2012 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.539
 so I hope you enjoyed 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.539
 thank you
