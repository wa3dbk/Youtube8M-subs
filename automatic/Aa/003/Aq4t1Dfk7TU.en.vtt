we are doing the scar-l versus the l85
and<00:00:40.910> you<00:00:41.330> know<00:00:41.450> a<00:00:41.600> ginger<00:00:41.990> for<00:00:42.260> 9:1<00:00:42.920> was<00:00:43.340> one<00:00:43.550> of

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
and you know a ginger for 9:1 was one of

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.370 
and you know a ginger for 9:1 was one of
many<00:00:43.940> of<00:00:44.090> you<00:00:44.180> guys<00:00:44.330> who<00:00:44.540> requested<00:00:45.110> seeing

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
many of you guys who requested seeing

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.320 
many of you guys who requested seeing
this<00:00:45.590> showdown<00:00:46.040> and<00:00:46.250> you<00:00:46.790> guys<00:00:46.940> have<00:00:47.150> been

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
this showdown and you guys have been

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.120 
this showdown and you guys have been
asking<00:00:47.510> for<00:00:48.020> this<00:00:48.140> for<00:00:48.200> quite<00:00:48.380> a<00:00:48.680> while<00:00:48.920> and<00:00:49.100> I

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
asking for this for quite a while and I

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.410 
asking for this for quite a while and I
feel<00:00:49.160> like<00:00:49.430> these<00:00:49.550> two<00:00:49.610> weapons<00:00:50.090> are<00:00:50.210> just

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
feel like these two weapons are just

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.150 
feel like these two weapons are just
destined<00:00:50.930> to<00:00:51.020> be<00:00:51.140> together<00:00:51.260> because<00:00:51.860> they

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
destined to be together because they

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.520 
destined to be together because they
have<00:00:52.190> some<00:00:52.640> very<00:00:52.910> key<00:00:53.270> similarities<00:00:53.600> but

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
have some very key similarities but

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.930 
have some very key similarities but
there<00:00:54.650> are<00:00:54.800> some<00:00:55.010> subtle<00:00:55.220> differences<00:00:55.790> that

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
there are some subtle differences that

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.340 
there are some subtle differences that
kind<00:00:56.120> of<00:00:56.180> set<00:00:56.360> them<00:00:56.480> apart<00:00:56.810> you<00:00:56.840> can<00:00:57.050> see<00:00:57.200> that

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
kind of set them apart you can see that

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.380 
kind of set them apart you can see that
the<00:00:57.410> l85a2<00:00:58.130> does<00:00:58.520> shoot<00:00:58.730> 30<00:00:58.970> rounds<00:00:59.300> per

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
the l85a2 does shoot 30 rounds per

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.760 
the l85a2 does shoot 30 rounds per
minute<00:00:59.510> faster<00:01:00.020> than<00:01:00.200> the<00:01:00.290> scar-l

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
minute faster than the scar-l

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.920 
minute faster than the scar-l
but<00:01:01.280> it<00:01:01.370> reloads<00:01:01.730> slower<00:01:02.030> by<00:01:02.270> a<00:01:02.300> pretty<00:01:02.690> large

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
but it reloads slower by a pretty large

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.049 
but it reloads slower by a pretty large
margin<00:01:03.500> however<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.159> scar-l<00:01:04.430> does<00:01:04.820> have<00:01:05.030> a

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
margin however the scar-l does have a

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.880 
margin however the scar-l does have a
little<00:01:05.390> less<00:01:05.689> recoil<00:01:05.960> now<00:01:06.320> I<00:01:06.350> will<00:01:06.560> point<00:01:06.770> out

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
little less recoil now I will point out

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.560 
little less recoil now I will point out
I<00:01:06.950> will<00:01:07.220> be<00:01:07.369> using<00:01:07.520> heavy<00:01:07.909> barrel<00:01:08.240> throughout

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
I will be using heavy barrel throughout

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.999 
I will be using heavy barrel throughout
all<00:01:08.780> of<00:01:08.810> these<00:01:09.080> clips<00:01:09.380> on<00:01:09.530> both<00:01:09.680> of<00:01:09.859> these

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
all of these clips on both of these

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.980 
all of these clips on both of these
weapons<00:01:10.219> it<00:01:10.579> is<00:01:10.640> my<00:01:11.210> recommendation<00:01:11.960> that

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
weapons it is my recommendation that

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.929 
weapons it is my recommendation that
heavy<00:01:12.499> barrel<00:01:12.829> is<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.159> attachment<00:01:13.729> of<00:01:13.759> choice

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
heavy barrel is the attachment of choice

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.069 
heavy barrel is the attachment of choice
on<00:01:14.149> either<00:01:14.390> of<00:01:14.570> these<00:01:14.689> two

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
on either of these two

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.200 
on either of these two
but<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:15.799> scar-l<00:01:16.070> actually<00:01:16.579> benefits<00:01:16.999> more

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
but the scar-l actually benefits more

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.520 
but the scar-l actually benefits more
from<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.509> heavy<00:01:17.659> barrel<00:01:17.840> because<00:01:18.079> it<00:01:18.289> seems

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
from the heavy barrel because it seems

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.529 
from the heavy barrel because it seems
to<00:01:18.679> have<00:01:18.829> a<00:01:18.859> lower<00:01:19.219> multiplier<00:01:19.909> in<00:01:20.149> terms<00:01:20.359> of

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
to have a lower multiplier in terms of

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.749 
to have a lower multiplier in terms of
the<00:01:20.630> recoil<00:01:21.079> patterns<00:01:21.409> now<00:01:22.009> the<00:01:22.069> scar<00:01:22.399> the

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
the recoil patterns now the scar the

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.190 
the recoil patterns now the scar the
scar<00:01:22.999> already<00:01:23.329> has<00:01:23.479> a<00:01:23.509> little<00:01:23.749> bit<00:01:23.960> lower

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
scar already has a little bit lower

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.980 
scar already has a little bit lower
recoil<00:01:24.710> than<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.130> l85<00:01:25.700> but<00:01:26.060> it<00:01:26.450> seems<00:01:26.780> like

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
recoil than the l85 but it seems like

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.020 
recoil than the l85 but it seems like
with<00:01:27.319> the<00:01:27.469> heavy<00:01:27.649> barrel<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.219> scar<00:01:28.729> isn't

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
with the heavy barrel the scar isn't

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.580 
with the heavy barrel the scar isn't
really<00:01:29.299> affected<00:01:29.719> a<00:01:29.780> whole<00:01:29.810> lot<00:01:30.109> according<00:01:30.409> to

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
really affected a whole lot according to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.380 
really affected a whole lot according to
the<00:01:30.710> stats<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:31.280> gun<00:01:31.549> actually<00:01:31.969> doesn't<00:01:32.270> have

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
the stats the gun actually doesn't have

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.940 
the stats the gun actually doesn't have
that<00:01:32.569> much<00:01:32.780> more<00:01:32.990> recoil<00:01:33.319> when<00:01:33.560> it<00:01:33.679> equipped

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
that much more recoil when it equipped

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.590 
that much more recoil when it equipped
with<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.249> heavy<00:01:34.399> barrel<00:01:34.609> and<00:01:34.939> when<00:01:35.329> you<00:01:35.420> use

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
with the heavy barrel and when you use

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.969 
with the heavy barrel and when you use
it<00:01:35.780> you<00:01:35.810> definitely<00:01:36.289> notice<00:01:36.439> that<00:01:36.679> and<00:01:36.859> that's

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
it you definitely notice that and that's

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.200 
it you definitely notice that and that's
one<00:01:37.130> of<00:01:37.219> the<00:01:37.280> things<00:01:37.460> I<00:01:37.609> noticed<00:01:37.939> when<00:01:38.030> I<00:01:38.090> was

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
one of the things I noticed when I was

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.700 
one of the things I noticed when I was
kind<00:01:38.450> of<00:01:38.509> field<00:01:38.749> testing<00:01:39.200> these<00:01:39.319> to<00:01:39.499> make<00:01:39.649> sure

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
kind of field testing these to make sure

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.739 
kind of field testing these to make sure
I<00:01:39.829> had<00:01:40.069> a<00:01:40.100> grip<00:01:40.369> on<00:01:40.549> you<00:01:41.119> know<00:01:41.240> what<00:01:41.630> the

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
I had a grip on you know what the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:43.179 
I had a grip on you know what the
difference<00:01:42.079> is<00:01:42.200> between<00:01:42.350> these<00:01:42.649> two<00:01:42.710> were<00:01:42.979> now

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
difference is between these two were now

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.590 
difference is between these two were now
you're<00:01:43.340> gonna<00:01:43.429> see<00:01:43.609> me<00:01:43.729> hip<00:01:43.909> firing<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.299> scar

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
you're gonna see me hip firing the scar

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.029 
you're gonna see me hip firing the scar
a<00:01:44.630> lot<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:45.020> that<00:01:45.170> was<00:01:45.259> because<00:01:45.560> I<00:01:45.649> was<00:01:45.799> trying

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
a lot and that was because I was trying

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.859 
a lot and that was because I was trying
to<00:01:46.219> get<00:01:46.340> some<00:01:46.490> hipfire<00:01:46.850> footage<00:01:47.509> to<00:01:47.630> kind<00:01:47.810> of

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
to get some hipfire footage to kind of

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.270 
to get some hipfire footage to kind of
show<00:01:48.049> you<00:01:48.109> guys<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.590> differences<00:01:49.069> between

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
show you guys the differences between

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.949 
show you guys the differences between
these<00:01:49.729> two<00:01:49.880> because<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.329> key<00:01:50.539> difference

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:50.959 
these two because the key difference

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:53.499 
these two because the key difference
between<00:01:50.990> them<00:01:51.530> is<00:01:51.709> the<00:01:52.159> l85<00:01:52.670> is<00:01:52.909> a<00:01:53.090> bullpup

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
between them is the l85 is a bullpup

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.389 
between them is the l85 is a bullpup
weapon<00:01:53.780> which<00:01:54.259> means<00:01:54.469> that<00:01:54.649> as<00:01:54.770> you're<00:01:55.009> moving

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
weapon which means that as you're moving

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.099 
weapon which means that as you're moving
you<00:01:55.729> know<00:01:55.819> as<00:01:55.969> you're<00:01:56.179> hip<00:01:56.389> firing<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.869> moving

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
you know as you're hip firing and moving

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:58.719 
you know as you're hip firing and moving
you're<00:01:57.229> going<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.439> get<00:01:57.590> aiming<00:01:57.950> bonuses<00:01:58.459> so<00:01:58.609> if

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
you're going to get aiming bonuses so if

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.459 
you're going to get aiming bonuses so if
your<00:01:58.850> aim<00:01:58.969> down<00:01:59.149> sights<00:01:59.450> while<00:01:59.659> moving<00:01:59.990> it's

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
your aim down sights while moving it's

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.289 
your aim down sights while moving it's
going<00:02:00.619> to<00:02:00.709> be<00:02:00.770> like<00:02:00.950> a<00:02:00.979> point<00:02:01.459> seven<00:02:01.939> spread

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
going to be like a point seven spread

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.120 
going to be like a point seven spread
versus<00:02:02.689> the<00:02:02.840> scar<00:02:03.319> which<00:02:03.560> is<00:02:03.649> a<00:02:03.679> little<00:02:04.009> bit

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
versus the scar which is a little bit

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.590 
versus the scar which is a little bit
higher<00:02:04.369> wall<00:02:04.670> moving<00:02:04.909> so<00:02:05.149> that's<00:02:05.329> a<00:02:05.420> big

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
higher wall moving so that's a big

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.120 
higher wall moving so that's a big
difference<00:02:05.810> you<00:02:06.139> will<00:02:06.289> be<00:02:06.439> more<00:02:06.679> accurate

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
difference you will be more accurate

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.190 
difference you will be more accurate
when<00:02:07.279> on<00:02:07.459> the<00:02:07.639> go<00:02:07.819> when<00:02:08.450> using<00:02:08.660> bullpup

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
when on the go when using bullpup

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.500 
when on the go when using bullpup
weapons<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:09.860> l85<00:02:10.399> definitely<00:02:10.940> kind<00:02:11.450> of

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
weapons so the l85 definitely kind of

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.850 
weapons so the l85 definitely kind of
caters<00:02:11.840> are<00:02:12.020> someone<00:02:12.290> who<00:02:12.380> wants<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.709> play

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
caters are someone who wants to play

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.710 
caters are someone who wants to play
very<00:02:13.160> aggressive<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:13.939> I<00:02:14.030> mean<00:02:14.209> that<00:02:14.390> hipfire

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
very aggressive and I mean that hipfire

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.509 
very aggressive and I mean that hipfire
bonus<00:02:15.110> does<00:02:15.319> come<00:02:15.560> into<00:02:15.739> play<00:02:15.860> from<00:02:16.220> time<00:02:16.400> to

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
bonus does come into play from time to

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.520 
bonus does come into play from time to
time<00:02:16.549> now<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:18.080> scar<00:02:18.349> is<00:02:18.470> a<00:02:18.620> painfully

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
time now the scar is a painfully

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.990 
time now the scar is a painfully
shooting<00:02:19.920> weapon<00:02:20.310> there's<00:02:20.490> no<00:02:20.700> doubt<00:02:20.970> about

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
shooting weapon there's no doubt about

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.970 
shooting weapon there's no doubt about
that<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.780> when<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.200> think<00:02:22.380> about<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.709> scar-l

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
that and when you think about the scar-l

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.530 
that and when you think about the scar-l
you<00:02:23.250> just<00:02:23.459> think<00:02:23.640> about<00:02:23.730> accuracy<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.450> know

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
you just think about accuracy you know

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.940 
you just think about accuracy you know
the<00:02:24.690> ability<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.110> go<00:02:25.319> fully<00:02:25.620> auto<00:02:25.860> a

the ability to go fully auto a

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.770 
the ability to go fully auto a
medium-range<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.850> ability<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.209> go<00:02:27.420> pretty

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
medium-range the ability to go pretty

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.290 
medium-range the ability to go pretty
you<00:02:28.620> know<00:02:28.680> pretty<00:02:28.920> large<00:02:29.370> pop<00:02:29.670> fires<00:02:29.970> when

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
you know pretty large pop fires when

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.820 
you know pretty large pop fires when
going<00:02:30.480> from<00:02:30.750> longer<00:02:31.080> ranges<00:02:31.350> now<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.560> can<00:02:31.680> sit

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
going from longer ranges now you can sit

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.330 
going from longer ranges now you can sit
there<00:02:32.180> boo-boo<00:02:33.209> as<00:02:33.600> opposed<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:35.010> that's<00:02:35.190> one

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
there boo-boo as opposed and that's one

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.370 
there boo-boo as opposed and that's one
of<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.520> key<00:02:35.850> advantages<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.510> but<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:37.290> know

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
of the key advantages to it but you know

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.110 
of the key advantages to it but you know
it<00:02:37.500> does<00:02:37.680> suffer<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.310> know<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.700> close

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
it does suffer you know in close

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.150 
it does suffer you know in close
quarters<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.540> scar-l<00:02:39.930> can<00:02:40.410> be<00:02:40.709> a<00:02:40.739> little<00:02:41.010> bit

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
quarters the scar-l can be a little bit

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.309 
quarters the scar-l can be a little bit
tricky<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.550> use<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:42.120> mean<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.630> lot<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.900> people<00:02:43.140> do

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
tricky to use I mean a lot of people do

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.720 
tricky to use I mean a lot of people do
like<00:02:43.560> using<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:44.010> in<00:02:44.100> close<00:02:44.250> quarters<00:02:44.610> though

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
like using it in close quarters though

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.340 
like using it in close quarters though
because<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.480> accuracy<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:46.050> know<00:02:46.170> they

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
because of that accuracy you know they

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.510 
because of that accuracy you know they
feel<00:02:46.530> like<00:02:46.650> if<00:02:46.800> they<00:02:46.830> can<00:02:46.920> get<00:02:47.130> more<00:02:47.280> bullets

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
feel like if they can get more bullets

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.240 
feel like if they can get more bullets
on<00:02:47.730> target<00:02:48.090> faster<00:02:48.360> they<00:02:49.319> can<00:02:49.350> often<00:02:49.950> beat

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
on target faster they can often beat

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.880 
on target faster they can often beat

of<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.320> scarrella<00:02:55.769> same<00:02:56.100> with<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.340> l85<00:02:56.880> but

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
of the scarrella same with the l85 but

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.820 
of the scarrella same with the l85 but
it<00:02:57.269> is<00:02:57.390> an<00:02:57.540> accuracy<00:02:57.930> weapon<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.410> look<00:02:58.590> at<00:02:58.709> these

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
it is an accuracy weapon I look at these

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.770 
it is an accuracy weapon I look at these
as<00:02:59.040> more<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.370> marksman<00:02:59.880> rifles<00:03:00.300> as<00:03:00.420> what

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
as more of marksman rifles as what

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.720 
as more of marksman rifles as what
rifles<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.410> you're<00:03:01.500> gonna<00:03:01.650> sit<00:03:02.519> back<00:03:02.670> a

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
rifles that you're gonna sit back a

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.770 
rifles that you're gonna sit back a
little<00:03:02.850> bit<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.209> know<00:03:03.300> you<00:03:03.390> don't<00:03:03.510> have<00:03:03.630> to

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
little bit you know you don't have to

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.210 
little bit you know you don't have to
rush<00:03:04.019> in<00:03:04.260> but<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.470> think<00:03:04.530> if<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:04.890> are<00:03:05.040> gonna

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
rush in but I think if you are gonna

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.620 
rush in but I think if you are gonna
find<00:03:05.489> yourself<00:03:05.850> in<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:06.030> situation<00:03:06.239> where

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
find yourself in a situation where

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.150 
find yourself in a situation where
you're<00:03:06.870> gonna<00:03:06.989> rush<00:03:07.319> in<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.590> little<00:03:07.800> bit<00:03:07.920> more

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
you're gonna rush in a little bit more

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.440 
you're gonna rush in a little bit more
you<00:03:08.640> know<00:03:08.670> you're<00:03:08.819> gonna<00:03:08.910> play<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.150> little<00:03:09.239> bit

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
you know you're gonna play a little bit

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.059 
you know you're gonna play a little bit
more<00:03:09.690> aggressive<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.380> might<00:03:10.739> want<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:10.950> go

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
more aggressive you might want to go

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.640 
more aggressive you might want to go
with<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.310> l85<00:03:11.850> now<00:03:12.150> one<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.290> things<00:03:13.500> that

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
with the l85 now one of the things that

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.920 
with the l85 now one of the things that
really<00:03:13.680> holds<00:03:14.340> me<00:03:14.430> back<00:03:14.459> from<00:03:14.670> liking<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.480> l85

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
really holds me back from liking the l85

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.600 
really holds me back from liking the l85
more<00:03:16.200> than<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:16.470> do<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.620> mean<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:16.920> do<00:03:16.980> enjoy<00:03:17.370> using

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
more than I do I mean I do enjoy using

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.670 
more than I do I mean I do enjoy using
this<00:03:17.850> rifle<00:03:18.060> but<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.810> problem<00:03:19.260> with<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.440> is

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
this rifle but the problem with it is

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.830 
this rifle but the problem with it is
the<00:03:19.950> reload<00:03:20.340> times<00:03:20.610> they<00:03:20.790> are<00:03:20.910> very<00:03:21.269> slow<00:03:21.660> you

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
the reload times they are very slow you

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.990 
the reload times they are very slow you
know<00:03:21.930> bullpup<00:03:22.410> weapons<00:03:22.830> reload<00:03:23.250> very<00:03:23.519> slow<00:03:23.850> in

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
know bullpup weapons reload very slow in

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.180 
know bullpup weapons reload very slow in
this<00:03:24.120> game<00:03:24.390> it's<00:03:25.140> kind<00:03:25.380> of<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.799> penalty

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
this game it's kind of the the penalty

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.220 
this game it's kind of the the penalty
you<00:03:26.340> get<00:03:26.579> from<00:03:26.850> using<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.269> bullpup<00:03:27.720> weapon<00:03:27.900> and

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
you get from using a bullpup weapon and

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.900 
you get from using a bullpup weapon and
that<00:03:28.350> can<00:03:28.650> can<00:03:29.070> lead<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.549> some<00:03:29.730> problems

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
that can can lead to some problems

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.490 
that can can lead to some problems
especially<00:03:30.329> if<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:30.780> find<00:03:30.959> yourself<00:03:31.140> with

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
especially if you find yourself with

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.470 
especially if you find yourself with
multiple<00:03:31.890> enemies<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.820> know<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.299> slow

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
multiple enemies you know the the slow

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.880 
multiple enemies you know the the slow
rate<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:33.690> fire<00:03:33.810> does<00:03:34.200> make<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.590> little<00:03:34.709> bit

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
rate of fire does make it a little bit

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.590 
rate of fire does make it a little bit
easier<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.280> kind<00:03:35.549> of<00:03:35.640> stay<00:03:35.820> on<00:03:35.850> target<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.480> get

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
easier to kind of stay on target and get

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.910 
easier to kind of stay on target and get
multiple<00:03:36.959> guys<00:03:37.170> but<00:03:37.440> for<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.650> most<00:03:37.829> part

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
multiple guys but for the most part

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.069 
multiple guys but for the most part
you're<00:03:38.190> going<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.519> struggle<00:03:38.910> if<00:03:39.269> you<00:03:39.690> run<00:03:39.930> into

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
you're going to struggle if you run into

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.229 
you're going to struggle if you run into
five<00:03:40.350> or<00:03:40.530> six<00:03:40.739> guys<00:03:40.950> even<00:03:41.579> on<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.820> map<00:03:42.060> like

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
five or six guys even on a map like

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.300 
five or six guys even on a map like
metro<00:03:42.630> but<00:03:43.530> I<00:03:43.560> think<00:03:43.799> if<00:03:43.890> you're<00:03:44.010> going<00:03:44.160> to

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
metro but I think if you're going to

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.710 
metro but I think if you're going to
pick<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.489> weapon<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:45.030> play<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.239> little<00:03:45.360> bit<00:03:45.570> more

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
pick a weapon to play a little bit more

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.930 
pick a weapon to play a little bit more
in<00:03:45.900> close<00:03:46.170> these<00:03:46.440> go<00:03:46.829> the<00:03:47.070> scar-l<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.610> going<00:03:47.850> to

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
in close these go the scar-l is going to

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.720 
in close these go the scar-l is going to
get<00:03:48.060> outclassed<00:03:48.510> by<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.780> l85<00:03:49.440> now<00:03:50.160> like<00:03:50.640> I

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
get outclassed by the l85 now like I

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.759 
get outclassed by the l85 now like I
said<00:03:50.790> these<00:03:51.060> are<00:03:51.120> very<00:03:51.570> very<00:03:52.019> similar<00:03:52.320> weapons

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
said these are very very similar weapons

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.620 
said these are very very similar weapons
I<00:03:52.890> had<00:03:53.040> a<00:03:53.070> really<00:03:53.489> hard<00:03:53.519> time<00:03:53.910> sitting<00:03:54.570> down

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
I had a really hard time sitting down

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.569 
I had a really hard time sitting down
and<00:03:54.959> deciding<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:55.560> know<00:03:55.590> what<00:03:55.739> factors<00:03:56.430> I

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
and deciding you know what factors I

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.220 
and deciding you know what factors I
want<00:03:56.850> out<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.150> weapon<00:03:57.359> but<00:03:57.690> I<00:03:57.750> think<00:03:58.079> that

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
want out of a weapon but I think that

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.140 
want out of a weapon but I think that
I'm<00:03:58.350> definitely<00:03:58.590> going<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:58.950> give<00:03:59.100> my<00:03:59.310> vote<00:03:59.340> to

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
I'm definitely going to give my vote to

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.810 
I'm definitely going to give my vote to
the<00:04:00.299> scar-l<00:04:00.570> now<00:04:00.989> I<00:04:01.290> will<00:04:01.859> say<00:04:02.010> this<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.519> one

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
the scar-l now I will say this the one

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.580 
the scar-l now I will say this the one
advantage<00:04:03.299> that<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.630> lot<00:04:03.900> of<00:04:04.019> people<00:04:04.260> overlook

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
advantage that a lot of people overlook

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.530 
advantage that a lot of people overlook
and<00:04:05.220> which<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.489> saw<00:04:05.670> me<00:04:05.820> using<00:04:06.060> at<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.239> very

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
and which you saw me using at the very

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.229 
and which you saw me using at the very
very<00:04:06.630> beginning<00:04:06.959> of<00:04:07.380> this<00:04:07.620> video<00:04:08.340> is<00:04:08.579> the<00:04:08.880> fact

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
very beginning of this video is the fact

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.569 
very beginning of this video is the fact
that<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.570> l85<00:04:10.230> can<00:04:10.470> actually<00:04:10.829> use<00:04:10.980> vers<00:04:11.280> fire

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
that the l85 can actually use vers fire

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.500 
that the l85 can actually use vers fire
now<00:04:12.180> that's<00:04:13.170> really<00:04:13.560> really<00:04:14.310> advantageous<00:04:15.000> at

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
now that's really really advantageous at

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.270 
now that's really really advantageous at
longer<00:04:15.720> ranges<00:04:16.109> as<00:04:16.229> least<00:04:16.410> in<00:04:16.560> my<00:04:16.680> experiences

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
longer ranges as least in my experiences

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.909 
longer ranges as least in my experiences
so<00:04:17.910> if<00:04:17.970> you're<00:04:18.090> looking<00:04:18.390> to<00:04:18.630> maybe<00:04:19.109> conserve<00:04:19.890> a

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
so if you're looking to maybe conserve a

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.289 
so if you're looking to maybe conserve a
little<00:04:20.039> bit<00:04:20.280> more<00:04:20.430> ammo<00:04:20.729> maybe<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.150> be<00:04:21.269> a

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
little bit more ammo maybe to be a

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.730 
little bit more ammo maybe to be a
little<00:04:21.539> bit<00:04:21.660> more<00:04:21.780> precise<00:04:22.140> with<00:04:22.320> your<00:04:22.350> shots

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
little bit more precise with your shots

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.190 
little bit more precise with your shots
the<00:04:23.250> burst<00:04:23.550> fire<00:04:23.669> mode<00:04:24.090> on<00:04:24.660> this<00:04:24.840> weapon

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
the burst fire mode on this weapon

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.140 
the burst fire mode on this weapon
really<00:04:25.500> comes<00:04:25.860> in<00:04:26.010> handy<00:04:26.039> even<00:04:26.550> better<00:04:27.000> you

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
really comes in handy even better you

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.640 
really comes in handy even better you
could<00:04:27.270> go<00:04:27.390> single<00:04:27.659> fire<00:04:27.900> but<00:04:28.110> obviously<00:04:28.470> all

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
could go single fire but obviously all

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.469 
could go single fire but obviously all
weapons<00:04:29.039> had<00:04:29.460> single<00:04:29.849> fire<00:04:30.030> for<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.300> most

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
weapons had single fire for the most

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:31.279 
weapons had single fire for the most
part<00:04:30.720> and

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
part and

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.709 
part and
honestly<00:04:32.069> guys<00:04:32.189> I<00:04:32.249> mean<00:04:32.610> if<00:04:32.759> you<00:04:32.909> want<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.419> sit

fire<00:04:36.930> but<00:04:37.139> I<00:04:37.169> think<00:04:37.409> best-of-breed<00:04:38.069> you<00:04:38.399> know

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.279 
fire but I think best-of-breed you know
even<00:04:39.300> though<00:04:39.419> it<00:04:39.539> is<00:04:39.629> a<00:04:39.659> little<00:04:39.990> bit<00:04:40.110> less

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
even though it is a little bit less

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.379 
even though it is a little bit less
versatile<00:04:40.800> than<00:04:40.979> the<00:04:41.069> l85<00:04:41.520> I<00:04:41.550> think<00:04:41.879> I<00:04:41.969> do<00:04:42.029> like
