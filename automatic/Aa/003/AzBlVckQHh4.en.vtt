00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.039 

I<00:00:04.640> was<00:00:05.640> really<00:00:05.790> pleased<00:00:06.089> with<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.450> game<00:00:06.629> you

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
I was really pleased with the game you

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.190 
I was really pleased with the game you
know<00:00:07.200> it's<00:00:07.589> an<00:00:07.859> often<00:00:08.849> obviously<00:00:09.750> people<00:00:09.929> look

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
know it's an often obviously people look

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.320 
know it's an often obviously people look
at<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.410> score<00:00:10.650> line<00:00:10.860> but<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.400> was<00:00:11.849> all<00:00:12.030> pleased

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
at the score line but I was all pleased

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.560 
at the score line but I was all pleased
with<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.780> performance<00:00:13.009> rather<00:00:14.009> than<00:00:14.570> learn

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
with the performance rather than learn

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.320 
with the performance rather than learn
so<00:00:15.780> much<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.109> school<00:00:16.320> life<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.830> think<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.670> we

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
so much the school life I think that we

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.200 
so much the school life I think that we
removed<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.840> ball<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.380> support<00:00:19.800> way<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:21.029> way

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
removed the ball of support way the way

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.200 
removed the ball of support way the way
we<00:00:21.390> kept<00:00:21.720> possession<00:00:22.550> the<00:00:23.550> way<00:00:23.670> we<00:00:23.820> created

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
we kept possession the way we created

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.960 
we kept possession the way we created
chances<00:00:24.720> was<00:00:24.930> really<00:00:25.260> really<00:00:25.470> good<00:00:25.740> today

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
chances was really really good today

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.040 
chances was really really good today
switching<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> point<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.330> attack<00:00:27.570> was<00:00:27.779> key

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
switching the point of attack was key

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.349 
switching the point of attack was key
also<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:29.310> know<00:00:29.429> when<00:00:29.580> one<00:00:29.760> forward<00:00:30.090> checks

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
also you know when one forward checks

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.120 
also you know when one forward checks
off<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:31.109> other<00:00:31.230> one<00:00:31.410> can<00:00:31.650> kind<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.890> get<00:00:32.040> him

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
off the other one can kind of get him

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.240 
off the other one can kind of get him
behind<00:00:32.719> and<00:00:33.719> find<00:00:34.110> those<00:00:34.290> gaps<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.739> seams<00:00:34.950> but

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
behind and find those gaps and seams but

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.150 
behind and find those gaps and seams but
I<00:00:35.280> thought<00:00:35.520> overall<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.239> know<00:00:36.360> we<00:00:36.559> we<00:00:37.559> started

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
I thought overall you know we we started

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.400 
I thought overall you know we we started
off<00:00:38.309> simple<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.059> possessing<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> ball<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.350> I

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
off simple and possessing the ball and I

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.990 
off simple and possessing the ball and I
think<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.739> that's<00:00:40.829> key<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.160> then<00:00:41.489> later

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
think that that's key and then later

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.760 
think that that's key and then later
towards<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.450> game<00:00:42.600> we<00:00:42.870> we<00:00:43.170> stretched<00:00:43.530> them

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
towards the game we we stretched them

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.369 
towards the game we we stretched them
and<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.129> opened<00:00:44.430> up<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.899> think<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:45.960> was<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> great

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
and it opened up I think it was a great

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.220 
and it opened up I think it was a great
performance<00:00:46.739> by<00:00:47.340> our<00:00:47.460> team<00:00:47.930> it's<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
performance by our team it's one of the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.529 
performance by our team it's one of the
first<00:00:49.680> games<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.550> year<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.210> come<00:00:51.390> out

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
first games of this year and to come out

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.660 
first games of this year and to come out
and<00:00:51.719> get<00:00:51.840> such<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> good<00:00:52.289> results<00:00:52.829> not<00:00:53.129> only<00:00:53.190> in

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
and get such a good results not only in

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.580 
and get such a good results not only in
the<00:00:53.789> score<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:54.449> also<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.930> style<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.379> we

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
the score but also the style that we

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.770 
the score but also the style that we
played<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.129> lot<00:00:56.520> more<00:00:56.760> possession<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.629> were

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
played a lot more possession we were

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.510 
played a lot more possession we were
able<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.079> get<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.350> better<00:00:58.739> rhythm<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.340> have

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
able to get a better rhythm that we have

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.639 
able to get a better rhythm that we have
in<00:00:59.640> previous<00:00:59.820> games<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.930> think<00:01:01.140> overall<00:01:01.410> was

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
in previous games so I think overall was

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.860 
in previous games so I think overall was
a<00:01:01.680> good<00:01:01.859> performance<00:01:02.309> for<00:01:02.430> us<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.820> think<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
a good performance for us I think the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.350 
a good performance for us I think the
way<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.199> played<00:01:04.500> made<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.519> very<00:01:05.640> difficult<00:01:05.820> for

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
way we played made it very difficult for

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.870 
way we played made it very difficult for
them<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.840> defend<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> whole<00:01:08.100> 90<00:01:08.369> minutes

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
them to defend for the whole 90 minutes

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.780 
them to defend for the whole 90 minutes
because<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.360> thought<00:01:09.540> our<00:01:09.750> ball<00:01:09.960> movement

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
because I thought our ball movement

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.289 
because I thought our ball movement
support<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.380> way<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:14.030> approach<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
support and the way that we approach the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.929 
support and the way that we approach the
game<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.990> was<00:01:16.200> very<00:01:16.409> good<00:01:16.680> Sidney<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.759> were

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
game it was very good Sidney and I were

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.820 
game it was very good Sidney and I were
kind<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.450> big<00:01:18.479> part<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.229> possession

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
kind of a big part of the possession

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.530 
kind of a big part of the possession
today<00:01:20.040> which<00:01:20.250> normally<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.210> front<00:01:21.420> line

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
today which normally in a front line

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.260 
today which normally in a front line
were<00:01:21.659> not<00:01:21.689> there<00:01:22.439> was<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> lot<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.830> space<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:24.180> us

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
were not there was a lot of space for us

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.700 
were not there was a lot of space for us
to<00:01:24.450> check<00:01:24.659> off<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> back<00:01:25.140> line<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.619> get

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
to check off the back line and get

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.310 
to check off the back line and get
involved<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:26.970> an<00:01:27.060> outlet<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.720> sort

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
involved and just be an outlet and sort

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.740 
involved and just be an outlet and sort
of<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.770> point<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.210> change<00:01:30.570> of

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
of the the point in the in the change of

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.770 
of the the point in the in the change of
attack<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.220> think<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.729> at<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> same<00:01:33.509> time

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
attack and I think that at the same time

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.390 
attack and I think that at the same time
we<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.170> be<00:01:34.380> there<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.710> stretch<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.189> line

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
we have to be there to stretch the line

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.789 
we have to be there to stretch the line
in<00:01:35.670> open<00:01:35.909> up<00:01:36.000> space<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.270> our<00:01:36.509> midfield<00:01:36.799> well

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
in open up space for our midfield well

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.010 
in open up space for our midfield well
what<00:01:38.040> we<00:01:38.159> felt<00:01:38.400> was<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.479> Russian

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
what we felt was that the the Russian

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.289 
what we felt was that the the Russian
back<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.500> really<00:01:40.950> didn't<00:01:41.280> push<00:01:42.060> off<00:01:42.270> a

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
back for really didn't push off a

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.359 
back for really didn't push off a
striker<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.380> thought<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.829> movement<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.250> our

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
striker so I thought the movement of our

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.280 
striker so I thought the movement of our
strikers<00:01:44.909> was<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.329> good<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.140> way

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
strikers was really good and the way

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.630 
strikers was really good and the way
that<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.560> kept<00:01:46.799> stretching<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.280> point<00:01:47.520> of

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
that we kept stretching the point of

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.030 
that we kept stretching the point of
attack<00:01:48.000> opened<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> space<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.829> left

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
attack opened up the space and the left

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.980 
attack opened up the space and the left
side<00:01:50.280> I'm<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.700> right<00:01:50.880> side<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.810> don't

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
side I'm the right side but I don't

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.389 
side I'm the right side but I don't
think<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.290> was<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.530> most<00:01:52.680> down<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.159> Russia

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
think that was the most down to Russia

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.370 
think that was the most down to Russia
as<00:01:53.970> donor<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:54.570> we<00:01:54.869> moved<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.259> ball

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
as donor that we we moved the ball

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.859 
as donor that we we moved the ball
around<00:01:55.560> beginning<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.460> game<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.670> was<00:01:56.969> happy

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
around beginning of the game I was happy

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.630 
around beginning of the game I was happy
to<00:01:57.899> get<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> lot<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.649> opportunities<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
to get a lot of opportunities on the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.190 
to get a lot of opportunities on the
outside<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.270> wish<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.840> we<00:02:00.960> could<00:02:00.990> have

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
outside I wish that we could have

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.780 
outside I wish that we could have
converted<00:02:01.500> some<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.890> those<00:02:01.979> early<00:02:02.340> chances

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
converted some of those early chances

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.999 
converted some of those early chances
that<00:02:02.939> took<00:02:03.090> us<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.299> little<00:02:03.450> bit<00:02:03.659> longer<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.649> put

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
that took us a little bit longer to put

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.319 
that took us a little bit longer to put
one<00:02:05.159> away<00:02:05.280> then<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.790> think<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.060> we<00:02:06.149> would<00:02:06.270> have

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
one away then I think that we would have

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.570 
one away then I think that we would have
liked<00:02:06.600> but<00:02:06.869> we<00:02:07.590> stayed<00:02:07.799> persistent<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.520> we

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
liked but we stayed persistent and we

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.350 
liked but we stayed persistent and we
kept<00:02:08.910> good

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
kept good

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.600 
kept good
but<00:02:09.570> send<00:02:09.810> that's<00:02:10.619> how<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.830> saw<00:02:11.130> goals<00:02:11.400> come

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
but send that's how you saw goals come

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.090 
but send that's how you saw goals come
our<00:02:11.760> way<00:02:11.880> I<00:02:12.320> think<00:02:13.320> that<00:02:13.500> that's<00:02:13.620> sort<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:13.980> the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
our way I think that that's sort of the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.370 
our way I think that that's sort of the
style<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.520> our<00:02:14.670> team<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.210> know<00:02:15.240> when<00:02:15.600> when<00:02:16.080> we

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
style of our team you know when when we

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.750 
style of our team you know when when we
get<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.560> goal<00:02:16.800> we<00:02:17.010> get<00:02:17.160> hyped<00:02:17.400> up<00:02:17.550> we<00:02:17.670> get

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
get a goal we get hyped up we get

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.460 
get a goal we get hyped up we get
adrenaline<00:02:18.390> we<00:02:18.660> were<00:02:18.810> keeping<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.260> lot<00:02:19.440> of

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
adrenaline we were keeping a lot of

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.020 
adrenaline we were keeping a lot of
possession<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.100> first<00:02:20.280> half<00:02:20.460> like<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.790> said

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
possession in the first half like I said

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.610 
possession in the first half like I said
kind<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:21.780> war<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.050> other<00:02:22.200> team<00:02:22.470> out<00:02:22.590> a

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620

kind of war to the other team out a
little<00:02:22.860> bit<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.250> then<00:02:23.340> once<00:02:23.520> we<00:02:23.760> got<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.910> goal

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
little bit and then once we got a goal

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.390 
little bit and then once we got a goal
it<00:02:24.330> sort<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.570> opened<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.900> floodgates<00:02:25.400> we've

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400

that you know once there's a little bit

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.270 
that you know once there's a little bit
of<00:02:30.660> gap<00:02:30.810> we<00:02:31.050> just<00:02:31.290> running<00:02:31.650> right<00:02:31.830> through<00:02:32.100> it

there was a different different kind of

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.250 
there was a different different kind of
tactics<00:02:52.020> as<00:02:52.950> far<00:02:53.220> as<00:02:53.400> them<00:02:53.610> sitting<00:02:53.970> in<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:55.020> it

was really kind of tricky to kind of get

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.729 
was really kind of tricky to kind of get
creative<00:02:57.090> find<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.810> gaps<00:02:57.989> find<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.500> seams
