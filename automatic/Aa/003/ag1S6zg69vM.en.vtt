00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.380
 it is not possible that they continue ending with so many small trees 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.840
 when we can discard the products that you have from them 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.950
 like when fiber is recycled to make products like me 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.910
 so that it costs so much little tree 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.770
 I do not understand 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.020
 I would like so much to find a human that does not have this desire to 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.170
 destroy 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.790
 there must be someone 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.460
 I know that children are extremely intelligent and know how to take good care of 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.740
 nature 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.740
 where against one 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.190
 chile are located friend who wants to have me 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.740
 Of course it is a very important and very difficult mission 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.740
 that's why it must be someone very special 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.740
 at the time he has been there 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.770
 listening to my sorrows and not half given how you call yourself you want enemy 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.770
 even better those who help in a very important mission 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.130
 thank you very much I'll tell you a bit about what this mission is about 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.820
 the immoderate felling of trees has been a very serious problem because 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.210
 unfortunately 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.140
 those brave members of nature have not been replaced by others 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.310
 young boys 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.710
 and that's why some of us have not finished with many forests 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.280
 this study the teenagers world 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.280
 that's why the details 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.520
 the trees crashed in the entity with which many products are made 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.690
 like paper and cardboard 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.760
 all those ideas and guess who 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.070
 I tell you a secret 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.970
 I can become a lot of furniture yes 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.020
 really believe 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.810
 and when these furniture are no longer useful to you, since they were left 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.719
 little ones 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.899
 it was a blanket again that apac where they worked 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:19.879
 and with ministers and after working in other countries that is called recycling 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.650
 and with that we are helping the world and in nature be in balance and the 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.449
 harmony 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:28.849
 so you already know if you want to help so that we live in a better world contributes 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.449
 recycled from buying edible products and key against Uruguay 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:34.159
 compromises 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:35.019
