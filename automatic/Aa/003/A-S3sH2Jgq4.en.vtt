if<00:00:44.300> he<00:00:44.510> can<00:00:44.690> compete<00:00:45.079> but<00:00:45.499> I<00:00:45.559> think<00:00:45.920> he<00:00:46.160> will<00:00:46.399> be

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:46.609

if he can compete but I think he will be
completing<00:00:47.120> as<00:00:47.300> there<00:00:47.510> was<00:00:47.629> no<00:00:47.660> choice<00:00:48.140> as<00:00:48.440> he

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
completing as there was no choice as he

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.770 
completing as there was no choice as he

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.450 
cannot back down from that because then

then that would just be against the
whole<00:01:18.530> thing<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:18.890> they'll<00:01:19.280> have<00:01:19.549> to<00:01:19.579> break

a surgery on the arm which could keep

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.469 
a surgery on the arm which could keep
him<00:01:36.500> out<00:01:36.619> of<00:01:36.649> action<00:01:36.920> for<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.369> while<00:01:37.640> so
