00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.810
 hello everybody, we are here to learn how to 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.190
 make the chicken pie with mass 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:48.160
 then we will combine the 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:01:04.100
 safe ingredients 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:01:04.910
 the fermi tone holley salt oil and sugar 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.100
 taste 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.060
 Let's go to beat all the 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.060
 ingredients in the blender 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.730
 we keep our ingredients in the 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.810
 orbiter we will put in the pathways to 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.810
 mix with wheat 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:36.900
 adds about 500 grams of 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:46.440
 wheat and mexico 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:48.240
 mix the staff you should eat the 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.080
 now I'm going to add a 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.640
 little of the people's wheat will be able to 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.640
 point of mass also possible 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.740
 people screaming you that we will 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.210
 repairing wheat until 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.320
 consistency of mass 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.840
 I never have pain in the mole for you to see 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.560
 who is loose 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.880
 Now let's divide it us power 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:27.590
 pick up and drop some rest 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.590
 to be able to touch 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.360
 after a video minute of rest of the 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.940
 mass but I get the ear in the woman 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:53.890
 open the dough to be able to assemble the pie 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:56.200
 our pie applied in the way people 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.769
 take a drill four o'clock place 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.150
 of the mass to be able to know better 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.150
 so we usually have custody of 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.769
 mass thing the team perforates in the mass and 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.769
 Let's take it to the oven now. 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.800
 So the people I found the part of 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.810
 bottom of the pie for 5 to 10 minutes to stand 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.570
 this way our underside 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.180
 because if it is not found it is completely 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.820
 since it would make the game more raw 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:37.040
 from the first to the bottom 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.040
 and now let's set up our door 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.100
 then the people will now have that already 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.230
 chose an x-ray on a date to 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.320
 under the pie and not put 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:51.020
 top US preferred today I 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.020
 I used pronounced chicken with potato 

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:04.749
 after placing the ball on top of the 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:07.659
 our pie starting from the mass 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:11.969
 I passed and I received the egg 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:11.969
 a pinch of solder and bring to the oven 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.080
 is the question at our door ready to 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.000
 be savored
