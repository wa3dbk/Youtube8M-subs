ESC this is a must-have for this RC

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.320 
ESC this is a must-have for this RC
because<00:00:21.470> well<00:00:21.740> I<00:00:22.010> lost<00:00:22.310> the<00:00:22.520> tabs<00:00:22.790> that<00:00:22.970> mount

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
because well I lost the tabs that mount

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.540 
because well I lost the tabs that mount
the<00:00:23.450> ESC<00:00:23.900> to<00:00:24.110> the<00:00:24.200> chassis<00:00:24.440> so<00:00:24.890> let's<00:00:25.310> go<00:00:25.490> ahead

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
the ESC to the chassis so let's go ahead

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.390 
the ESC to the chassis so let's go ahead
and<00:00:25.790> open<00:00:25.820> this<00:00:26.120> thing<00:00:26.180> up<00:00:26.480> and<00:00:26.720> check<00:00:26.960> it<00:00:27.140> out

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
and open this thing up and check it out

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.740 
and open this thing up and check it out
and<00:00:28.400> so<00:00:28.520> I'm<00:00:28.610> just<00:00:28.670> gonna<00:00:28.970> pull<00:00:29.240> off<00:00:29.390> the<00:00:29.539> tab

and so I'm just gonna pull off the tab

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.480 
and so I'm just gonna pull off the tab
and<00:00:30.230> this<00:00:30.590> one<00:00:30.800> I<00:00:30.830> don't<00:00:30.950> have<00:00:31.190> to<00:00:31.310> cut<00:00:31.460> open

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
staple there we go we have the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.419 
staple there we go we have the
instructions<00:00:36.230> of<00:00:36.350> course<00:00:36.409> followed<00:00:37.190> by<00:00:37.370> the

00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:37.429 
instructions of course followed by the

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:40.119 
instructions of course followed by the
cage<00:00:38.030> itself<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:38.839> then<00:00:39.499> we<00:00:39.620> have<00:00:39.859> of<00:00:40.100> course

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
cage itself and then we have of course

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.509 
cage itself and then we have of course
rpm<00:00:40.909> stickers<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:41.809> finally<00:00:42.679> the<00:00:43.010> hardware

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
rpm stickers and finally the hardware

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.489

well<00:00:44.210> guys<00:00:44.420> let's<00:00:44.780> go<00:00:44.899> ahead<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:45.260> get<00:00:45.379> this

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:45.499 
well guys let's go ahead and get this

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:47.799 
well guys let's go ahead and get this
thing<00:00:45.559> installed<00:00:45.999> so<00:00:46.999> the<00:00:47.030> first<00:00:47.329> thing<00:00:47.510> is<00:00:47.659> to

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
thing installed so the first thing is to

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.540 
thing installed so the first thing is to
go<00:00:47.960> ahead<00:00:48.199> and<00:00:48.350> move<00:00:48.469> the<00:00:48.559> ESC<00:00:49.010> out<00:00:49.190> of<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.399> way

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
go ahead and move the ESC out of the way

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.340 
go ahead and move the ESC out of the way
and<00:00:50.030> now<00:00:50.300> we<00:00:50.359> need<00:00:50.569> to<00:00:50.659> go<00:00:50.780> ahead<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:51.079> attach

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
and now we need to go ahead and attach

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.099 
and now we need to go ahead and attach
the<00:00:51.679> mounting<00:00:52.159> plate<00:00:52.609> which<00:00:53.329> ever<00:00:53.600> this

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
the mounting plate which ever this

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.739 
the mounting plate which ever this
corner<00:00:54.620> is<00:00:54.800> facing<00:00:55.429> is<00:00:55.609> the<00:00:55.789> way<00:00:55.999> the<00:00:56.239> ESC<00:00:56.719> is

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:56.749 
corner is facing is the way the ESC is

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:58.209 
corner is facing is the way the ESC is
going<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.050> be<00:00:57.109> facing<00:00:57.350> since<00:00:57.739> I<00:00:57.889> want<00:00:58.100> to

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
going to be facing since I want to

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.860 
going to be facing since I want to
facing<00:00:58.549> this<00:00:58.699> way<00:00:58.760> I'm<00:00:59.239> gonna<00:00:59.389> be<00:00:59.569> attaching

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
facing this way I'm gonna be attaching

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.169 
facing this way I'm gonna be attaching
it<00:01:00.170> just<00:01:00.469> like<00:01:00.649> this<00:01:00.979> it's<00:01:01.609> held<00:01:01.909> to<00:01:02.089> the

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
it just like this it's held to the

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.720 
it just like this it's held to the
chassis<00:01:02.449> using<00:01:02.960> two<00:01:03.350> screws<00:01:03.769> one<00:01:04.400> on<00:01:04.670> each

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
chassis using two screws one on each

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.760 
chassis using two screws one on each
side<00:01:04.940> after<00:01:05.930> that<00:01:06.080> it's<00:01:06.290> time<00:01:06.470> to<00:01:06.620> go<00:01:06.740> ahead

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
side after that it's time to go ahead

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.050 
side after that it's time to go ahead
and<00:01:07.190> plug<00:01:07.370> the<00:01:07.580> motor<00:01:07.790> from<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.240> ESC<00:01:08.900> with<00:01:10.060> a

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
and plug the motor from the ESC with a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.120 
and plug the motor from the ESC with a
motor<00:01:11.360> on<00:01:11.450> pledge<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:12.110> can<00:01:12.260> now<00:01:12.440> install<00:01:12.950> the

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
motor on pledge you can now install the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.090 
motor on pledge you can now install the
cage<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:14.510> cage<00:01:14.840> is<00:01:15.200> going<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.440> be<00:01:15.530> fed<00:01:15.800> over

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
cage the cage is going to be fed over

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.720 
cage the cage is going to be fed over
all<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:17.030> cables<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:17.870> pushed<00:01:18.470> down<00:01:18.730> but

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
all the cables and pushed down but

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.400 
all the cables and pushed down but
before<00:01:20.030> you<00:01:20.120> attach<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:20.840> bottom<00:01:21.020> plate

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
before you attach it to the bottom plate

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.780 
before you attach it to the bottom plate
there's<00:01:21.680> one<00:01:21.920> thing<00:01:22.100> I<00:01:22.220> should<00:01:22.280> go<00:01:22.490> ahead<00:01:22.580> and

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
there's one thing I should go ahead and

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.320 
there's one thing I should go ahead and
mention<00:01:23.180> if<00:01:23.330> you<00:01:24.020> want<00:01:24.320> to<00:01:24.500> use<00:01:24.710> this<00:01:24.920> cable

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
mention if you want to use this cable

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.730 
mention if you want to use this cable
make<00:01:26.330> sure<00:01:26.600> that<00:01:26.780> you<00:01:26.900> take<00:01:27.110> it<00:01:27.290> out<00:01:27.500> of<00:01:27.530> the

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
make sure that you take it out of the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.040 
make sure that you take it out of the
little<00:01:27.920> brace<00:01:28.220> if<00:01:28.580> not<00:01:29.150> go<00:01:29.420> ahead<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:29.780> stick

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
little brace if not go ahead and stick

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.230 
little brace if not go ahead and stick
it<00:01:30.230> right<00:01:30.380> into<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.100> brace<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.670> you'll<00:01:31.940> see

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
it right into the brace and you'll see

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.330 
it right into the brace and you'll see
that<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:33.020> cage<00:01:33.230> actually<00:01:33.800> covers<00:01:34.160> it<00:01:34.310> and

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
that the cage actually covers it and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.580 
that the cage actually covers it and
keeps<00:01:34.700> it<00:01:34.820> in<00:01:35.030> that<00:01:35.150> place<00:01:35.390> now

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
keeps it in that place now

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.860 
keeps it in that place now
it<00:01:36.650> gets<00:01:36.890> attached<00:01:37.250> to<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:38.060> mounting<00:01:38.570> plate

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
it gets attached to the mounting plate

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.330 
it gets attached to the mounting plate
using<00:01:39.470> four<00:01:40.190> screws<00:01:40.820> one<00:01:41.540> on<00:01:41.780> each<00:01:42.170> corner
