00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
what I did come up with was this block

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.999 
what I did come up with was this block
here<00:01:59.070> with<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.640> rubber<00:02:00.090> sheet<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.960> pretty<00:02:01.920> much

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
here with a rubber sheet and pretty much

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.090 
here with a rubber sheet and pretty much
just<00:02:02.070> drilled<00:02:02.759> two<00:02:03.240> holes<00:02:03.270> here<00:02:03.950> drill<00:02:04.950> two

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
just drilled two holes here drill two

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.940 
just drilled two holes here drill two
holes<00:02:05.130> up<00:02:05.640> here<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.619> connected<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.740> with<00:02:07.829> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
holes up here and connected it with the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.330 
holes up here and connected it with the
wood<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:09.030> stopped<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.750> it's<00:02:10.200> it's

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
wood and it stopped it and it's it's

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.339 
wood and it stopped it and it's it's
touching<00:02:11.940> but<00:02:12.300> it's<00:02:12.420> kind<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.840> pressing<00:02:13.260> up

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
touching but it's kind of pressing up

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.120 
touching but it's kind of pressing up
against<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:14.099> did<00:02:14.550> email<00:02:14.730> euro<00:02:15.180> tubes<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:16.130> to

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
against it I did email euro tubes to to

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.890 
against it I did email euro tubes to to
just<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.880> know<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.239> sent<00:02:18.630> him<00:02:18.720> some<00:02:18.870> pictures

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
just you know I sent him some pictures

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.900 
just you know I sent him some pictures
just<00:02:19.440> so<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.709> way<00:02:19.950> they<00:02:20.130> could<00:02:20.280> tell<00:02:20.520> me<00:02:20.700> if

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
just so that way they could tell me if

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.820 
just so that way they could tell me if
it<00:02:21.030> was<00:02:21.120> even<00:02:21.330> healthy<00:02:21.720> got<00:02:22.319> an<00:02:22.440> email<00:02:22.530> back

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
it was even healthy got an email back

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.030 
it was even healthy got an email back
and<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:23.069> said<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.430> was<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:25.040> PV

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
and I said that it was that the PV

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.759 
and I said that it was that the PV
classic<00:02:26.819> 50<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.209> think<00:02:27.300> uses<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.989> same<00:02:28.290> method

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
classic 50 I think uses the same method

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.080 
classic 50 I think uses the same method
and<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.660> prevent<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.530> Brattle<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.250> just

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
and to to to prevent to Brattle and just

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.180 
and to to to prevent to Brattle and just
like<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.360> it's<00:02:33.840> it's<00:02:34.470> worked<00:02:34.680> for<00:02:34.739> me<00:02:34.890> and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
like that it's it's worked for me and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.360 
like that it's it's worked for me and
it's<00:02:36.060> working<00:02:36.569> really<00:02:36.780> really<00:02:37.170> great<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.680> I

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
it's working really really great and I

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.160 
it's working really really great and I
haven't<00:02:38.640> heard<00:02:38.760> anything<00:02:38.940> else<00:02:39.150> thought<00:02:39.989> I'd

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
haven't heard anything else thought I'd

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.460

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
soldering all I'm doing here is just

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.830 
soldering all I'm doing here is just
touching<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.370> kind<00:03:17.880> of<00:03:17.970> pressing<00:03:18.329> up<00:03:18.450> against

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
touching it kind of pressing up against

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.110 
touching it kind of pressing up against
it<00:03:18.989> it's<00:03:19.440> not<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:19.890> know<00:03:19.980> full-fledged<00:03:20.609> a<00:03:20.820> lot

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
it it's not you know full-fledged a lot

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.990 
it it's not you know full-fledged a lot
of<00:03:21.269> force<00:03:21.570> up<00:03:22.350> on<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.739> tubes<00:03:23.040> so<00:03:23.730> yeah<00:03:23.940> you

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
of force up on the tubes so yeah you

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.729 
of force up on the tubes so yeah you
don't<00:03:24.209> want<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.480> do<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:24.720> again<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:25.530> don't

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
don't want to do that again you don't

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.039 
don't want to do that again you don't
want<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.070> put<00:03:26.280> just<00:03:26.579> wood<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.239> touching<00:03:27.930> it

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
want to put just wood to touching it

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.130 
want to put just wood to touching it
because<00:03:28.260> these<00:03:28.950> things<00:03:29.250> do<00:03:29.579> get<00:03:29.730> hot<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.510> will

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
because these things do get hot and will

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.289 
because these things do get hot and will
cause<00:03:31.319> or<00:03:31.829> could<00:03:32.280> cause<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:32.549> fire<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.269> you

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
cause or could cause a fire and you

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.390 
cause or could cause a fire and you
don't<00:03:33.750> want<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:34.019> so<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.290> want<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.739> use<00:03:34.890> some

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
don't want that so you want to use some

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.640 
don't want that so you want to use some
type<00:03:35.430> of<00:03:35.579> rubber<00:03:36.049> and<00:03:37.049> don't<00:03:37.290> use<00:03:37.410> metal

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
type of rubber and don't use metal

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.559 
type of rubber and don't use metal
either<00:03:37.890> because<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.459> think<00:03:38.910> since<00:03:39.329> they<00:03:39.450> are

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
either because I think since they are

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.460 
either because I think since they are
rattling<00:03:40.130> they<00:03:41.130> could<00:03:41.459> possibly<00:03:42.450> crack<00:03:42.959> or

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
rattling they could possibly crack or

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.780 
rattling they could possibly crack or
break<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.980> tubes<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.489> don't<00:03:44.609> want<00:03:44.730> to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
break the tubes and you don't want to
