00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello everyone how are you if it is 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.150
 your first video tell you there are two 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.730
 previous related to hair with 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.320
 the hair with the extensions where I 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.000
 I cut where I cut bangs and 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.660
 where I cut the extensions for 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.660
 shape it 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.180
 this video we will try another 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.240
 and it's going to be how to mold our hair 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.800
 I'm going to give shape by giving you curls and going 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.570
 to be with these tweezers that I have 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.460
 asked mostly for now to go 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.320
 I wanted some so I did not 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.870
 they will occupy a lot and have both 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.640
 functions this first view then I 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.320
 it seemed pretty good now it's 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.870
 loading by the nearby is a bit 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.910
 tense to tell you that we 're going to try it on 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.640
 to see how it goes is the brand that I 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.970
 I've got it in vp fashion have 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.430
 there also products for hair and 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:01.510
 the good thing is that it can be done 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.640
 curl well with this to grab the hair and 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.280
 then apart you have here also this 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.900
 function that is to open as well 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.240
 you can see, I'm seeing it 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.490
 the video camera opening it then 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.979
 you can smooth it here then you can see 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.110
 which is lit by a red light and the 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.740
 cylinder thickness so to speak are 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.390
 26 millimeters and well let's try it 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.900
 let's go there to see how I'm doing 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.550
 Give light waves to the hair 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.700
 just to give you a little bit of 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:33.510
 way I usually put as I have tried 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.640
 because I never had one like that in another 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.580
 video giving me curl hair with hair 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.890
 short because I have one that is a cone and goes 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.540
 from fatter to more finite but from 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.460
 this cylindrical xi then I do not have 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.460
 then we go there we are going to take 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.170
 I'm going to give you only at the beginning I do not want 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.970
 give it up everything we are going to leave 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.970
 there that hot a little 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.280
 in this you have no problem because it has 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.439
 this part of up here that you can 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.219
 touch and we will burn the other one that I 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.080
 I have instead it's very narrow and it 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.780
 it's a bit complicated if it's not used 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.769
 or before the other I had bought 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.220
 to a friend who is a hairdresser and a 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:21.560
 provider then well then they are the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.290
 I took them sells them to him the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.569
 catalog and then you can sell the good 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:31.319
 there is the curl while I talk to 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:35.060
 you let it cool a little 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:38.459
 and that is undoing as always 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.499
 the part is down we take made 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.499
 we stretch and we do it out 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.430
 we leave a little bit about 20 seconds or 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.430
 A) Yes 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.990
 and let's see how it is taking shape 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.240
 Well, now I'm going to continue all 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.820
 the hair just catching like this a few 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.230
 tuft cited the tip also the part of 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.230
 down like this 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.900
 as you can see, it is also 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.239
 just give it a pass and it's already 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.280
 the curl I think is pretty good 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.110
 my problem with her I will leave you down in 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.900
 the information house if you want 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.610
 take a look at a visual and I'll 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.610
 continue with a hair rest 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.680
 when doing it for inside the bangs 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:50.590
 so yes I already take it from above and 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.650
 a little bit like that, ligerito, I do not want 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:58.019
 do it very much inside that is very 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.019
 abruptly so to give it a little touch 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.890
 and for outside 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.360
 I wait a little there 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.360
 and ready 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.870
 we can also take the part from here 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.560
 up and make us a light load 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.560
 A) Yes 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.580
 next step would be to take a brush 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:37.750
 so that the curl could be undone 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.950
 there is a perfect curl 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.950
 and it would be ready 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.310
 tell me down here in comments if you 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.960
 liked it 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.490
 this and if you have already had one I 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.770
 truth that is the first and I will come 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.690
 great for my holidays and nothing more 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.640
