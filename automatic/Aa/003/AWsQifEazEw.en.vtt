00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello friends here who speaks is educating 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.170
 I made it to another game of 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.679
 world Cup 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.290
 this time the eighth-finals netherlands and 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.580
 Mexico, that's where I play in Holland and Mexico. 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.470
 two teams campaigned 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.710
 relatively good, right? 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.590
 in the first phase the squid made the best 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.230
 the whole cup campaign and there you go. 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.609
 a very strong team and let's see let's go 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.519
 see if this year will be that Holland 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.130
 to win the cup I think not but there's 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.360
 chances there are great chances to reach 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.350
 until the end, right? 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.430
 but honestly I do not know why I 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.090
 I have a feeling of tragedy for 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.090
 the netherlands 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.809
 Game Picked Think Mexico And Play 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.700
 That's because we can 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.640
 realize that Holland had problems there 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.350
 and past Australia is despite having 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.440
 spent the last 20 years in Chile 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.859
 boom wrong but not there 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.120
 I think the defense of Mexico is better 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.519
 that the defense of chile 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.970
 so I do not know, man I think it's going to have 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.890
 a little more tranquility but even 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.150
 so I still think it's going to be Holland 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.610
 better than this weird feeling 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.040
 It may be that something is wrong but 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.950
 I think it's going to be from Holland but we're going to have 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.150
 a good score I 'll be 3 to 2 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.070
 holland is well taken care of at the same time well 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.689
 complicated because as I said I think 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.920
 Mexico will do a lot of work not 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.490
 I think Lula will have a ride. 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.610
 I'm calm about Mexico and I bet 18 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.610
 year but I do not do not say that no mexico 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.579
 I can not win, I do not know, I'm fine. 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.009
 weird feeling but I do not know I 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.829
 'm thinking it will give Holland more 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.100
 mexico can surprise and I get sometimes 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.290
 Until goal is the lesson, that's my voice and 3 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.909
 to 2 to the holland was not there we passed 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.009
 by the census is now in Europeans ' 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.360
 Leave the comments do not 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.920
