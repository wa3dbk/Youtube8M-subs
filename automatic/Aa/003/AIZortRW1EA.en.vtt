decision

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.740 
decision
then<00:01:59.430> breaking<00:01:59.850> down<00:02:00.030> there<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.329> think<00:02:00.450> a

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
then breaking down there I think a

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.679 
then breaking down there I think a
little<00:02:00.869> bit<00:02:01.130> ok<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.340> longer<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:02.880> make<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
little bit ok the longer we make the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.170 
little bit ok the longer we make the
pass

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
pass

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.900 
pass
the<00:02:06.110> more<00:02:06.320> time<00:02:06.590> defenders<00:02:07.220> have<00:02:07.400> a<00:02:07.460> chance<00:02:07.730> to

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
the more time defenders have a chance to

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.480 
the more time defenders have a chance to
get<00:02:08.060> in<00:02:08.240> and<00:02:08.540> then<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.619> fifth<00:02:09.890> thing<00:02:09.979> we<00:02:10.250> need

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
get in and then the fifth thing we need

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.380 
get in and then the fifth thing we need
is<00:02:10.729> execution<00:02:11.450> so<00:02:12.350> we<00:02:12.500> need<00:02:12.680> an<00:02:12.890> esper<00:02:13.430> stop<00:02:14.030> a
