Junior dos Santos would want to take
John<00:00:27.570> Jones<00:00:27.930> took<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.289> ground<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.369> who<00:00:30.210> would

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
Junior dos Santos I do see a slight

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.330 
Junior dos Santos I do see a slight
weakness<00:00:35.989> in<00:00:36.989> John<00:00:37.440> Jones<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.890> stand<00:00:38.160> up

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
weakness in John Jones to stand up

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.100 
weakness in John Jones to stand up
although<00:00:38.550> John<00:00:38.969> Jones<00:00:39.300> has<00:00:39.510> not<00:00:39.690> showed<00:00:39.930> much

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
although John Jones has not showed much

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.860 
although John Jones has not showed much
weakness<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.620> didn't<00:00:40.829> up<00:00:41.040> until<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.340> point

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
weakness up didn't up until this point

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.030 
weakness up didn't up until this point
when<00:00:42.870> he<00:00:42.960> fought<00:00:43.200> later<00:00:43.530> Machida

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
when he fought later Machida

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.860 
when he fought later Machida
I<00:00:44.250> thought<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.879> whatever<00:00:45.180> won<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.660> first

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
I thought that whatever won the first

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.619 
I thought that whatever won the first
round<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:47.250> unless<00:00:47.700> John<00:00:48.149> Jones<00:00:48.420> took

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
round and that unless John Jones took

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.110 
round and that unless John Jones took
him<00:00:48.780> down<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.140> ground<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.860> other<00:00:50.820> was

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
him down to the ground the other was

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.020 
him down to the ground the other was
going<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.360> continue<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.750> win<00:00:51.870> rounds<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:53.030> but

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
going to continue to win rounds so but

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.569 
going to continue to win rounds so but
John<00:00:54.300> knew<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.690> took<00:00:55.379> him<00:00:55.530> down<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.039> changed

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
John knew that took him down and changed

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.220 
John knew that took him down and changed
the<00:00:56.670> course<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.090> fight<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.079> this

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the course of the fight but in this

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.680 
the course of the fight but in this
fight<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.800> don't<00:00:59.010> see<00:00:59.250> John<00:00:59.760> Jones<00:01:00.770> taking

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
fight I just don't see John Jones taking

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.440 
fight I just don't see John Jones taking
Junior<00:01:03.690> dos<00:01:03.840> Santos<00:01:03.870> down<00:01:04.559> if<00:01:05.309> he<00:01:06.000> could<00:01:06.240> take

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
Junior dos Santos down if he could take

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.600 
Junior dos Santos down if he could take
him<00:01:06.689> down<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.439> fight<00:01:07.680> might<00:01:08.189> be<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> little

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
him down the fight might be a little

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.130 
him down the fight might be a little
different<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.540> don't<00:01:09.750> think<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.020> would

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
different but I don't think it would

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.450 
different but I don't think it would
happen<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:11.159> think<00:01:11.240> jr.<00:01:12.240> would<00:01:12.650> smash<00:01:13.650> John

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
happen and I think jr. would smash John

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.670 
happen and I think jr. would smash John
Jones<00:01:14.850> he<00:01:15.479> doesn't<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.080> reach<00:01:16.259> but<00:01:16.290> he

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
Jones he doesn't have the reach but he

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.950 
Jones he doesn't have the reach but he
would<00:01:16.830> get<00:01:16.979> inside<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:18.479> haven't<00:01:18.750> seen

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
would get inside and we haven't seen

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.020 
would get inside and we haven't seen
John<00:01:19.170> Jones<00:01:19.530> rocked<00:01:19.830> then<00:01:20.369> I'm<00:01:20.490> sure<00:01:20.729> if<00:01:20.880> these

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
John Jones rocked then I'm sure if these

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.179
