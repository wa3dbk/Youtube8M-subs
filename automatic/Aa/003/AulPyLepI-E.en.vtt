00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
for this lesson is to just take the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.290 
for this lesson is to just take the
basic<00:01:16.620> open<00:01:16.830> chords<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.550> that<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.030> work

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
basic open chords that you that you work

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.100 
basic open chords that you that you work
on<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.840> when<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.440> strum<00:01:19.770> them<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.610> try

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
on and when you strum them you can try

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.660 
on and when you strum them you can try
typically<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.320> lowest<00:01:22.560> sounding<00:01:23.340> note<00:01:23.550> of

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
typically the lowest sounding note of

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.870 
typically the lowest sounding note of
the<00:01:23.730> chord<00:01:23.990> isn't<00:01:24.990> necessarily<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:26.490> best<00:01:26.520> one

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the chord isn't necessarily the best one

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.750 
the chord isn't necessarily the best one
to<00:01:26.970> do<00:01:27.120> it<00:01:27.150> but<00:01:27.840> either<00:01:28.050> of<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:29.130> higher<00:01:29.370> notes

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
to do it but either of the higher notes

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.210 
to do it but either of the higher notes
of<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.030> chord<00:01:30.060> any<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.140> these<00:01:31.260> cowboy<00:01:31.740> chords

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
of a chord any of these cowboy chords

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.100 
of a chord any of these cowboy chords
open<00:01:32.490> chords<00:01:32.790> what<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.360> can<00:01:33.510> do<00:01:33.660> is<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.020> can

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
open chords what you can do is you can

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.690 
open chords what you can do is you can
start<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.440> practice<00:01:34.620> like<00:01:35.070> instead<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.520> just

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
start to practice like instead of just

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.030 
start to practice like instead of just
forming<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.180> whole<00:01:36.300> chord<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:37.650> doing<00:01:37.890> not

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
forming the whole chord and doing not

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.830 
forming the whole chord and doing not
eventually<00:01:38.790> as<00:01:39.120> you<00:01:39.150> get<00:01:39.390> better<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
eventually as you get better with the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.660 
eventually as you get better with the
chord<00:01:40.230> you<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.980> this<00:01:41.190> you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.400> kind<00:01:41.640> of

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
chord you can do this you can kind of

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.350 
chord you can do this you can kind of
form<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.330> chord<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:43.820> relax<00:01:44.820> one<00:01:45.150> of<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
form the chord and relax one of the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.070 
form the chord and relax one of the
fingers<00:01:45.660> of<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.870> chord<00:01:46.110> open

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
fingers of the chord open

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.800 
fingers of the chord open
then<00:01:48.230> strum<00:01:49.010> one<00:01:49.400> of<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.640> notes<00:01:49.820> down<00:01:50.090> after

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
then strum one of the notes down after

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.340 
then strum one of the notes down after
the<00:01:51.380> other<00:01:51.560> notes<00:01:51.830> of<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.010> court<00:01:52.190> like<00:01:53.350> like

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
the other notes of the court like like

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:14.420

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.010 

so<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:15.490> could<00:02:15.640> strum<00:02:15.940> at<00:02:16.090> first<00:02:16.330> then<00:02:16.630> hammer

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
so you could strum at first then hammer

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.700 
so you could strum at first then hammer
it<00:02:17.140> as<00:02:17.410> well

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.630 

you<00:02:23.490> can<00:02:23.640> do<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.790> with<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.000> finger<00:02:25.640> and

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
you can do it with that finger and

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.830 
you can do it with that finger and
they're<00:02:26.910> gonna<00:02:27.000> have<00:02:27.210> different<00:02:27.600> emotional

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
they're gonna have different emotional

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:36.860 
they're gonna have different emotional
qualities<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.710> them<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.160> one

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.580 

but<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.769> good<00:02:38.010> start<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.549> just<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:39.440> finger<00:02:40.440> that's

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
but a good start is just a finger that's

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.039 
but a good start is just a finger that's
already<00:02:40.950> going<00:02:41.129> to<00:02:41.250> be<00:02:41.489> on<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.480> cord<00:02:42.750> and

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
taking it off and putting it back on or

that<00:05:46.819> but<00:05:47.060> watch<00:05:47.270> I<00:05:47.419> was<00:05:47.569> a<00:05:47.599> pick<00:05:47.810> each<00:05:47.930> note

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190

but<00:05:51.120> what<00:05:51.300> I'll<00:05:51.390> do<00:05:51.570> is<00:05:51.720> when<00:05:51.870> I<00:05:51.900> get<00:05:52.110> to<00:05:52.230> the<00:05:52.410> D

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
but what I'll do is when I get to the D

00:05:52.620 --> 00:06:29.780 
but what I'll do is when I get to the D
I'm<00:05:53.010> going<00:05:53.100> to<00:05:53.280> pull<00:05:53.460> it<00:05:53.580> off

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.910 

I<00:06:29.960> don't<00:06:30.960> know<00:06:31.080> if<00:06:31.170> you<00:06:31.260> caught<00:06:31.500> what<00:06:31.740> that

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:31.920

sounded<00:06:32.310> like<00:06:32.460> but<00:06:32.760> um<00:06:32.970> but<00:06:33.660> that's<00:06:33.930> another

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
sounded like but um but that's another

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.760 
sounded like but um but that's another
concept<00:06:34.950> you<00:06:35.820> know<00:06:35.940> another<00:06:36.900> example<00:06:37.440> of<00:06:37.560> that

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770
