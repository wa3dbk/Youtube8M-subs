they're<00:02:09.260> just<00:02:09.380> got<00:02:09.530> numbers<00:02:09.940> but<00:02:10.940> I<00:02:11.270> guess

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
they're just got numbers but I guess

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.960 
they're just got numbers but I guess
that's<00:02:12.200> all<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.560> do<00:02:12.650> with<00:02:12.680> how<00:02:12.980> sort<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:13.730> no

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
that's all to do with how sort of no

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.450 
that's all to do with how sort of no
frills<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.690> ranges<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:15.860> i'm<00:02:16.100> going<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.280> use

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
frills the ranges so i'm going to use

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.340 
frills the ranges so i'm going to use
pencil<00:02:17.030> brush<00:02:17.180> for<00:02:17.660> this<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:20.810> first<00:02:21.050> time

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
way down to the tear duct so following

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.230 
way down to the tear duct so following
the<00:02:35.840> line<00:02:36.340> there<00:02:38.830> socket<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.010> then<00:02:40.970> get<00:02:41.210> a

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
the line there socket and then get a

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.030 
the line there socket and then get a
fluffy<00:02:41.750> blending<00:02:42.020> brush<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:44.800> blend<00:02:45.800> that

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
and then in the same again to just build

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.789 
and then in the same again to just build
this<00:03:07.019> color<00:03:07.290> up<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:10.200> this<00:03:10.319> time<00:03:10.500> we're<00:03:10.650> not

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
this color up and this time we're not

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
going to take it quite so far around so

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.789 
going to take it quite so far around so
only<00:03:13.739> halfway<00:03:14.069> through<00:03:14.599> the<00:03:15.599> crease<00:03:15.840> and

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
only halfway through the crease and

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.179 
I've got like a completely black line
but<00:04:52.810> I<00:04:52.840> think<00:04:53.169> for<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.710> fact<00:04:53.889> that<00:04:53.919> it's<00:04:54.129> a

00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:54.189 
but I think for the fact that it's a

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:57.689 
but I think for the fact that it's a
pound<00:04:54.490> rather<00:04:55.300> than<00:04:55.650> 5<00:04:56.650> pounds<00:04:56.889> open<00:04:57.370> like<00:04:57.490> 10

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
pound rather than 5 pounds open like 10

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.379 
pound rather than 5 pounds open like 10
pounds<00:04:57.849> or<00:04:58.090> more<00:04:58.120> like<00:04:58.990> other<00:04:59.199> liquid<00:04:59.590> liners

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
pounds or more like other liquid liners

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:07.879 
pounds or more like other liquid liners
I'm<00:05:01.389> not<00:05:01.659> going<00:05:01.840> to<00:05:01.900> complain<00:05:02.080> too<00:05:02.349> much<00:05:05.940> and

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
I'm not going to complain too much and

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.180 
I'm not going to complain too much and
then<00:05:08.889> finally<00:05:09.460> do<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.180> thin<00:05:10.539> line<00:05:10.780> on<00:05:11.349> the

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
then finally do the thin line on the

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:19.460 
then finally do the thin line on the
inside<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:15.250> that<00:05:15.849> chapter<00:05:16.270> again

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.350

on<00:06:17.580> most<00:06:17.790> pinup<00:06:18.240> looks<00:06:18.710> we've<00:06:19.710> got<00:06:19.890> very<00:06:20.580> neat

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
on most pinup looks we've got very neat

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:28.400 
on most pinup looks we've got very neat
filled<00:06:22.350> in<00:06:23.690> eyebrows<00:06:25.460> quite<00:06:26.900> strong<00:06:27.900> not<00:06:28.200> very

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
filled in eyebrows quite strong not very

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.100 
filled in eyebrows quite strong not very
thick<00:06:28.650> we're<00:06:29.220> definitely<00:06:29.370> strong<00:06:31.070> say

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
thick we're definitely strong say

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.150 
thick we're definitely strong say
unfortunately<00:06:34.110> I'm<00:06:34.350> my<00:06:34.530> eyebrows<00:06:34.919> and

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
unfortunately I'm my eyebrows and

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.310 
unfortunately I'm my eyebrows and
actually<00:06:35.520> a<00:06:35.580> little<00:06:35.760> bit<00:06:35.940> wonky<00:06:36.120> and<00:06:38.990> an<00:06:39.990> even

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
actually a little bit wonky and an even

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.190 
actually a little bit wonky and an even
but<00:06:41.540> they're<00:06:42.540> gay<00:06:42.690> I<00:06:42.720> think<00:06:42.810> they<00:06:43.050> look<00:06:43.169> pretty

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
but they're gay I think they look pretty

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.530 
but they're gay I think they look pretty
similar<00:06:43.530> and<00:06:44.270> then<00:06:45.270> final<00:06:45.720> step<00:06:45.990> is<00:06:47.540> your

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:48.540 
similar and then final step is your

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.890 
similar and then final step is your
pinup<00:06:49.290> red<00:06:49.650> lipstick<00:06:50.100> and<00:06:50.370> this<00:06:50.880> is<00:06:51.120> shade

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 
pinup red lipstick and this is shade

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:58.070 
pinup red lipstick and this is shade
number<00:06:53.540> 13<00:06:55.580> so<00:06:56.580> what<00:06:57.540> I'm<00:06:57.630> going<00:06:57.720> to<00:06:57.780> do<00:06:57.930> is

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 
number 13 so what I'm going to do is

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.060 
number 13 so what I'm going to do is
because<00:06:58.260> I'm<00:06:58.320> not<00:06:58.440> quite<00:06:58.590> very<00:06:58.770> enough<00:06:58.979> to

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070 
because I'm not quite very enough to

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.240 
because I'm not quite very enough to
apply<00:06:59.220> it<00:06:59.310> straight<00:06:59.550> out<00:06:59.640> of<00:06:59.700> the<00:07:00.419> tube<00:07:01.250> going

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.250 
apply it straight out of the tube going

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:09.159 
apply it straight out of the tube going
to<00:07:02.310> use<00:07:02.430> a<00:07:02.460> lip<00:07:02.669> brush<00:07:03.169> and<00:07:04.169> just<00:07:04.320> pop<00:07:04.530> them

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:09.169 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:11.619 

I<00:07:09.229> find<00:07:10.159> it<00:07:10.279> helps<00:07:10.490> to<00:07:10.580> trace<00:07:10.789> the<00:07:10.969> outside<00:07:11.509> of

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:11.629 
I find it helps to trace the outside of

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:14.320 
I find it helps to trace the outside of
your<00:07:11.689> lips<00:07:11.870> first<00:07:12.169> and<00:07:12.939> then<00:07:13.939> fill<00:07:14.120> in<00:07:14.240> the

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.330 
your lips first and then fill in the

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:35.940 
your lips first and then fill in the
center

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:35.950 

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.250 

and<00:07:37.180> then<00:07:38.180> we<00:07:38.240> have<00:07:38.360> it<00:07:38.480> to<00:07:38.720> a<00:07:38.750> four-pound

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:39.260 
and then we have it to a four-pound

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.560 
and then we have it to a four-pound
pinup<00:07:39.650> inspired<00:07:39.980> makeup<00:07:40.370> look<00:07:40.430> I<00:07:40.940> hope<00:07:41.360> you've
