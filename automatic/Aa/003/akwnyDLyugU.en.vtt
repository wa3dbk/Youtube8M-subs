00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
value of education and I concluded that

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.350 
value of education and I concluded that
it<00:00:10.920> cost<00:00:11.190> too<00:00:11.370> much<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:12.030> don't<00:00:12.150> learn

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
it cost too much and you don't learn

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.560 
it cost too much and you don't learn
enough<00:00:13.820> because<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:14.849> don't<00:00:15.089> learn<00:00:15.330> exactly

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
enough because you don't learn exactly

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.380 
enough because you don't learn exactly
what<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.650> need<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.039> learn<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:18.000> to

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
what it is you need to learn and that to

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.660 
what it is you need to learn and that to
me<00:00:18.510> that's<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.810> big<00:00:18.930> pet<00:00:19.800> peeve<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.430> have

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
me that's a big pet peeve that I have

do well the technology we have that we

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.660 
do well the technology we have that we

just effing do it go out there and do it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.020 
just effing do it go out there and do it
not<00:02:35.530> any<00:02:35.770> more<00:02:36.010> complicated<00:02:36.220> than<00:02:36.819> that

and<00:03:22.989> it<00:03:23.799> learns<00:03:24.610> quicker<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.450> better<00:03:25.630> than

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
and it learns quicker and better than

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.600 
and it learns quicker and better than
anything<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:26.799> can<00:03:26.980> imagine<00:03:27.040> right<00:03:27.579> now
