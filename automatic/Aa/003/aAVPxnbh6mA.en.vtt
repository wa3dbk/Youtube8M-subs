00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
own they're a few clicks north of where

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.399 
own they're a few clicks north of where
you<00:02:02.009> are<00:02:02.189> now<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.210> non<00:02:03.390> combat<00:02:03.899> zone<00:02:04.170> so

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
you are now it's a non combat zone so

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.440 
you are now it's a non combat zone so
there<00:02:04.530> won't<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.799> any<00:02:04.920> checkpoints<00:02:05.450> there's

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
there won't be any checkpoints there's

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.290 
there won't be any checkpoints there's
even<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.840> dialysis<00:02:07.469> machine

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
even a dialysis machine

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.470 
even a dialysis machine
it'll<00:02:08.870> take<00:02:09.080> some<00:02:09.260> time<00:02:09.320> but<00:02:09.890> I<00:02:10.430> think<00:02:11.240> he'll

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
it'll take some time but I think he'll

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
be okay good anyway you need to hurry
