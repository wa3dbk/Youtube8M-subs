00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
I would assume that most the time I kind

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.399 
I would assume that most the time I kind
of<00:01:02.520> zone<00:01:02.760> out<00:01:03.000> like<00:01:03.210> most<00:01:03.420> people<00:01:03.719> but<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.960> just

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
of zone out like most people but I just

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.929
