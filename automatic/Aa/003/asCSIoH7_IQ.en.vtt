I<00:02:08.640> really<00:02:09.510> like<00:02:09.630> this<00:02:09.869> snake<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.290> even<00:02:10.530> though

is<00:02:13.380> somewhat<00:02:13.860> problematic<00:02:14.220> as<00:02:14.880> rush<00:02:15.090> just

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
is somewhat problematic as rush just

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.180 
is somewhat problematic as rush just

when<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.400> council<00:02:23.880> i<00:02:23.940> think<00:02:24.239> has<00:02:24.480> also<00:02:24.810> this

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
when this council i think has also this

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.600 
when this council i think has also this
moving<00:02:25.590> snake<00:02:25.830> but<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.160> doesn't<00:02:26.459> mean<00:02:26.580> that

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
moving snake but that doesn't mean that

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.820 
moving snake but that doesn't mean that
it<00:02:26.910> is<00:02:27.030> great<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.230> does<00:02:28.380> better<00:02:28.739> than

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
it is great and it does better than

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.860 
it is great and it does better than
super<00:02:29.220> mario<00:02:29.519> world<00:02:29.700> which<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.090> kind<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.630> rare

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
super mario world which is kind of rare

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.130 
super mario world which is kind of rare
for<00:02:31.049> a<00:02:31.080> megaman<00:02:31.440> game<00:02:31.650> i<00:02:31.680> think<00:02:32.720> this<00:02:33.720> is<00:02:33.780> like

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
for a megaman game i think this is like

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.050 
for a megaman game i think this is like
an<00:02:34.320> auto-scrolling<00:02:34.680> stage<00:02:35.250> than<00:02:35.519> completely

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
an auto-scrolling stage than completely

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.830 
an auto-scrolling stage than completely
right<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.470> right<00:02:37.760> speed<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.239> you

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
right it is the right speed and you

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.120 
right it is the right speed and you
never<00:02:40.080> feel<00:02:40.380> like<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.830> wait<00:02:41.100> for

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
never feel like you have to wait for

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.699 
never feel like you have to wait for
something<00:02:41.820> except<00:02:42.390> for<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.720> short<00:02:43.380> bit<00:02:43.530> at<00:02:43.680> the

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
something except for a short bit at the

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:44.840 
something except for a short bit at the
end<00:02:43.830> here<00:02:44.100> but<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.340> doesn't<00:02:44.580> really<00:02:44.640> matter

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
end here but it doesn't really matter

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.390 
end here but it doesn't really matter
and<00:02:45.090> fell<00:02:45.269> from<00:02:45.450> above<00:02:45.830> enough<00:02:46.830> napalm<00:02:47.190> bombs

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
and fell from above enough napalm bombs

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.590 
and fell from above enough napalm bombs
and<00:02:47.610> yeah<00:02:48.570> I<00:02:48.630> really<00:02:49.200> like<00:02:49.320> that<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:50.600> contrary

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
and yeah I really like that and contrary

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.630 
and yeah I really like that and contrary
to<00:02:51.840> many<00:02:52.140> many<00:02:52.380> gimmicks<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:53.040> Mega<00:02:53.220> Man<00:02:53.430> games

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
to many many gimmicks and Mega Man games

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.030 
to many many gimmicks and Mega Man games
it<00:02:54.180> gets<00:02:54.510> reused<00:02:54.780> later<00:02:55.049> in<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.560> stage<00:02:55.799> and

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
it gets reused later in the stage and

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.850 
it gets reused later in the stage and
it's<00:02:56.160> even<00:02:56.280> better<00:02:56.519> there<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:57.769> that's<00:02:58.769> the

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
it's even better there so that's the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.490 
it's even better there so that's the
breaks<00:02:59.130> super<00:02:59.970> air<00:03:00.209> is<00:03:00.360> still<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.750> best<00:03:00.780> deal

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
breaks super air is still the best deal

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.590 
breaks super air is still the best deal
with<00:03:01.680> those<00:03:01.860> guys<00:03:02.100> because<00:03:02.370> well<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.390> is<00:03:03.570> the

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
with those guys because well it is the

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.390

week

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.490 
week
very<00:03:05.239> glad<00:03:05.450> for<00:03:05.510> that<00:03:05.659> weapon<00:03:05.930> energy<00:03:06.319> drop

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
very glad for that weapon energy drop

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.920 
very glad for that weapon energy drop
though<00:03:06.819> now<00:03:07.819> charge<00:03:08.150> kick<00:03:08.329> is<00:03:08.480> usually<00:03:08.900> very

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
though now charge kick is usually very

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.470 
though now charge kick is usually very
good<00:03:09.379> against<00:03:09.860> those<00:03:09.980> guys<00:03:10.250> but<00:03:10.579> in<00:03:11.209> this

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
good against those guys but in this

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.460 
good against those guys but in this
instance<00:03:11.720> it's<00:03:13.540> just<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:14.780> don't<00:03:14.989> have<00:03:15.200> any

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
instance it's just you don't have any

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.589 
instance it's just you don't have any
room<00:03:15.709> behind<00:03:16.280> them<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:16.939> I'm<00:03:17.120> just<00:03:17.299> going<00:03:17.480> to

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
room behind them so I'm just going to

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.699 
room behind them so I'm just going to
test<00:03:18.019> this<00:03:18.319> right<00:03:18.709> here<00:03:18.769> yeah<00:03:20.709> stuff

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
test this right here yeah stuff

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.080 
test this right here yeah stuff
like<00:03:21.890> that<00:03:21.920> is<00:03:22.069> also<00:03:22.340> what<00:03:22.519> makes<00:03:22.579> this<00:03:22.879> stage

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
like that is also what makes this stage

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.089 
like that is also what makes this stage
great<00:03:23.420> I<00:03:23.599> mean<00:03:23.959> they<00:03:24.079> obviously<00:03:24.230> designed<00:03:24.890> it

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
great I mean they obviously designed it

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:26.410 
great I mean they obviously designed it
so<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:25.280> could<00:03:25.489> help<00:03:25.700> up<00:03:25.849> there<00:03:25.879> you<00:03:26.209> could

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
so you could help up there you could

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.569 
so you could help up there you could
have<00:03:26.510> used<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.930> Mega<00:03:27.109> Buster<00:03:27.319> too<00:03:27.709> but<00:03:28.220> that

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
have used the Mega Buster too but that

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.319 
have used the Mega Buster too but that
would<00:03:29.000> have<00:03:29.150> taken<00:03:29.359> far<00:03:29.750> more<00:03:29.780> time<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:31.329> this

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
would have taken far more time and this

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.330 
would have taken far more time and this
is<00:03:32.599> the<00:03:32.930> most<00:03:33.170> legitimate<00:03:33.620> use<00:03:33.920> for<00:03:34.129> Power

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
is the most legitimate use for Power

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.250 
is the most legitimate use for Power
Stone<00:03:34.579> I've<00:03:34.760> ever<00:03:34.879> seen<00:03:35.200> especially<00:03:36.200> if

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
Stone I've ever seen especially if

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.140 
Stone I've ever seen especially if
you're<00:03:36.379> hanging<00:03:36.620> on<00:03:36.799> the<00:03:36.950> ladder<00:03:37.159> not<00:03:37.549> an<00:03:37.790> art

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
you're hanging on the ladder not an art

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.059 
you're hanging on the ladder not an art
quick<00:03:38.450> on<00:03:38.629> the<00:03:38.720> draw<00:03:38.750> like<00:03:39.109> I<00:03:39.260> was<00:03:39.470> just<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:39.889> mean

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
quick on the draw like I was just I mean

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.069 
quick on the draw like I was just I mean
it<00:03:40.370> takes<00:03:40.579> forever<00:03:40.819> to<00:03:41.000> kill<00:03:41.239> this<00:03:41.420> guy<00:03:41.659> but

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
it takes forever to kill this guy but

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.280 
it takes forever to kill this guy but
you're<00:03:42.260> perfectly<00:03:42.739> safe<00:03:42.829> while<00:03:43.310> doing<00:03:43.519> it<00:03:43.790> and

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
you're perfectly safe while doing it and

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.619 
you're perfectly safe while doing it and
if<00:03:45.290> you<00:03:45.500> are<00:03:45.680> under<00:03:45.889> later<00:03:46.190> well<00:03:46.700> you<00:03:47.239> cannot

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
if you are under later well you cannot

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.080 
if you are under later well you cannot
use<00:03:47.810> gyro<00:03:48.170> tech<00:03:48.530> alarm<00:03:49.189> because<00:03:49.489> you<00:03:49.790> cannot

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
use gyro tech alarm because you cannot

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.020 
use gyro tech alarm because you cannot
shoot<00:03:50.359> it<00:03:50.510> upwards<00:03:50.900> so<00:03:51.319> yeah<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.220> I'm<00:03:52.790> going

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
shoot it upwards so yeah and I'm going

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.369 
shoot it upwards so yeah and I'm going
to<00:03:53.090> leave<00:03:53.269> out<00:03:53.450> powers<00:03:53.720> down<00:03:53.959> a<00:03:54.019> bit<00:03:54.200> more

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
to leave out powers down a bit more

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.339 
to leave out powers down a bit more
because<00:03:54.620> why<00:03:55.189> not<00:03:55.220> if<00:03:56.120> you<00:03:56.389> get<00:03:56.540> lucky<00:03:56.780> it<00:03:57.079> can

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
because why not if you get lucky it can

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.559 
because why not if you get lucky it can

absolutely<00:04:36.710> nothing<00:04:37.220> you<00:04:37.340> can<00:04:37.550> do<00:04:37.669> against

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
absolutely nothing you can do against

this however this is a far fair a fight

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.610 
this however this is a far fair a fight
than<00:04:41.210> Brightman<00:04:41.630> because<00:04:41.960> you<00:04:42.260> can<00:04:42.440> actually

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
than Brightman because you can actually

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.980 
than Brightman because you can actually
just<00:04:42.830> dodge<00:04:43.430> those<00:04:43.729> things<00:04:44.090> you<00:04:44.570> can<00:04:44.750> tease

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
them out by jumping at the right time

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.710 
them out by jumping at the right time
this<00:04:47.630> was<00:04:47.840> a<00:04:47.870> mistimed<00:04:48.560> on<00:04:48.889> my<00:04:49.070> end<00:04:49.419> it<00:04:50.419> is<00:04:50.690> a

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
this was a mistimed on my end it is a

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.360 
this was a mistimed on my end it is a
really<00:04:51.020> hard<00:04:51.169> boss<00:04:51.409> fight<00:04:51.650> because<00:04:52.010> it<00:04:52.039> can

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
really hard boss fight because it can

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.129 
really hard boss fight because it can
wreck<00:04:52.639> your<00:04:52.970> pretty<00:04:53.539> easily<00:04:53.750> and

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
wreck your pretty easily and

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.439 
wreck your pretty easily and
dodging<00:04:55.099> him<00:04:55.400> and<00:04:55.639> his<00:04:55.789> barrage<00:04:56.150> of<00:04:56.270> bullets

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
dodging him and his barrage of bullets

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.350 
dodging him and his barrage of bullets
isn't<00:04:56.960> too<00:04:57.110> easy<00:04:57.470> but<00:04:58.130> if<00:04:58.340> you<00:04:58.460> slide<00:04:58.849> away<00:04:59.090> at

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
isn't too easy but if you slide away at

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.540 
isn't too easy but if you slide away at
the<00:04:59.479> right<00:04:59.690> time<00:05:00.139> and<00:05:00.380> remember<00:05:00.979> that<00:05:01.250> you<00:05:01.370> can

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
the right time and remember that you can

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.250 
the right time and remember that you can
indeed<00:05:01.849> with<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.090> right<00:05:02.270> timing<00:05:02.539> tease<00:05:03.050> out

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
indeed with the right timing tease out

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.469 
indeed with the right timing tease out
his<00:05:03.500> bullets<00:05:03.919> that<00:05:04.400> frees<00:05:04.699> you<00:05:04.940> when<00:05:05.120> you<00:05:05.270> call

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
his bullets that frees you when you call

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.250 
his bullets that frees you when you call
as<00:05:05.659> you<00:05:05.690> then<00:05:06.530> it's<00:05:06.710> not<00:05:07.120> too<00:05:08.120> hard<00:05:08.389> also<00:05:08.990> gyro

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
as you then it's not too hard also gyro

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.719 
as you then it's not too hard also gyro
Tech<00:05:09.590> is<00:05:09.740> this<00:05:09.889> weakness<00:05:10.130> which<00:05:10.400> is<00:05:10.550> always

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
Tech is this weakness which is always

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.469 
Tech is this weakness which is always
good<00:05:11.060> because<00:05:11.210> gyro<00:05:11.750> tech<00:05:11.930> rules

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
good because gyro tech rules

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.570 
good because gyro tech rules
so<00:05:14.479> done<00:05:15.440> with<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:15.800> best<00:05:16.009> stage<00:05:16.280> in<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.550> game

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
my opinion at least and off to proto man

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.770 
my opinion at least and off to proto man
himself<00:05:20.740> whoa<00:05:21.740> while<00:05:22.550> that<00:05:22.580> spiky<00:05:23.240> and<00:05:23.570> I
