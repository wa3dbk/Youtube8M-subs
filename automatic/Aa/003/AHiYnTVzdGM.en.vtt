 how are you today I bring you a top 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.040
 action games war games 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.589
 but a little different to good because the 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.980
 conception of the three best games of 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:18.109
 war you have from google play many 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.300
 you will know the combat combat innova 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.279
 etcetera good then I bring you three 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.810
 games that are war that are very 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.550
 good but that are different for 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.590
 repeat me and to tell you what I already 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.330
 you know then I do not do this video so 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.130
 so good, well, I bring you three games 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.590
 that I think you're going to like a lot and that 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.170
 I warn you that as it also says in the 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.360
 that of three games that hook three 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.039
 games that are addictive then 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.379
 I notice that they are very cool and that 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.690
 they will also hook us into smaller 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.239
 measure because good because those are 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.090
 made for you to be all day 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.129
 playing these not so much but good 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.559
 are three pretty good games that 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.930
 they have some characteristics that 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.030
 they make the rest different and that I 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.829
 I have been testing and of course they are very 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.870
 very cool so good between then and 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.769
 we started talking about this this top of 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.769
 three war games 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.720
 the first one that I bring you is pixel gun 3 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.950
 of a video game that mimics what it is 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.280
 the entire planet or what is the visual of 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.190
 minecraft that is going to be all pixelated and 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.080
 that also has two game modes 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.570
 one that is campaign in which we are going to 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.850
 have to go doing different things 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.130
 as if it were the call of duty but 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.500
 in minecraft very similar good always 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.530
 for this world that is more wild by 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.869
 so say it and then a second way that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.000
 will be of war of everyone's fight against 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.149
 we're all going to have shotguns we're going to 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.690
 have knives let's have a bunch 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.850
 of weapons all in this visual type 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.640
 minecraft in which we go then that to 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.770
 playing matches is as good as a 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.350
 call of duty as I was saying or as a 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.750
 model combat but in the style of minecraft 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.060
 a video game that is free I try 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.069
 always bring free video games 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.390
 although many of you tell me good 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.670
 although they are not free we can 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.340
 get free yes but good then 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.450
 Many people do not know how to how 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.520
 create it and 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.930
 and well for the moment I have seen 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.180
 these three surely in the next 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.800
 top that go playing games os 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.319
 I will bring games that are also paid 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.870
 but well I wanted in this first 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.810
 top free trayers and well then 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.640
 I say this one of course pixel gun 3 of a 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.440
 videogame that you will like a lot and 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.900
 especially if you are fans of 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.110
 minecraft good the second of them is 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.000
 blitz bill gates a video game that 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.580
 recreated in World War II is 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.310
 totally online there are no campaigns like 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.099
 is the case with pixel gun that we were 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.200
 speaking before and well then what 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.360
 will consist of like all games of 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.840
 war we choose a side we will choose the 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.880
 axis or the allies depending on how 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.920
 we see better and good for within 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.900
 these two sides are different 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.299
 categories to me in this sense I 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.240
 remember for example the faithful toilet in the 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:10.750
 that we can choose a gunner 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.570
 and the sanitary and so on, different types 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.390
 and in each type, we see a 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.220
 armament shows us another is a guy 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.320
 that sorry is a video game that has 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.520
 liked a lot for the characteristic 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.290
 visual that brings that is also a 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.090
 little bit different from what we can 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.030
 find in the war games more 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.910
 classics that is to say they are video games is a 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.020
 video game that is based on the comic by 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.090
 so to say it has a more ambience 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.280
 comic more epic comical in the sense in 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.260
 which graphics are more than 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.060
 little pictures but that is certainly a 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.950
 very entertaining video game in which 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.010
 Well, if we have a good connection 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.860
 to the internet, there are also events for 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.410
 different, that is , one day an event 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.060
 which is to achieve such an objective and 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.280
 then there is a fight between both 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.220
 sides and good because the truth is that it is 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.440
 A is a free game as well 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.630
 I was commenting and the other one that I'm going to bring 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.940
 it is also and that you will have fun 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.980
 quite and that I think is very very 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.290
 curious and that you will like it because 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.150
 it really is something different from what we 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.960
 they bring other war video games for 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.850
 that 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.560
 It's a comic-book visual aspect that brings us 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.420
 and in which besides we will have 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.710
 armament we will have shots we will have 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.210
 war what else can we ask in addition with 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.460
 the scenarios is to say that also 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.730
 They are quite healed and they are very cool 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.620
 the last one is something more classic 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:37.210
 of google play that's why I left it 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:40.240
 for the end it's called sg dead zone I think 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.150
 that you will know and well it is a 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.120
 video game also in first person from 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.790
 shots I have not brought you a game so 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.650
 say it of strategies that also what 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.270
 there is war that can also be very 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.670
 entertaining and in fact I will think if 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:58.140
 bring another top dedicated by these games 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:00.700
 that are usually also pretty 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.550
 numerous in google play good then in 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:07.000
 this game on that day are we going to have 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.650
 what to do is a typical war game 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.249
 we will be able to choose the weaponry 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.319
 buy 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:14.839
 depending on the different points 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:17.299
 so that we have we will be able to buy 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:20.089
 one thing we are going to buy another everything 

00:05:17.299 --> 00:05:23.559
 online in all against all we can 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:27.500
 also make teams and certainly as 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:31.430
 Regarding what it is 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.200
 the form, so to speak, of the video game 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.090
 is not that much innovate the graphics 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.340
 yes they are very good therefore if 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.340
 you have a device that does not have either 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.430
 too much is not a quad core for 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.260
 down then you're going to have maybe some 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.530
 problem because as I say the 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.190
 requirements of this game because they are more 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:54.350
 that of course the first the first the 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.630
 pixel junk did not need much but this 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.060
 yes it has some pretty graphics 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.330
 cured and what good are they going to 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.860
 completely wrap and it will look like 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.690
 we are in the war is something else 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.550
 futuristic than the other two that had 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.470
 commented is not acclimated 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.410
 historically in and of course in the 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.650
 world of minecraft and well it is the 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:18.350
 game that completes this top 3 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.200
 I believe that the latter is perhaps the one 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.030
 it is better not better valued but it is 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.340
 the one that most assimilates to the games 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.460
 traditional as good as modern 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.789
 combat as call of duty 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.680
 the faithful toilet 'medal of honor' and so on 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:35.960
 so good to comment as always 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.030
 what do you think about this this top a top 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.190
 Well, as I tell you, it left me 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.319
 many many video games that also 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.509
 they can be interesting and what if 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:46.550
 you have tried and liked 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:48.590
 Well, you leave it down here so the 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.389
 rest of people also know them 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.849
 bring them in the next top os 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:55.160
 I will mention and good to say one thing that 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:57.650
 I forgot it will send me good either 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.360
 kill but a pool of specialized 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.940
 I was doing with him a collaboration 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.860
 a collaborative video has explaining or 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.289
 commenting on the experiences that 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.479
 had with the 360 ​​motorcycle we both had 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:10.759
 tried both we were a couple of 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:13.270
 weeks with him and well then we decided 

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:16.680
 make a video a video by kanouté 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:19.410

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.180
 our impressions the conclusions to 

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.789
 what we had accomplished after 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:28.169
