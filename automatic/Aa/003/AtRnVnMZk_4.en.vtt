00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.430 

well<00:00:10.760> I<00:00:10.820> have<00:00:10.970> run<00:00:11.180> the<00:00:11.330> tiller<00:00:11.600> over<00:00:12.320> the

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
well I have run the tiller over the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.950 
well I have run the tiller over the
entire<00:00:12.769> area<00:00:13.120> made<00:00:14.120> at<00:00:14.270> least<00:00:14.299> three<00:00:14.840> passes

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
entire area made at least three passes

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.650 
entire area made at least three passes
in<00:00:17.960> each<00:00:18.230> lane<00:00:18.910> I've<00:00:19.910> only<00:00:20.119> got<00:00:22.450> about<00:00:23.450> that

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
in each lane I've only got about that

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.840 
in each lane I've only got about that
much<00:00:23.720> tops<00:00:24.140> walk

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
much tops walk

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.710 
much tops walk
so<00:00:26.850> we're<00:00:26.970> gonna<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.270> make<00:00:27.420> some<00:00:27.600> more

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
so we're gonna have to make some more

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:38.060 
so we're gonna have to make some more
adjustments

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.760 

after<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> first<00:00:39.180> couple<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.600> passes<00:00:40.170> it

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
after the first couple of passes it

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.610 
after the first couple of passes it
wasn't<00:00:41.190> getting<00:00:41.340> very<00:00:41.700> deep<00:00:41.970> and<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.350> made

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
wasn't getting very deep and so I made

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.050 
wasn't getting very deep and so I made
an<00:00:43.740> adjustment<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:46.100> move<00:00:47.100> my<00:00:47.310> three-point<00:00:47.730> top

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
an adjustment to move my three-point top

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.020 
an adjustment to move my three-point top
arm<00:00:48.410> from<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.620> hole<00:00:49.830> here<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.370> very<00:00:50.640> very

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
arm from this hole here on the very very

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.420 
arm from this hole here on the very very
front<00:00:51.390> at<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.320> point<00:00:52.620> here<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.070> then

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
front at this point here and then

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.060 
front at this point here and then
tightened<00:00:53.880> it<00:00:53.970> as<00:00:54.060> far<00:00:54.300> as<00:00:54.450> I<00:00:54.540> could<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.920> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
tightened it as far as I could and it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.979 
tightened it as far as I could and it
tilted<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.580> tiller<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.330> this<00:00:57.450> direction<00:00:57.900> and

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
tilted the tiller in this direction and

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.210 
tilted the tiller in this direction and
that<00:00:58.110> helped<00:00:58.350> me<00:00:58.440> get<00:00:58.590> deeper<00:00:58.890> than<00:00:59.040> what<00:00:59.160> I

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
that helped me get deeper than what I

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.979 
that helped me get deeper than what I
was<00:00:59.460> getting<00:01:00.320> they<00:01:01.320> still<00:01:01.590> not<00:01:01.710> deep<00:01:01.920> enough

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
was getting they still not deep enough

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.820 
was getting they still not deep enough
down<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:05.309> bottom<00:01:06.170> there's<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.380> nut

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
down here on the bottom there's a nut

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.680 
down here on the bottom there's a nut
that<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.250> loosen<00:01:08.460> on<00:01:08.700> both<00:01:08.910> sides<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
that we can loosen on both sides of the

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.180 
that we can loosen on both sides of the
tiller<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.860> will<00:01:11.630> allow<00:01:12.630> us<00:01:12.660> to<00:01:12.990> raise<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
tiller that will allow us to raise the

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.300 
tiller that will allow us to raise the
sled<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.600> skids<00:01:17.570> up<00:01:18.740> towards<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.800> tiller<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
sled the skids up towards the tiller and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.340 
sled the skids up towards the tiller and
get<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> tiller<00:01:21.210> lower<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.660> the<00:01:21.750> ground<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.320> I

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
get the tiller lower to the ground and I

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.660 
get the tiller lower to the ground and I
think<00:01:22.380> that's<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.890> adjustment<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.520> need

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
think that's the adjustment that we need

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.520 
think that's the adjustment that we need
to<00:01:23.759> make<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.270> order<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.930> be<00:01:25.050> able<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.259> get<00:01:25.440> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
to make in order to be able to get the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.300 
to make in order to be able to get the
tines<00:01:25.800> deeper<00:01:26.700> into<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:27.030> soil<00:01:31.310> I've

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
tines deeper into the soil I've

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.249 
tines deeper into the soil I've
consulted<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.910> manual<00:01:33.330> and<00:01:33.750> what<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> manual

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
consulted the manual and what the manual

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.850 
consulted the manual and what the manual
says<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.590> do<00:01:34.830> is<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:36.060> lower<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.690> tiller<00:01:36.930> lower

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
says to do is to lower the tiller lower

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.719 
says to do is to lower the tiller lower
the<00:01:38.040> tiller<00:01:38.220> tines<00:01:38.580> onto<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> couple<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.080> boards

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
the tiller tines onto a couple of boards

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.870 
the tiller tines onto a couple of boards
to<00:01:41.729> give<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.479> tiller<00:01:42.720> some<00:01:42.930> support<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
to give the the tiller some support and

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.770 
to give the the tiller some support and
then<00:01:44.900> to<00:01:46.400> raise<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:47.610> skids<00:01:47.990> by<00:01:50.570> tightening<00:01:51.570> or

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
then to raise the skids by tightening or

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.350 
then to raise the skids by tightening or
loosening<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.850> pivot<00:01:54.150> bolt<00:01:54.330> and<00:01:56.060> this<00:01:57.060> top

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
loosening the pivot bolt and this top

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.690 
loosening the pivot bolt and this top
bolt<00:01:57.600> here<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.590> will<00:01:58.740> allow<00:01:58.920> us<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.280> move<00:01:59.430> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
bolt here it will allow us to move the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.270 
bolt here it will allow us to move the
skid<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.790> these<00:02:02.790> predetermined

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
skid up to these predetermined

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.460 
skid up to these predetermined
predetermined<00:02:05.280> sections<00:02:05.659> so<00:02:06.659> we're<00:02:07.290> going<00:02:07.380> to

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
predetermined sections so we're going to

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:51.440 
predetermined sections so we're going to
try<00:02:07.560> that

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.809 

well<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.480> had<00:02:52.689> to<00:02:52.810> go<00:02:52.900> find<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.730> little<00:02:54.730> bit

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
well I had to go find a little bit

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.100 
well I had to go find a little bit
better<00:02:54.970> tools<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.480> what<00:02:55.659> I<00:02:55.689> started<00:02:55.989> off<00:02:56.110> with

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
better tools and what I started off with

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.990 
better tools and what I started off with
case<00:02:59.110> you're<00:02:59.260> wondering<00:02:59.439> these<00:03:00.340> are<00:03:00.549> three

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
case you're wondering these are three

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.839 
case you're wondering these are three
quarter<00:03:01.269> inch<00:03:02.849> start<00:03:03.849> by<00:03:04.260> loosening<00:03:05.849> this

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
quarter inch start by loosening this

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:15.979 
quarter inch start by loosening this
side<00:03:09.150> just<00:03:10.150> so<00:03:10.269> we<00:03:10.359> can<00:03:10.480> pivot<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:11.079> little<00:03:11.290> bit

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.759 

just<00:03:16.989> to<00:03:17.140> make<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.290> pivot<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:19.650> for<00:03:20.650> reference

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
just to make it pivot and for reference

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.420 
just to make it pivot and for reference
the<00:03:22.170> nut<00:03:23.170> that<00:03:23.200> it's<00:03:23.530> on<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.859> other<00:03:23.980> side<00:03:24.069> is

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
the nut that it's on the other side is

00:03:24.430 --> 00:04:16.069 
the nut that it's on the other side is
three-quarters<00:03:24.909> of<00:03:25.000> inch<00:03:25.180> as<00:03:25.329> well

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:50.250 

now<00:04:17.079> we<00:04:17.140> just<00:04:17.290> want<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.500> tighten<00:04:17.620> them<00:04:17.769> back<00:04:49.260> I

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
now we just want to tighten them back I

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.110 
now we just want to tighten them back I
love<00:04:51.040> you<00:04:51.160> can't<00:04:51.310> tell<00:04:51.460> her<00:04:51.610> why<00:04:51.760> but<00:04:51.820> there's

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
love you can't tell her why but there's

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.840 
love you can't tell her why but there's
like<00:04:53.020> four<00:04:53.260> little<00:04:53.380> ridges<00:04:53.800> here<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:54.760> I've

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
like four little ridges here and I've

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.070 
like four little ridges here and I've
left<00:04:55.030> underneath<00:04:57.510> I'll<00:04:58.510> tighten<00:04:58.720> back<00:04:58.870> this

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
left underneath I'll tighten back this

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.800 
left underneath I'll tighten back this
one<00:04:59.910> we're<00:05:00.910> gonna<00:05:01.030> do<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.270> same<00:05:01.419> thing<00:05:01.630> on<00:05:01.720> the

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
one we're gonna do the same thing on the

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:37.940 
one we're gonna do the same thing on the
other<00:05:01.870> side

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:57.040 

I<00:05:53.600> think<00:05:54.600> that<00:05:54.750> worked<00:05:54.930> a<00:05:55.050> whole<00:05:55.260> lot<00:05:55.710> better

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
I think that worked a whole lot better

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:06.620 
I think that worked a whole lot better
as<00:05:58.340> you<00:05:59.340> can<00:05:59.490> see<00:06:02.000> we<00:06:03.000> get<00:06:04.820> quite<00:06:05.820> a<00:06:05.880> bit<00:06:06.210> deeper

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
as you can see we get quite a bit deeper

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.460 
as you can see we get quite a bit deeper
to<00:06:06.870> the<00:06:07.680> point<00:06:07.980> where<00:06:08.100> we're<00:06:08.220> running<00:06:08.490> into<00:06:08.670> a

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
to the point where we're running into a

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.710 
to the point where we're running into a
significant<00:06:10.470> rocks<00:06:11.090> job<00:06:12.090> got<00:06:12.270> a<00:06:12.300> lot<00:06:12.450> of<00:06:12.480> rocky

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
significant rocks job got a lot of rocky

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:19.040 
significant rocks job got a lot of rocky
soil<00:06:15.980> now<00:06:16.980> see<00:06:17.760> we're<00:06:18.000> actually<00:06:18.120> we're

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
soil now see we're actually we're

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.210 
soil now see we're actually we're
actually<00:06:19.110> getting<00:06:19.410> to<00:06:19.590> business<00:06:19.920> down<00:06:20.070> to

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
actually getting to business down to

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.750 
actually getting to business down to
business<00:06:20.510> so<00:06:22.190> we're<00:06:23.190> gonna<00:06:23.280> shut<00:06:23.430> the<00:06:23.490> camera

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
business so we're gonna shut the camera

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.460 
business so we're gonna shut the camera
off<00:06:23.820> and<00:06:24.240> we're<00:06:24.630> gonna<00:06:24.720> try<00:06:24.960> to<00:06:25.020> do<00:06:25.200> as<00:06:25.320> much

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 
off and we're gonna try to do as much

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.370 
off and we're gonna try to do as much
telling<00:06:25.770> us<00:06:25.860> we<00:06:25.980> can<00:06:27.020> while<00:06:28.020> we<00:06:28.110> still<00:06:28.230> have
