00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.130 

so<00:00:09.320> this<00:00:09.560> right<00:00:09.800> here<00:00:09.860> is<00:00:10.220> the<00:00:10.940> skylight<00:00:11.840> well

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:12.140 
so this right here is the skylight well

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.530 
so this right here is the skylight well
as<00:00:12.500> we<00:00:12.740> see<00:00:12.950> it<00:00:13.040> from<00:00:13.250> the<00:00:13.340> Attic<00:00:13.760> earlier<00:00:14.330> we

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
as we see it from the Attic earlier we

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.440 
as we see it from the Attic earlier we
were<00:00:14.690> outside<00:00:14.960> air<00:00:15.650> sealing<00:00:16.250> the<00:00:16.610> skylight

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
were outside air sealing the skylight

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.019 
were outside air sealing the skylight
from<00:00:17.660> above<00:00:17.990> but<00:00:18.680> we<00:00:18.830> also<00:00:18.980> need<00:00:19.369> to<00:00:19.400> treat<00:00:19.790> the

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
from above but we also need to treat the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:21.760 
from above but we also need to treat the
skylight<00:00:20.480> well<00:00:20.660> from<00:00:20.869> the<00:00:20.990> interior

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
skylight well from the interior

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.130 
skylight well from the interior
this<00:00:22.490> is<00:00:22.670> totally<00:00:23.119> typical<00:00:23.510> where<00:00:24.020> the

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
this is totally typical where the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.290 
this is totally typical where the
fiberglass<00:00:24.560> that<00:00:25.220> was<00:00:25.400> installed<00:00:25.910> on<00:00:26.180> the

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
fiberglass that was installed on the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.630 
fiberglass that was installed on the
skylight<00:00:26.750> well<00:00:26.930> originally<00:00:27.529> this<00:00:28.070> hasn't

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
skylight well originally this hasn't

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.280 
skylight well originally this hasn't
been<00:00:28.700> fit<00:00:29.119> right<00:00:29.360> and<00:00:29.570> you<00:00:29.630> can<00:00:29.779> see<00:00:29.810> that<00:00:30.140> it's

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.290 
been fit right and you can see that it's

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.200 
been fit right and you can see that it's
got<00:00:30.439> dark<00:00:30.800> staining<00:00:31.250> on<00:00:31.520> it<00:00:31.550> from<00:00:31.849> years<00:00:32.119> of

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
got dark staining on it from years of

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.479 
got dark staining on it from years of
air<00:00:32.540> filtering<00:00:33.079> through<00:00:33.470> it<00:00:33.620> so<00:00:34.220> what<00:00:34.370> we're

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
air filtering through it so what we're

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.819 
air filtering through it so what we're
going<00:00:34.640> to<00:00:34.700> do<00:00:34.880> is<00:00:35.170> first<00:00:36.170> of<00:00:36.320> all<00:00:36.470> we're<00:00:36.800> just

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
going to do is first of all we're just

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.540 
going to do is first of all we're just
going<00:00:37.190> to<00:00:37.220> cut<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:38.360> fiberglass<00:00:38.980> so<00:00:39.980> that<00:00:40.250> it

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
going to cut the fiberglass so that it

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.860 
going to cut the fiberglass so that it
actually<00:00:40.760> fits<00:00:41.390> properly<00:00:42.879> into<00:00:43.879> the<00:00:44.239> skylight

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
actually fits properly into the skylight

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.900 
actually fits properly into the skylight
well<00:00:45.079> and<00:00:45.590> fitting<00:00:46.039> properly<00:00:46.340> means<00:00:46.730> that

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
well and fitting properly means that

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.810 
well and fitting properly means that
it's<00:00:47.260> actually<00:00:48.260> slipping<00:00:49.129> between<00:00:49.280> these

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
it's actually slipping between these

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.759 
it's actually slipping between these
framing<00:00:50.300> members<00:00:50.449> and<00:00:50.899> touching<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.590> wall

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
framing members and touching the wall

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:58.930 
framing members and touching the wall
behind<00:00:51.980> it<00:00:54.519> like<00:00:55.519> that<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:58.309> then<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:58.640> next

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
behind it like that and then the next

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.610 
behind it like that and then the next
thing<00:00:59.090> we're<00:00:59.329> going<00:00:59.449> to<00:00:59.510> do<00:00:59.690> those<00:01:00.379> we're

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
thing we're going to do those we're

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:09.700 
thing we're going to do those we're
going<00:01:00.769> to<00:01:00.829> use<00:01:01.070> a<00:01:04.059> special<00:01:08.380> we<00:01:09.380> can<00:01:09.530> use<00:01:09.680> a

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
going to use a special we can use a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.530 
going to use a special we can use a
special<00:01:10.220> film<00:01:10.430> to<00:01:10.580> cover<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:11.060> that's<00:01:11.300> going<00:01:11.480> to

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
special film to cover it that's going to

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.999 
special film to cover it that's going to
help<00:01:11.780> hold<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.110> fiberglass<00:01:12.619> in<00:01:12.799> place

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
help hold the fiberglass in place

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:14.530 
help hold the fiberglass in place
permanently<00:01:13.700> so<00:01:13.850> it<00:01:14.000> doesn't<00:01:14.270> fall<00:01:14.509> down

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
permanently so it doesn't fall down

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.140 
permanently so it doesn't fall down
again<00:01:14.960> some<00:01:15.380> way<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:16.400> it's<00:01:16.549> also<00:01:16.759> going<00:01:17.060> to

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
again some way and it's also going to

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.420 
again some way and it's also going to
prevent<00:01:17.509> air<00:01:17.810> from<00:01:18.200> leaking<00:01:18.259> from<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:18.979> Attic

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
prevent air from leaking from the Attic

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.060 
prevent air from leaking from the Attic
through<00:01:19.939> the<00:01:20.180> fiberglass<00:01:20.960> so<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.770> fiberglass

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
through the fiberglass so the fiberglass

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.620 
through the fiberglass so the fiberglass
is<00:01:22.400> actually<00:01:22.759> going<00:01:22.909> to<00:01:23.000> work<00:01:23.240> as<00:01:23.479> an

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
is actually going to work as an

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.359 
is actually going to work as an
insulator<00:01:24.170> rather<00:01:24.470> than<00:01:24.680> just<00:01:24.890> working<00:01:25.009> as<00:01:25.250> a

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
insulator rather than just working as a

00:01:25.369 --> 00:02:16.020 
insulator rather than just working as a
filter

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.190 

so<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.090> see<00:02:17.300> here<00:02:17.450> not<00:02:17.630> only<00:02:17.780> are<00:02:17.959> we

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
so you see here not only are we

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.509 
so you see here not only are we
continuing<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.830> file<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.160> glass<00:02:19.310> and

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
continuing the file the glass and

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.009 
continuing the file the glass and
letting<00:02:19.730> its<00:02:19.850> do<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.090> job<00:02:20.390> that<00:02:20.569> it's<00:02:20.720> supposed

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
letting its do it job that it's supposed

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.080 
letting its do it job that it's supposed
to<00:02:21.170> but<00:02:21.739> visually<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:22.370> aesthetically<00:02:22.970> it's

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
to but visually and aesthetically it's

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.620 
to but visually and aesthetically it's
also<00:02:23.269> a<00:02:23.420> much<00:02:23.630> cleaner<00:02:23.950> edit<00:02:25.959> right<00:02:27.160> so<00:02:28.630> so

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
also a much cleaner edit right so so

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.000 
also a much cleaner edit right so so
what<00:02:30.049> you'll<00:02:30.200> see<00:02:30.290> here<00:02:30.560> is<00:02:30.650> we're<00:02:30.830> applying

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
what you'll see here is we're applying

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.140 
what you'll see here is we're applying
this<00:02:31.370> film<00:02:31.989> which<00:02:32.989> is<00:02:33.170> gonna<00:02:33.700> actually<00:02:34.700> allow

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
this film which is gonna actually allow

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.970 
this film which is gonna actually allow
the<00:02:35.209> fiberglass<00:02:35.780> insulation<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.500> perform

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
the fiberglass insulation to perform

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.280 
the fiberglass insulation to perform
properly<00:02:37.519> it's<00:02:38.239> going<00:02:38.299> to<00:02:38.420> keep<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:38.840> in<00:02:38.930> place

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
properly it's going to keep it in place

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.490 
properly it's going to keep it in place
permanently<00:02:40.209> it's<00:02:41.209> actually<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.720> film<00:02:42.260> that's

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
permanently it's actually a film that's

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.650 
permanently it's actually a film that's
got<00:02:42.920> little<00:02:43.220> tiny<00:02:43.370> perforations<00:02:44.000> in<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.510> so

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
got little tiny perforations in it so

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.050 
got little tiny perforations in it so
that<00:02:44.810> we<00:02:44.930> don't<00:02:45.049> trap<00:02:45.380> any<00:02:45.680> moisture<00:02:46.370> behind

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
that we don't trap any moisture behind

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.699 
that we don't trap any moisture behind
there<00:02:47.480> which<00:02:47.630> might<00:02:47.870> create<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.230> problem<00:02:48.620> in

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
there which might create a problem in

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.440 
there which might create a problem in
the<00:02:48.799> future<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.670> we're<00:02:49.790> also<00:02:49.880> going<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.209> leave

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
the future and we're also going to leave

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.479 
the future and we're also going to leave
the<00:02:51.260> attic<00:02:52.090> actually<00:02:53.090> looking<00:02:53.660> kind<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.200> nice

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
the attic actually looking kind of nice

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.140 
the attic actually looking kind of nice
last<00:02:55.489> but<00:02:55.730> not<00:02:55.880> least<00:02:56.180> this<00:02:56.480> foil<00:02:56.950> reflects

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
last but not least this foil reflects

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.569 
last but not least this foil reflects
the<00:02:59.150> heat<00:02:59.480> that's<00:03:00.109> in<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.440> attic<00:03:00.950> that<00:03:01.370> would

the heat that's in the attic that would

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.000 
the heat that's in the attic that would
otherwise<00:03:01.790> be<00:03:02.200> radiating<00:03:03.200> into<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.560> skylight
