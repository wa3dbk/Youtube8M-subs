00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
maybe duty output transformer

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.130 
maybe duty output transformer
maybe<00:01:20.510> something<00:01:20.900> else<00:01:21.050> I<00:01:21.380> notice<00:01:22.070> that

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
maybe something else I notice that

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.080 
maybe something else I notice that
I'm<00:01:23.590> going<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:23.800> change<00:01:23.950> around<00:01:24.100> my<00:01:24.400> input

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
I'm going to change around my input

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.780 
I'm going to change around my input
to<00:01:26.659> another<00:01:26.899> style<00:01:27.350> of<00:01:27.770> how<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.009> a<00:01:28.250> liar

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790

sound<00:01:30.540> was<00:01:30.750> amplified<00:01:31.230> so<00:01:32.090> I'm<00:01:33.090> thinking

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
sound was amplified so I'm thinking

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.360 
sound was amplified so I'm thinking
that's<00:01:33.630> what<00:01:33.690> it<00:01:33.870> is<00:01:33.990> with<00:01:34.200> all<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.500> them<00:01:34.620> or

that's what it is with all of them or

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.420 
that's what it is with all of them or
with<00:01:35.520> most<00:01:35.730> insurance<00:01:35.850> that

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.290
