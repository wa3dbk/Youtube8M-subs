00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.560
 of the month of April as we always start 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.260
 with beauty and this month the favorites have 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.880
 been indisputable the first of them 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.039
 It is a product of lips to vary 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.140
 because you already know that I love 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.230
 lip products and in this case it is 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.230
 a lipstick of revlon lalín 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.559
 the cow are super famous but I'm up 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.329
 the moment had not had any 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.070
 because I do not have any physical tub that 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.410
 sell them I do not know about things in life 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.149
 I had never placed an order on any web 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.510
 to buy them and now I bought 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:49.540
 two to prove it this is 75 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.699
 lollipop is this fuchsia color so 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.890
 nice and above all I like them because they are 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.540
 very very comfortable to wear and very 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.519
 pigmented and we go to the next 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.430
 beauty favorite that is a little bit 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:03.640
 more as in season I have to 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.520
 recognize I'm pretty lazy for the 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.380
 general care of beauty and such 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.990
 Although I like it and I am one of the 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.970
 typical that you do not take care of your feet up 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.820
 that the good weather is coming and you have to 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.310
 teach yes and confess it I'm sure that 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.259
 many of you do as I do and as 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.990
 nothing will I start wearing sandals 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.090
 started using sling cream 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.670

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.530
 pharmacies and is very very good has a 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.990
 light oil texture 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.600
 It hydrates your feet a lot and helps you 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.820
 eliminate hardness 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.610
 we went from the fashion favorites has 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.369
 it cost me quite to decide over there we go the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.009
 first favorite is the necklace that I bought 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.560
 just to sort it out I bought it in those 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.509
 I do not know the brand right now but the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.520
 I'll leave somewhere is to say here in 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.979
 gilt of three blue journalists like that 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.119
 very very simple like the necklaces that 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.310
 I am usually carrying 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.350
 practically what took the days 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.149
 love and the next favorite are the 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.030
 Kimonos in general I bought 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.430
 some these days this month but I've 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.170
 chosen only one for the video of 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.810
 favorites because by some it goes you have to 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.209
 decide and this has been the winner is of 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.690
 pull and bear is this one here with this 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.140
 stamped and this in turn this kind 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.080
 of this species this kind of I do not know 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.120
 how to call it is not lace I do not know this 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.400
 which is how transparent you are 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.530
 seeing now I just put it on and as 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.209
 you see I love this part of here that 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.280
 it is as transparent I love the 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.470
 stamped I love as a contrast with 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.660
 dark shirts and I do not know it seems very 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.160
 feminine and super comfortable and perfect for 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.170
 spring 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.330
 this month's food favorite has 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.580
 It cost quite a lot to decide because I wanted to 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.470
 put something a little different 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.720
 but really this is what has most 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.720
 liked you know that I am a lover of 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.790
 I love chocolate and that's why 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.070
 This month's favorite pie 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.150
 nestlé chocolate the one that is filled 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:03.160
 of caramel and dulce de leche is 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.220
 Spectacular buy it and I would eat 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.980
 whole tablet in one sitting and I have it 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.810
 to recognize as series this month 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.300
 or no news I continue with house of 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.190
 cards even though I have not seen it 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.140
 too much this month I have seen many more 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.330
 videos on youtube that series and movies 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.820
 so that's why I do not have any news 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.830
 in series and that's the only one I've seen 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.380
 some chapter but without much 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.260
 continuity either and I have the 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.170
 favorite of youtube has been the law 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.300
 count 16 is a girl who has a channel 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.430
 little one they are showing me much their 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.320
 videos I find very nice makes 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.180
 beauty videos and so on more things 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.750
 varied mistakes so move on to 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.720
 visit it and if you like to subscribe 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.340
 I'm sure you're going to fall great 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.530
 in terms of this favorite movie 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.190
 month the film is of interviú and is a 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.070
 pretty funny movie but it has its 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.810
 point I do not know of social interest let's say 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.610
 by calling it somehow it comes 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.070
 of a presenter of a program of 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.900
 television and its product I think it's 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.880
 travel to North Korea to be able 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.940
 interview the dictator Kim Jong a 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.750
 and I'm really bad at that kind of name 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.720
 well that kim jong-un invites you to go 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.790
 there because obviously I snatch and I'm going 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.560
 to do an interview like that because if without 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.200
 that he wants is a movie that has 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.050
 had a lot of controversy over the issue 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.300
 tries focuses on the subject in a way 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.700
 funny I think it's a movie with the 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.320
 that you can laugh a lot and that you can 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.790
 like though it's not a movie or my 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.650
 way of seeing but I liked it 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.600
 focuses basically on the image and wants 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.900
 give North Korea to the rest of the world 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.840
 they also entrust the presenter and the 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.120
 another boy a specific mission by 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.700
 part of the company not only to go to 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.200
 interview the dictator so good 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.820
 that's what the film is focused on and 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.720
 I recommend seeing her 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.820
 look well favorite of the month and I'm 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.770
 obsessed I put it in a loop is the 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.070
 Ernie de de Ubiquen is in the band 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.540
 sound of the 50 shades of king 9 is the 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.430
 second shadows of ginobili of the 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.590
 books I have no pension at 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.830
 interest but if this song is the 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.180
 soundtrack and I fell in love as soon as 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.580
 to application is a new application 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.410
 to edit photos is specifically called 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.480
 filters I'm looking for us 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.640
 going on from you basically is a 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.320
 application that focuses on the filters 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.780
 to avoid the photos come a lot 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.580
 and the good thing is that you can see them all 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.110
 as well as followed and you can see how 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.180
 the photo is left without having to apply it 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.710
 directly, it seems very fast to me 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.870
 use and has a wide variety of 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.030
 filters and I do not know there are for all 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.380
