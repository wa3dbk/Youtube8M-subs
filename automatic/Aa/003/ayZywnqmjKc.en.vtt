00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
the guitar but before that we're going

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.529 
the guitar but before that we're going
to<00:00:27.800> have<00:00:27.920> to<00:00:28.039> unbox<00:00:28.430> it<00:00:28.610> so<00:00:29.000> let's<00:00:29.210> see<00:00:29.360> what's

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
to have to unbox it so let's see what's

to have to unbox it so let's see what's
inside

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.970 

you

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:01:03.640 

I<00:00:52.120> ring<00:00:53.120> too<00:01:01.930> alright<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.080> let's<00:01:03.230> take<00:01:03.380> a<00:01:03.410> close

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
I ring too alright so let's take a close

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.770 
I ring too alright so let's take a close
up<00:01:03.680> look<00:01:03.940> what<00:01:04.940> are<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.089> changes<00:01:05.510> over<00:01:05.540> the

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
up look what are the changes over the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.430 
up look what are the changes over the
iRig

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
iRig

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.000 
iRig
so<00:01:07.040> on<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:07.640> iRig<00:01:07.940> 2<00:01:08.210> you<00:01:08.750> have<00:01:09.010> quarter-inch

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
so on the iRig 2 you have quarter-inch

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.499 
so on the iRig 2 you have quarter-inch
amp<00:01:10.820> output<00:01:12.250> you<00:01:13.250> have<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.880> switch<00:01:14.240> on<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.420> side

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
amp output you have a switch on the side

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.280 
amp output you have a switch on the side
to<00:01:15.110> be<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.680> pass-through<00:01:15.950> or<00:01:16.600> apply<00:01:17.600> effects

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
to be a pass-through or apply effects

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.050 
to be a pass-through or apply effects
through<00:01:18.650> amplitude<00:01:19.369> or<00:01:19.580> whatever<00:01:19.820> it<00:01:19.940> is

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
through amplitude or whatever it is

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.100 
through amplitude or whatever it is
you're<00:01:20.240> using<00:01:20.390> on<00:01:20.810> your<00:01:21.110> on<00:01:21.800> your<00:01:22.610> iDevice<00:01:23.110> you

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
you're using on your on your iDevice you

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.950 
you're using on your on your iDevice you
have<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.259> gain<00:01:25.119> up-and-down<00:01:26.150> knob<00:01:26.600> that<00:01:26.840> you

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
have a gain up-and-down knob that you

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.880 
have a gain up-and-down knob that you
can<00:01:27.110> adjust<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:28.000> you<00:01:29.000> have<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.450> slot<00:01:30.320> to<00:01:30.590> attach

can adjust and you have a slot to attach

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.340 
can adjust and you have a slot to attach
this<00:01:31.160> thing<00:01:31.399> to<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.700> microphone<00:01:32.479> stand<00:01:32.690> so<00:01:33.200> a

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
this thing to a microphone stand so a

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.290 
this thing to a microphone stand so a
lot<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:33.950> great<00:01:34.280> upgrades<00:01:34.910> here<00:01:37.119> so<00:01:38.119> if<00:01:38.210> you

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
lot of great upgrades here so if you

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.800 
lot of great upgrades here so if you
want<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.479> do<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.630> quick<00:01:38.960> comparison<00:01:40.630> here's<00:01:41.630> the

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
want to do a quick comparison here's the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.230 
want to do a quick comparison here's the
iRig<00:01:42.170> here's<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:42.920> iRig<00:01:43.190> 2<00:01:43.929> cylindrical

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
iRig here's the iRig 2 cylindrical

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.490 
iRig here's the iRig 2 cylindrical
versus<00:01:47.240> a<00:01:47.600> little<00:01:47.780> more<00:01:48.220> oval<00:01:49.220> ish<00:01:49.429> shaped<00:01:50.500> and

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
versus a little more oval ish shaped and

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.190 
versus a little more oval ish shaped and
so<00:01:51.979> here's<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.759> big<00:01:52.910> differences<00:01:53.330> quarter

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
so here's the big differences quarter

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.499 
so here's the big differences quarter
inch<00:01:54.350> plug<00:01:54.619> from<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.069> guitar<00:01:55.340> still<00:01:56.149> had<00:01:56.330> that

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
inch plug from the guitar still had that

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.169 
inch plug from the guitar still had that
right<00:01:56.720> now<00:01:57.470> instead<00:01:58.130> of<00:01:58.250> having<00:01:58.399> just<00:01:58.520> one

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
right now instead of having just one

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.449 
right now instead of having just one
headphone<00:02:00.020> output<00:02:00.679> that<00:02:00.830> could<00:02:00.979> also<00:02:01.100> go<00:02:01.399> to

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
headphone output that could also go to

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.460 
headphone output that could also go to
your<00:02:01.610> amplifier<00:02:01.759> now<00:02:02.330> you<00:02:02.869> have<00:02:03.080> headphone

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
your amplifier now you have headphone

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.680 
your amplifier now you have headphone
output<00:02:03.830> here<00:02:04.160> and<00:02:04.310> then<00:02:04.819> go<00:02:05.119> to<00:02:05.179> wrenching<00:02:05.539> amp

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
output here and then go to wrenching amp

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.800 
output here and then go to wrenching amp
output<00:02:06.310> there's<00:02:07.310> no<00:02:07.610> gain<00:02:08.569> or<00:02:10.810> throughput

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
output there's no gain or throughput

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.440 
output there's no gain or throughput
switch<00:02:12.520> okay<00:02:13.520> but<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:13.880> do<00:02:14.000> have<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.270> here

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
switch okay but you do have it here

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
switch okay but you do have it here

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
right still have the 8 inch jack coming

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.970 
right still have the 8 inch jack coming
out<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.709> it

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
out of it

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.760 
out of it
so<00:02:19.640> still<00:02:20.360> great<00:02:20.540> product<00:02:20.930> here<00:02:20.990> but<00:02:21.620> this

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
so still great product here but this

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.210 
so still great product here but this
definitely<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.640> an<00:02:23.090> improvement<00:02:24.220> more

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
definitely is an improvement more

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.040 
definitely is an improvement more
features<00:02:25.580> of<00:02:25.700> functionality<00:02:26.390> slightly

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
features of functionality slightly

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.360 
features of functionality slightly
different<00:02:27.349> color<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:27.770> don't<00:02:27.950> know<00:02:28.099> if<00:02:28.160> you<00:02:28.250> can

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
different color I don't know if you can

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.220 
different color I don't know if you can
pick<00:02:28.550> up<00:02:28.580> on<00:02:28.819> that<00:02:28.849> and<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.150> camera<00:02:29.510> this

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
pick up on that and the camera this

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.320 
pick up on that and the camera this
one's<00:02:30.500> like<00:02:31.130> black<00:02:31.490> this<00:02:31.700> one's<00:02:31.910> got<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.150> bit

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
one's like black this one's got a bit

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.820 
one's like black this one's got a bit
more<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.599> a<00:02:32.690> matte<00:02:32.930> finish<00:02:33.349> to<00:02:33.380> it<00:02:33.560> it's<00:02:33.800> a

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
more of a matte finish to it it's a

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.760 
more of a matte finish to it it's a
little<00:02:33.890> more<00:02:34.069> glossy<00:02:35.349> anyway<00:02:36.349> so<00:02:36.410> there's<00:02:36.709> a

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
little more glossy anyway so there's a

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.490 
little more glossy anyway so there's a
comparison<00:02:37.340> between<00:02:37.459> this<00:02:37.940> new<00:02:38.300> iRig<00:02:39.080> model

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
comparison between this new iRig model

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.420 
comparison between this new iRig model
iRig<00:02:39.860> 2<00:02:39.890> versus<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.670> original<00:02:40.760> iRig<00:02:45.430> now

iRig 2 versus the original iRig now

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.420 
iRig 2 versus the original iRig now
we're<00:02:46.580> going<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.730> prep<00:02:47.079> for<00:02:48.079> some<00:02:48.290> music<00:02:48.430> first
