00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 exchange concert this time with the songs 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.250
 the woman striker or like me now 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.099
 the dole would always say something 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.250
 with life in the song and I thought so 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.440
 already ahead well the songs from the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.260
 the sound of everything is the same 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.850
 fairly uniform there is missing 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.060
 somehow the diversion whatever 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.150
 great things make it difficult 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.529
 hard and that's how it came 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.640
 Almost all of them were boring 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.930
 not good or just taken over so 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.360
 the up and england simply 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.160
 million lights failed because he 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.690
 again did not come up with the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:49.350
 high pitches the wirz has easy 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.289
 simply quite boring 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.789
 covered something of a dubstep 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.120
 version something about it dubstep 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.039
 should be no idea 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.739
 The striker has come up with her new single 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:07.200
 naturally occurred boring the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:10.380
 text then of course came kuranyi with 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.030
 lonely domotex fly to the angel 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.119
 from the adjusted made bad for 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.710
 his relationships and the princes 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.680
 the country version wanted to do something 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.509
 It was not a bad idea, though 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.820
 rather the ones with their effects on the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.610
 voice of just sounded strange 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.549
 but it was woman catterfeld with me 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.460
 really live that way i said i had that 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.820
 only fantastically implemented so that is 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.500
 yes really say next to take next 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.299
 xenia actually vocally the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.829
 strongest or you own one at 1 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.950
 always dumb attacks or mostly 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.350
 stupid texts there so we say they are 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.720
 has relatively good text as I live 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.280
 actually I hate the text after all 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.930
 meanwhile i hate that lies 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.299
 to say so because he has been so many times 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.409
 you were thrown thousands of times 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.880
 but is such a victory is yes 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.829
 actually, bad text is going on 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.869
 say there has the text which at 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.490
 thought and the catterfeld that I want 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.380
 also in terms of content so super implemented 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.930
 really can say that 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.390
 crass at the same young crass but 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.280
 really very good version so what had to 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.470
 be implemented and otherwise 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.920
 of course the xavier naidoo with 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.500
 in the middle of the year completely convinced 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.140
 simply because he can see it better than 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.450
 the woman striker because he simply said 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.660
 I have a lot more going has a leading 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.810
 The two really have a say here 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.090
 distance to the other artistically 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.760
 seen where actually now 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.630
 not from the creative point of view 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.300
 really big smashed with glory 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.510
 until now catterfeld became the woman 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.850
 was also technically instrumental technically 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.610
 well done so woman catterfeld all 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.020
 great number also great sung by the 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.110
 creative rail 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.820
 the rest was creative 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.670
 not great and actually the 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.260
 what we really mean that important office 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.400
 out of concert, therefore, rather 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.400
 a bad result
