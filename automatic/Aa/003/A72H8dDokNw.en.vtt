00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.270 
this is the Sony Vaio ECB's laptop and

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.579 
this is the Sony Vaio ECB's laptop and
there's<00:00:06.270> no<00:00:06.450> hiding<00:00:06.750> from<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.200> fact<00:00:07.500> that

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
there's no hiding from the fact that

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.740 
there's no hiding from the fact that
visually<00:00:08.280> it<00:00:08.309> looks<00:00:08.760> very<00:00:09.120> different<00:00:09.450> from

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
visually it looks very different from

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.020 
visually it looks very different from
the<00:00:09.960> conventional<00:00:10.650> boring<00:00:11.160> laptop<00:00:11.610> designs

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
the conventional boring laptop designs

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.570 
the conventional boring laptop designs
that<00:00:12.330> we<00:00:12.480> see<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:12.960> price<00:00:13.290> bracket<00:00:13.769> when<00:00:14.549> I

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
that we see in this price bracket when I

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.129 
that we see in this price bracket when I
talk<00:00:14.820> about<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.179> price<00:00:15.360> but<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.690> think<00:00:15.900> this

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
talk about the price but I think this

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.160 
talk about the price but I think this
vaio<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.949> available<00:00:17.670> for<00:00:17.850> around<00:00:18.050> 55,000<00:00:19.050> of

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
each box price and it truly doesn't look

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.220 
each box price and it truly doesn't look
that<00:00:22.230> much<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.920> looks<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.369> lot<00:00:23.640> more<00:00:23.880> expensive

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
that much it looks a lot more expensive

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.220 
that much it looks a lot more expensive
than<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.470> price<00:00:25.710> actually<00:00:25.980> suggests<00:00:26.609> and

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
than the price actually suggests and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.720 
than the price actually suggests and
trust<00:00:28.230> us<00:00:28.410> when<00:00:28.650> we<00:00:28.680> say<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.310> actually

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
trust us when we say that it actually

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.429 
trust us when we say that it actually
feels<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.240> lot<00:00:30.420> more<00:00:30.599> expensive<00:00:30.869> than<00:00:31.170> it

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
feels a lot more expensive than it

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.709 
feels a lot more expensive than it

runs around three sides of the laptop as
you<00:00:44.760> can<00:00:44.910> see<00:00:45.920> this<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:47.730> adds<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.270> different

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the entire laptop but this looks really

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.720 
the entire laptop but this looks really
subtle<00:00:57.809> yet<00:00:58.170> very<00:00:58.440> classy<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.430> little

spotty

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.100 
spotty
the<00:01:01.680> most<00:01:01.890> defining<00:01:02.370> visual<00:01:02.879> element<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.480> not

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the most defining visual element is not

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.230 
the most defining visual element is not
the<00:01:04.290> red<00:01:04.470> stripes<00:01:04.830> around<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.430> laptop<00:01:06.000> it's

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the red stripes around the laptop it's

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.000 
the red stripes around the laptop it's
actually<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> fact<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.530> lid<00:01:07.770> is

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
actually the fact that the lid is

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.910 
actually the fact that the lid is
slightly<00:01:08.460> smaller<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.960> base<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.470> sits<00:01:10.710> on

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
slightly smaller in the base it sits on

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.550 
slightly smaller in the base it sits on
now<00:01:11.750> essentially<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.869> not<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.080> bad<00:01:13.290> thing

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
now essentially it's not a bad thing

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.200 
now essentially it's not a bad thing
it's<00:01:13.979> not<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.220> good<00:01:14.430> thing<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
it's not a good thing it's just a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.080 
it's not a good thing it's just a
visually<00:01:16.140> different<00:01:16.380> thing<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:17.700> don't<00:01:17.880> mind

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
that's enough for ya the only little

that's enough for ya the only little
detail<00:02:55.269> that<00:02:55.299> I<00:02:55.480> had<00:02:55.870> was<00:02:56.290> there's<00:02:56.799> a<00:02:56.950> little

detail that I had was there's a little

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.539 
detail that I had was there's a little
bit<00:02:57.519> too<00:02:57.700> much<00:02:57.850> travel<00:02:58.510> for<00:02:58.720> every<00:02:58.989> key<00:02:59.170> so

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
bit too much travel for every key so

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.860 
bit too much travel for every key so
typing<00:03:00.549> tends<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.970> become<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.239> little<00:03:01.420> slower

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870
