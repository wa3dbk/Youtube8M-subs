want to show you guys what these devices
look<00:00:27.759> next<00:00:28.119> to<00:00:28.270> each<00:00:28.390> other<00:00:28.539> actually<00:00:28.900> that's

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
look next to each other actually that's

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.619 
look next to each other actually that's
really<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:29.980> request<00:00:30.460> that<00:00:30.669> we<00:00:30.790> got<00:00:31.000> because

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:31.629 
really the request that we got because

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:33.810 
really the request that we got because
this<00:00:31.809> is<00:00:31.960> a<00:00:31.989> one<00:00:32.290> $49<00:00:32.980> device<00:00:33.340> and<00:00:33.640> older

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
this is a one $49 device and older

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.700 
this is a one $49 device and older
technology<00:00:34.420> obviously<00:00:35.230> it's<00:00:35.350> not<00:00:35.469> going<00:00:35.590> to

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
technology obviously it's not going to

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.049 
technology obviously it's not going to
be<00:00:35.770> able<00:00:35.800> to<00:00:36.010> outperform<00:00:36.370> you<00:00:36.670> can<00:00:36.789> see<00:00:36.940> the

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
be able to outperform you can see the

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.990 
be able to outperform you can see the
numbers<00:00:37.360> from<00:00:37.660> the<00:00:38.129> benchmark<00:00:39.129> here<00:00:39.460> at<00:00:39.879> the

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
numbers from the benchmark here at the

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.330 
numbers from the benchmark here at the
same<00:00:40.239> time<00:00:40.539> this<00:00:41.379> is<00:00:41.530> actually<00:00:41.980> is<00:00:42.070> still<00:00:42.309> a

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
same time this is actually is still a

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.729 
same time this is actually is still a
pretty<00:00:42.610> good<00:00:42.850> tablet<00:00:43.120> for<00:00:43.570> reading<00:00:43.899> not<00:00:44.469> for

pretty good tablet for reading not for
you<00:00:45.039> know<00:00:45.190> hacking<00:00:45.730> or<00:00:46.150> doing<00:00:46.720> heavy<00:00:47.020> the<00:00:47.590> hard

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
you know hacking or doing heavy the hard

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.340 
you know hacking or doing heavy the hard
core<00:00:48.640> android<00:00:49.180> programming<00:00:49.510> things<00:00:50.170> like

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
core android programming things like

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.650 
core android programming things like
that<00:00:50.530> but<00:00:51.190> for<00:00:51.400> reading<00:00:51.790> for<00:00:52.000> testing<00:00:52.450> maybe

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
that but for reading for testing maybe

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.380 
that but for reading for testing maybe
for<00:00:53.290> the<00:00:53.590> fact<00:00:54.010> that<00:00:54.130> that<00:00:54.340> has<00:00:54.730> google<00:00:55.120> play

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
for the fact that that has google play

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.660 
for the fact that that has google play
now<00:00:55.630> so<00:00:56.320> you<00:00:56.380> can<00:00:56.620> install<00:00:57.070> google<00:00:57.489> play

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
now so you can install google play

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.270 
now so you can install google play
applications<00:00:58.420> whereas<00:00:59.350> here<00:00:59.739> i<00:00:59.770> have<00:01:00.160> to

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
applications whereas here i have to

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.310 
applications whereas here i have to
actually<00:01:00.489> do<00:01:00.790> multiple<00:01:01.239> steps<00:01:01.570> to<00:01:01.840> install

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
actually do multiple steps to install

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.100

google play it's possible we're going to

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.149 
google play it's possible we're going to
