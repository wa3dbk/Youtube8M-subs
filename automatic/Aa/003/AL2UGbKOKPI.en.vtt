00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.990 

where'd<00:05:23.090> I<00:05:23.150> go<00:05:23.300> oh<00:05:23.539> no<00:05:24.409> still<00:05:24.650> recording<00:05:24.979> huh

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.159 

so<00:05:29.000> I<00:05:29.030> picked<00:05:29.270> this<00:05:29.389> lipstick<00:05:29.780> up<00:05:29.930> from<00:05:30.080> the

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
so I picked this lipstick up from the

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:31.959 
so I picked this lipstick up from the
drugstore<00:05:30.379> the<00:05:30.710> other<00:05:30.860> day<00:05:31.039> and<00:05:31.279> it's<00:05:31.699> a<00:05:31.789> wet

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:31.969 
drugstore the other day and it's a wet

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:34.600 
drugstore the other day and it's a wet
and<00:05:32.060> wild<00:05:32.150> color<00:05:32.870> in<00:05:33.110> cashmere<00:05:33.800> it's<00:05:34.250> a<00:05:34.370> really

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
and wild color in cashmere it's a really

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.399 
and wild color in cashmere it's a really
pretty<00:05:34.729> kind<00:05:35.090> of<00:05:35.180> shimmery<00:05:35.539> brown<00:05:35.870> color<00:05:36.199> and

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
pretty kind of shimmery brown color and

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:37.899 
pretty kind of shimmery brown color and
I<00:05:36.770> thought<00:05:36.919> it<00:05:37.039> would<00:05:37.129> complement<00:05:37.610> the<00:05:37.639> gold

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
I thought it would complement the gold

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:50.490 
I thought it would complement the gold
really<00:05:38.210> nicely

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.050 

so<00:05:51.500> I<00:05:51.530> decided<00:05:51.950> that<00:05:52.070> needed<00:05:52.490> a<00:05:52.640> little<00:05:52.850> bit

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
so I decided that needed a little bit

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.430 
so I decided that needed a little bit
more<00:05:53.120> shimmer<00:05:53.720> on<00:05:53.990> the<00:05:54.110> lips

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
more shimmer on the lips

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.470 
more shimmer on the lips
so<00:05:54.650> here<00:05:55.430> I'm<00:05:55.610> just<00:05:55.790> taking<00:05:56.090> the<00:05:56.210> gold

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
so here I'm just taking the gold

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.060 
so here I'm just taking the gold
eyeshadow<00:05:56.780> that<00:05:57.200> we<00:05:57.380> started<00:05:57.650> with<00:05:57.890> in<00:05:58.040> the

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
eyeshadow that we started with in the

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.040 
eyeshadow that we started with in the
very<00:05:58.340> beginning<00:05:58.460> I'm<00:05:59.060> just<00:05:59.510> placing<00:05:59.720> that<00:05:59.900> on

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
very beginning I'm just placing that on

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:07.670 
very beginning I'm just placing that on
the<00:06:00.290> very<00:06:00.620> center<00:06:01.250> of<00:06:01.460> my<00:06:01.580> lips

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:25.980 

and<00:06:07.919> here's<00:06:08.850> the<00:06:09.060> finished<00:06:09.150> makeup<00:06:09.449> look

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.060 

they'll<00:06:26.990> just<00:06:27.200> start<00:06:27.410> out<00:06:27.560> when<00:06:27.740> I'm<00:06:27.800> brushing

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
they'll just start out when I'm brushing

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.580 
they'll just start out when I'm brushing
your<00:06:28.310> hair<00:06:28.370> and<00:06:28.760> then<00:06:28.970> separating<00:06:29.750> it<00:06:29.840> into<00:06:29.870> I

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
your hair and then separating it into I

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.320 
your hair and then separating it into I
would<00:06:31.040> say<00:06:31.190> three<00:06:31.430> sections<00:06:31.850> if<00:06:32.090> you<00:06:32.210> have

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
would say three sections if you have

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.800 
would say three sections if you have
about<00:06:32.540> the<00:06:32.720> same<00:06:32.900> amount<00:06:33.050> of<00:06:33.260> hair<00:06:33.470> as<00:06:33.560> I<00:06:33.710> do

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.510 

I'm<00:06:38.810> taking<00:06:39.140> fairly<00:06:39.560> small<00:06:39.800> sections<00:06:40.250> I'm

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
I'm taking fairly small sections I'm

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.580 
I'm taking fairly small sections I'm
just<00:06:40.940> curling<00:06:41.240> it<00:06:41.510> like<00:06:41.750> you<00:06:42.200> normally<00:06:42.350> would

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
just curling it like you normally would

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:48.820 
just curling it like you normally would
with<00:06:42.740> this<00:06:43.070> kind<00:06:43.340> of<00:06:43.430> tool<00:06:47.380> once<00:06:48.380> you<00:06:48.500> make<00:06:48.650> the

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
with this kind of tool once you make the

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.200 
with this kind of tool once you make the
curls<00:06:49.130> just<00:06:49.250> leave<00:06:49.700> them<00:06:49.880> where<00:06:50.060> they<00:06:50.180> are

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
curls just leave them where they are

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.790 
curls just leave them where they are
we're<00:06:50.630> gonna<00:06:50.810> spray<00:06:51.170> the<00:06:51.320> whole<00:06:51.470> bottom

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:20.890 
what I did here is just entangled the
rubber<00:07:10.340> snake<00:07:10.670> within<00:07:11.060> the<00:07:11.660> different<00:07:11.900> curls

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:20.900 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.300 

these<00:07:21.900> were<00:07:22.050> really<00:07:22.230> easy<00:07:22.500> to<00:07:22.770> hold<00:07:22.860> down<00:07:23.070> with

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.310 
these were really easy to hold down with

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:39.749 
these were really easy to hold down with
bobby<00:07:23.490> pins<00:07:23.820> so<00:07:23.940> that's<00:07:24.180> what<00:07:24.300> I'm<00:07:24.390> doing<00:07:24.630> here

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.890 

I'm<00:07:40.759> just<00:07:40.970> teasing<00:07:41.120> the<00:07:41.360> hair<00:07:41.389> a<00:07:41.570> little<00:07:41.690> bit

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:41.900 
I'm just teasing the hair a little bit

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:50.710 
I'm just teasing the hair a little bit
to<00:07:42.110> make<00:07:42.229> it<00:07:42.289> look<00:07:42.590> a<00:07:42.710> little<00:07:42.919> more<00:07:43.100> messy

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.150
