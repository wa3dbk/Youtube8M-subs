 I import that the plant is original 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.010
 of temperate and humid zones the 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.620
 microclimate of its distant and cumbersome 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.390
 mountain accompany him his work began 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.059
 when the experimental coffee station 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.820

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.960
 only one in a crop can give up 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.560
 60 fruits good that around 15 thousand 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.950
 bushes already sown in production this 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.070
 a bush produces up to 60 and 65 and maybe 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.050
 more fruit only than to see him harvesting 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.880

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.649
 Mauritius to pick your strawberries them 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.869

 strawberry reports 15 Cuban pesos and 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.170
 Mauricio feels motivated good with the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.570
 strawberry you can make infinity of sweet 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.100
 here we see the process is doing it 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.340
 in syrup 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.560

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.479
 beaten marmalade the industry marks the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.830
 destination of its fruits to later join 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.830
 to the ideal markets 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.929
 to the industry at this time the average 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.440

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.660
 sold less quintales the strawberry possess 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.180
 antiseptic disinfectant properties 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.769
 and bacteriostatic its reddish color 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.030
 owes to the presence of anthocyanins 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.670
 pigments that have properties 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.870
 antioxidants capable of preventing 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.780
 emergence of degenerative diseases 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.290
 like cancer Parkinson's disease and 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.290
 alzheimer 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.909

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:39.340
