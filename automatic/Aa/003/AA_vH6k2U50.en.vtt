00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.970 

so<00:00:34.670> once<00:00:34.879> we've<00:00:35.030> opened<00:00:35.450> the<00:00:35.570> net<00:00:35.809> come<00:00:36.770> back

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
so once we've opened the net come back

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.900 
so once we've opened the net come back
so<00:00:37.640> that<00:00:37.670> they<00:00:37.940> can't<00:00:38.149> say<00:00:38.420> yes<00:00:39.010> and<00:00:40.010> I've

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
so that they can't say yes and I've

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.119 
so that they can't say yes and I've
turned<00:00:41.090> to<00:00:41.149> play<00:00:41.360> back<00:00:41.600> on<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.290> normally<00:00:43.010> the

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
turned to play back on so normally the

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.740 
turned to play back on so normally the
gaudy<00:00:43.309> ins<00:00:43.460> will<00:00:43.610> come<00:00:43.760> in<00:00:43.910> and<00:00:44.269> respond<00:00:44.690> to

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
gaudy ins will come in and respond to

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.229 
gaudy ins will come in and respond to
the<00:00:44.899> playback<00:00:45.489> here<00:00:46.489> they're<00:00:46.640> coming<00:00:46.910> down<00:00:47.000> to

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
the playback here they're coming down to

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:48.729 
the playback here they're coming down to
the<00:00:47.360> dirt<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:47.780> sometimes<00:00:48.140> you<00:00:48.290> have<00:00:48.379> to<00:00:48.470> flush

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
the dirt so sometimes you have to flush

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.939 
the dirt so sometimes you have to flush
them<00:00:49.010> into<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:49.370> net<00:00:49.579> I<00:00:50.650> don't<00:00:51.650> know<00:00:51.710> if<00:00:51.860> you

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949

had the white I've had to wait hours

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.220 
had the white I've had to wait hours
before<00:00:55.430> usually<00:00:56.150> here's<00:00:56.600> very<00:00:56.900> good<00:00:57.140> though

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
you have to be pretty quick to get them

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.280 
you have to be pretty quick to get them
at<00:01:01.640> once<00:01:01.909> they<00:01:02.120> go<00:01:02.269> in<00:01:02.420> yeah<00:01:02.690> cuz<00:01:03.019> I<00:01:03.110> can

at once they go in yeah cuz I can
overheat<00:01:03.710> cuz<00:01:04.640> I'd<00:01:04.790> panic<00:01:05.530> yet<00:01:06.560> they're<00:01:06.920> a

overheat cuz I'd panic yet they're a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.469 
overheat cuz I'd panic yet they're a
little<00:01:07.070> confused<00:01:07.640> I<00:01:07.759> think<00:01:07.789> when<00:01:08.060> they<00:01:08.180> go<00:01:08.330> in

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
little confused I think when they go in

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.450 
little confused I think when they go in
the<00:01:08.570> net<00:01:08.750> so<00:01:08.990> they<00:01:09.110> just<00:01:09.320> think<00:01:09.530> to<00:01:09.710> live<00:01:10.160> it<00:01:10.310> or

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
the net so they just think to live it or

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:25.320

see<00:01:31.070> how<00:01:31.250> they're<00:01:31.429> faring<00:01:31.869> so<00:01:32.869> Steve<00:01:33.110> what's

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
see how they're faring so Steve what's

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.749 
see how they're faring so Steve what's
really<00:01:33.679> the<00:01:33.800> limiting<00:01:34.159> factor<00:01:34.460> is<00:01:34.580> at<00:01:34.670> the

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
really the limiting factor is at the

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.310 
really the limiting factor is at the
number<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:35.119> nest<00:01:35.360> holes<00:01:35.630> or<00:01:35.929> the<00:01:35.960> amount<00:01:36.259> of

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
number of nest holes or the amount of

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.139 
number of nest holes or the amount of
seed<00:01:36.619> that<00:01:36.649> they<00:01:37.009> can<00:01:37.220> find<00:01:37.489> during<00:01:37.910> the<00:01:38.000> wet

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
seed that they can find during the wet

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.120 
seed that they can find during the wet
season<00:01:38.179> it<00:01:38.899> seems<00:01:39.259> to<00:01:39.380> be<00:01:39.470> a<00:01:39.500> combination<00:01:39.770> of

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
season it seems to be a combination of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.859 
season it seems to be a combination of
both<00:01:40.190> that<00:01:40.729> compelled<00:01:41.119> to<00:01:41.300> nest<00:01:41.509> in<00:01:41.630> tree

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
both that compelled to nest in tree

make one of two decisions they can

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.740 
make one of two decisions they can
either<00:01:52.190> try<00:01:52.610> and<00:01:52.640> commute<00:01:53.119> from<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.450> nest

doing so that exhausts themselves or
they<00:01:58.580> just<00:01:58.789> decide<00:01:59.270> not<00:01:59.300> to<00:01:59.479> breed<00:01:59.810> that

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
they just decide not to breed that

either<00:02:00.229> way<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.619> population<00:02:00.770> is<00:02:01.190> just<00:02:01.340> going

either way the population is just going

either way the population is just going
to<00:02:01.580> go<00:02:01.670> down<00:02:02.319> okay<00:02:03.319> so<00:02:03.379> here<00:02:04.280> we<00:02:04.310> have<00:02:04.550> a<00:02:04.580> female

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569

Gordian<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.560> love<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.129> move<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:07.970> then

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
Gordian I love the move and then

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.240 
Gordian I love the move and then
the<00:02:09.220> yellow<00:02:09.610> so<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.630> process<00:02:10.990> is<00:02:11.250> first

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
the yellow so the process is first

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.370 
the yellow so the process is first

it's got a individual number and then I
bleed<00:02:17.590> them<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.130> find<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.730> vein<00:02:18.940> under<00:02:19.209> the

mmm<00:02:26.560> an<00:02:26.709> error<00:02:27.060> here<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:28.330> where<00:02:28.600> cattle<00:02:29.230> has

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
mmm an error here is where cattle has

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
better chance of fighting back it does

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.740 
better chance of fighting back it does
because<00:02:34.390> cattle<00:02:35.260> do<00:02:35.590> preferentially<00:02:36.280> graze

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
because cattle do preferentially graze

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.479 
because cattle do preferentially graze
some<00:02:37.750> grass<00:02:38.200> species<00:02:38.500> which<00:02:38.860> they<00:02:39.010> find<00:02:39.250> tasty

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
some grass species which they find tasty

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.479 
some grass species which they find tasty
yeah<00:02:40.769> what<00:02:41.769> you're<00:02:41.890> doing<00:02:42.220> here<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.459> it's

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
yeah what you're doing here is it's

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.910 
yeah what you're doing here is it's
monitoring<00:02:43.209> how<00:02:43.420> your<00:02:43.660> burnings<00:02:44.319> going<00:02:44.709> in<00:02:44.830> a

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
monitoring how your burnings going in a

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.580 
monitoring how your burnings going in a
sense<00:02:45.160> yes<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:45.880> grazing<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.600> grozny<00:02:47.140> destock

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
sense yes and grazing and grozny destock

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.590 
sense yes and grazing and grozny destock
yeah<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.280> can<00:02:48.430> tell<00:02:48.670> by<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:48.940> condition<00:02:49.510> of

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
yeah so you can tell by the condition of

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
yeah so you can tell by the condition of
the<00:02:49.690> birds<00:02:49.930> with<00:02:50.200> all<00:02:50.410> your<00:02:50.590> other

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
the birds with all your other

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.289 
the birds with all your other
management's<00:02:51.340> really<00:02:51.610> working<00:02:51.940> absolutely

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
management's really working absolutely

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.990 
management's really working absolutely
yeah<00:02:53.019> they're<00:02:53.319> an<00:02:53.830> extremely<00:02:54.340> good<00:02:54.489> indicator

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
yeah they're an extremely good indicator

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.690 
yeah they're an extremely good indicator
of<00:02:55.330> that<00:02:55.390> actually<00:02:55.870> yeah<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.769> real<00:02:57.040> key<00:02:57.400> to

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
of that actually yeah the real key to

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.880 
of that actually yeah the real key to
maintaining<00:02:58.269> biodiversity<00:02:58.810> north<00:02:59.410> is<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.709> try

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
maintaining biodiversity north is to try

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.640 
maintaining biodiversity north is to try
and<00:03:00.010> break<00:03:00.220> up<00:03:00.400> those<00:03:00.610> those<00:03:01.540> impacts<00:03:02.470> that

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
and break up those those impacts that

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.920 
and break up those those impacts that
are<00:03:02.739> happening<00:03:02.860> on<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.760> landscape<00:03:04.209> scale<00:03:04.450> so

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
are happening on the landscape scale so

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.360 
are happening on the landscape scale so
to<00:03:05.290> try<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:05.500> break<00:03:05.739> it<00:03:05.920> up<00:03:05.980> make<00:03:06.160> things

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
to try and break it up make things

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.830 
to try and break it up make things
patching<00:03:06.790> make<00:03:06.970> sure<00:03:07.180> we've<00:03:07.360> got<00:03:07.540> some<00:03:07.690> old

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
patching make sure we've got some old

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.780 
patching make sure we've got some old
spinifex<00:03:08.170> left<00:03:08.560> in<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.769> system<00:03:08.950> make<00:03:09.610> sure

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
spinifex left in the system make sure

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.520 
spinifex left in the system make sure
that<00:03:09.940> not<00:03:10.090> all<00:03:10.390> areas<00:03:10.660> are<00:03:10.959> grazed<00:03:11.200> in

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
that not all areas are grazed in

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.560 
that not all areas are grazed in
particularly<00:03:11.950> sensitive<00:03:12.310> areas<00:03:12.910> are<00:03:13.090> not

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
particularly sensitive areas are not

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.870 
particularly sensitive areas are not
grades<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.320> I<00:03:14.650> think<00:03:15.190> that's<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.670> key<00:03:15.850> to

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
grades so I think that's the key to

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.630 
grades so I think that's the key to
making<00:03:16.600> sure<00:03:16.780> that<00:03:16.930> you<00:03:17.680> know<00:03:17.799> pastures<00:03:18.310> sir

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
making sure that you know pastures sir

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.130 
making sure that you know pastures sir
you<00:03:18.880> know<00:03:19.000> can<00:03:19.209> go<00:03:19.510> on<00:03:19.630> doing<00:03:19.750> what<00:03:19.959> they<00:03:20.079> do

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
you know can go on doing what they do

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.780 
you know can go on doing what they do
and<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.980> plants<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:21.459> animals<00:03:21.670> have

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
and the plants and animals have

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.580 
and the plants and animals have
somewhere<00:03:22.060> to<00:03:22.120> live<00:03:22.239> as<00:03:22.359> well<00:03:22.540> hmm<00:03:22.959> so<00:03:23.410> those
