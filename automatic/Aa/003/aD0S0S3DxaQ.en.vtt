00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
structure that we did and the library

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.830 
structure that we did and the library
module<00:00:51.950> tutorials<00:00:52.520> where<00:00:53.180> we<00:00:53.270> discussed<00:00:53.660> all

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
module tutorials where we discussed all

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.210 
module tutorials where we discussed all
the<00:00:53.989> panel<00:00:54.380> functionality<00:00:54.980> and<00:00:55.130> the

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
the panel functionality and the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.150 
the panel functionality and the
interface<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:55.970> then<00:00:56.600> whatever<00:00:57.070> kind<00:00:58.070> of

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
interface and then whatever kind of

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.470 
interface and then whatever kind of
features<00:00:58.460> and<00:00:58.610> functions<00:00:58.940> were<00:00:59.059> left<00:00:59.270> out

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
features and functions were left out

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.060 
features and functions were left out
from<00:00:59.630> the<00:00:59.720> menus<00:01:00.230> we<00:01:00.440> went<00:01:00.620> back<00:01:00.800> over

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
from the menus we went back over

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.040 
from the menus we went back over
afterwards<00:01:01.520> and<00:01:01.850> covered<00:01:02.180> those<00:01:02.360> kind<00:01:03.020> of

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
afterwards and covered those kind of

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.350 
afterwards and covered those kind of
awkward<00:01:03.350> because<00:01:03.500> for<00:01:04.189> the<00:01:04.369> most<00:01:04.549> part<00:01:04.820> the

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
awkward because for the most part the

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.700 
awkward because for the most part the
menus<00:01:05.750> that<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:05.960> see<00:01:06.110> up<00:01:06.229> here<00:01:06.259> at<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:06.500> top

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
menus that you see up here at the top

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.800 
menus that you see up here at the top
are<00:01:06.950> just<00:01:07.240> duplications<00:01:08.240> of<00:01:08.479> all<00:01:08.659> the

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
are just duplications of all the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.940 
are just duplications of all the
features<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:09.229> functionality<00:01:09.710> that's

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
features and functionality that's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.039 
features and functionality that's
already<00:01:10.310> in<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.610> interface<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.270> then<00:01:11.930> we'll

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
already in the interface and then we'll

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.690 
already in the interface and then we'll
cover<00:01:12.259> whatever<00:01:12.649> we<00:01:12.890> don't<00:01:13.189> cover<00:01:13.429> in<00:01:13.609> the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
cover whatever we don't cover in the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.219 
cover whatever we don't cover in the
interface<00:01:13.969> later<00:01:14.509> when<00:01:14.780> we<00:01:14.869> get<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.109> that

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
interface later when we get to that

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.529 
interface later when we get to that
point<00:01:15.819> alright<00:01:16.819> guys<00:01:16.939> so<00:01:17.060> let's<00:01:17.090> jump<00:01:17.450> right

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
point alright guys so let's jump right

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.809 
point alright guys so let's jump right
in<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:17.840> start<00:01:18.020> talking<00:01:18.380> about<00:01:18.679> the<00:01:19.159> Navigator

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:19.819 
in and start talking about the Navigator

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:21.609 
in and start talking about the Navigator
window<00:01:20.420> right<00:01:20.600> here<00:01:20.780> as<00:01:20.929> well<00:01:21.109> as<00:01:21.350> these

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
window right here as well as these

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.739 
window right here as well as these
presets<00:01:22.189> now<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.759> Navigator<00:01:23.240> actually<00:01:23.539> works

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:23.749 
presets now the Navigator actually works

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:25.539 
presets now the Navigator actually works
very<00:01:24.109> similarly<00:01:24.560> to<00:01:24.679> how<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.039> does<00:01:25.219> in<00:01:25.459> the

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
very similarly to how it does in the

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.489 
very similarly to how it does in the
library<00:01:25.969> module<00:01:26.119> where<00:01:26.840> when<00:01:27.049> we<00:01:27.139> mouse<00:01:27.319> over

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:27.499 
library module where when we mouse over

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:29.230 
library module where when we mouse over
images<00:01:27.799> in<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.069> filmstrip<00:01:28.579> it'll<00:01:28.850> show<00:01:29.029> us<00:01:29.149> a

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
images in the filmstrip it'll show us a

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.629 
images in the filmstrip it'll show us a
preview<00:01:29.569> in<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:29.779> Navigator<00:01:30.229> we<00:01:31.159> can<00:01:31.340> use<00:01:31.520> the

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:31.639 
preview in the Navigator we can use the

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:33.849 
preview in the Navigator we can use the
Navigator<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.240> zoom<00:01:32.479> in<00:01:32.749> to<00:01:32.929> our<00:01:33.049> image<00:01:33.380> we<00:01:33.709> can

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:33.859 
Navigator to zoom in to our image we can

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:36.669 
Navigator to zoom in to our image we can
adjust<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.639> zoom<00:01:35.630> level<00:01:35.689> three<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.319> one<00:01:36.469> one

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
adjust the zoom level three to one one

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.760 
adjust the zoom level three to one one
to<00:01:36.709> one<00:01:36.829> fit<00:01:37.249> our<00:01:37.429> fill<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:39.139> then<00:01:39.560> we<00:01:39.649> can

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
to one fit our fill and and then we can

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.109 
to one fit our fill and and then we can
double<00:01:40.039> click<00:01:40.069> to<00:01:40.279> zoom<00:01:40.310> back<00:01:40.490> out<00:01:40.789> so<00:01:40.999> it's

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
double click to zoom back out so it's

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.399 
double click to zoom back out so it's
all<00:01:41.240> pretty<00:01:41.659> much<00:01:41.719> the<00:01:41.779> same<00:01:41.929> functionality

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
all pretty much the same functionality

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.889 
all pretty much the same functionality
there<00:01:42.770> but<00:01:43.429> where<00:01:43.609> it<00:01:43.729> differs<00:01:44.029> is<00:01:44.509> basically

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
there but where it differs is basically

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.169 
there but where it differs is basically
with<00:01:45.109> these<00:01:45.259> presets<00:01:45.829> the<00:01:46.609> Navigator<00:01:47.029> window

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
with these presets the Navigator window

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:48.699 
with these presets the Navigator window
in<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.569> develop<00:01:47.990> module<00:01:48.109> works<00:01:48.560> in

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
in the develop module works in

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:50.709 
in the develop module works in
conjunction<00:01:48.889> with<00:01:49.639> these<00:01:49.849> presets<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:50.599> these

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
conjunction with these presets and these

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.449 
conjunction with these presets and these
presets<00:01:51.170> are<00:01:51.319> basically<00:01:51.590> developed<00:01:52.099> module

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:52.459 
presets are basically developed module

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:53.699 
presets are basically developed module
presets<00:01:52.909> so<00:01:53.060> essentially<00:01:53.479> they<00:01:53.599> are

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
presets so essentially they are

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.050 
presets so essentially they are
different<00:01:54.709> settings<00:01:55.099> that<00:01:55.490> have<00:01:55.579> been<00:01:55.729> saved

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
different settings that have been saved

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.959 
different settings that have been saved
as<00:01:56.270> presets<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:57.139> each<00:01:57.289> photo<00:01:57.679> so<00:01:58.549> if<00:01:58.819> you
