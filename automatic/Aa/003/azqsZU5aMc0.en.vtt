00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.840 
but so do you take work home with you at

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
least thinking about it many times will

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.249 
least thinking about it many times will
be<00:01:08.880> weekends<00:01:09.420> where<00:01:09.570> I'll<00:01:09.689> be<00:01:09.720> working<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.200> a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
lot to do and a lot to think about all

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.859 
lot to do and a lot to think about all
the<00:01:13.890> time<00:01:13.920> how<00:01:14.759> would<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.030> describe<00:01:15.329> the<00:01:15.630> pace

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the time how would you describe the pace

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.249 
the time how would you describe the pace
at<00:01:16.140> which<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.469> work<00:01:18.109> personally<00:01:19.109> I'm<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
at which you work personally I'm a

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.469 
at which you work personally I'm a
multitasker<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.490> don't<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.090> watching

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
multitasker so I don't like watching

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.599 
multitasker so I don't like watching
something<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.259> typically<00:01:22.859> do<00:01:23.069> probably<00:01:23.460> two

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:23.609 
something I typically do probably two

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:25.969 
something I typically do probably two
three<00:01:23.789> things<00:01:24.060> at<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> time<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.259> lot<00:01:25.890> of

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
three things at a time if I can a lot of

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.730 
three things at a time if I can a lot of
times<00:01:26.219> in<00:01:26.539> technical<00:01:27.539> work<00:01:27.719> or<00:01:27.929> computer

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
times in technical work or computer

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.230 
times in technical work or computer
related<00:01:29.069> work<00:01:29.249> there's<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.520> lot<00:01:29.639> of<00:01:29.670> waiting<00:01:29.969> a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
related work there's a lot of waiting a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.989 
related work there's a lot of waiting a
lot<00:01:30.389> of<00:01:30.420> watching<00:01:30.960> things<00:01:31.259> work<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.850> there's

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:32.999 
lot of watching things work so there's

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:34.399 
lot of watching things work so there's
many<00:01:33.119> times<00:01:33.359> you<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.630> do<00:01:33.719> multiple<00:01:33.899> things<00:01:34.139> at

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
many times you can do multiple things at

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:34.840 
many times you can do multiple things at
once

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
once

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.149

how<00:01:35.540> has<00:01:35.810> your<00:01:35.960> education<00:01:35.990> prepared<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:37.130> for

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
how has your education prepared you for

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.109 
how has your education prepared you for
your<00:01:37.430> career<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:39.520> started<00:01:40.520> out<00:01:40.640> in<00:01:40.820> in

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
your career I started out in in

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.690 
your career I started out in in
mathematics<00:01:42.080> in<00:01:42.710> college<00:01:43.190> and<00:01:43.430> didn't<00:01:43.610> really

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
mathematics in college and didn't really

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.910 
mathematics in college and didn't really
think<00:01:43.940> about<00:01:44.060> computers<00:01:44.690> but<00:01:45.350> slowly<00:01:45.619> went

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
think about computers but slowly went

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.280 
think about computers but slowly went
into<00:01:46.159> computers<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:47.080> found<00:01:48.080> out<00:01:48.229> that

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
into computers and found out that

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.990 
into computers and found out that
mathematics<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:49.430> computer<00:01:49.970> science

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
mathematics and computer science

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.749 
mathematics and computer science
together<00:01:50.780> as<00:01:51.170> my<00:01:51.350> majors<00:01:51.770> really<00:01:52.430> worked<00:01:52.610> out

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
together as my majors really worked out

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.330 
together as my majors really worked out
for<00:01:52.940> troubleshooting<00:01:53.680> particularly<00:01:54.680> now<00:01:55.220> you

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
for troubleshooting particularly now you

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.310 
for troubleshooting particularly now you
learn<00:01:55.490> a<00:01:55.520> lot<00:01:55.729> about<00:01:55.789> computer<00:01:56.450> science<00:01:56.720> you

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
learn a lot about computer science you

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.700 
learn a lot about computer science you
know<00:01:57.409> programming<00:01:57.860> and<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:59.590> specifics<00:02:00.590> to

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
know programming and and specifics to

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.740 
know programming and and specifics to
computers<00:02:01.159> but<00:02:01.369> mathematics<00:02:02.330> I<00:02:02.390> think<00:02:02.570> really

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
computers but mathematics I think really

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.120 
computers but mathematics I think really
gives<00:02:02.930> you<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.140> edge<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:04.210> troubleshoot<00:02:05.210> maybe

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
gives you the edge to troubleshoot maybe

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.710 
gives you the edge to troubleshoot maybe
complex<00:02:07.130> problems<00:02:07.700> or<00:02:07.940> things<00:02:08.390> that<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.600> may

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.699 
did you choose this career
I<00:02:16.090> chose<00:02:17.090> this<00:02:17.690> career<00:02:18.050> I<00:02:18.260> came<00:02:18.590> from

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
I chose this career I came from

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.960 
I chose this career I came from
someplace<00:02:18.980> else<00:02:19.340> but<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.819> NISC<00:02:20.390> has<00:02:20.540> become<00:02:20.930> a

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
someplace else but the NISC has become a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.070 
someplace else but the NISC has become a
actually<00:02:22.970> I<00:02:23.000> maybe<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:23.330> should<00:02:23.510> step<00:02:23.720> back<00:02:23.750> the

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
actually I maybe I should step back the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.449 
actually I maybe I should step back the
career<00:02:24.319> itself<00:02:26.379> computers<00:02:27.379> again<00:02:27.980> going<00:02:28.370> back

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
career itself computers again going back

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.399 
career itself computers again going back
to<00:02:28.849> the<00:02:29.030> fact<00:02:29.269> that<00:02:29.360> i<00:02:29.480> looked<00:02:29.720> at<00:02:29.840> mathematics

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
to the fact that i looked at mathematics

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.890 
to the fact that i looked at mathematics
first<00:02:30.650> computers<00:02:31.370> really<00:02:31.700> has<00:02:31.849> a<00:02:31.879> probably<00:02:32.840> a

first computers really has a probably a

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.470 
first computers really has a probably a
better<00:02:33.019> edge<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:34.160> when<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.400> term<00:02:34.640> in<00:02:35.090> terms<00:02:35.120> of

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
better edge and when a term in terms of

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.990 
better edge and when a term in terms of
today's<00:02:36.140> technology<00:02:36.769> there's<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:37.819> lot<00:02:37.970> more

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
today's technology there's a lot more

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.430 
today's technology there's a lot more
openings<00:02:38.569> out<00:02:38.810> there<00:02:39.019> there's<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.260> lot<00:02:39.410> more

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
openings out there there's a lot more

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.190 
openings out there there's a lot more
things<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:40.129> do<00:02:40.280> in<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.549> technology<00:02:40.849> field

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
things to do in the technology field

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.569 
things to do in the technology field
versus<00:02:42.200> what<00:02:42.920> i<00:02:42.950> was<00:02:43.129> looking<00:02:43.160> at<00:02:43.430> in

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
versus what i was looking at in

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.410 
versus what i was looking at in
mathematics<00:02:44.230> so<00:02:45.230> probably<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.549> pay<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.120> the

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
mathematics so probably the pay and the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.900 
mathematics so probably the pay and the
experience<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:49.010> opportunities

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
experience and the the opportunities

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.250 
experience and the the opportunities
that<00:02:49.940> are<00:02:50.209> in<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:50.420> careers<00:02:50.690> what<00:02:50.959> probably

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
that are in the careers what probably

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.009 
that are in the careers what probably
drove<00:02:51.379> me<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:52.450> do<00:02:53.450> you<00:02:53.540> have<00:02:53.720> in<00:02:53.870> your

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
drove me to it do you have in your

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.390 
drove me to it do you have in your
career<00:02:54.400> i<00:02:55.540> tried<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.569> be<00:02:57.040> possibly<00:02:58.040> some<00:02:58.220> sort

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
career i tried to be possibly some sort

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.559 
career i tried to be possibly some sort
of<00:02:58.430> technical<00:02:59.680> advisor<00:03:00.680> in<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.099> company<00:03:01.790> they

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
of technical advisor in the company they

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.750 
of technical advisor in the company they
basically<00:03:02.900> have<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.260> role<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.609> to<00:03:04.609> make

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
basically have a role to to make

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.390 
basically have a role to to make
decisions<00:03:05.239> on<00:03:05.359> a<00:03:05.390> technical<00:03:05.840> level<00:03:06.400> versus

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
decisions on a technical level versus

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.460 
decisions on a technical level versus
just<00:03:07.640> doing<00:03:07.940> day-to-day<00:03:08.090> tasks<00:03:08.569> actually

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
just doing day-to-day tasks actually

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.740 
just doing day-to-day tasks actually
having<00:03:09.739> a<00:03:09.829> chance<00:03:10.400> to<00:03:10.519> have<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:10.970> say<00:03:11.239> in<00:03:11.269> some<00:03:11.660> of

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
having a chance to have a say in some of

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.080 
having a chance to have a say in some of
the<00:03:11.810> bigger<00:03:11.989> decisions<00:03:12.859> of<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.040> company

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.259 

I<00:03:17.180> think<00:03:18.670> keeping<00:03:19.670> up<00:03:19.970> with<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.239> latest

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
I think keeping up with the latest

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.330 
I think keeping up with the latest
technology<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:21.379> technology<00:03:22.129> is<00:03:22.220> always

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
technology and technology is always

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.550 
technology and technology is always
changing<00:03:22.430> so<00:03:22.970> there's<00:03:23.660> always<00:03:23.930> things<00:03:24.410> you

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
changing so there's always things you

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.199 
changing so there's always things you
need<00:03:24.709> to<00:03:24.739> learn<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.310> that<00:03:25.580> sometimes<00:03:25.790> means

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
need to learn and that sometimes means

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.460 
need to learn and that sometimes means
taking<00:03:26.540> your<00:03:26.780> own<00:03:26.810> personal<00:03:27.260> time<00:03:27.440> and

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
taking your own personal time and

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.160 
taking your own personal time and
learning<00:03:27.920> some<00:03:28.069> of<00:03:28.160> these<00:03:28.220> technologies

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
learning some of these technologies

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.869 
learning some of these technologies
because<00:03:30.170> if<00:03:30.319> you<00:03:30.440> don't<00:03:30.590> you'll<00:03:31.280> you'll<00:03:31.610> fall

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
because if you don't you'll you'll fall

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:33.850 
because if you don't you'll you'll fall
off<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.180> bus<00:03:32.360> maybe<00:03:32.660> what<00:03:33.260> they'd<00:03:33.410> say<00:03:33.440> and

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
off the bus maybe what they'd say and

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.619 
off the bus maybe what they'd say and
you<00:03:34.370> won't<00:03:34.400> be<00:03:34.549> able<00:03:34.610> to<00:03:34.819> get<00:03:34.910> back<00:03:35.090> on<00:03:35.330> really

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
you won't be able to get back on really

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.839 
you won't be able to get back on really
easily<00:03:35.690> because<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.500> technology<00:03:36.739> moves<00:03:37.190> you

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
easily because the technology moves you

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.500 
easily because the technology moves you
know<00:03:37.970> as<00:03:38.209> fast<00:03:38.569> as<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:39.410> can<00:03:39.910> you<00:03:40.910> travel<00:03:41.209> for

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
know as fast as it can you travel for

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.839 
know as fast as it can you travel for
your<00:03:41.660> job<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:42.170> do<00:03:42.680> I've<00:03:43.250> actually<00:03:43.430> traveled

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
your job I do I've actually traveled

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.320 
your job I do I've actually traveled
quite<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.060> bit<00:03:44.299> with<00:03:44.450> an<00:03:44.569> ISC<00:03:45.049> I've<00:03:45.650> been<00:03:45.890> to

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
quite a bit with an ISC I've been to

quite a bit with an ISC I've been to
Alaska<00:03:47.330> Hawaii<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:49.489> know<00:03:49.519> some<00:03:49.790> of<00:03:49.819> the<00:03:49.970> more

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
Alaska Hawaii you know some of the more

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.660 
Alaska Hawaii you know some of the more
exotic<00:03:50.329> places<00:03:50.870> all<00:03:51.590> over<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.950> country<00:03:52.370> so

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
exotic places all over the country so

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.360 
exotic places all over the country so
that's<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.630> very<00:03:53.900> good<00:03:54.200> experience<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:55.160> people

but<00:04:16.920> you<00:04:17.040> know<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.250> most<00:04:17.609> difficult

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
but you know the most difficult

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.120 
but you know the most difficult
decisions<00:04:18.660> are<00:04:19.049> probably<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.680> ones<00:04:19.709> that

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
decisions are probably the ones that

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.390 
decisions are probably the ones that
have<00:04:20.280> multiple<00:04:21.290> multiple<00:04:22.290> right<00:04:22.800> answers<00:04:23.250> or

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
have multiple multiple right answers or

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.400 
have multiple multiple right answers or
multiple<00:04:23.820> right<00:04:23.970> tracks<00:04:24.330> when<00:04:25.170> you<00:04:25.260> have<00:04:25.380> a

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
multiple right tracks when you have a

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.890 
multiple right tracks when you have a
lot<00:04:25.650> of<00:04:25.680> risk<00:04:26.100> in<00:04:26.400> all<00:04:27.210> of<00:04:27.390> them<00:04:27.540> are<00:04:27.720> that

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
lot of risk in all of them are that

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.200 
lot of risk in all of them are that
there's<00:04:28.110> equal<00:04:28.410> risk<00:04:28.650> many<00:04:29.370> times<00:04:29.610> it's<00:04:29.910> just

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
there's equal risk many times it's just

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.600 
there's equal risk many times it's just
basically<00:04:30.810> up<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.080> you<00:04:31.350> to<00:04:31.500> decide<00:04:31.650> which<00:04:32.400> one

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
basically up to you to decide which one

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.370 
basically up to you to decide which one
do<00:04:32.700> you<00:04:32.790> think<00:04:32.820> will<00:04:33.150> be<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.390> better<00:04:34.260> option

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
do you think will be the better option

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.130 
do you think will be the better option
down<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:35.130> road<00:04:35.310> maybe<00:04:35.340> 5-10<00:04:36.120> years<00:04:36.390> and<00:04:36.810> you

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
down the road maybe 5-10 years and you

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.420 
down the road maybe 5-10 years and you
may<00:04:37.260> not<00:04:37.410> know<00:04:37.620> you're<00:04:37.950> you're<00:04:38.220> wrong

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
may not know you're you're wrong

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.580 
may not know you're you're wrong
decision<00:04:38.970> until<00:04:39.240> five<00:04:39.870> ten<00:04:40.110> years<00:04:40.140> down<00:04:40.350> the

decision until five ten years down the

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.770 
decision until five ten years down the
road<00:04:40.620> so<00:04:41.210> definitely<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.360> ones<00:04:42.540> that<00:04:42.690> affect

risk and a lot of different solutions
you<00:04:49.020> work<00:04:49.260> independently<00:04:50.250> or
