being so incredibly hopeful and I kept

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.010 
being so incredibly hopeful and I kept
walking<00:02:26.840> in<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.260> shoes<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.910> said<00:02:29.180> yes<00:02:29.360> I'll

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
comfortable now and i had custom

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.210 
comfortable now and i had custom
fittings<00:03:11.360> done<00:03:11.630> so<00:03:12.290> that's<00:03:12.590> what's<00:03:12.920> very

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
fittings done so that's what's very

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.830 
fittings done so that's what's very
important<00:03:13.730> i<00:03:13.760> like<00:03:13.910> to<00:03:14.030> call<00:03:14.180> them<00:03:14.240> tune<00:03:14.630> ups

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
important i like to call them tune ups

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.449 
important i like to call them tune ups
but<00:03:15.110> i<00:03:15.170> think<00:03:15.410> here<00:03:15.560> Zeke<00:03:15.830> oil<00:03:16.070> they<00:03:16.190> actually

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
but i think here Zeke oil they actually

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.790 
but i think here Zeke oil they actually
call<00:03:16.670> them<00:03:16.760> custom<00:03:17.150> fitting<00:03:17.510> but<00:03:18.260> that<00:03:18.590> would

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
call them custom fitting but that would

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.920 
call them custom fitting but that would
make<00:03:18.950> such<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.340> huge<00:03:19.520> difference<00:03:19.760> because<00:03:20.330> as

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
make such a huge difference because as

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.380 
make such a huge difference because as
the<00:03:20.990> tissues<00:03:21.770> are<00:03:21.950> healing<00:03:22.250> as<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:23.030> body's

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
the tissues are healing as the body's

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.530 
the tissues are healing as the body's
shifting<00:03:24.019> as<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:25.190> things<00:03:25.760> are<00:03:25.970> changing<00:03:26.480> in

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
shifting as the things are changing in

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.330 
shifting as the things are changing in
your<00:03:26.690> body<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:27.170> need<00:03:27.350> to<00:03:27.470> come<00:03:27.680> in<00:03:27.920> and<00:03:28.070> see

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
your body you need to come in and see

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.360 
your body you need to come in and see
that<00:03:28.640> that<00:03:28.940> these<00:03:29.420> custom<00:03:29.930> fittings<00:03:30.200> occur<00:03:30.560> so

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
that that these custom fittings occur so

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.190 
that that these custom fittings occur so
that<00:03:31.730> you<00:03:32.000> can<00:03:32.150> go<00:03:32.269> on<00:03:32.390> to<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.600> next<00:03:32.780> level<00:03:33.110> of

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
that you can go on to the next level of

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.199 
that you can go on to the next level of
healing<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.680> that's<00:03:34.430> what<00:03:34.730> kept<00:03:34.940> happening

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
healing and that's what kept happening

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.780 
healing and that's what kept happening
and<00:03:35.690> so<00:03:36.590> we<00:03:36.769> did<00:03:36.950> that<00:03:36.980> for<00:03:37.370> a<00:03:37.400> couple<00:03:37.459> of

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
and so we did that for a couple of

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.860 
and so we did that for a couple of
months<00:03:37.850> and<00:03:38.860> that<00:03:39.860> made<00:03:40.190> a<00:03:40.220> huge<00:03:40.519> difference

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
months and that made a huge difference

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.170 
months and that made a huge difference
at<00:03:41.870> one<00:03:42.260> point<00:03:42.290> my<00:03:43.010> ankles<00:03:43.489> just<00:03:43.610> were<00:03:44.150> not

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
at one point my ankles just were not

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.590 
at one point my ankles just were not
getting<00:03:44.720> any<00:03:44.959> better<00:03:45.019> so<00:03:45.950> I<00:03:45.980> came<00:03:46.220> down<00:03:46.459> to<00:03:47.239> the

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
getting any better so I came down to the

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.300 
getting any better so I came down to the
store<00:03:47.840> again<00:03:47.959> and<00:03:48.380> I<00:03:48.440> talked<00:03:48.709> with<00:03:48.800> Kathleen

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
store again and I talked with Kathleen

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.460 
store again and I talked with Kathleen
and<00:03:49.519> she<00:03:50.060> suggested<00:03:50.570> it<00:03:50.989> actually<00:03:51.260> try<00:03:51.410> the

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
and she suggested it actually try the

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.650 
and she suggested it actually try the
hiking<00:03:51.950> boot<00:03:52.160> and<00:03:52.820> I<00:03:53.090> didn't<00:03:53.300> even<00:03:53.330> know<00:03:53.540> there

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
hiking boot and I didn't even know there

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.720 
hiking boot and I didn't even know there
