00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
hear that noise it is pretty significant

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.900 
hear that noise it is pretty significant
than<00:00:55.359> the<00:00:55.710> when<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.800> guy<00:00:56.890> failed<00:00:57.190> he<00:00:57.399> told<00:00:57.820> me

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
than the when the guy failed he told me

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.490 
than the when the guy failed he told me
that<00:00:58.210> you<00:00:58.329> know<00:00:58.420> legally<00:00:58.840> he's<00:00:58.989> not<00:00:59.199> allowed

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
that you know legally he's not allowed

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.830 
that you know legally he's not allowed
to<00:00:59.910> guess<00:01:00.910> at<00:01:01.149> it<00:01:01.180> and<00:01:01.390> tell<00:01:01.480> me<00:01:01.539> what<00:01:01.629> it<00:01:01.809> is

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
to guess at it and tell me what it is

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.810 
to guess at it and tell me what it is
but<00:01:02.410> he<00:01:02.710> decided<00:01:03.039> to<00:01:03.219> go<00:01:03.280> ahead<00:01:03.579> and<00:01:03.699> do<00:01:03.789> that

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
but he decided to go ahead and do that

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.690 
but he decided to go ahead and do that
anyway<00:01:04.300> and<00:01:04.660> he<00:01:04.750> said<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:06.369> probably<00:01:06.610> your

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
anyway and he said it's probably your

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.999 
anyway and he said it's probably your
front<00:01:06.880> wheel<00:01:07.060> their<00:01:07.270> wheel<00:01:07.899> bearings<00:01:08.289> and<00:01:08.710> I

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
front wheel their wheel bearings and I

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.980 
front wheel their wheel bearings and I
really<00:01:09.610> didn't<00:01:10.179> think<00:01:10.210> that<00:01:10.509> was<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.750> case

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
really didn't think that was the case

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.430 
really didn't think that was the case
mostly<00:01:11.500> because<00:01:11.679> I<00:01:11.890> mean<00:01:12.100> there's<00:01:12.310> been<00:01:12.580> no

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
mostly because I mean there's been no

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.030 
mostly because I mean there's been no
associated<00:01:14.440> road<00:01:14.740> noise<00:01:14.950> of<00:01:15.220> that<00:01:15.369> and<00:01:17.040> when

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
associated road noise of that and when

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.679 
associated road noise of that and when
the<00:01:18.130> wheel<00:01:18.250> bearings<00:01:18.640> went<00:01:19.210> on<00:01:19.360> my<00:01:19.479> last

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
the wheel bearings went on my last

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.560 
the wheel bearings went on my last
Subaru<00:01:20.460> there<00:01:21.460> was<00:01:21.580> definite<00:01:21.970> definite<00:01:22.420> noise

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
Subaru there was definite definite noise

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.980 
Subaru there was definite definite noise
so<00:01:23.020> I<00:01:24.150> did<00:01:25.150> some<00:01:25.299> more<00:01:25.360> checking<00:01:25.659> and<00:01:25.900> I

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
so I did some more checking and I

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.950 
so I did some more checking and I
grabbed<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.680> wheel<00:01:26.770> at<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.040> top<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:27.460> bottom

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
grabbed the wheel at the top and bottom

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.660 
grabbed the wheel at the top and bottom
and<00:01:28.960> it's<00:01:29.409> pretty<00:01:29.590> much<00:01:29.680> solid<00:01:30.100> as<00:01:30.220> a<00:01:30.250> rock

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
and it's pretty much solid as a rock

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.929 
and it's pretty much solid as a rock
same<00:01:31.180> on<00:01:31.329> the<00:01:31.450> other<00:01:31.479> side<00:01:31.869> of<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:32.020> car<00:01:32.200> and<00:01:32.939> if

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
same on the other side of the car and if

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.350 
same on the other side of the car and if
it<00:01:34.119> was<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.329> wheel<00:01:34.450> bearings<00:01:34.869> it<00:01:35.049> would<00:01:35.200> be<00:01:36.360> it

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
it was the wheel bearings it would be it

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.940 
it was the wheel bearings it would be it
would<00:01:37.450> be<00:01:37.479> given<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.110> same<00:01:38.259> kind<00:01:38.560> of<00:01:38.590> rocking

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
would be given the same kind of rocking

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.639 
would be given the same kind of rocking
up<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.220> down<00:01:39.720> at<00:01:40.720> which<00:01:40.840> point<00:01:41.140> I<00:01:41.200> realized

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
up and down at which point I realized

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.420 
up and down at which point I realized
that<00:01:41.979> it's<00:01:42.970> us<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:44.560> play<00:01:44.799> here<00:01:45.070> is<00:01:45.159> somewhere

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
that it's us this play here is somewhere

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.780 
that it's us this play here is somewhere

else in the suspension so let me get

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.370 
else in the suspension so let me get
under<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.060> car<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.270> I'll<00:01:49.780> show<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.229> what<00:01:50.350> I

the boots when I bought the car both

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.940 
the boots when I bought the car both
shredded<00:02:06.189> by<00:02:07.149> grabbing<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.570> wheel<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.920> can

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
shredded by grabbing the wheel you can

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.510 
shredded by grabbing the wheel you can
see<00:02:12.250> the

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
see the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.190 
see the
police<00:02:14.300> seems<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.660> be<00:02:14.750> there<00:02:14.870> in<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.020> rack

because I looked over here so look at

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.020 
because I looked over here so look at
the<00:02:18.050> wheel<00:02:18.200> while<00:02:18.830> looking<00:02:19.160> at<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.400> rest<00:02:19.850> of

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
the wheel while looking at the rest of

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.900 
the wheel while looking at the rest of
the<00:02:20.450> suspension<00:02:20.990> and<00:02:21.280> everything<00:02:22.280> else<00:02:22.610> seems

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
the suspension and everything else seems

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.750 
the suspension and everything else seems
pretty<00:02:23.780> tight<00:02:24.080> over<00:02:24.320> here<00:02:24.350> in<00:02:24.740> relation<00:02:25.730> to

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
pretty tight over here in relation to

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.910 
pretty tight over here in relation to
eat<00:02:25.970> all<00:02:26.930> these<00:02:27.050> parts<00:02:27.320> in<00:02:27.410> relation<00:02:27.710> to<00:02:27.800> each

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
eat all these parts in relation to each

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.880 
eat all these parts in relation to each
other<00:02:28.300> all<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.450> movement<00:02:29.780> is<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.380> seems<00:02:30.740> to<00:02:30.830> be

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
other all the movement is it seems to be

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.890 
other all the movement is it seems to be
coming<00:02:31.010> from<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.310> rack<00:02:31.460> so<00:02:32.500> as<00:02:33.500> much<00:02:33.680> as<00:02:33.800> I

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
coming from the rack so as much as I

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.460 
coming from the rack so as much as I
really<00:02:35.900> would<00:02:36.380> rather<00:02:37.070> not<00:02:37.370> do<00:02:37.610> that<00:02:38.230> looks<00:02:39.230> at

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
really would rather not do that looks at

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.040 
really would rather not do that looks at
me<00:02:39.560> be<00:02:39.740> forced<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.460> replace<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:41.450> rack<00:02:41.630> itself

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
me be forced to replace the rack itself

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.640 
me be forced to replace the rack itself
I<00:02:44.020> think<00:02:45.020> I<00:02:45.170> may<00:02:45.320> actually<00:02:45.350> just<00:02:47.470> pull<00:02:48.470> off<00:02:48.620> the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
I think I may actually just pull off the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.160 
I think I may actually just pull off the
boot<00:02:49.450> at<00:02:50.450> least<00:02:50.720> on<00:02:50.870> one<00:02:50.900> side<00:02:52.870> see<00:02:53.870> maybe<00:02:54.110> I

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
boot at least on one side see maybe I

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.320 
boot at least on one side see maybe I
can<00:02:54.320> trace<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.710> slop<00:02:55.010> just<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.880> inner<00:02:56.060> tie

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
can trace the slop just to the inner tie

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.630 
can trace the slop just to the inner tie
rod<00:02:56.360> here<00:02:56.930> but<00:02:57.140> that's<00:02:57.620> what<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:57.950> is

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.590 

actually<00:03:01.640> I<00:03:01.670> decided<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:02.120> take<00:03:02.240> a<00:03:02.270> little<00:03:02.450> more

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
actually I decided to take a little more

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.640 
actually I decided to take a little more
video<00:03:02.900> here<00:03:02.960> I<00:03:03.230> just<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:05.120> be<00:03:05.210> sure<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:06.470> I<00:03:06.530> was

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
video here I just to be sure and I was

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.110 
video here I just to be sure and I was
able<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:06.890> surprise<00:03:07.130> myself<00:03:07.370> again<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:07.820> pulled

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
able to surprise myself again I pulled

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.800 
able to surprise myself again I pulled
back<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:09.520> steering<00:03:10.520> rack<00:03:10.640> boot<00:03:10.910> here<00:03:11.300> on<00:03:11.480> the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
back the steering rack boot here on the

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.250 
back the steering rack boot here on the
passenger<00:03:12.650> side<00:03:12.800> and<00:03:13.100> check<00:03:13.460> this<00:03:13.580> out<00:03:17.260> the

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
passenger side and check this out the

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.840 
passenger side and check this out the
play<00:03:18.470> isn't<00:03:18.920> in<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.130> rack<00:03:19.310> at<00:03:19.490> all<00:03:19.610> it's

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
play isn't in the rack at all it's

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.370 
play isn't in the rack at all it's
actually<00:03:20.030> just<00:03:20.450> in<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.930> inner<00:03:21.740> tie<00:03:22.070> rods<00:03:22.370> and

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
actually just in the inner tie rods and

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.290 
actually just in the inner tie rods and
you<00:03:24.380> have<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.560> be<00:03:24.680> sure<00:03:24.860> that's<00:03:25.130> a<00:03:25.490> lot<00:03:26.030> of<00:03:26.150> play

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
you have to be sure that's a lot of play

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.350 
you have to be sure that's a lot of play
there<00:03:26.510> but<00:03:27.020> I<00:03:27.490> may<00:03:28.490> be<00:03:28.550> able<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:28.910> get<00:03:29.060> away<00:03:29.210> with

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
there but I may be able to get away with

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.790 
there but I may be able to get away with
just<00:03:29.390> replacing<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.880> inner<00:03:31.880> tie<00:03:32.090> rods<00:03:32.360> I

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
just replacing the inner tie rods I

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.250 
just replacing the inner tie rods I
checked<00:03:33.800> my<00:03:34.090> repair<00:03:35.090> manual<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:35.780> it<00:03:35.990> doesn't

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
checked my repair manual and it doesn't

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.360 
checked my repair manual and it doesn't
actually<00:03:36.350> give<00:03:36.620> any<00:03:36.770> information<00:03:36.860> on<00:03:37.310> that

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
actually give any information on that

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.490 
actually give any information on that
but<00:03:37.790> that's<00:03:38.300> just<00:03:38.570> kind<00:03:38.900> of<00:03:38.990> the<00:03:39.080> manual<00:03:39.380> like

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
but that's just kind of the manual like

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.750 
but that's just kind of the manual like
keeping<00:03:39.740> the<00:03:39.830> car<00:03:39.980> it's<00:03:40.160> not<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.400> factory

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
keeping the car it's not the factory

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.930 
keeping the car it's not the factory
shop<00:03:40.970> manual<00:03:41.390> so<00:03:41.570> I'll<00:03:41.630> consult<00:03:42.080> that<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.940> see

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
shop manual so I'll consult that and see

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.800 
shop manual so I'll consult that and see
what<00:03:44.030> I<00:03:44.060> can<00:03:44.180> do<00:03:44.270> about<00:03:44.330> this<00:03:44.510> but<00:03:44.690> that's

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
what I can do about this but that's

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.090 
what I can do about this but that's
that's<00:03:45.500> 100%<00:03:45.890> where<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.280> play<00:03:46.430> is<00:03:48.100> definitely

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
that's 100% where the play is definitely

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.990 
that's 100% where the play is definitely
not<00:03:49.520> the<00:03:49.700> wheel<00:03:49.820> bearings<00:03:50.270> as<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:50.810> as<00:03:52.000> the

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
not the wheel bearings as the as the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.270 
not the wheel bearings as the as the
grease<00:03:53.630> monkey<00:03:54.080> said<00:03:54.320> so<00:03:54.860> I'm<00:03:54.920> happy<00:03:55.130> about

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
grease monkey said so I'm happy about

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.860 
grease monkey said so I'm happy about
that<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:55.580> already<00:03:55.910> checked<00:03:56.180> online<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.750> inner

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
that I already checked online the inner

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.140 
that I already checked online the inner
tie<00:03:57.080> rods<00:03:57.320> are<00:03:57.470> not<00:03:57.530> expensive<00:03:58.300> so<00:04:01.150> probably

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
tie rods are not expensive so probably

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.140 
tie rods are not expensive so probably
replace<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:02.750> outer<00:04:03.670> and<00:04:04.670> a<00:04:04.760> whole<00:04:04.910> bunch<00:04:05.060> of

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
replace the outer and a whole bunch of

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.370 
replace the outer and a whole bunch of
other<00:04:05.300> stuff<00:04:05.510> while<00:04:05.660> I'm<00:04:05.810> in<00:04:05.930> here<00:04:06.110> too<00:04:06.350> and

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
other stuff while I'm in here too and

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.080 
other stuff while I'm in here too and
looks<00:04:07.070> like<00:04:07.190> I'll<00:04:07.250> have<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.430> take<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:07.760> car<00:04:07.910> for

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
looks like I'll have to take the car for

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.770 
looks like I'll have to take the car for
an<00:04:08.180> alignment<00:04:08.420> after<00:04:08.990> that<00:04:09.490> but<00:04:10.600> you<00:04:11.600> know<00:04:11.690> it

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
an alignment after that but you know it

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.920 
an alignment after that but you know it
is<00:04:11.900> what<00:04:12.050> it<00:04:12.170> is<00:04:12.320> got<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.340> be<00:04:13.400> done<00:04:13.550> so<00:04:13.930> that's

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
is what it is got to be done so that's

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.680 
is what it is got to be done so that's
definitely<00:04:15.140> all<00:04:15.440> for<00:04:15.590> now
