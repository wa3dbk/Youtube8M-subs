00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
Jeffrey Campbell ones that are

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.749 
Jeffrey Campbell ones that are
incredibly<00:01:15.570> similar<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:17.009> these<00:01:17.250> are<00:01:17.430> 40

pounds whereas Jeffrey come ones are
much<00:01:19.619> more<00:01:19.830> expensive<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.850> good<00:01:21.420> investment

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
much more expensive so a good investment

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.740

I<00:01:22.290> think<00:01:22.369> so<00:01:23.369> they<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> strap<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
I think so they have the strap on the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.859 
I think so they have the strap on the
front<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:26.040> cutouts<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.330> heel<00:01:27.600> and
