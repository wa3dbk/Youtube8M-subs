built-in battery inside the camera grip
so<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.659> were<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.619> push<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:16.979> little<00:01:17.159> button

so you were to push this little button

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.550 
so you were to push this little button
right<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.540> see<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.990> we're<00:01:19.200> down<00:01:19.380> to

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
right here you see that we're down to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.109 
right here you see that we're down to
about<00:01:19.650> twenty-five<00:01:20.280> percent<00:01:20.430> battery<00:01:20.790> life

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
about twenty-five percent battery life

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.760 
about twenty-five percent battery life
you<00:01:21.750> know<00:01:21.840> each<00:01:22.049> one<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.320> those<00:01:22.470> dots

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
you know each one of those dots

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.219 
you know each one of those dots
represents<00:01:23.400> twenty-five<00:01:23.820> percent<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.689> you

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
represents twenty-five percent so you

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.050 
represents twenty-five percent so you
charge<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.710> all<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.100> way<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.549> you're

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
charge that all the way up and you're

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.850 
charge that all the way up and you're
going<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.210> get<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.570> know<00:01:27.860> approximately

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
going to get you know approximately

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.530 
going to get you know approximately
about<00:01:28.950> three<00:01:29.250> hours<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.579> extra<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.329> your

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
about three hours of extra on your

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.289 
about three hours of extra on your
performance<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.950> what's<00:01:32.700> going<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.880> happen<00:01:32.970> is

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
performance so what's going to happen is

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.510 
performance so what's going to happen is
you<00:01:33.420> charge<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.869> all<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.290> way<00:01:34.320> up<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:35.310> phone

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
you charge this all the way up the phone

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.850 
you charge this all the way up the phone
will<00:01:35.729> use<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.180> battery<00:01:36.630> first<00:01:36.930> when<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.770> gets

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
will use this battery first when it gets

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.980 
will use this battery first when it gets
down<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.159> zero<00:01:38.549> percent<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.180> depleted<00:01:39.450> it

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
down to zero percent it's depleted it

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.999 
down to zero percent it's depleted it
