00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.060
 life after receiving the attack of a 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.970
 inflamed swarm of bees a 'change 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.400

 where there were four people injured him 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.070
 reported that the information was that 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.240
 they were within a touch of a trunk 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.759
 deposited doing the works of 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.579
 green fallow when unfortunately 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.040
 the animals this one attacked people 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.570
 that they were in their place working other 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.970
 people including a minor 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.070
 they managed to escape from the swarm and called 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.840
 to the rescue bodies to see that the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.730
 old man was thrown away 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.780
 on the floor while the bees are 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.780
 They pounced on him 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:09.270
 if I use soap inside if it 's a mixture 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.920
 of ham in the tank of the unit and with 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.230
 that was working to be able to 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.580
 rescue the people who were already 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:20.850
 on the ground and they were still out there 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.100
 close the plus the swarm of bees 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.020
 finally the man was rescued and what 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.030
 they moved emergency when considering 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.450
 that the bites caused injuries 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.700
 serious that put your life at risk 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.420
 one of them was possibly more 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.460
 a little bit more serious in the aspect of 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.040
 for the reaction I might have with 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.500
 hard practices of animals but 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.300
 fortunately we thought that they could 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.580
 get out of the crisis you are in 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.100
 the family circulated on board a 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.509
 truck on a dirt road 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.990
