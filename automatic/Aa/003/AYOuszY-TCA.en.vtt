I'm<00:00:11.510> sure<00:00:11.780> those<00:00:11.959> are<00:00:12.139> all<00:00:12.260> very<00:00:12.410> interesting

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
I'm sure those are all very interesting

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.830 
I'm sure those are all very interesting
and<00:00:13.129> relevant<00:00:13.250> but<00:00:13.969> anyways<00:00:14.299> something<00:00:14.690> that

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
and relevant but anyways something that

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.260 
and relevant but anyways something that
people<00:00:15.170> aren't<00:00:15.469> talking<00:00:15.889> about<00:00:16.070> much<00:00:16.460> is<00:00:16.699> the

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
people aren't talking about much is the

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.109 
people aren't talking about much is the
new<00:00:17.480> architecture<00:00:18.519> 64-bit<00:00:19.519> I<00:00:19.640> think<00:00:19.880> part<00:00:20.089> of

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
new architecture 64-bit I think part of

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.880 
new architecture 64-bit I think part of
the<00:00:20.240> reason<00:00:20.269> is<00:00:20.750> is<00:00:20.960> because<00:00:21.019> it's<00:00:21.560> sort<00:00:21.740> of<00:00:21.800> an

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
the reason is is because it's sort of an

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.070 
the reason is is because it's sort of an
abstract<00:00:22.490> concept<00:00:22.669> I<00:00:23.179> mean<00:00:23.330> what<00:00:23.839> is<00:00:23.929> that

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
abstract concept I mean what is that

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.870 
abstract concept I mean what is that
number<00:00:24.320> one<00:00:24.830> solutely<00:00:25.249> going<00:00:25.369> to<00:00:25.429> do<00:00:25.519> for<00:00:25.789> you

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
number one solutely going to do for you

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.429 
number one solutely going to do for you
and<00:00:26.029> why<00:00:26.179> should<00:00:26.449> you<00:00:26.599> care<00:00:26.630> let<00:00:27.199> me<00:00:27.259> try<00:00:27.410> to

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
and why should you care let me try to

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.189 
and why should you care let me try to
break<00:00:27.679> it<00:00:27.830> down<00:00:27.859> for<00:00:28.220> you<00:00:28.310> in

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
break it down for you in

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.390 
break it down for you in
easy-to-understand<00:00:30.199> way<00:00:30.349> I<00:00:30.740> have<00:00:31.009> to<00:00:31.160> preface

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
easy-to-understand way I have to preface

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.920 
easy-to-understand way I have to preface
though<00:00:31.730> that<00:00:31.970> this<00:00:32.090> is<00:00:32.150> intended<00:00:32.570> for<00:00:32.810> people

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
though that this is intended for people

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.520 
though that this is intended for people
who<00:00:33.530> have<00:00:33.710> no<00:00:34.010> background<00:00:34.310> in<00:00:34.879> computers<00:00:35.480> or

who have no background in computers or

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.139 
who have no background in computers or
electronics<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:37.070> if<00:00:37.309> you<00:00:37.460> are<00:00:37.670> a<00:00:37.699> computer

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
electronics so if you are a computer

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.439 
electronics so if you are a computer
programmer<00:00:38.719> or<00:00:38.989> a<00:00:39.770> robot<00:00:40.699> you<00:00:41.059> will<00:00:41.090> be

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
programmer or a robot you will be

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.000 
programmer or a robot you will be
offended<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:41.989> you<00:00:42.050> should<00:00:42.320> probably<00:00:42.559> just

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
offended and you should probably just

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.950 
offended and you should probably just
turn<00:00:43.250> away<00:00:43.399> right<00:00:43.730> now<00:00:43.760> so<00:00:44.329> pretend<00:00:44.840> your

sixty four-bit to make your computing

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.230 
sixty four-bit to make your computing
much<00:02:43.620> more<00:02:43.950> efficient<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:44.730> depends<00:02:45.120> on<00:02:45.209> a

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
much more efficient and it depends on a

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.970 
much more efficient and it depends on a
lot<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.540> different<00:02:45.720> factors<00:02:46.080> -<00:02:46.560> like<00:02:46.800> your

lot of different factors - like your

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.040 
lot of different factors - like your
processor<00:02:47.520> your<00:02:47.700> memory<00:02:48.120> but<00:02:48.390> having<00:02:48.930> a

different architecture like that it will

different architecture like that it will
make<00:02:51.000> everything<00:02:51.420> run<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.410> much<00:02:52.709> smoother<00:02:53.400> so

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
make everything run so much smoother so

make everything run so much smoother so
that<00:02:53.880> was<00:02:54.060> as<00:02:54.270> simplified<00:02:54.870> an<00:02:55.080> analogy<00:02:55.590> of
