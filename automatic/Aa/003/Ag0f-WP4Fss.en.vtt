00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.130
 I feel that I am not a 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:30.450
 say that it has two floors or so that the 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.450
 spaces are integrated 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.570
 look at event in me I told you that space 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.020
 ideal for a single person is a 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.970
 loft and I came to teach some that had 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.190
 rent always if you realize the 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.400
 logs have something of the construction by 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.260
 example is this cement wall in the 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.090
 cement finish of a book the 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.710
 finished in this polished then always 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.720
 they have something that they keep inside the 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.800
 construction that makes it look a little more 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.110
 simple 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.930
 and here for example how many are the 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.900
 square meters 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.330
 does not recommend for a person to see 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.930
 example this is a duplex that has 80 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.420
 meters you can not have from 45 meters to 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.310
 more and according to what you're looking for 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.530
 this is a duplex of a part of a 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.110
 bedroom then is for a single 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.900
 decide alone not right now there are many people 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.760
 that because of the work that he wants 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.549
 be closer or the simple fact of the 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.880
 compensation as they decide to live 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.530
 alone but with one with a bedroom or 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.970
 be a bath and a half that is basic because 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.100
 you always have to have a bathroom visits 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.930
 it's more comfortable where you're invited seeing 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.759
 all your things not clear because there are days 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.619
 in case the department is small and 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.149
 that they go to your bathroom that is not 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.830
 always a bathroom visits is always good 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.710
 go and did not tell me that a blog and a 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.000
 study is practically the same can 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.280
 have in 45 square meters to 80 meters 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.920
 square or much more and it already depends on 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.619
 the needs of the person who 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.039
 wants to move I loved the first one 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:07.159
 I saw because it has two floors and so you can 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:10.009
 have a party in your house nobody has 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.739
 why see your room and have the business 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.019
 integral that suffers practical that has 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.730
 much the the integrated kitchen so 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.280
 same as I tell you, always the same 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.830
 environment does not take out we have the atmosphere of 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.600
 the dining room and the kitchen then 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.380
 you also feel integrated do not invite 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.820
 A couple of friends 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.440
 and it's not like you're locked in the kitchen 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.470
 but that like all the style of 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.660
 department is fun 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.760
 and has he told me that if 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.180
 there is definitely a fear for all 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.800
 this real estate bubble but not 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.320
 We need to worry because the 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.190
 city is growing to great power 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.950
 and that there is a lot of demand for 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.990
 buildings so if you're not single and 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.900
 you want to make an investment and it seems 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.360
 fun to buy a blog you're going to have the 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.010
 possibility of living there or of 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.380
 rent it or sell it at any 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.200
 moment without any problem good since 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.690
 this is another apartment this is a plan 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.300
 which is 75 meters 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.190
 this one is also super nice has the 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.350
 theme this closet I do not know for example 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.570
 achieve a walking closet this comes to 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.280
 be a closet that is the same and cook 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.130
 set but not 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.360
 that is how it looks and can not be seen 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.740
 when you're single you do not want to have 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.510
 a person that helps you every day 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.040
 with the cleaning you want a couple to come 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.140
 of times per week or suddenly doing it 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.940
 yourself and you do not want to complicate with 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.690
 lots of furniture the idea is that it be 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.090
 a space that is cozy that is 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.069
 easy to maintain and that is a place 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.709
 where it causes you to arrive every night 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.540
 from work look how interesting if 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.850
 the kitchen is just what it was 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.030
 commenting on the road or is it like 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.730
 that part of the decoration is not in 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.320
 true that this one does not see it as a 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.840
 kitchen itself but as part of the 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:01.680
 landscape 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:04.709
 rich yes sure if it causes you what 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.599
 clean seconds for three are you this is 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.220
 the theme the theme of simplicity the subject 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.440
 that a person who is just living alone 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.420
 he does not have time because being can not be 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.099
 with Duster where he is the other the 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.229
 illustrator we now for example this 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:19.620
 type of floors you really spend a this one 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.750
 this happens more like that and there is that 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.120
 you even need to wax anything and if you 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.070
 also caused to sweep what you already have 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.070
 with your four glasses 4 true
