00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.990
 animal that if it perceives our 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.159
 presence together with certainty it goes 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.210

 tune it decreases the bones from supporting 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.490
 for her to spend within their 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.579
 whole food then we bota have 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:45.390
