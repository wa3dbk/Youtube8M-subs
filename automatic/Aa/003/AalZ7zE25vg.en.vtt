the<00:02:23.670> embedded<00:02:24.360> object<00:02:25.170> installed<00:02:25.590> go<00:02:25.830> back<00:02:26.010> to

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
the embedded object installed go back to

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.620 
the embedded object installed go back to
your<00:02:26.370> game<00:02:26.840> just<00:02:27.840> try<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.650> load<00:02:29.390> kingdom<00:02:30.390> rush

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
your game just try to load kingdom rush

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.690 
your game just try to load kingdom rush
and<00:02:31.020> this<00:02:31.500> would<00:02:31.710> I<00:02:31.950> think<00:02:32.370> this<00:02:32.520> would

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
and this would I think this would

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.940 
and this would I think this would
possibly<00:02:33.330> work<00:02:33.600> for<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.960> hacked<00:02:34.410> came<00:02:34.830> from

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
possibly work for the hacked came from

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.820 
possibly work for the hacked came from
rush<00:02:35.190> like<00:02:36.060> if<00:02:36.240> you<00:02:36.420> go<00:02:36.990> onto<00:02:37.170> Google<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.680> you

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
rush like if you go onto Google and you

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.100

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
have the cooldowns hacked in it so you

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.350 
have the cooldowns hacked in it so you
you<00:02:43.680> might<00:02:43.860> be<00:02:44.010> able<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.280> download<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.090> too
