00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
deformity some general problem that

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.390 
deformity some general problem that
might<00:01:16.079> have

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
might have

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.150 
might have
unnoticed<00:01:16.940> to<00:01:17.270> put<00:01:17.480> this<00:01:17.660> present<00:01:18.050> time<00:01:18.160> so

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
unnoticed to put this present time so

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.150 
unnoticed to put this present time so
this<00:01:19.370> is<00:01:19.430> mostly<00:01:19.910> tibial<00:01:20.540> torsion<00:01:20.990> so<00:01:21.890> at<00:01:22.010> this

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
this is mostly tibial torsion so at this

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.230 
this is mostly tibial torsion so at this
point<00:01:22.430> I<00:01:22.520> think<00:01:22.730> we<00:01:22.820> don't<00:01:22.970> have<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.120> do

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
point I think we don't have to do

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.840 
point I think we don't have to do
anything<00:01:23.510> we'll<00:01:23.780> just<00:01:23.930> watch<00:01:24.140> her<00:01:24.730> some<00:01:25.730> of

anything we'll just watch her some of

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.030 
anything we'll just watch her some of
the<00:01:25.940> unique<00:01:26.540> features<00:01:26.570> of<00:01:27.050> the<00:01:27.500> program<00:01:27.890> are

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
the unique features of the program are

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.280 
the unique features of the program are
that<00:01:28.190> it's<00:01:28.370> a<00:01:28.460> mentorship<00:01:29.120> program<00:01:29.330> so<00:01:30.170> it

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
that it's a mentorship program so it

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.440 
that it's a mentorship program so it
allows<00:01:30.560> young<00:01:30.980> orthopedic<00:01:31.790> surgeons<00:01:32.270> in
