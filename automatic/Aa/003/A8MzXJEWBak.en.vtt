Technical College dental hygiene faculty
and<00:00:11.070> today<00:00:11.400> we're<00:00:11.610> going<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:12.000> have<00:00:12.300> video<00:00:12.690> on

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
and today we're going to have video on

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.099 
and today we're going to have video on
how<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.380> assemble<00:00:13.889> folders<00:00:17.869> all<00:00:18.869> right<00:00:18.990> when

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
how to assemble folders all right when

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.300 
how to assemble folders all right when
we're<00:00:19.230> doing<00:00:19.350> bite<00:00:19.680> wounds<00:00:19.920> there<00:00:20.100> are<00:00:20.160> many

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
we're doing bite wounds there are many

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.220 
we're doing bite wounds there are many
different<00:00:20.760> techniques<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.480> holders<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.050> one

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
different techniques and holders so one

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.380 
different techniques and holders so one
of<00:00:22.260> them<00:00:22.439> would<00:00:22.650> be<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.250> loop<00:00:23.490> which<00:00:24.210> is

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
of them would be just the loop which is

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.060 
of them would be just the loop which is
straight<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.019> then<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.320> just<00:00:25.470> push<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.710> make

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
straight and then you just push it make

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.370 
straight and then you just push it make
it<00:00:26.220> into<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> tea<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.240> then<00:00:27.810> place<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:28.349> your

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
it into a tea and then place it on your

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.290 
it into a tea and then place it on your
film<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.980> most<00:00:29.130> important<00:00:29.699> thing<00:00:29.880> here<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.179> to

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
film the most important thing here is to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.359 
film the most important thing here is to
remember<00:00:30.900> we're<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.590> take<00:00:31.800> maxillary

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
remember we're going to take maxillary

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.490 
remember we're going to take maxillary
and<00:00:32.430> mandibular<00:00:32.910> arch<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.510> your<00:00:33.719> tab<00:00:34.020> whatever

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
and mandibular arch so your tab whatever

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.350 
and mandibular arch so your tab whatever
you're<00:00:34.710> using<00:00:34.739> has<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.520> be<00:00:35.640> centered<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.300> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
you're using has to be centered in the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.380 
you're using has to be centered in the
middle<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.200> your<00:00:37.469> film<00:00:37.739> where<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.760> front<00:00:39.210> to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
middle of your film where it is front to

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.910 
middle of your film where it is front to
back<00:00:39.420> doesn't<00:00:40.079> make<00:00:40.200> any<00:00:40.260> difference<00:00:40.649> because

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
back doesn't make any difference because

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.889 
back doesn't make any difference because
you're<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.280> using<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.969> hold<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
you're just using it to hold but the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.690 
you're just using it to hold but the
important<00:00:43.350> part<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.010> half<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
important part is is that half of the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.940 
important part is is that half of the
film<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.360> top<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.840> half<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> film

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
film is on the top and half of the film

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.850 
film is on the top and half of the film
is<00:00:47.100> underneath<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.879> tab<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:49.140> could<00:00:49.320> use<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.469> tab

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
is underneath the tab we could use a tab

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.240 
is underneath the tab we could use a tab
we<00:00:50.370> could<00:00:50.579> use<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.059> sticky<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:52.829> sticky

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
we could use the sticky the sticky

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.580 
we could use the sticky the sticky
sponge<00:00:53.579> as<00:00:53.910> long<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.899> when<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.170> place<00:00:55.410> it

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
sponge as long as that when you place it

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.700 
sponge as long as that when you place it
on<00:00:55.680> there<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.610> centered<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> film<00:00:57.710> then

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
on there it is centered on the film then

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.010 
on there it is centered on the film then
we<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:59.010> go<00:00:59.190> into<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.300> different<00:01:00.660> holders

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
we can go into the the different holders

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.369 
we can go into the the different holders
for<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.260> for<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:01.980> Ryn<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.870> ring

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
for the for the Ryn so we have a a ring

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.050 
for the for the Ryn so we have a a ring
holder<00:01:04.799> which<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:04.979> used<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.580> anterior

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
holder which is used for the anterior

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.359 
holder which is used for the anterior
it's<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.390> straight<00:01:06.689> holder<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.290> aperture<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
it's a straight holder and aperture and

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.469 
it's a straight holder and aperture and
a<00:01:08.490> straight<00:01:08.850> stem<00:01:09.979> we<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.580> horizontal

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
a straight stem we have the horizontal

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.380 
a straight stem we have the horizontal
bite<00:01:12.659> block<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:14.610> put<00:01:14.820> our<00:01:14.880> film<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
bite block and we put our film in the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.700 
bite block and we put our film in the
same<00:01:15.659> way<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:17.869> then<00:01:18.869> where<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.200> Center<00:01:19.590> it

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
same way and then where we Center it

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.020 
same way and then where we Center it
left<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.040> right<00:01:20.159> doesn't<00:01:20.729> make<00:01:20.880> any

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
left to right doesn't make any

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.820 
left to right doesn't make any
difference<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.600> long<00:01:22.140> as<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> film<00:01:22.710> is

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
difference as long as the film is

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.440 
difference as long as the film is
centered<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.340> folder<00:01:23.759> which<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.119> would<00:01:24.270> be

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
centered in the folder which it would be

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.600 
centered in the folder which it would be
if<00:01:25.140> we're<00:01:25.350> using<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.710> vertical<00:01:26.009> holder

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
if we're using the vertical holder

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.010 
if we're using the vertical holder
obviously<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.240> film<00:01:27.509> would<00:01:27.659> be<00:01:27.720> in

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
obviously the film would be in

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.520 
obviously the film would be in
vertically<00:01:28.759> for<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> mat<00:01:30.329> posterior<00:01:31.290> and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
vertically for the mat posterior and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.630 
vertically for the mat posterior and
then<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.460> would<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.090> number<00:01:33.270> one<00:01:33.630> film<00:01:34.640> for

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
then we would have a number one film for

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.969 
then we would have a number one film for
the<00:01:35.670> anterior<00:01:36.540> view<00:01:36.600> again<00:01:37.140> depending<00:01:37.860> on

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
the anterior view again depending on

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.679 
the anterior view again depending on
where<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.369> are<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.909> how<00:01:39.240> you're<00:01:39.479> going<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
where you are and how you're going to

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.810 
where you are and how you're going to
place<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.200> mouth<00:01:40.439> your<00:01:41.070> film<00:01:41.369> has<00:01:41.640> to

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
place it in the mouth your film has to

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.330 
place it in the mouth your film has to
still<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.240> centered<00:01:42.689> within<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.140> holder<00:01:43.500> so

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
still be centered within the holder so

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.770 
still be centered within the holder so
just<00:01:44.549> for<00:01:44.670> an<00:01:44.790> example<00:01:44.850> we'll<00:01:45.450> put<00:01:45.630> this

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
just for an example we'll put this

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.410 
just for an example we'll put this
together<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> posterior<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:48.119> use<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
together for the posterior we use the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.840 
together for the posterior we use the
state<00:01:48.689> straight<00:01:49.170> stem<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:50.040> take<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.430> ring<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
state straight stem we take the ring and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.600 
state straight stem we take the ring and
slide<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.540> there<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.619> flat<00:01:53.340> part

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
slide it on there so that the flat part

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.300 
slide it on there so that the flat part
is<00:01:53.850> towards<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.299> face<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.990> then<00:01:55.829> use<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
is towards the face and then use the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.360 
is towards the face and then use the
holder<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.880> we<00:01:57.030> want

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
holder that we want

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.270 
holder that we want
use<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:59.170> this<00:01:59.350> is<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.680> way<00:01:59.830> it<00:01:59.980> would<00:02:00.130> look

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
use so this is the way it would look

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.250 
use so this is the way it would look
when<00:02:00.520> we're<00:02:00.670> setting<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:01.060> up

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.020 

okay<00:02:07.860> now<00:02:07.980> the<00:02:08.070> next<00:02:08.250> technique<00:02:08.550> we're<00:02:08.880> going

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
okay now the next technique we're going

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.850 
okay now the next technique we're going
to<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.180> doing<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.540> paralleling<00:02:10.080> technique<00:02:10.619> and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
to be doing is paralleling technique and

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.280 
to be doing is paralleling technique and
we're<00:02:10.979> using<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.340> rim<00:02:11.640> system<00:02:12.150> again<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:13.170> we

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
we're using the rim system again so we

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.170 
we're using the rim system again so we
have<00:02:13.410> two<00:02:13.680> different<00:02:13.830> holders<00:02:14.490> one<00:02:14.820> is<00:02:14.970> very

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
have two different holders one is very

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.870 
have two different holders one is very
flat<00:02:15.570> one<00:02:16.050> has<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.260> couple<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.770> bends<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
flat one has a couple of bends to it the

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.730 
flat one has a couple of bends to it the
one<00:02:18.030> with<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.240> Benz<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> anterior<00:02:19.410> the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
one with the Benz is the anterior the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.280 
one with the Benz is the anterior the
one<00:02:19.920> that's<00:02:20.130> flat<00:02:20.460> is<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.880> posterior<00:02:21.390> then

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
one that's flat is the posterior then

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.970 
one that's flat is the posterior then
you<00:02:22.470> have<00:02:22.710> an<00:02:22.860> offset<00:02:23.400> ring<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:25.500> ring<00:02:25.710> that

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
you have an offset ring and a ring that

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.220 
you have an offset ring and a ring that
is<00:02:26.130> centered<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.420> one<00:02:27.570> that<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.840> centered

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
is centered so the one that is centered

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.380 
is centered so the one that is centered
goes<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.220> anterior<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.910> one<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.270> is

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
goes to the anterior the one that is

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.310 
goes to the anterior the one that is
offset<00:02:31.310> goes<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.610> posterior<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.540> then

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
offset goes to the posterior and then

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.260 
offset goes to the posterior and then
our<00:02:34.470> holders<00:02:34.980> are<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.370> same<00:02:35.640> we're<00:02:36.030> going<00:02:36.210> to

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
our holders are the same we're going to

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.510 
our holders are the same we're going to
be<00:02:36.390> placing<00:02:36.810> our<00:02:36.930> films<00:02:37.350> in<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.860> posterior<00:02:38.310> of

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
be placing our films in the posterior of

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.000 
be placing our films in the posterior of
the<00:02:38.640> mouth<00:02:38.820> horizontally<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.920> the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
the mouth horizontally and in the

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.580 
the mouth horizontally and in the
anterior<00:02:41.460> of<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.670> mouth<00:02:41.880> vertically<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.470> when

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
anterior of the mouth vertically so when

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.590 
anterior of the mouth vertically so when
we<00:02:43.710> take<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.160> posterior<00:02:44.700> one<00:02:45.090> if<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.390> always

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
we take the posterior one if you always

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.530 
we take the posterior one if you always
remember<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.710> elbow<00:02:47.280> or<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.820> Ben<00:02:48.030> has

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
remember that the elbow or the Ben has

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.240 
remember that the elbow or the Ben has
to<00:02:48.810> come<00:02:48.960> out<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.320> mouth<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:49.800> we're<00:02:50.130> going

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
to come out of the mouth so we're going

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.010 
to come out of the mouth so we're going
to<00:02:50.310> do<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.520> for<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.730> upper<00:02:51.000> right<00:02:51.210> we're<00:02:51.930> going

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
to do it for the upper right we're going

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.780 
to do it for the upper right we're going
to<00:02:52.080> place<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.320> in<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.650> two<00:02:52.950> holes<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.580> are

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
to place it in the two holes that are

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.610 
to place it in the two holes that are
closest<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.630> end<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:54.990> holder<00:02:55.380> and

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
closest to the end of the holder and

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.010 
closest to the end of the holder and
then<00:02:56.520> our<00:02:56.640> ring<00:02:56.940> has<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.510> be<00:02:57.630> centered<00:02:58.110> over

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
then our ring has to be centered over

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.310 
then our ring has to be centered over
over<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.140> film<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:01.740> it<00:03:01.770> would<00:03:02.010> look<00:03:02.040> like<00:03:02.220> this

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
over the film so it would look like this

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.800 
over the film so it would look like this
if<00:03:04.320> I<00:03:04.500> wanted<00:03:04.800> to<00:03:04.860> change<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.430> for<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.420> upper

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
if I wanted to change it for the upper

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.620 
if I wanted to change it for the upper
right<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.410> can<00:03:07.860> then<00:03:08.040> also<00:03:08.220> do<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:09.120> lower<00:03:09.330> left

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
right I can then also do the lower left

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.170 
right I can then also do the lower left
of<00:03:09.810> my<00:03:09.990> patient<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:11.250> say<00:03:11.459> we're<00:03:11.670> finished<00:03:11.970> with

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
of my patient so say we're finished with

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.729 
of my patient so say we're finished with
that<00:03:12.330> now<00:03:12.600> I'm<00:03:12.750> going<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.959> do<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.200> upper<00:03:13.500> left

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
that now I'm going to do the upper left

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.979 
that now I'm going to do the upper left
so<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:13.980> take<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.820> elbows<00:03:15.209> still<00:03:15.480> coming<00:03:15.810> out<00:03:15.959> of

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
so I take the elbows still coming out of

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.340 
so I take the elbows still coming out of
the<00:03:16.170> mouth<00:03:16.790> take<00:03:17.790> off<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.180> bite<00:03:18.360> block<00:03:18.630> turn

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
the mouth take off the bite block turn

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.520 
the mouth take off the bite block turn
it<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.590> half<00:03:19.770> a<00:03:19.950> turn<00:03:20.160> towards<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.790> ceiling<00:03:21.030> now

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
it a half a turn towards the ceiling now

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.600 
it a half a turn towards the ceiling now
take<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.680> ring<00:03:22.860> off<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:25.130> turn<00:03:26.130> it<00:03:26.160> up<00:03:26.400> towards

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
take the ring off and turn it up towards

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.400 
take the ring off and turn it up towards
the<00:03:26.820> ceiling<00:03:27.150> so<00:03:27.540> it's<00:03:27.720> pointed<00:03:28.140> toward<00:03:28.320> the

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
the ceiling so it's pointed toward the

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.680 
the ceiling so it's pointed toward the
ceiling<00:03:28.620> also<00:03:29.130> now<00:03:29.700> you're<00:03:29.940> all<00:03:30.090> set<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.570> do

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
ceiling also now you're all set to do

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:39.670 
ceiling also now you're all set to do
the<00:03:30.840> upper<00:03:31.230> left<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.940> lower<00:03:33.150> right

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.170 

for<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.770> anterior<00:03:41.430> view<00:03:41.490> then<00:03:41.850> what<00:03:42.030> we're

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
for the anterior view then what we're

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.580 
for the anterior view then what we're
going<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.450> do<00:03:42.600> is<00:03:42.780> we're<00:03:42.930> going<00:03:43.020> to<00:03:43.080> hold<00:03:43.380> the

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
going to do is we're going to hold the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.250 
going to do is we're going to hold the
stem<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.510> elbow<00:03:45.510> with<00:03:45.720> our<00:03:45.930> with<00:03:46.230> our

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.990 
place our white block on and the last
two<00:03:53.640> holes<00:03:54.380> take<00:03:55.380> our<00:03:55.590> centered<00:03:56.490> ring<00:03:56.760> and

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
two holes take our centered ring and

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.870 
two holes take our centered ring and
place<00:03:57.450> it<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:58.110> it's<00:03:58.380> in<00:03:58.620> circles<00:03:59.160> the

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
place it so that it's in circles the

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.060 
place it so that it's in circles the
holder<00:04:00.330> and<00:04:00.540> now<00:04:00.810> we<00:04:00.870> have<00:04:01.050> it<00:04:01.440> set<00:04:01.650> up<00:04:01.680> for<00:04:01.800> the

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
holder and now we have it set up for the

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.060 
holder and now we have it set up for the
maxillary<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.840> mandibular<00:04:04.320> so<00:04:04.680> this<00:04:04.890> one

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
maxillary and the mandibular so this one

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.320 
maxillary and the mandibular so this one
you<00:04:05.160> only<00:04:05.310> have<00:04:05.610> to<00:04:05.760> know<00:04:05.910> how<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.060> put<00:04:06.300> it

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
you only have to know how to put it

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.440 
you only have to know how to put it
together<00:04:06.510> one<00:04:06.870> time<00:04:09.740> on<00:04:10.820> the<00:04:11.820> snap<00:04:12.120> array

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
together one time on the snap array

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.550 
together one time on the snap array
which<00:04:12.660> we're<00:04:12.840> going<00:04:12.960> to<00:04:13.020> use<00:04:13.140> for<00:04:13.440> the

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
which we're going to use for the

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.590 
which we're going to use for the
bisecting<00:04:14.190> angle<00:04:14.550> technique<00:04:15.000> it<00:04:15.180> works<00:04:15.390> like

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
bisecting angle technique it works like

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.050 
bisecting angle technique it works like
the<00:04:15.750> scissors<00:04:16.109> and<00:04:16.380> again<00:04:17.040> you<00:04:17.580> can<00:04:17.609> have

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
the scissors and again you can have

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.880 
the scissors and again you can have
invite<00:04:18.420> on<00:04:18.570> either<00:04:18.750> side<00:04:19.080> of<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.320> holder<00:04:19.709> but

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
invite on either side of the holder but

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.070 
invite on either side of the holder but
for<00:04:20.220> stability<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:21.000> wider<00:04:21.239> side<00:04:21.600> is<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.840> good

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
for stability the wider side is a good

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.110 
for stability the wider side is a good
place<00:04:22.320> for<00:04:22.350> them<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.710> bite<00:04:23.040> if<00:04:23.610> I'm<00:04:23.730> doing<00:04:23.910> the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
place for them to bite if I'm doing the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.710 
place for them to bite if I'm doing the
upper<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.720> place<00:04:25.140> the<00:04:25.470> dot<00:04:25.710> in<00:04:25.980> the<00:04:26.160> holder<00:04:26.720> make

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
upper I place the dot in the holder make

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.360 
upper I place the dot in the holder make
sure<00:04:27.900> that<00:04:28.140> it's<00:04:28.290> even<00:04:28.680> here<00:04:28.950> and<00:04:29.130> flushed

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
sure that it's even here and flushed

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.100 
sure that it's even here and flushed
because<00:04:29.580> whatever<00:04:29.940> sticks<00:04:30.360> out<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:30.750> bottom

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
because whatever sticks out the bottom

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.840 
because whatever sticks out the bottom
is<00:04:31.260> taken<00:04:31.620> away<00:04:31.740> from<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.190> apex<00:04:32.610> see<00:04:32.790> the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
is taken away from the apex see the

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.540 
is taken away from the apex see the
apices<00:04:33.450> of<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.750> teeth<00:04:33.960> lock<00:04:34.800> it<00:04:34.980> in<00:04:35.100> there<00:04:35.340> and

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
apices of the teeth lock it in there and

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.600 
apices of the teeth lock it in there and
then<00:04:35.820> I'm<00:04:35.970> all<00:04:36.150> set<00:04:36.420> to<00:04:36.600> do<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:36.900> posterior

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
then I'm all set to do the posterior

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.190 
then I'm all set to do the posterior
when<00:04:38.610> i<00:04:38.640> get<00:04:38.820> to<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:38.970> anterior<00:04:39.480> then<00:04:39.870> i<00:04:39.900> can

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
when i get to the anterior then i can

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.320 
when i get to the anterior then i can
just<00:04:40.230> lock<00:04:40.560> this<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:41.400> scissors<00:04:41.760> part<00:04:42.030> of<00:04:42.180> it

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
just lock this the scissors part of it

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.230 
just lock this the scissors part of it
this<00:04:43.050> is<00:04:43.260> going<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:43.830> be<00:04:43.980> my<00:04:44.160> anterior<00:04:44.640> holder

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
this is going to be my anterior holder

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.960 
this is going to be my anterior holder
the<00:04:45.810> dot<00:04:46.020> goes<00:04:46.260> in<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.560> slot<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:47.100> that's<00:04:47.760> the

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
the dot goes in the slot and that's the

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.700 
the dot goes in the slot and that's the
way<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.240> holders<00:04:48.630> for<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:48.930> anterior<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:49.620> you

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
way the holders for the anterior so you

00:04:49.710 --> 00:05:08.330 
way the holders for the anterior so you
only<00:04:49.860> have<00:04:50.100> one<00:04:50.400> item<00:04:51.210> to<00:04:51.630> use

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.400
