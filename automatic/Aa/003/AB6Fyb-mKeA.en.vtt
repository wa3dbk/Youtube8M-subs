way<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:18.229> this<00:01:19.229> working<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:19.830> correctly<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:21.060> said

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
way of this working out correctly I said

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.740 
way of this working out correctly I said
this<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.290> still<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.130> think<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.729> easiest<00:01:24.270> method

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
this is still I think the easiest method

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.370 
this is still I think the easiest method
to<00:01:24.840> get<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:26.330> obviously<00:01:27.330> aside<00:01:27.750> from<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.259> you

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
to get this obviously aside from if you

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.539 
to get this obviously aside from if you
can<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:28.680> find<00:01:28.799> someone<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.340> line<00:01:29.490> who

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
can just find someone on the line who

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.289 
can just find someone on the line who
will<00:01:29.759> let<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.270> use<00:01:30.509> their<00:01:30.780> sword<00:01:31.939> to<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.150> this

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
will let you use their sword to get this

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.380 
will let you use their sword to get this
