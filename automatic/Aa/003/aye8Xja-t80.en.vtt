00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.750
 today we are in another network of other 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.189
 seeds that these seeds and I the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.750
 They sent me to send our test 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.300
 They said not to publish a channel or 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.340
 nothing simply to prove it and that 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.130
 It's pretty pretty, they sent me 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.750
 this seed that is pretty but not 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.270
 I know how where they have achieved as 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.010
 but they sent me out there like that 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.099
 these seeds have villas have 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.439
 villas has a temple has jungles 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.029
 you know that now in version 172 in 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.439
 which we are now in extraction 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.230
 is generating that's why you're seeing 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.070
 everything in this version that the a 172 now 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.930
 to the generation of the jungle is a bit 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.489
 more complicated than you did before 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.710
 they found that she was a facilitator in 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.480
 against jungle is quite complicated 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.629
 trained as before so let's see 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.270
 here to see and be put on 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.110
 was where the spot appeared and here 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.199
 we have 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.320
 the guide our thing we have here as 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.180
 can see in the blacksmith's house 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.290
 we have some little things 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.430
 here are we get everything 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.380
 up to a peak of airÃ³n 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.380
 the armor and all ok 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.390
 as you can see here we have 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.350
 also a temple wisting people but a 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.220
 temple that has impressed me so much 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.220
 here we have a temple 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.740
 let's see I do not know why it's leaving me 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:34.450
 so much that we're going to go down 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.450
 I'm going to put on a good torch 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:45.289
 this is not the wise one and in this already because 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.770
 we have all this iron massage what 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.770
 important 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.220
 so we break this so that we do not 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.620
 shoot 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.690
 and we break the other one that is around here 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.270
 is and we have the other chef that we have 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.390
 more iron gold and all that now I'm going to 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.670
 leave to see other things also 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.250
 these seeds and I liked it very much 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.080
 very much is being the not the best 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.240
 friend the sardine to see but that I 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.910
 they sent her or they sent her and she said 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.010
 I think to try it and there it is ok so 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.380
 that we are testing it to see one of 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.820

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.010

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.980
 coordinates for you to see the 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.150
