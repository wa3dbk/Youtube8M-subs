it<00:01:25.140> which<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.500> took<00:01:25.560> off<00:01:25.950> because<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.520> really

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
it which I took off because I really

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.700 
it which I took off because I really
felt<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.360> didn't<00:01:27.840> fit<00:01:27.990> here<00:01:28.200> anymore<00:01:28.380> it

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
felt like it didn't fit here anymore it

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.830 
felt like it didn't fit here anymore it
would<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.130> go<00:01:29.280> up<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.119> over<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.450> shelf

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
would have to go up and over that shelf

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.300 
would have to go up and over that shelf
that<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.020> see<00:01:31.140> at<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.259> top<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.619> cover<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.250> up

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
that you see at the top and cover it up

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.429 
that you see at the top and cover it up
so<00:01:32.790> for<00:01:33.060> now<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.990> might<00:01:34.200> find<00:01:34.380> a

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
so for now it's like this I might find a

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.230 
so for now it's like this I might find a
different<00:01:34.470> frame<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.610> do<00:01:35.759> still

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
different frame for it but I do still

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.490 
different frame for it but I do still
think<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.540> looks<00:01:36.689> good<00:01:36.869> because<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
think it looks good because the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.319 
think it looks good because the
substance<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.280> still<00:01:38.549> there<00:01:38.759> all<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
substance that is still there all the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.880 
substance that is still there all the
figures<00:01:39.600> are<00:01:39.750> still<00:01:39.930> there<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.290> ash<00:01:40.650> looks

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
figures are still there and ash looks

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.200 
figures are still there and ash looks
pretty<00:01:41.100> cool<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.460> his<00:01:41.610> friends<00:01:41.909> there<00:01:42.060> and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
pretty cool with his friends there and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.330 
pretty cool with his friends there and
Team<00:01:42.390> Rocket<00:01:42.780> as<00:01:43.170> well<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.979> that's<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> first

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
Team Rocket as well so that's the first

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.910

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
looking at this Zelda wall which is

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.090 
looking at this Zelda wall which is
really<00:01:48.960> started<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.409> come<00:01:49.530> together<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.979> this

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
really started to come together and this

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.679 
really started to come together and this
thing<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.399> really<00:01:51.030> close<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.360> completion

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
thing is really close to completion

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.990 
thing is really close to completion
actually<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.740> one<00:01:52.950> main<00:01:53.250> thing<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.820> new

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
actually the one main thing that is new

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.639 
actually the one main thing that is new
is<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.360> two<00:01:54.540> new<00:01:54.659> shelves<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.200> are<00:01:55.259> holding

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649

all<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.950> games<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.640> really<00:01:56.909> thought

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
all of the games so I really thought

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.819 
all of the games so I really thought
when<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.360> put<00:01:57.479> up<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.630> posters<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.619> guides

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
when I put up the posters and the guides

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.310 
when I put up the posters and the guides
that<00:01:59.100> there<00:01:59.280> was<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> lot<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.850> empty<00:02:00.090> space<00:02:00.320> you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
that there was a lot of empty space you

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.450 
that there was a lot of empty space you
don't<00:02:01.439> want<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> feel<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:01.920> your<00:02:02.130> entire

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
don't want to feel like your entire

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.940 
don't want to feel like your entire
collection<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.939> way<00:02:03.240> too<00:02:03.299> cramped<00:02:03.780> but<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.680> did

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
collection is way too cramped but I did

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.499 
collection is way too cramped but I did
really<00:02:05.159> want<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.579> display<00:02:05.969> all<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.299> games

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
as a few of the remakes that are more

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.760 
as a few of the remakes that are more
recent<00:02:12.330> on<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.660> side<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.440> idea

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
recent on the side the idea

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.080 
recent on the side the idea
is<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.950> kind<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.190> leave<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.370> little<00:02:14.580> bit<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.880> room

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
is to kind of leave a little bit of room

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.060 
is to kind of leave a little bit of room
but<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.570> can<00:02:15.780> grow<00:02:15.960> into<00:02:16.170> with<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.650> new<00:02:16.800> games

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
but I can grow into with the new games

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.530 
but I can grow into with the new games
that<00:02:17.160> are<00:02:17.340> coming<00:02:17.370> out<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.270> Legend<00:02:18.480> of

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
now covered up I did install the bars I

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.900 
now covered up I did install the bars I
cut<00:02:53.820> out<00:02:53.940> this<00:02:54.120> black<00:02:55.520> protective<00:02:56.520> or

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
cut out this black protective or

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.070 
cut out this black protective or
whatever<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.240> want<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.420> call<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:57.900> it

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
whatever you want to call it so that it

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.870 
whatever you want to call it so that it
doesn't<00:02:58.410> get<00:02:58.500> Sun<00:02:58.830> faded<00:02:59.220> any<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.520> my<00:02:59.610> items

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
doesn't get Sun faded any of my items

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.250 
doesn't get Sun faded any of my items
don't<00:03:00.090> get<00:03:00.180> Sun<00:03:00.360> faded<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:00.900> it's<00:03:01.020> kind<00:03:01.230> of

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
don't get Sun faded and it's kind of

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.660 
don't get Sun faded and it's kind of
just<00:03:01.410> blocking<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.890> light<00:03:02.040> out<00:03:02.220> but<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.460> feel

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
just blocking the light out but I feel

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.310 
just blocking the light out but I feel
like<00:03:02.760> black<00:03:03.060> looks<00:03:03.300> really<00:03:03.630> bad<00:03:03.780> on<00:03:03.900> this<00:03:04.080> side

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
like black looks really bad on this side

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.200 
like black looks really bad on this side
so<00:03:04.770> I'm<00:03:04.860> probably<00:03:04.980> gonna<00:03:05.220> paint<00:03:05.520> that<00:03:05.610> piece

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
so I'm probably gonna paint that piece

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.180 
so I'm probably gonna paint that piece
the<00:03:06.630> same<00:03:06.840> color<00:03:07.050> as<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.380> walls<00:03:07.620> so<00:03:07.920> hopefully

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
the same color as the walls so hopefully

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.100 
the same color as the walls so hopefully
it's<00:03:08.310> not<00:03:08.460> as<00:03:08.700> noticeable<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.480> is<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> bit

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
it's not as noticeable and is a bit

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.960 
it's not as noticeable and is a bit
darker<00:03:10.500> down<00:03:10.650> here<00:03:10.860> because<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.490> but

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
darker down here because of that but

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.280 
darker down here because of that but
really<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.240> think<00:03:12.420> Sun<00:03:12.720> fading<00:03:13.020> could<00:03:13.170> be<00:03:13.260> a

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
really I think Sun fading could be a

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.110 
really I think Sun fading could be a
huge<00:03:13.530> issue<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.830> think<00:03:13.920> people<00:03:14.250> are<00:03:14.340> right<00:03:14.640> so

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
huge issue I think people are right so

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.240 
huge issue I think people are right so
either<00:03:15.270> I<00:03:15.390> don't<00:03:15.540> have<00:03:15.840> items<00:03:16.110> here<00:03:16.350> or<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.590> have

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
either I don't have items here or I have

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.699 
either I don't have items here or I have

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
the Sun in the space we'll see covered

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:20.960 
the Sun in the space we'll see covered
up<00:03:19.950> or<00:03:20.100> don't<00:03:20.160> cover<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.490> up<00:03:20.550> we'll<00:03:20.700> see<00:03:20.820> what<00:03:20.910> I

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.520 
up or don't cover it up we'll see what I

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
chair over here but I also kind of

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.030 
chair over here but I also kind of
changed<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.240> display<00:03:27.570> of<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:27.780> slightly<00:03:28.260> so

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
changed the display of this slightly so

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.710 
changed the display of this slightly so
right<00:03:29.220> now<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.490> way<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.670> TV's<00:03:30.090> are<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.600> can

right now the way the TV's are you can

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.900 
right now the way the TV's are you can
play<00:03:30.930> four<00:03:31.560> players<00:03:31.920> could<00:03:32.250> actually<00:03:32.370> play<00:03:32.730> on

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
play four players could actually play on

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.180 
play four players could actually play on
four<00:03:33.270> different<00:03:33.420> TVs<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.709> chair<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.160> I

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
four different TVs and the chair that I

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.400 
four different TVs and the chair that I
bought<00:03:35.610> I<00:03:35.880> put<00:03:36.120> on<00:03:36.270> this<00:03:36.540> side<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.870> lot<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.290> you

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
bought I put on this side a lot of you

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.080 
bought I put on this side a lot of you
were<00:03:37.530> really<00:03:37.709> concerned<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.790> chair

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
were really concerned that the chair

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.760 
were really concerned that the chair
placement<00:03:39.780> would<00:03:40.140> have<00:03:40.260> been<00:03:40.380> in<00:03:40.500> front<00:03:40.680> of

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
placement would have been in front of

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.250 
placement would have been in front of
the<00:03:40.830> TV<00:03:41.040> blocking<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:41.850> lot<00:03:42.570> of<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.780> times<00:03:43.020> I'm

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
the TV blocking a lot of the times I'm

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.510 
the TV blocking a lot of the times I'm
the<00:03:43.290> only<00:03:43.530> one<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:43.800> this<00:03:43.890> space<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.340> if<00:03:44.400> I'm

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
the only one in this space and if I'm

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.640 
the only one in this space and if I'm
streaming<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.120> will<00:03:45.330> sit<00:03:45.600> over<00:03:45.840> here<00:03:45.870> on<00:03:46.290> this

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
streaming I will sit over here on this

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.190 
streaming I will sit over here on this
side<00:03:46.760> but<00:03:47.760> otherwise<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.660> chair<00:03:48.870> should<00:03:49.050> be

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
side but otherwise the chair should be

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.690 
side but otherwise the chair should be
over<00:03:49.350> here<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:49.560> think<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.160> agree<00:03:50.520> because

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
over here I think and I agree because

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.250 
over here I think and I agree because
then<00:03:50.940> it's<00:03:51.060> not<00:03:51.209> in<00:03:51.300> the<00:03:51.360> way<00:03:51.480> all<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:51.990> would

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
then it's not in the way all I would

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.900 
then it's not in the way all I would
have<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.500> do<00:03:52.620> is<00:03:52.740> then<00:03:52.890> swivel<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.400> monitor<00:03:53.760> to

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
of changed positions because it was

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.490 
of changed positions because it was
taking<00:04:11.400> away<00:04:11.550> from<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:11.850> nes<00:04:12.209> table<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:12.840> kind<00:04:13.440> of

agree with you so it's here for now but

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.880 
agree with you so it's here for now but
it's<00:04:15.030> probably<00:04:15.270> gonna<00:04:15.360> move<00:04:15.540> around<00:04:15.660> again<00:04:16.049> so

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
because I damaged it a little bit but I

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.060 
because I damaged it a little bit but I
think<00:05:15.690> my<00:05:15.810> entire<00:05:16.200> and<00:05:16.590> intended<00:05:16.920> power

bend<00:05:39.960> the<00:05:40.110> belt<00:05:40.290> on<00:05:40.470> this<00:05:40.710> side<00:05:40.980> because<00:05:41.250> it

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
bend the belt on this side because it

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.650 
bend the belt on this side because it
was<00:05:41.670> way<00:05:41.880> too<00:05:41.910> long<00:05:42.270> and<00:05:42.330> it<00:05:42.540> looked

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
was way too long and it looked

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.030 
was way too long and it looked
asymmetrical<00:05:43.350> and<00:05:43.470> it<00:05:43.530> was<00:05:43.620> bothering<00:05:43.890> my

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
asymmetrical and it was bothering my

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.310 
asymmetrical and it was bothering my
wife<00:05:44.280> as<00:05:44.460> well<00:05:44.540> but<00:05:45.540> I<00:05:45.570> don't<00:05:45.840> usually<00:05:46.050> like

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
wife as well but I don't usually like

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.200 
wife as well but I don't usually like
damaging<00:05:46.770> items<00:05:47.010> like<00:05:47.130> that<00:05:47.160> it<00:05:47.730> does<00:05:47.940> look<00:05:48.150> a

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
damaging items like that it does look a

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.460 
damaging items like that it does look a
lot<00:05:48.330> better<00:05:48.570> so<00:05:48.780> that's<00:05:48.900> the<00:05:49.050> way<00:05:49.140> it<00:05:49.230> is<00:05:49.350> right

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
lot better so that's the way it is right

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.010 
lot better so that's the way it is right
now<00:05:49.650> and<00:05:49.950> then<00:05:50.520> I<00:05:50.550> also<00:05:50.910> added<00:05:51.090> the<00:05:51.420> clock<00:05:51.750> up

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.870 
now and then I also added the clock up
there<00:05:52.050> you're<00:05:52.890> not<00:05:53.040> really<00:05:53.280> supposed<00:05:53.490> to<00:05:53.730> keep

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
there you're not really supposed to keep

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.220 
there you're not really supposed to keep
time<00:05:54.150> when<00:05:54.360> you're<00:05:54.480> in<00:05:54.510> a<00:05:54.600> Nintendo<00:05:55.080> room

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
time when you're in a Nintendo room

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.210 
time when you're in a Nintendo room
you're<00:05:55.380> supposed<00:05:55.560> to<00:05:55.590> have<00:05:55.770> fun<00:05:55.980> enjoy

yourself<00:05:56.670> relax<00:05:57.000> but<00:05:57.930> I<00:05:57.960> thought<00:05:58.200> the<00:05:58.380> clock

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
yourself relax but I thought the clock

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.110 
yourself relax but I thought the clock
was<00:05:58.740> a<00:05:58.770> perfect<00:05:59.160> color<00:05:59.280> when<00:05:59.580> I<00:05:59.610> bought<00:05:59.850> it<00:05:59.880> and

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
was a perfect color when I bought it and

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.700 
was a perfect color when I bought it and
it<00:06:00.330> does<00:06:00.510> fit<00:06:00.690> pretty<00:06:00.990> well<00:06:01.110> up<00:06:01.320> there<00:06:01.440> in<00:06:01.560> case

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
it does fit pretty well up there in case

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.410 
it does fit pretty well up there in case
we<00:06:01.920> are<00:06:02.100> worried<00:06:02.520> about<00:06:02.700> looking<00:06:02.850> at<00:06:03.090> the<00:06:03.180> time

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
we are worried about looking at the time

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.270 
we are worried about looking at the time
so<00:06:04.170> the<00:06:04.260> Smash<00:06:04.470> Brothers<00:06:04.650> display<00:06:05.040> looks

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
so the Smash Brothers display looks

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.280
