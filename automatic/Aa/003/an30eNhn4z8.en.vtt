00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
my gosh I don't know how to approach

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.500 
my gosh I don't know how to approach
this<00:03:24.340> out<00:03:24.989> I'm<00:03:25.989> just<00:03:26.200> gonna<00:03:27.180> just<00:03:28.180> go<00:03:28.329> for

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
this out I'm just gonna just go for

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.280 
this out I'm just gonna just go for
whatever<00:03:33.299> all<00:03:34.299> right<00:03:34.480> let's<00:03:34.660> start<00:03:34.840> over<00:03:34.930> I

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
whatever all right let's start over I

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:44.890 
whatever all right let's start over I
didn't<00:03:35.889> like<00:03:35.980> that<00:03:36.010> cell<00:03:38.970> this<00:03:39.970> is<00:03:40.180> terrible

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.929 

all<00:03:45.409> right<00:03:45.590> let's<00:03:45.769> go<00:03:45.920> for<00:03:46.129> this<00:03:46.220> oh<00:03:50.140> my<00:03:51.140> gosh

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:51.939 
all right let's go for this oh my gosh

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:55.390 
all right let's go for this oh my gosh
and<00:03:52.939> I<00:03:53.299> didn't<00:03:53.989> like<00:03:54.110> this<00:03:54.200> one<00:03:54.260> either<00:03:54.409> but<00:03:55.129> so

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
and I didn't like this one either but so

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.420 
and I didn't like this one either but so
far<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:56.030> turn<00:03:56.299> in<00:03:56.480> I<00:03:56.739> average<00:03:57.739> five<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:58.189> six

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
far the turn in I average five to six

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.649 
far the turn in I average five to six
and<00:03:59.180> E<00:03:59.390> and<00:03:59.540> F<00:03:59.629> sometimes<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:01.340> turning<00:04:01.730> so<00:04:01.879> far

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:04.659 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.250 

it's<00:04:05.659> very<00:04:06.019> nice<00:04:06.290> it<00:04:06.799> feels<00:04:06.829> so<00:04:07.370> nice<00:04:07.959> it<00:04:08.959> feels

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
it's very nice it feels so nice it feels

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.929 
it's very nice it feels so nice it feels
like<00:04:09.530> you<00:04:09.650> don't<00:04:09.680> even<00:04:09.890> need<00:04:10.129> to<00:04:10.310> lube<00:04:10.519> it<00:04:10.670> that

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:10.939 
like you don't even need to lube it that

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.670 
like you don't even need to lube it that
that's<00:04:11.920> it's<00:04:12.920> like<00:04:13.069> ready<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.430> compete<00:04:14.000> but<00:04:14.209> it

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
that's it's like ready to compete but it

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.659 
that's it's like ready to compete but it
probably<00:04:15.680> needs<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:16.009> be<00:04:16.100> tightened<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.459> little

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
probably needs to be tightened a little

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.479 
probably needs to be tightened a little
bit<00:04:16.759> though<00:04:16.910> it<00:04:17.150> is<00:04:17.870> kind<00:04:18.109> of<00:04:18.169> stretchy<00:04:18.650> all

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
bit though it is kind of stretchy all

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.699 
bit though it is kind of stretchy all
right<00:04:19.729> everyone<00:04:19.910> so<00:04:20.840> I<00:04:20.870> wiped<00:04:21.199> out<00:04:21.350> all<00:04:21.560> the

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
right everyone so I wiped out all the

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.590 
right everyone so I wiped out all the
loop<00:04:21.889> that<00:04:22.100> came<00:04:22.340> with<00:04:22.580> you<00:04:22.940> know<00:04:23.030> in<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.240> cube

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
loop that came with you know in the cube

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.360 
loop that came with you know in the cube
and<00:04:23.810> we<00:04:24.710> lubed<00:04:24.949> it<00:04:25.130> with<00:04:26.060> you<00:04:26.990> know<00:04:27.110> rubix<00:04:27.710> and

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.779 

this<00:04:31.370> cube<00:04:31.610> is<00:04:31.729> really<00:04:32.300> really<00:04:32.660> fast<00:04:33.080> I<00:04:33.789> might

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
this cube is really really fast I might

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:39.520 
this cube is really really fast I might
need<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:35.060> tighten<00:04:35.630> it<00:04:35.780> a<00:04:35.870> bit<00:04:36.020> but<00:04:38.380> it's<00:04:39.380> a

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
need to tighten it a bit but it's a

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.529 
need to tighten it a bit but it's a
little<00:04:39.830> fast<00:04:40.130> a<00:04:40.370> little<00:04:40.639> hard<00:04:40.820> to<00:04:41.000> control

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
little fast a little hard to control

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:45.610 
little fast a little hard to control
sometimes<00:04:42.699> but<00:04:43.699> corner<00:04:44.270> cut<00:04:44.449> in<00:04:44.570> is<00:04:44.960> still<00:04:45.320> 45

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
sometimes but corner cut in is still 45

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.900 
sometimes but corner cut in is still 45
degrees<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:46.490> reverse<00:04:47.090> is<00:04:47.300> still<00:04:47.539> great<00:04:48.910> and

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
degrees and reverse is still great and

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.529 
degrees and reverse is still great and
this<00:04:50.090> cube<00:04:50.570> got<00:04:50.840> even<00:04:51.199> smoother<00:04:51.860> so<00:04:52.419> it<00:04:53.419> has

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
this cube got even smoother so it has

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.529 
this cube got even smoother so it has
that<00:04:53.780> really<00:04:54.530> nice<00:04:55.010> smooth<00:04:55.610> that<00:04:56.000> I<00:04:56.030> really

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
that really nice smooth that I really

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.820 
that really nice smooth that I really
like<00:04:57.820> still<00:04:58.820> not<00:04:59.000> as<00:04:59.120> smooth<00:04:59.389> as<00:04:59.539> the<00:04:59.960> Diane

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
like still not as smooth as the Diane

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.879 
like still not as smooth as the Diane
the<00:05:01.550> Diane<00:05:01.789> is<00:05:02.030> just<00:05:02.240> really<00:05:02.720> really<00:05:03.050> super

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
the Diane is just really really super

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.879 
the Diane is just really really super
smooth<00:05:04.630> but<00:05:05.630> I<00:05:05.750> like<00:05:05.960> this<00:05:06.229> smooth<00:05:06.590> a<00:05:06.710> little

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
smooth but I like this smooth a little

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.990 
smooth but I like this smooth a little
bit<00:05:06.979> better<00:05:07.099> because<00:05:07.789> it's<00:05:08.060> just<00:05:08.120> more<00:05:08.720> of<00:05:08.750> a<00:05:08.960> a

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
bit better because it's just more of a a

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.659 
bit better because it's just more of a a
slight<00:05:11.000> scratchy<00:05:11.659> smooth<00:05:12.199> the<00:05:13.159> feeling<00:05:13.490> is

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
slight scratchy smooth the feeling is

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.450 
slight scratchy smooth the feeling is
still<00:05:13.880> in<00:05:14.000> between<00:05:14.330> the<00:05:15.139> wit<00:05:15.860> to<00:05:15.889> and<00:05:16.280> the

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
still in between the wit to and the

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.930 
still in between the wit to and the
Diane<00:05:17.199> except<00:05:18.199> more<00:05:18.620> closer<00:05:19.010> to<00:05:19.460> the<00:05:19.699> dye<00:05:19.880> and

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
Diane except more closer to the dye and

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.430 
Diane except more closer to the dye and
smoothness<00:05:20.330> I<00:05:22.449> am<00:05:23.449> loving<00:05:23.750> this<00:05:23.960> two<00:05:24.229> by<00:05:24.380> two

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
smoothness I am loving this two by two

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.390 
smoothness I am loving this two by two
I'm<00:05:25.220> considering<00:05:25.849> it<00:05:25.940> to<00:05:26.180> be<00:05:26.419> my<00:05:26.690> main<00:05:27.340> so<00:05:28.340> you

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
I'm considering it to be my main so you

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.010 
I'm considering it to be my main so you
know<00:05:28.699> I'm<00:05:29.150> not<00:05:29.300> I<00:05:29.449> don't<00:05:29.599> want<00:05:29.720> to<00:05:29.810> take<00:05:29.930> the

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
know I'm not I don't want to take the

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.469 
know I'm not I don't want to take the
pieces<00:05:30.199> apart<00:05:30.590> cuz<00:05:30.860> its<00:05:31.039> kind<00:05:31.340> of<00:05:31.430> the<00:05:32.240> last

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
pieces apart cuz its kind of the last

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.450 
pieces apart cuz its kind of the last
like<00:05:32.960> it's<00:05:33.139> hard<00:05:33.320> to<00:05:33.409> put<00:05:33.620> in<00:05:33.740> the<00:05:33.830> last<00:05:34.010> corner

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
like it's hard to put in the last corner

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.659 
like it's hard to put in the last corner
for<00:05:34.789> me<00:05:34.909> but<00:05:35.860> that's<00:05:36.860> how<00:05:37.220> it<00:05:37.250> looks<00:05:37.520> on<00:05:37.610> the

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
for me but that's how it looks on the

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.960 
for me but that's how it looks on the
inside<00:05:38.120> and<00:05:38.479> overall<00:05:39.349> so<00:05:39.590> far<00:05:39.800> this<00:05:40.010> this<00:05:40.669> cube

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
inside and overall so far this this cube

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.100 
inside and overall so far this this cube
is<00:05:41.150> really<00:05:41.870> really<00:05:42.289> awesome<00:05:42.520> really<00:05:43.520> fast<00:05:44.110> tad

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
is really really awesome really fast tad

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.800 
is really really awesome really fast tad
bit<00:05:45.139> out<00:05:45.409> of<00:05:45.440> control<00:05:45.830> though<00:05:46.570> but<00:05:47.570> let<00:05:47.780> me

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
bit out of control though but let me

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.080 
bit out of control though but let me
finish<00:05:48.110> off<00:05:48.349> this<00:05:48.440> video<00:05:48.740> with<00:05:49.000> average<00:05:50.000> of

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
finish off this video with average of

00:05:50.090 --> 00:06:00.370 
finish off this video with average of
five<00:05:50.210> guys

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:14.690 

first<00:06:01.380> time<00:06:01.650> is<00:06:01.800> five<00:06:02.100> seconds<00:06:13.550> second<00:06:14.550> time

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
first time is five seconds second time

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:26.300
