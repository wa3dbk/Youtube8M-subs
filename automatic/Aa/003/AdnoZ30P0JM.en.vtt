00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
browser was like heavy data-intensive

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.010 
browser was like heavy data-intensive
browsers<00:02:17.700> been<00:02:17.850> updated<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:18.630> no<00:02:18.840> longer

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
browsers been updated so it's no longer

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.680 
browsers been updated so it's no longer
as<00:02:19.319> insensitive<00:02:19.709> as<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.040> was<00:02:20.130> before<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.880> HTML

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.080 
as insensitive as it was before the HTML
engine<00:02:22.140> actually<00:02:22.560> was<00:02:22.740> updated<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.459> the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
engine actually was updated so the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.120 
engine actually was updated so the
browser<00:02:24.360> works<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.959> lot<00:02:25.200> faster<00:02:25.260> it's<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.950> lot

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
browser works a lot faster it's a lot

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.180 
browser works a lot faster it's a lot
more<00:02:26.310> responsive<00:02:26.940> in<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.120> Cell<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.360> nicer<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.990> use

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
more responsive in a Cell a nicer to use

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.410 
more responsive in a Cell a nicer to use
so<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.280> see<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.670> sticks<00:02:29.940> with<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.180> same

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
so you see it sticks with the same

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.050 
so you see it sticks with the same
update<00:02:31.050> lay<00:02:31.170> off<00:02:31.319> from<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.650> 1.8<00:02:32.400> Update<00:02:32.760> I

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
update lay off from the 1.8 Update I

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.660 
update lay off from the 1.8 Update I
believe<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:33.480> was<00:02:33.810> where<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.620> search<00:02:34.860> bar<00:02:35.160> is

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
believe this was where the search bar is

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.930 
believe this was where the search bar is
separated<00:02:36.209> from<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:38.250> address<00:02:39.209> bar<00:02:39.500> and

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
separated from the the address bar and

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.340 
separated from the the address bar and
flowing<00:02:41.940> through<00:02:42.090> websites<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.630> very<00:02:42.989> simple

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
flowing through websites is very simple

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.530 
flowing through websites is very simple
I<00:02:43.530> mean<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:43.770> are<00:02:43.920> gonna<00:02:44.069> get<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.640> stuttering

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
I mean you are gonna get that stuttering

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.110 
I mean you are gonna get that stuttering
from<00:02:45.930> websites<00:02:46.320> but<00:02:47.070> again<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:47.910> isn't

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
from websites but again this isn't

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.720 
from websites but again this isn't
exactly<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.630> smartphone<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:49.500> yet<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.610> be

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
exactly a smartphone so yet to be

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.509 
exactly a smartphone so yet to be
expected<00:02:51.530> websites<00:02:52.530> do<00:02:52.769> load<00:02:52.980> very<00:02:53.190> quickly

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
expected websites do load very quickly

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.750 
expected websites do load very quickly
and<00:02:54.510> things<00:02:55.110> are<00:02:55.500> very<00:02:55.800> nice<00:02:56.130> actually<00:02:56.430> it's

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
and things are very nice actually it's

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.850 
and things are very nice actually it's
actually<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.060> lot<00:02:57.239> more<00:02:57.420> usable<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:58.080> mean<00:02:58.650> every

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
actually a lot more usable I mean every

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.559 
actually a lot more usable I mean every
update<00:02:59.010> gives<00:02:59.550> you<00:02:59.730> know<00:02:59.850> a<00:02:59.880> lot<00:03:00.090> more<00:03:00.120> update

to<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.780> browser<00:03:00.959> makes<00:03:01.319> it<00:03:01.470> more<00:03:01.620> usable<00:03:01.860> just

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
to the browser makes it more usable just

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.920 
to the browser makes it more usable just
apt<00:03:02.430> update<00:03:02.819> actually<00:03:03.150> made<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.480> lot<00:03:03.720> nicer

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
apt update actually made it a lot nicer
