00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.110 

we<00:00:04.740> are<00:00:04.890> just<00:00:05.100> scratching<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.609> surface<00:00:05.700> I

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
we are just scratching the surface I

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.450 
we are just scratching the surface I
mean<00:00:06.270> now<00:00:06.359> I<00:00:06.600> truly<00:00:07.080> believe<00:00:07.440> that<00:00:07.470> in<00:00:07.919> 10

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
mean now I truly believe that in 10

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.459 
mean now I truly believe that in 10
years<00:00:08.790> we<00:00:09.120> will<00:00:09.300> look<00:00:09.929> at<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.170> game<00:00:10.320> of

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
years we will look at the game of

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.810 
years we will look at the game of
basketball<00:00:10.590> completely<00:00:11.400> different<00:00:11.700> than

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
basketball completely different than

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.890 
basketball completely different than
because<00:00:12.000> we<00:00:12.090> would<00:00:12.179> have<00:00:12.210> discovered<00:00:12.719> things

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
because we would have discovered things

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.470 
because we would have discovered things
that<00:00:13.710> we<00:00:14.070> just<00:00:14.340> couldn't<00:00:14.849> have<00:00:14.969> known<00:00:15.120> before

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
that we just couldn't have known before

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.170 
that we just couldn't have known before
so<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:16.500> would<00:00:16.650> shock<00:00:17.010> me<00:00:17.039> if<00:00:17.369> we<00:00:17.520> didn't<00:00:17.850> change

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
so it would shock me if we didn't change

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.029 
so it would shock me if we didn't change
the<00:00:18.330> way<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:19.170> people<00:00:19.439> work<00:00:19.680> at<00:00:19.770> basketball

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
the way that people work at basketball

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.920 
the way that people work at basketball
because<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.640> way<00:00:23.820> people<00:00:24.359> count<00:00:24.689> things

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
because the way people count things

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.929 
because the way people count things
changed<00:00:25.470> before<00:00:25.800> what<00:00:26.460> happened<00:00:26.789> was<00:00:26.910> people

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
changed before what happened was people

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.400 
changed before what happened was people
would<00:00:27.269> sit<00:00:27.480> there<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.689> watch<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.080> game<00:00:28.230> and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
would sit there and watch the game and

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.140 
would sit there and watch the game and
write<00:00:28.590> things<00:00:28.830> down<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.460> that's<00:00:29.820> what<00:00:29.939> became

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
write things down and that's what became

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.759 
write things down and that's what became
the<00:00:30.330> box<00:00:30.510> score<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.929> people<00:00:31.199> same<00:00:31.619> for

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
the box score and people same for

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.020 
the box score and people same for
basketball<00:00:32.099> people<00:00:32.279> would<00:00:32.489> watch<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.850> game

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
basketball people would watch the game

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.150 
basketball people would watch the game
and<00:00:33.270> write<00:00:33.809> stuff<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.110> would<00:00:34.380> happen<00:00:34.680> but

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
and write stuff that would happen but

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.950 
and write stuff that would happen but
there's<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.460> lot<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.730> missing<00:00:36.059> things<00:00:36.600> missing

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
there's a lot of missing things missing

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.270 
there's a lot of missing things missing
because<00:00:37.170> people<00:00:37.410> can<00:00:37.530> only<00:00:37.710> mark<00:00:38.040> things

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
because people can only mark things

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.250 
because people can only mark things
every<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:38.760> often<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.329> there's<00:00:39.750> all<00:00:39.989> this

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
every so often and there's all this

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.540 
every so often and there's all this
stuff<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.559> happens<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:40.980> between<00:00:41.129> that's

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
stuff that happens in between that's

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.760 
stuff that happens in between that's
very<00:00:41.790> very<00:00:41.940> important<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:43.290> great<00:00:43.500> thing

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
very very important and the great thing

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.740 
very very important and the great thing
about<00:00:43.800> today<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.090> they<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.390> all<00:00:45.539> kinds

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
about today is that they have all kinds

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.959 
about today is that they have all kinds
of<00:00:45.809> completely<00:00:46.260> new<00:00:46.379> technology<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.700> lot<00:00:47.850> of

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
of completely new technology in a lot of

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.940 
of completely new technology in a lot of
sports<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.390> now<00:00:48.480> basketball<00:00:49.079> where<00:00:49.230> they<00:00:49.350> can

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
sports and now basketball where they can

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.860 
sports and now basketball where they can
basically<00:00:50.100> track<00:00:50.700> every<00:00:51.239> single<00:00:51.539> thing<00:00:51.750> at

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
basically track every single thing at

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.959 
basically track every single thing at
very<00:00:52.140> very<00:00:52.410> small<00:00:52.829> timescales<00:00:53.399> like<00:00:53.610> 25

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
very very small timescales like 25

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.150 
very very small timescales like 25
frames<00:00:54.210> per<00:00:54.300> second<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:55.140> basketball<00:00:55.710> well

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
frames per second for basketball well

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.470 
frames per second for basketball well
that's<00:00:56.340> one<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> big<00:00:56.760> challenges<00:00:57.180> that

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
that's one of the big challenges that

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.209 
that's one of the big challenges that
when<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> data<00:00:57.989> gets<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.440> us<00:00:58.590> it's<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.070> this

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
when the data gets to us it's just this

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.099 
when the data gets to us it's just this
big<00:00:59.460> log<00:00:59.699> file<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.300> lots<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.719> lots<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.930> numbers

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
big log file of lots and lots of numbers

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.020 
big log file of lots and lots of numbers
right<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.699> challenge<00:01:03.000> to

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
right and so it's a challenge to

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.289 
right and so it's a challenge to
transform<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.750> into<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> meaningful<00:01:05.299> you

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
transform that into a meaningful you

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.000 
transform that into a meaningful you
know<00:01:06.330> data<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.380> can<00:01:07.530> actually<00:01:07.830> apply

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
know data that we can actually apply

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.770 
know data that we can actually apply
algorithms<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.970> we<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.210> actually<00:01:09.479> you

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
algorithms to and we can actually you

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.179 
algorithms to and we can actually you
know<00:01:09.810> discern<00:01:10.200> patterns<00:01:10.229> from<00:01:13.070> there<00:01:14.070> were

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
know discern patterns from there were

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.609 
know discern patterns from there were
far<00:01:14.490> more<00:01:14.520> teams<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.090> had<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.810> sport<00:01:16.409> view

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
far more teams that had a sport view

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.440 
far more teams that had a sport view
last<00:01:16.920> year<00:01:17.189> they're<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.610> 10<00:01:17.880> teams<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.330> it

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
last year they're up to 10 teams have it

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.609 
last year they're up to 10 teams have it
now<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.720> I'm<00:01:18.780> sure<00:01:18.810> more<00:01:19.110> will<00:01:19.259> have<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.500> next

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
now and I'm sure more will have it next

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.510 
now and I'm sure more will have it next
year

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
year

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.510 
year
there's<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.210> holy<00:01:21.479> grail<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.170> many<00:01:23.130> sports

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
there's the holy grail of many sports

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.280 
there's the holy grail of many sports
and<00:01:23.790> basketball<00:01:24.479> included<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.049> figure<00:01:25.200> out

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
and basketball included is to figure out

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.100 
and basketball included is to figure out
defense<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.700> lot<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> reason<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:27.990> because

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
defense a lot of the reason is because

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.170 
defense a lot of the reason is because
box<00:01:28.829> scores<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> lot<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.460> offensive

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
box scores have a lot of offensive

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.330 
box scores have a lot of offensive
statistics<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.780> there's<00:01:30.930> very<00:01:31.229> little<00:01:31.530> about

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
statistics but there's very little about

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.020 
statistics but there's very little about
defense<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:34.130> basically<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.400> data<00:01:35.700> we

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
defense and basically with this data we

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.910 
defense and basically with this data we
might<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.810> able<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.020> solve<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.500> whole<00:01:37.650> holy

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
might be able to solve the whole holy

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.010 
might be able to solve the whole holy
grail<00:01:38.220> which<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.549> what<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.240> good<00:01:39.420> defense<00:01:39.810> what

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
grail which is what is good defense what

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.850 
grail which is what is good defense what
does<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.200> mean<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.500> play<00:01:40.650> good<00:01:40.799> defense

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
does it mean to play good defense

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.310 
does it mean to play good defense
because<00:01:41.460> if<00:01:41.939> somebody<00:01:42.689> runs<00:01:42.869> around<00:01:43.020> with<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
because if somebody runs around with the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.170 
because if somebody runs around with the
ball<00:01:43.500> for<00:01:43.799> 24<00:01:44.189> seconds<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.640> misses<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.030> shot

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
ball for 24 seconds and misses a shot

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.789 
ball for 24 seconds and misses a shot
you<00:01:45.360> could<00:01:45.479> actually<00:01:45.720> see<00:01:46.229> what<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.560> players

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
you could actually see what the players

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.219 
you could actually see what the players
were<00:01:47.070> doing<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.880> prevent<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.540> good<00:01:48.840> shot<00:01:49.079> from

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
were doing to prevent a good shot from

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.260 
were doing to prevent a good shot from
being<00:01:49.500> taken<00:01:49.890> we<00:01:50.040> know<00:01:50.189> we<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.579> exactly<00:01:51.000> how

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
being taken we know we know exactly how

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.210 
being taken we know we know exactly how
every<00:01:51.600> player<00:01:52.020> moves<00:01:52.350> before<00:01:52.710> they<00:01:53.009> take<00:01:53.189> a

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
every player moves before they take a

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.429 
every player moves before they take a
shot<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.640> we<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.909> tell<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.360> they<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:55.079> stand

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
shot so we can tell if they just stand

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.899 
shot so we can tell if they just stand
still<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.710> take<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> shot<00:01:56.219> or<00:01:56.460> what<00:01:56.640> kind<00:01:56.820> of

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
still and take a shot or what kind of

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.280 
still and take a shot or what kind of
moves<00:01:57.180> they<00:01:57.450> make<00:01:57.659> before<00:01:57.810> they<00:01:58.020> take<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
moves they make before they take the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.749 
moves they make before they take the
shot<00:01:58.469> how<00:01:58.680> they<00:01:58.860> like<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.130> go<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> basket

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
shot how they like to go to the basket

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.149 
shot how they like to go to the basket
so<00:02:00.149> we<00:02:00.270> can<00:02:00.420> really<00:02:00.600> do<00:02:00.869> very<00:02:01.320> specific<00:02:01.590> player

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
so we can really do very specific player

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.380 
so we can really do very specific player
profiling<00:02:02.729> if<00:02:02.820> we<00:02:02.939> do<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.240> right

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.219 

people<00:02:07.390> had<00:02:07.540> figured<00:02:07.720> out<00:02:07.930> that<00:02:08.110> the

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
people had figured out that the

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.310 
people had figured out that the
mid-range<00:02:08.640> jump<00:02:09.640> shot<00:02:09.850> was<00:02:10.210> a<00:02:10.509> very<00:02:10.810> bad<00:02:11.020> shot

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
mid-range jump shot was a very bad shot

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.410 
mid-range jump shot was a very bad shot
what<00:02:11.650> we<00:02:11.740> found<00:02:11.890> out<00:02:12.070> is<00:02:12.280> it's<00:02:12.550> an<00:02:12.760> even<00:02:13.180> worse

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
what we found out is it's an even worse

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.420 
what we found out is it's an even worse
shot<00:02:13.720> than<00:02:14.140> people<00:02:14.560> thought<00:02:14.710> before<00:02:15.100> because

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
shot than people thought before because

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.730 
shot than people thought before because
mid-range<00:02:16.210> shots<00:02:16.450> are<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.660> worst<00:02:17.110> kind<00:02:17.650> of

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
mid-range shots are the worst kind of

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.020 
mid-range shots are the worst kind of
shot<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.070> try<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.370> get<00:02:18.490> back<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:18.940> it's

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
shot to try and get back and it's

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.790 
shot to try and get back and it's
virtually<00:02:19.360> it's<00:02:19.660> very<00:02:19.900> hard<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.200> get<00:02:20.380> that

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
virtually it's very hard to get that

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.800 
virtually it's very hard to get that
back<00:02:21.070> as<00:02:21.190> an<00:02:21.280> offensive<00:02:21.670> team<00:02:21.850> so<00:02:22.120> there<00:02:22.720> was

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
back as an offensive team so there was

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.940 
back as an offensive team so there was
an<00:02:22.900> important<00:02:23.260> thing<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.380> there<00:02:23.680> are<00:02:23.800> two

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
an important thing that there are two

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.200 
an important thing that there are two
things<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.400> people<00:02:24.430> thought<00:02:24.760> were<00:02:24.940> had

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
things that people thought were had

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.850 
things that people thought were had
nothing<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.570> do<00:02:25.660> with<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:25.990> other<00:02:26.140> one<00:02:26.320> the

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
nothing to do with you the other one the

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.500 
nothing to do with you the other one the
chance<00:02:27.160> of<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.370> shot<00:02:27.580> would<00:02:27.700> go<00:02:27.880> in<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.300> the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
chance of the shot would go in and the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.910 
chance of the shot would go in and the
chance<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:29.050> would<00:02:29.200> get<00:02:29.320> it<00:02:29.410> back<00:02:29.560> we're

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
chance that you would get it back we're

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.440 
chance that you would get it back we're
treated<00:02:30.190> as<00:02:30.280> two<00:02:30.430> different<00:02:30.580> things<00:02:30.940> but

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
treated as two different things but

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.790 
treated as two different things but
because<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.780> our<00:02:31.900> research<00:02:32.230> we<00:02:32.380> know<00:02:32.560> that

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
because of our research we know that

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.920 
because of our research we know that
both<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.460> them<00:02:33.850> are<00:02:34.030> dependent<00:02:34.300> on<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.750> same

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
both of them are dependent on the same

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.320 
both of them are dependent on the same
thing<00:02:35.230> which<00:02:35.440> is<00:02:35.590> where<00:02:35.770> you<00:02:35.980> took<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.160> shot

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
thing which is where you took the shot

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.610 
thing which is where you took the shot
the<00:02:37.330> interesting<00:02:37.750> thing<00:02:37.900> is<00:02:38.050> that<00:02:38.170> once<00:02:38.470> we

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
the interesting thing is that once we

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.230 
the interesting thing is that once we
built<00:02:38.860> these<00:02:39.010> visualizations<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.790> find<00:02:40.060> that

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
built these visualizations I find that

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.360 
built these visualizations I find that
watching<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.140> visualizations<00:02:41.620> is<00:02:41.980> actually

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
watching the visualizations is actually

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.720 
watching the visualizations is actually
more<00:02:43.680> it's<00:02:44.680> more<00:02:44.830> clarifying<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.490> me<00:02:45.580> than

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
more it's more clarifying to me than

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.370 
more it's more clarifying to me than
watching<00:02:46.030> video<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:46.959> know<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.140> players

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
watching video of you know the players

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.990 
watching video of you know the players
on<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.920> court<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.280> mean<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.520> can<00:02:48.670> really<00:02:48.880> see

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
on the court I mean you can really see

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.580 
on the court I mean you can really see
the<00:02:49.090> spatial<00:02:49.450> relationships<00:02:49.990> and<00:02:50.260> that's

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
the spatial relationships and that's

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.690 
the spatial relationships and that's
something<00:02:50.830> that<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.040> actually<00:02:51.190> don't<00:02:51.550> get

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
something that you actually don't get

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.670 
something that you actually don't get
watching<00:02:52.270> video<00:02:52.720> three<00:02:52.959> of<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.110> four<00:02:53.290> teams

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
watching video three of the four teams

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.160 
watching video three of the four teams
in<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.190> left<00:02:55.180> are<00:02:55.390> actually<00:02:55.840> using<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.140> data

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
in the left are actually using the data

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.930 
in the left are actually using the data
now<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.530> would<00:02:56.800> say<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.400> most<00:02:57.520> important<00:02:57.910> thing

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
now I would say the most important thing

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.190 
now I would say the most important thing
to<00:02:58.150> being<00:02:58.270> successful<00:02:58.690> is<00:02:58.750> having<00:02:58.780> very<00:02:59.080> good

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
to being successful is having very good

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.590 
to being successful is having very good
players<00:02:59.530> but<00:02:59.800> a<00:03:00.490> lot<00:03:00.850> of<00:03:00.940> these<00:03:01.090> games<00:03:01.330> are

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
players but a lot of these games are

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.080 
players but a lot of these games are
very<00:03:01.780> very<00:03:02.050> close<00:03:02.380> for<00:03:03.100> example<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:03.850> know<00:03:03.970> in

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
very very close for example you know in

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.800 
very very close for example you know in
the<00:03:04.150> game

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
the game

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.110 
the game
the<00:03:05.080> Celtics<00:03:05.440> heat<00:03:05.709> game<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.130> was<00:03:06.250> 9999<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.060> it

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
the Celtics heat game it was 9999 and it

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.420 
the Celtics heat game it was 9999 and it
went<00:03:07.270> to<00:03:07.360> overtime<00:03:07.780> one<00:03:08.500> slight<00:03:08.920> strategic

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
went to overtime one slight strategic

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.009 
went to overtime one slight strategic
shift<00:03:09.670> could<00:03:09.820> have<00:03:09.940> made<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.150> difference<00:03:10.600> in<00:03:10.720> a

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
shift could have made a difference in a

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.229 
shift could have made a difference in a
winner<00:03:11.350> or<00:03:11.530> loss<00:03:11.709> for<00:03:11.890> either<00:03:12.040> team<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:12.880> that's

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
winner or loss for either team so that's

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.090 
winner or loss for either team so that's
really<00:03:13.540> where<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.200> value<00:03:14.230> for<00:03:14.769> a<00:03:14.800> lot<00:03:14.920> of<00:03:15.010> this

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
really where the value for a lot of this

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.040 
really where the value for a lot of this
stuff<00:03:15.250> is<00:03:15.459> in<00:03:15.670> even<00:03:16.180> when<00:03:16.480> good<00:03:16.660> teams<00:03:16.840> playing

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.380 
stuff is in even when good teams playing
good<00:03:17.200> teams<00:03:17.380> in<00:03:17.800> close<00:03:18.430> games<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:18.910> want<00:03:19.060> every
