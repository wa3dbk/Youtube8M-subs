00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
done a 3d printer video and kind of had

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.660 
done a 3d printer video and kind of had
my<00:00:12.030> hands<00:00:12.269> full<00:00:12.509> with<00:00:12.570> other<00:00:12.900> stuff<00:00:13.670> doesn't

mean I'm not still progressing on this
but<00:00:18.180> I've<00:00:18.960> been<00:00:19.170> every<00:00:19.890> time<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.100> do<00:00:20.250> get<00:00:20.520> some

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
but I've been every time I do get some

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.960 
but I've been every time I do get some
carve<00:00:21.449> out<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> few<00:00:21.840> hours<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.260> play<00:00:22.439> with<00:00:22.650> it

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
carve out a few hours to play with it

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.929 
carve out a few hours to play with it
I've<00:00:23.970> been<00:00:24.180> failing<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.960> lot<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.199> prints<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.099> so

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
I've been failing a lot of prints and so

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.099 
I've been failing a lot of prints and so
basically<00:00:27.650> here's<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:29.539> the<00:00:30.539> bottom<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.019> a

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
basically here's a a the bottom of a

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.080 
basically here's a a the bottom of a
case<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.920> I've<00:00:32.040> been<00:00:32.130> trying<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.550> print<00:00:32.850> for

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
case that I've been trying to print for

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.260 
case that I've been trying to print for
my<00:00:33.180> as<00:00:33.360> tx3<00:00:34.140> Pro<00:00:34.410> over<00:00:34.710> there<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.270> essentially

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
my as tx3 Pro over there and essentially

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.479 
my as tx3 Pro over there and essentially
I<00:00:36.719> get<00:00:37.170> about<00:00:37.380> thirty<00:00:37.800> minutes<00:00:37.980> into<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
I get about thirty minutes into the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.790 
I get about thirty minutes into the
print<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.420> jams<00:00:39.660> up<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.230> I've<00:00:40.410> done<00:00:40.590> some

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
print and it jams up so I've done some

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.049 
print and it jams up so I've done some
reading<00:00:41.010> I've<00:00:41.280> kind<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.550> had<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.820> problem

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
reading I've kind of had this problem

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.940 
reading I've kind of had this problem
for<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> while<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:42.870> just<00:00:42.930> sort<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.410> ignoring<00:00:43.739> it

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
for a while but just sort of ignoring it

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.790 
for a while but just sort of ignoring it
and<00:00:44.070> not<00:00:44.160> really<00:00:44.280> addressing<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:45.530> I'm<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.710> an

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
and not really addressing it I'm on an

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.119 
and not really addressing it I'm on an
e3d<00:00:47.239> v5<00:00:48.239> hot<00:00:48.660> end<00:00:48.870> which<00:00:49.320> obviously<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.980> did

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
e3d v5 hot end which obviously I did

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.729 
e3d v5 hot end which obviously I did
some<00:00:50.280> videos<00:00:50.550> about<00:00:50.579> before<00:00:51.590> and<00:00:52.590> I'm<00:00:52.710> just

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
some videos about before and I'm just

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.869 
some videos about before and I'm just
really<00:00:52.949> not<00:00:53.100> having<00:00:53.370> luck<00:00:53.520> with<00:00:53.730> it

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
really not having luck with it

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.580 
really not having luck with it
unfortunately<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.719> don't<00:00:54.840> really<00:00:55.199> want<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.500> buy

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
unfortunately I don't really want to buy

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.139 
unfortunately I don't really want to buy
another<00:00:55.860> one<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.340> kind<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.730> my<00:00:56.820> last-ditch

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
another one so kind of my last-ditch

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.529 
another one so kind of my last-ditch
effort<00:00:57.690> here<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.550> to<00:00:59.550> try<00:00:59.760> this<00:00:59.969> seasoning

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
effort here is to to try this seasoning

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.070 
effort here is to to try this seasoning
procedure<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.289> everybody<00:01:01.680> claims<00:01:02.520> works<00:01:03.080> at

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
procedure that everybody claims works at

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.740 
procedure that everybody claims works at
least<00:01:04.290> for<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.650> while<00:01:05.240> so<00:01:06.240> I'll<00:01:06.330> see<00:01:06.479> if<00:01:06.510> that'll

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
least for a while so I'll see if that'll

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.270 
least for a while so I'll see if that'll
help<00:01:06.960> me<00:01:07.110> out<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.530> maybe<00:01:07.680> at<00:01:07.920> least<00:01:08.070> prove

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
help me out and maybe at least prove

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.800 
help me out and maybe at least prove
that<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.939> hot<00:01:09.119> end<00:01:09.299> I'm<00:01:09.450> pretty<00:01:09.630> sure

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
that it is the hot end I'm pretty sure

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.300 
that it is the hot end I'm pretty sure
it's<00:01:09.930> not<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.229> extruder<00:01:10.650> giving<00:01:10.950> me<00:01:11.040> problems

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
it's not the extruder giving me problems

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.160 
it's not the extruder giving me problems
because<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:11.939> push<00:01:12.150> really<00:01:12.450> hard<00:01:12.570> but<00:01:13.080> it

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
because it can push really hard but it

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.620 
because it can push really hard but it
still<00:01:13.380> jams<00:01:13.619> up<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.250> kind<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.330> runs

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
still jams up and I kind of just runs

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.649 
still jams up and I kind of just runs
out<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.020> makes<00:01:16.200> these<00:01:16.350> little<00:01:16.409> blobby<00:01:16.860> things

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
out and makes these little blobby things

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.160 
out and makes these little blobby things
here<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.720> there<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:20.030> anyway<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.780> know<00:01:21.869> print

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
here and there but anyway you know print

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.649 
here and there but anyway you know print
like<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.470> size<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.920> fine<00:01:23.159> it's<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:23.700> that

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
like that size is fine it's just that

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.170 
like that size is fine it's just that
size<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.229> fine<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.799> just<00:01:25.950> eventually<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.520> jam

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
size is fine it's just eventually a jam

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.819 
size is fine it's just eventually a jam
up<00:01:27.390> when<00:01:27.540> I'm<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.750> these<00:01:27.869> longer<00:01:28.290> prints<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.770> I

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
up when I'm on these longer prints and I

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.170 
up when I'm on these longer prints and I
sort<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.159> what<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.310> need<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.640> do<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.970> get<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
sort of what I need to do to get the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.020 
sort of what I need to do to get the
printer<00:01:30.479> finished<00:01:30.810> up<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.670> this<00:01:32.670> video<00:01:32.939> is

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
printer finished up so this video is

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.670 
printer finished up so this video is
gonna<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.240> about<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.630> seasoning<00:01:34.229> procedure

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
gonna be about the seasoning procedure

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.880 
gonna be about the seasoning procedure
and<00:01:35.900> see<00:01:36.900> if<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.079> works<00:01:37.259> hopefully<00:01:37.500> I'll<00:01:37.770> do

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
and see if it works hopefully I'll do

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.440 
and see if it works hopefully I'll do
some<00:01:38.100> prints<00:01:38.430> before<00:01:38.579> they<00:01:38.880> conclude<00:01:39.299> this

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
some prints before they conclude this

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.020 
some prints before they conclude this
video<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.460> tell<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.579> if<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.729> works<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.090> on

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
video and tell you if it works it on

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.160 
video and tell you if it works it on
alright<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.390> start<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.750> seasoning

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
alright so you can start the seasoning

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.170 
alright so you can start the seasoning
process<00:01:46.619> off<00:01:46.860> by<00:01:47.100> taking<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.520> small<00:01:47.640> piece<00:01:47.790> of

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
process off by taking a small piece of

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.330 
process off by taking a small piece of
PLA<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.869> heating<00:01:49.500> your<00:01:49.619> hot<00:01:49.770> end<00:01:49.979> up<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
PLA and heating your hot end up to the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.819 
PLA and heating your hot end up to the
melting<00:01:50.700> tempo<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.149> your<00:01:51.180> PLA<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.649> I'm<00:01:52.740> gonna

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
melting tempo of your PLA so I'm gonna

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.710 
melting tempo of your PLA so I'm gonna
push<00:01:53.070> something<00:01:53.340> through<00:01:53.430> manually<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.540> is

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
push something through manually this is

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.230 
push something through manually this is
what<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.020> Bowden<00:01:55.350> tube<00:01:55.380> disconnected<00:01:56.340> just

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
what the Bowden tube disconnected just

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.910 
what the Bowden tube disconnected just
to<00:01:57.329> make<00:01:57.509> sure<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> good<00:01:58.200> solid<00:01:58.439> bit<00:01:58.770> in

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
to make sure we have a good solid bit in

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.520 
to make sure we have a good solid bit in
there<00:01:59.119> and<00:02:00.119> then<00:02:00.360> I'm<00:02:01.049> gonna<00:02:01.170> go<00:02:01.290> ahead<00:02:01.409> and

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
there and then I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.709 
there and then I'm gonna go ahead and
turn<00:02:01.740> off<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.189> hot<00:02:02.430> end<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.240> let<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.570> cool

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
turn off that hot end and let it cool

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.780 
turn off that hot end and let it cool
down<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.990> room<00:02:04.140> temperature

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.130 

all<00:02:08.240> right<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:08.570> once<00:02:08.750> you're<00:02:08.869> at<00:02:08.960> room

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
all right so once you're at room

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.690 
all right so once you're at room
temperature<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:09.740> can<00:02:09.950> turn<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.280> extruder

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
temperature you can turn the extruder

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.510 
temperature you can turn the extruder
back<00:02:10.940> on<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:12.230> put<00:02:12.470> some<00:02:12.680> slight<00:02:12.950> pressure<00:02:13.310> in

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
back on and put some slight pressure in

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.970 
back on and put some slight pressure in
the<00:02:13.610> upward<00:02:14.000> direction<00:02:16.000> on<00:02:17.000> your<00:02:17.060> filament

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
the upward direction on your filament

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.830 
the upward direction on your filament
and<00:02:18.980> as<00:02:19.130> soon<00:02:19.340> as<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.580> heats<00:02:19.790> up<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.540> should

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
and as soon as it heats up it should

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.950 
and as soon as it heats up it should
just<00:02:21.020> come<00:02:21.650> right<00:02:22.160> out<00:02:22.270> without<00:02:23.270> stretching

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
just come right out without stretching

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.290 
just come right out without stretching
too<00:02:24.170> much<00:02:24.380> and<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.460> end<00:02:25.610> up<00:02:25.730> with<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:26.060> nice

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
too much and you end up with this nice

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.550 
too much and you end up with this nice
little<00:02:26.560> plug<00:02:27.560> looking<00:02:27.980> thing<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:29.480> is<00:02:29.870> the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
little plug looking thing that is the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.170 
little plug looking thing that is the
shape<00:02:30.770> of<00:02:30.800> your<00:02:31.130> extruder<00:02:31.430> if<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.850> do<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.150> just

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
shape of your extruder if you do it just

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.590 
shape of your extruder if you do it just
right<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:34.040> can<00:02:34.220> see<00:02:34.460> sometimes<00:02:35.000> on<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:35.360> very

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
right you can see sometimes on the very

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.150 
right you can see sometimes on the very
very<00:02:35.900> end<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:38.090> can<00:02:38.240> see<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.600> last

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
very end of it that you can see the last

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
very end of it that you can see the last
diameter<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.220> your<00:02:40.340> nozzle<00:02:40.760> in<00:02:40.880> there<00:02:41.060> and

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
diameter of your nozzle in there and

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.220 
diameter of your nozzle in there and
that's<00:02:41.300> how<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.480> know<00:02:41.630> you've<00:02:41.780> really<00:02:42.050> got<00:02:42.200> it

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
that's how you know you've really got it

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.960 
that's how you know you've really got it
cleaned<00:02:42.560> all<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.800> way<00:02:42.920> out<00:02:43.040> but<00:02:43.280> this<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:43.700> good

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
cleaned all the way out but this is good

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.550 
cleaned all the way out but this is good
enough<00:02:44.180> just<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.450> get<00:02:44.600> any<00:02:44.750> excess<00:02:45.080> plastic

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
enough just to get any excess plastic

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.050 
enough just to get any excess plastic
out<00:02:45.740> of<00:02:45.830> there<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.070> can<00:02:46.220> also<00:02:46.370> inspect<00:02:46.880> this

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
out of there you can also inspect this

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.180 
out of there you can also inspect this
to<00:02:47.300> see<00:02:47.510> if<00:02:47.660> your<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:47.959> transition<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:49.160> really

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
to see if your a transition is really

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.040 
to see if your a transition is really
well<00:02:49.700> seated<00:02:50.120> because<00:02:50.270> you'll<00:02:50.510> see<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.780> little

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
well seated because you'll see a little

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.010 
well seated because you'll see a little
a<00:02:51.910> little<00:02:52.910> seam<00:02:53.240> there<00:02:53.510> where<00:02:53.720> it<00:02:53.810> kind<00:02:53.990> of

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
a little seam there where it kind of

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.520 
a little seam there where it kind of
pokes<00:02:54.290> out<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.530> little<00:02:54.740> bit<00:02:55.010> so<00:02:56.200> anyway<00:02:57.200> take<00:02:57.500> a

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
pokes out a little bit so anyway take a

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.380 
pokes out a little bit so anyway take a
look<00:02:57.800> at<00:02:57.920> that<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.370> just<00:02:58.640> just<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.150> know<00:02:59.270> what

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
look at that and just just you know what

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.550 
look at that and just just you know what
you're<00:02:59.540> looking<00:02:59.660> at<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.959> little<00:03:00.230> bit<00:03:00.350> there

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
you're looking at a little bit there

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.320 
you're looking at a little bit there
okay<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:03.620> now<00:03:03.920> that<00:03:03.950> it's<00:03:04.220> clean<00:03:04.520> heat<00:03:05.090> it<00:03:05.239> up

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
okay so now that it's clean heat it up

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.229 
okay so now that it's clean heat it up
to<00:03:05.600> about<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:06.200> melting<00:03:06.380> tempo<00:03:07.070> of<00:03:07.130> your<00:03:07.239> POA

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
to about the melting tempo of your POA

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.699 
to about the melting tempo of your POA
which<00:03:08.600> on<00:03:08.780> -<00:03:09.110> two<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.709> ten<00:03:10.010> on<00:03:10.190> this<00:03:10.310> one<00:03:11.709> some

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
which on - two to ten on this one some

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:13.960 
which on - two to ten on this one some
people<00:03:12.739> say<00:03:13.100> do<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.280> about<00:03:13.580> a<00:03:13.640> hundred<00:03:13.730> eight

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
people say do it about a hundred eight

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.280 
people say do it about a hundred eight
hundred<00:03:14.330> ninety<00:03:14.510> but<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:14.810> think<00:03:15.050> as<00:03:15.140> long<00:03:15.170> as

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
hundred ninety but I think as long as

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.420 
hundred ninety but I think as long as
you<00:03:15.410> don't<00:03:15.470> get<00:03:15.620> it<00:03:15.709> too<00:03:15.800> hot<00:03:15.980> you<00:03:16.100> should<00:03:16.130> be

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
you don't get it too hot you should be

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.990 
you don't get it too hot you should be
good<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.900> so<00:03:18.500> I've<00:03:18.650> got<00:03:18.860> some<00:03:19.130> olive<00:03:19.550> oil<00:03:19.670> here

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
good and so I've got some olive oil here

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.530 
good and so I've got some olive oil here
you<00:03:20.180> can<00:03:20.420> use<00:03:20.570> canola<00:03:21.050> as<00:03:21.530> well<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:23.299> I'm<00:03:23.390> just

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
you can use canola as well so I'm just

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.000 
you can use canola as well so I'm just
gonna<00:03:23.660> use<00:03:25.630> use<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.660> piece<00:03:26.930> of<00:03:26.959> this<00:03:27.290> dip<00:03:27.739> it<00:03:27.890> in

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
gonna use use a piece of this dip it in

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.530 
gonna use use a piece of this dip it in
there<00:03:28.190> real<00:03:28.370> good<00:03:28.400> get<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.000> all<00:03:29.120> rolled<00:03:29.420> around

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
there real good get it all rolled around

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:42.940 
there real good get it all rolled around
and<00:03:31.090> basically<00:03:34.330> feed<00:03:35.330> that<00:03:35.510> right<00:03:35.720> through

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:51.770 

and<00:03:43.950> extrude<00:03:44.580> it<00:03:49.970> and<00:03:50.970> just<00:03:51.180> extrude<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.630> good

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
and extrude it and just extrude a good

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.460 
and extrude it and just extrude a good
bit<00:03:52.020> not<00:03:52.230> oil<00:03:52.470> should<00:03:53.960> should<00:03:54.960> clean<00:03:55.230> right

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
bit not oil should should clean right

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.080 
bit not oil should should clean right
out<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.650> there<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.130> it's<00:03:56.280> gonna<00:03:56.490> season<00:03:56.820> the

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
out of there and it's gonna season the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.360 
out of there and it's gonna season the
metal<00:03:57.390> that<00:03:57.660> should<00:03:57.960> keep<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.380> sugars<00:03:59.070> in<00:03:59.280> the

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
metal that should keep the sugars in the

metal that should keep the sugars in the
PLA<00:03:59.790> from<00:04:00.060> sticking<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.720> stainless<00:04:01.200> so

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
PLA from sticking to the stainless so

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.920 
PLA from sticking to the stainless so
I'm<00:04:01.590> told

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
I'm told

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.240 
I'm told
so<00:04:03.930> I'm<00:04:04.290> gonna<00:04:04.410> go<00:04:04.530> ahead<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.740> do<00:04:04.890> that<00:04:05.040> same

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
so I'm gonna go ahead and do that same

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.010 
so I'm gonna go ahead and do that same
procedure<00:04:05.460> one<00:04:05.910> more<00:04:06.090> time<00:04:06.360> so<00:04:06.600> I'll<00:04:06.690> turn<00:04:06.870> off

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
procedure one more time so I'll turn off

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.460 
procedure one more time so I'll turn off
the<00:04:07.170> hot<00:04:07.290> end<00:04:07.530> let<00:04:08.280> it<00:04:08.400> cool<00:04:08.550> all<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.790> way<00:04:08.880> down

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
the hot end let it cool all the way down

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.720 
the hot end let it cool all the way down
heat<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:10.590> up<00:04:10.680> again<00:04:10.860> while<00:04:11.220> pulling<00:04:11.580> on<00:04:11.700> it

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
heat it up again while pulling on it

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.390 
heat it up again while pulling on it
clean<00:04:12.420> all<00:04:12.540> that<00:04:12.570> out<00:04:12.750> do<00:04:13.530> it<00:04:13.650> again<00:04:13.890> do<00:04:14.370> it

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
clean all that out do it again do it

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.789 
clean all that out do it again do it
maybe<00:04:14.640> a<00:04:14.730> few<00:04:15.000> times<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:15.660> we'll<00:04:16.470> see<00:04:16.680> if<00:04:16.739> that

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
maybe a few times and we'll see if that

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.090 
maybe a few times and we'll see if that
improves<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.940> jamming<00:04:18.329> issue<00:04:19.100> hopefully

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
improves the the jamming issue hopefully

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.220 
improves the the jamming issue hopefully
I<00:04:20.130> will<00:04:20.489> try<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.120> print<00:04:21.390> something<00:04:21.630> large<00:04:21.959> here

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
I will try to print something large here

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:33.980 
I will try to print something large here
soon<00:04:22.530> and<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:23.600> report<00:04:24.600> back<00:04:24.660> my<00:04:24.990> findings

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.670 

once<00:04:34.590> you've<00:04:34.740> done<00:04:34.889> a<00:04:34.949> few<00:04:35.190> cycles<00:04:35.430> just<00:04:35.970> purge

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
once you've done a few cycles just purge

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.890 
once you've done a few cycles just purge
50<00:04:37.680> or<00:04:37.830> 100<00:04:38.190> millimeters<00:04:38.699> of<00:04:39.000> filament

50 or 100 millimeters of filament
through<00:04:40.050> you<00:04:40.410> should<00:04:40.680> clean<00:04:40.949> out<00:04:40.979> all<00:04:41.190> the

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
through you should clean out all the

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.650 
through you should clean out all the
excess<00:04:41.639> oil<00:04:41.789> to<00:04:42.090> make<00:04:42.240> sure<00:04:42.389> it<00:04:42.509> doesn't

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
excess oil to make sure it doesn't

00:04:42.660 --> 00:05:39.230 
excess oil to make sure it doesn't
contaminate<00:04:43.080> your<00:04:43.530> prints

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.510

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
all right four and a half five hours

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.510 
all right four and a half five hours
later<00:05:41.729> baby<00:05:42.500> finally<00:05:43.500> finished<00:05:43.860> the<00:05:44.099> bottom

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
later baby finally finished the bottom

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.969 
later baby finally finished the bottom
half<00:05:44.789> of<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.449> Assateague<00:05:45.900> x3<00:05:46.440> probe<00:05:46.740> case

after seasoning the e3d hotend with pla

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.570 
after seasoning the e3d hotend with pla
i<00:05:52.020> was<00:05:52.319> having<00:05:52.500> a<00:05:52.620> lot<00:05:52.650> of<00:05:52.740> jamming<00:05:53.160> problems

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
i was having a lot of jamming problems

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.990 
i was having a lot of jamming problems
and<00:05:54.500> basically<00:05:55.500> it<00:05:55.979> seems<00:05:56.310> to<00:05:56.520> have<00:05:56.610> solved

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
and basically it seems to have solved

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.180 
and basically it seems to have solved
them<00:05:57.150> in<00:05:57.300> the<00:05:57.509> first<00:05:57.750> try<00:05:58.050> so<00:05:58.410> that's<00:05:58.440> that's

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
them in the first try so that's that's

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.860 
them in the first try so that's that's
really<00:05:59.460> good<00:05:59.759> I<00:05:59.789> think<00:06:00.120> that<00:06:00.419> I<00:06:00.479> had<00:06:00.599> to<00:06:00.720> even

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
really good I think that I had to even

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.279 
really good I think that I had to even
mess<00:06:01.530> with<00:06:01.770> it<00:06:01.949> and<00:06:02.449> read<00:06:03.449> about<00:06:03.690> it<00:06:03.960> and<00:06:04.169> all

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
mess with it and read about it and all

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.980 
mess with it and read about it and all
of<00:06:04.319> that<00:06:04.530> but<00:06:05.150> apparently<00:06:06.150> it<00:06:06.539> works<00:06:06.690> a<00:06:06.840> lot

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
of that but apparently it works a lot

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.559 
of that but apparently it works a lot
better<00:06:07.050> with<00:06:07.410> abs<00:06:07.889> then<00:06:08.250> it<00:06:08.340> does<00:06:08.520> PLA<00:06:09.000> but<00:06:09.449> I'm

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569 
better with abs then it does PLA but I'm

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.210 
better with abs then it does PLA but I'm
just<00:06:09.690> happy<00:06:09.900> that<00:06:10.199> I<00:06:10.289> finally<00:06:10.650> got<00:06:10.770> this<00:06:10.949> thing

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
just happy that I finally got this thing

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.460 
just happy that I finally got this thing
done<00:06:11.490> it's<00:06:12.060> kind<00:06:12.300> of<00:06:12.330> renewed<00:06:12.720> my<00:06:12.900> interest<00:06:13.319> in

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
done it's kind of renewed my interest in

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.070 
done it's kind of renewed my interest in
this<00:06:13.530> 3d<00:06:13.860> printer<00:06:14.250> it<00:06:14.400> kind<00:06:14.610> of<00:06:14.780> crept<00:06:15.780> away<00:06:15.930> a

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
this 3d printer it kind of crept away a

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.990 
this 3d printer it kind of crept away a
little<00:06:16.319> bit<00:06:16.440> it<00:06:16.770> was<00:06:16.830> it<00:06:17.130> was<00:06:17.250> hard<00:06:17.490> to<00:06:17.550> devote

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
little bit it was it was hard to devote

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.170 
little bit it was it was hard to devote
time<00:06:18.870> to<00:06:18.930> it<00:06:19.289> when<00:06:19.500> getting<00:06:20.130> like<00:06:20.430> failed

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
time to it when getting like failed

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.909 
time to it when getting like failed
prints<00:06:21.599> all<00:06:21.750> the<00:06:21.870> time<00:06:22.110> and<00:06:22.349> stuff<00:06:22.530> like<00:06:22.710> that

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
prints all the time and stuff like that

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:25.129 
prints all the time and stuff like that
it's<00:06:23.099> just<00:06:23.159> when<00:06:23.849> you<00:06:23.909> don't<00:06:24.150> expect<00:06:24.330> success

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 
it's just when you don't expect success

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.610 
it's just when you don't expect success
it's<00:06:25.380> hard<00:06:25.560> to<00:06:25.680> put<00:06:25.860> the<00:06:25.949> time<00:06:26.159> in<00:06:26.340> it<00:06:26.460> so

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
it's hard to put the time in it so

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.839 
it's hard to put the time in it so
hopefully<00:06:28.620> I'll<00:06:28.860> put<00:06:29.039> some<00:06:29.190> more<00:06:29.340> videos<00:06:29.669> out

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849 
hopefully I'll put some more videos out

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:31.820 
hopefully I'll put some more videos out
pretty<00:06:30.060> soon<00:06:30.360> I've<00:06:30.870> got<00:06:31.080> a<00:06:31.110> lot<00:06:31.319> of<00:06:31.349> like<00:06:31.620> more

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
pretty soon I've got a lot of like more

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.730 
pretty soon I've got a lot of like more
functional<00:06:32.400> kind<00:06:32.639> of<00:06:32.729> prints<00:06:33.030> coming<00:06:33.240> on

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
functional kind of prints coming on

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.279 
functional kind of prints coming on
other<00:06:34.740> than<00:06:35.009> just<00:06:35.310> the<00:06:35.699> printer<00:06:36.690> upgrades<00:06:37.110> and

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
other than just the printer upgrades and

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:38.809 
other than just the printer upgrades and
stuff<00:06:37.530> like<00:06:37.710> that<00:06:37.889> that<00:06:37.919> I<00:06:38.069> have<00:06:38.310> been<00:06:38.520> doing

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:38.819 
stuff like that that I have been doing

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:43.249 
stuff like that that I have been doing
so<00:06:40.550> anyway<00:06:41.550> I<00:06:41.669> did<00:06:41.880> have<00:06:42.030> a<00:06:42.060> few<00:06:42.360> issues<00:06:42.990> with

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:43.259 
so anyway I did have a few issues with

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:46.580 
so anyway I did have a few issues with
this<00:06:43.680> print<00:06:44.370> a<00:06:44.789> couple<00:06:45.240> of<00:06:45.539> kind<00:06:46.080> of<00:06:46.169> almost

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
this print a couple of kind of almost

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.860 
this print a couple of kind of almost
filament<00:06:47.190> starvation<00:06:47.820> issues<00:06:48.330> maybe<00:06:48.630> the

filament starvation issues maybe the

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.360 
filament starvation issues maybe the

flow-rate needs to adjust it or
something<00:06:51.150> like<00:06:51.180> that<00:06:51.330> so<00:06:51.750> I'm<00:06:51.930> gonna<00:06:52.050> try<00:06:52.259> to

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:52.289 
something like that so I'm gonna try to

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:55.159 
something like that so I'm gonna try to
address<00:06:52.650> those<00:06:52.830> problems<00:06:52.889> and<00:06:54.020> this<00:06:55.020> is<00:06:55.139> a

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:55.169 
address those problems and this is a

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:57.020 
address those problems and this is a
perfectly<00:06:55.620> usable<00:06:56.009> piece<00:06:56.340> though<00:06:56.580> assuming

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
perfectly usable piece though assuming

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.499 
perfectly usable piece though assuming
out-breaking<00:06:57.419> getting<00:06:57.780> off<00:06:57.900> the<00:06:58.080> bed<00:06:58.259> I<00:06:58.530> have

00:06:59.499 --> 00:06:59.509 
out-breaking getting off the bed I have

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:03.409 
out-breaking getting off the bed I have
been<00:07:00.509> using<00:07:00.780> this<00:07:01.130> Elmer's<00:07:02.130> glue<00:07:02.520> glue<00:07:03.150> stick

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 
been using this Elmer's glue glue stick

been using this Elmer's glue glue stick
on<00:07:03.900> blue<00:07:04.800> painters<00:07:05.219> tape<00:07:05.280> so<00:07:05.820> I<00:07:06.000> know<00:07:06.270> there's

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:06.539 
on blue painters tape so I know there's

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:08.300 
on blue painters tape so I know there's
some<00:07:06.690> other<00:07:06.780> methods<00:07:07.289> of<00:07:07.409> doing<00:07:07.530> that<00:07:07.830> I<00:07:08.069> kind

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.310 
some other methods of doing that I kind

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.209 
some other methods of doing that I kind
of<00:07:08.400> tried<00:07:08.690> many<00:07:09.690> many<00:07:09.810> times<00:07:10.319> many<00:07:10.650> times<00:07:10.710> or

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:11.219 
of tried many many times many times or

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:14.779 
of tried many many times many times or

all<00:07:15.060> that<00:07:15.270> and<00:07:15.659> I<00:07:15.719> just<00:07:15.780> couldn't<00:07:16.289> find

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:16.469 
all that and I just couldn't find

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:18.950 
all that and I just couldn't find
anything<00:07:16.740> that<00:07:17.069> would<00:07:17.159> work<00:07:17.430> without<00:07:17.849> a<00:07:18.389> glue

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 
anything that would work without a glue

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.290 
anything that would work without a glue
or<00:07:19.199> an<00:07:19.289> adhesive<00:07:19.620> of<00:07:19.919> some<00:07:20.130> type<00:07:20.370> so<00:07:20.400> probably

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 
or an adhesive of some type so probably

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.879 
or an adhesive of some type so probably
I'll<00:07:21.419> try<00:07:21.599> some<00:07:21.840> hairspray<00:07:22.229> at<00:07:22.380> some<00:07:22.590> point

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:22.889
