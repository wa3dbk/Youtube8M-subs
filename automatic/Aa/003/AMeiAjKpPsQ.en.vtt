pulling the fascia away from the side of
the<00:00:57.930> case<00:00:58.190> eventually<00:00:59.190> what<00:00:59.760> happened<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the case eventually what happened is

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.119 
the case eventually what happened is
it'll<00:01:00.329> click<00:01:02.300> be<00:01:03.300> careful<00:01:03.690> not<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.840> be<00:01:03.989> too

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
it'll click be careful not to be too

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.050 
it'll click be careful not to be too
forceful<00:01:05.129> with<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.369> otherwise<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.670> will<00:01:05.820> snap

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
forceful with it otherwise you will snap

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.060 
forceful with it otherwise you will snap
the<00:01:06.180> casing<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.650> was<00:01:07.740> obviously<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the casing and that was obviously the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.730 
the casing and that was obviously the
last<00:01:08.250> thing<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.520> want<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.729> do<00:01:09.500> well<00:01:10.500> you'll<00:01:10.710> be

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
last thing you want to do well you'll be

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.350 
last thing you want to do well you'll be
raised<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.369> should<00:01:11.640> be<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.820> run<00:01:11.970> your<00:01:12.090> finger

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
raised you should be to run your finger

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.450 
raised you should be to run your finger
along<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.659> side<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.080> casing<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.860> it

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
along the side of the casing and it

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.660 
along the side of the casing and it
should<00:01:14.580> start<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.880> come<00:01:15.000> up<00:01:15.119> as<00:01:15.420> shown<00:01:15.720> just<00:01:16.670> do

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
should start to come up as shown just do

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.660 
should start to come up as shown just do
that<00:01:17.790> with<00:01:17.970> hallway<00:01:18.360> down<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> side<00:01:19.490> best<00:01:20.490> way

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
that with hallway down the side best way

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.730 
that with hallway down the side best way
to<00:01:20.700> describe<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:21.689> pulling<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.200> housing

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
to describe it it's pulling the housing

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.440 
to describe it it's pulling the housing
away<00:01:23.040> from<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> fascia<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.909> snaps<00:01:24.150> away

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
away from the fascia so it snaps away

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.590 
away from the fascia so it snaps away
like<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.820> then<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:26.909> just<00:01:27.030> need<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> same

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
like so then we just need to do the same

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.140 
like so then we just need to do the same
with<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.780> other<00:01:27.900> side<00:01:28.909> using<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:29.970> same

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
with the other side using the same

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.969 
with the other side using the same
screwdriver<00:01:30.479> sometimes<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.619> be<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.710> little

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
screwdriver sometimes it can be a little

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.380 
screwdriver sometimes it can be a little
bit<00:01:32.070> more<00:01:32.130> tricky<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.790> because<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> angle

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
bit more tricky just because the angle

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.690 
bit more tricky just because the angle
of<00:01:33.450> phones<00:01:33.630> now<00:01:33.840> adds<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:35.040> what<00:01:35.340> we'll<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.579> is

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
of phones now adds so what we'll do is

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:45.719 
of phones now adds so what we'll do is
we'll<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:36.000> click<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.390> up<00:01:36.450> gently

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:56.340 

like<00:01:46.729> so

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.300 

like<00:01:57.350> I<00:01:57.500> said<00:01:57.560> this<00:01:57.920> is<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.189> tricky<00:01:58.520> about

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.279 

okay<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.579> once<00:02:04.700> it's<00:02:04.820> clicked<00:02:05.030> up<00:02:05.210> and<00:02:06.170> then

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
okay and once it's clicked up and then

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:21.230 
okay and once it's clicked up and then
just<00:02:06.409> click<00:02:06.679> the<00:02:06.890> whole<00:02:07.100> base<00:02:07.610> shop

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.890 

shut<00:02:22.240> up<00:02:23.640> okay<00:02:24.640> next<00:02:25.210> we're<00:02:25.540> going<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.720> do<00:02:25.810> is

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
shut up okay next we're going to do is

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.290 
shut up okay next we're going to do is
remove<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.290> two<00:02:26.470> t6<00:02:27.130> screws<00:02:27.430> at<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.760> top<00:02:27.880> here

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
remove the two t6 screws at the top here

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.450 
remove the two t6 screws at the top here
so<00:02:28.330> we<00:02:28.540> can<00:02:28.660> get<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.870> LCD<00:02:28.990> out<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:30.040> do<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.310> you

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
so we can get the LCD out to do that you

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:44.760 
so we can get the LCD out to do that you
will<00:02:30.550> need<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.910> t6<00:02:31.390> screwdriver

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:14.969 
keep an hour away and they'll see

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:16.280 
keep an hour away and they'll see
there's<00:03:15.150> another<00:03:15.329> set<00:03:15.629> of<00:03:15.659> full<00:03:15.989> screws

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
underneath those we'll just take these

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:25.849 
underneath those we'll just take these
off<00:03:23.840> as<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.900> slightly<00:03:25.230> shorter<00:03:25.620> we'll<00:03:25.739> keep

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
off as a slightly shorter we'll keep

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.849 
off as a slightly shorter we'll keep
them<00:03:26.040> slightly<00:03:26.250> separated<00:03:27.620> just<00:03:28.620> so<00:03:28.739> we<00:03:28.829> don't

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
them slightly separated just so we don't

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:58.559 
them slightly separated just so we don't
confuse<00:03:29.189> them<00:03:29.579> like<00:03:30.000> that

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.569
