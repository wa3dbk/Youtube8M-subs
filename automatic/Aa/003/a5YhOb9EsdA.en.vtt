00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello I have nautas if you are by 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.850
 buy a mobile a tablet or a 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.610
 Attentive laptop because there is a 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.250
 cable that will govern them all we are 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.900
 talking about the type c usb and if not us 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.910
 we want to be in obsolescence what 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.509
 we are going to have to know next 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.509
 we start 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.730
 good times are coming for the haters 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.040
 of the cables between which I include myself 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.810
 because we are going to be able to have a single 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.880
 cable all the functionalities that 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.080
 we have with many of them for 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.030
 example we will eliminate the hdmi vga others 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.010
 cables like the express pci that after 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.320
 I'll tell you a little bit how important it is 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.269
 and also those of the charger 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.460
 also for example we can connect 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.280
 our monitor directly with a single 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.769
 cable to which it provides energy and data 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.380
 so imagine the simplicity that 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.180
 this will have a bit then we comment on 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.820
 in the previous video just that 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.550
 we talked about the new one plus in which 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.770
 will also include this connection and for 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.469
 generally after they appeal they pulled out 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.330
 your new macbook with this unique connection 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.979
 all the other companies that are 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.740
 starting to take it seriously and this is 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.660
 really great because from here more or 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.430
 less than a year is already going to be a standard 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.119
 so if you're about to buy yourself any 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.590
 thing of these many very attentive because 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.970
 it's better out there waiting a little bit 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.330
 although I know 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.670
 adds to this new new fashion of the new 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.770
 cable in terms of functionalities and 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.570
 as we said is reversible it can be 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.690
 connect from both sides unlike 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.180
 of the usb 2.0 on the other hand the models 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.270
 there is one there is only one type of 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.690
 connector unlike the usb 2 that there 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.690
 we have the mini usb the usb micro usb 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.760
 tg the usb for the printer and others in 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.430
 this case fortunately we do not need them 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.310
 since the model is bidirectional and the 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.920
 two ends are the same on the other hand 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.110
 the speed is much faster and 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.090
 that reaches up to 10 gigabytes per 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.119
 second a bestiality if we compare it 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.850
 with the 480 megabytes per second that 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.149
 comes to usb 2.0 this would be only a 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.369
 4 8% of the speed that this new one gives 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.620
 awesome cable if we compare it 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.130
 also for example with the usb 3.0 is 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.350
 almost double since this one was in 48 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.420
 gigabytes per second in terms of 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.770
 Powers exceedingly great news because 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.769
 for example a laptop to be able 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.819
 work needs 60 watts good this 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.730
 cable is able to provide 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.560
 100 so we'll have power to spare 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.749
 to be able to connect all of our 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.930
 most important devices for example 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:38.780
 this has 20 volts unlike the 2.5 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.849
 that have the USB 2.0 100 watts as already 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.430
 we had said unlike the 2,5 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.409
 that has the current model and the most 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.689
 important of all is that this cable is 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.879
 bidirectional or whether it can provide 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:51.560
 energy from the two sides other things 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.680
 very important good if what already 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.629
 we said the hdmi we can directly 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.120
 replace it with this cable from the cable 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.620
 also from gea the pci express what 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.629
 does this mean good for example 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.120
 we have a laptop that has 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.069
 a video card not a very graphic 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.829
 good little we can 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.500
 connect directly through the usb 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.329
 type c we can connect a graph 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.889
 external with all the power that 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.680
 we want when for example we are in 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:21.290
 house and so we will avoid having to 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.489
 be connecting him warm even if it's a 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.379
 heavier laptop that carries a 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.810
 heavy graphic no so it's 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.819
 very important and the applications that 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.799
 has these are many too we 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.270
 will serve as ethernet cable as 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.460
 charger we already said 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.100
 the new macbook comes with that unique 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.260
 usb port type c and connects 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.700
 directly to the charger so there 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.740
 It gives you an idea of where the 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.840
 shots and there is also comment on 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.550
 that will be able to replace the mini jack or 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.040
 be that our smartphones are going to have 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.080
 from now on a single connection 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.670
 good in a little bit not because 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.710
 still nobody cheers us up too much but 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.330
 it's going to be that way so good 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.550
 it's really worth doing this video 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.710
 for this topic more than anything if you go to 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.810
 buying a laptop is very important 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.700
 you expect even next year 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.060
 where more models will come out than 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.700
 least have a usb port type c for 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.310
 so you can take advantage of the whole topic 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.760
 of maximum speed to be able to load your 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.500
 devices quickly and easily that 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.959
 we are left after this good will be 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.610
 about 10 years surely until the 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.020
 next type of cable that will come that 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.080
 surely I imagine that it will be 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.510
 magnetic as it happens with the charger 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.580
 apple watch that really is very easy 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.130
 to connect and is the following not in 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.249
 As for simplicity, maybe later 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.229
 come the load 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:39.509
 directly wireless cables 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.279
 directly avoid all kinds of cables 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.769
 because there are already technologies that are being 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:45.869
 developing that one can load their 

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:47.429
 devices directly from a distance 

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:49.559
 without any cable or anything that 

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:52.289
 bother around and that we're going to 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:54.539
 be the fucking paradise for all geeks 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:57.299
 and others that we really swim between 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.799
 cables very crude day by day and nothing more 

00:04:57.299 --> 00:05:01.349
 for the moment if you liked the video 

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:03.329
 you know I like it if you liked it a lot 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.159
 more you can subscribe to the channel that 

00:05:03.329 --> 00:05:07.199
 we talk about the latest technology and 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:09.059
 we had a good time a little talking 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.189
 about it and also tell you what else 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:13.529
 information on our website techno nauta 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:14.210
 puntocom we see you in the 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:29.110
 next video
