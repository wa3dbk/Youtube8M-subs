to<00:00:50.670> note<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.510> my<00:00:51.719> benchmarking<00:00:52.230> runs<00:00:52.469> I

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
to note is in my benchmarking runs I

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.660 
to note is in my benchmarking runs I
wait<00:00:53.010> until<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.460> stop<00:00:54.620> like<00:00:55.620> shaking<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
wait until I stop like shaking on the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.790 
wait until I stop like shaking on the
hooks<00:00:56.899> until<00:00:57.899> I'm<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.230> more<00:00:58.410> static

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
hooks until I'm in a more static

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.200 
hooks until I'm in a more static
position<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.370> then<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.489> jump<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.879> next<00:01:00.059> one

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
position and then I jump to the next one

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.319 
position and then I jump to the next one
just<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.690> make<00:01:00.870> my<00:01:00.989> pacing<00:01:01.410> right<00:01:02.059> you<00:01:03.059> jump

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
just to make my pacing right you jump

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.130 
just to make my pacing right you jump
down<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.719> just<00:01:03.870> wreck<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.559> guy's<00:01:04.769> face<00:01:09.140> a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
down and just wreck this guy's face a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.289 
down and just wreck this guy's face a
little<00:01:10.380> bit<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> long<00:01:10.920> way<00:01:11.189> but<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:12.060> just

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
little bit on the long way but it's just

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.840 
little bit on the long way but it's just
better<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.409> pacing<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.860> consistency<00:01:14.340> throw

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
better for pacing and consistency throw

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.100 
better for pacing and consistency throw
a<00:01:14.880> fireball<00:01:15.119> over<00:01:15.509> here<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.750> take<00:01:15.900> care<00:01:16.049> of

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
a fireball over here to take care of

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.920 
a fireball over here to take care of
those<00:01:16.290> guys<00:01:16.320> nice<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.130> quick<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.909> then<00:01:18.570> kill

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
those guys nice and quick and then kill

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.539 
those guys nice and quick and then kill
these<00:01:19.140> two<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> right<00:01:19.740> side<00:01:22.549> without

these two on the right side without
strangler<00:01:24.240> I'm<00:01:24.360> gonna<00:01:24.509> take<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.960> turret

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
strangler I'm gonna take this turret

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.469 
strangler I'm gonna take this turret
your<00:01:26.250> shield<00:01:26.520> should<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.880> able<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.060> defend<00:01:27.360> you

your shield should be able to defend you

your shield should be able to defend you
throughout<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.869> entire<00:01:28.290> benchmark<00:01:29.070> pretty

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
throughout this entire benchmark pretty

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.749 
throughout this entire benchmark pretty
much<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.119> wouldn't<00:01:30.450> worry<00:01:30.570> too<00:01:30.869> much

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
much so I wouldn't worry too much

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.219 
much so I wouldn't worry too much
right<00:01:33.150> when<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.329> see<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.659> slot<00:01:33.960> up<00:01:34.079> here

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229

right when I see this slot up here
between<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.530> pillar<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.740> throw<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.040> fireball

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
between the pillar I throw a fireball

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.700 
between the pillar I throw a fireball
because<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.689> helps<00:01:36.930> take<00:01:37.079> care<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.439> at<00:01:37.560> least

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
because it helps take care of at least

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.190 
because it helps take care of at least
one<00:01:37.979> or<00:01:38.100> two<00:01:38.250> guys<00:01:38.689> and<00:01:39.689> we're<00:01:39.840> gonna<00:01:39.930> fight

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
one or two guys and we're gonna fight

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.050 
one or two guys and we're gonna fight
off<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.470> rest<00:01:40.829> there<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.189> go<00:01:41.280> fight<00:01:41.820> off<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
off the rest there we go fight off the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.569 
off the rest there we go fight off the
rest<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.840> police<00:01:43.259> barrage<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.920> then<00:01:44.070> kill

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
rest of the police barrage and then kill

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.999 
rest of the police barrage and then kill
the<00:01:44.729> other<00:01:44.939> police<00:01:45.329> barges<00:01:45.720> turret<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.409> a

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
the other police barges turret and a

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.700 
the other police barges turret and a
little<00:01:47.909> bit<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.210> miss<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.840> guy<00:01:49.079> but<00:01:49.380> he'll<00:01:49.680> be

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
little bit I miss that guy but he'll be

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.960 
little bit I miss that guy but he'll be
on<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.950> roof<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.399> other<00:01:50.460> side<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:50.880> it's

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
on the roof on the other side so it's

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.920 
on the roof on the other side so it's
not<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.119> problem<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:52.970> do<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:54.540> go<00:01:54.689> over<00:01:54.780> to

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
not a problem to do and we go over to

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.539 
not a problem to do and we go over to
this<00:01:55.020> roof<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.740> we're<00:01:55.860> cleaning<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.310> roof

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
this roof and we're cleaning this roof

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.789 
this roof and we're cleaning this roof
as<00:01:56.729> well<00:01:56.759> we're<00:01:57.570> gonna<00:01:57.659> kind<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.140> do<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> snake

you guys enjoyed this this gives you
some<00:02:36.340> idea<00:02:36.670> how<00:02:37.240> we<00:02:37.300> benchmark<00:02:37.870> BioShock

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
some idea how we benchmark BioShock

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.900 
some idea how we benchmark BioShock
Infinite<00:02:38.350> because<00:02:38.980> we<00:02:39.130> do<00:02:39.310> believe<00:02:39.520> in

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
Infinite because we do believe in
