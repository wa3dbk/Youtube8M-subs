worth<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.270> especially<00:02:04.140> if<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.649> only<00:02:04.860> have

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
worth and especially if you only have

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.270 
worth and especially if you only have
your<00:02:05.280> IRA<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.820> trade<00:02:06.710> that's<00:02:07.710> what<00:02:07.890> he<00:02:07.979> traded

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
your IRA to trade that's what he traded

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.979 
your IRA to trade that's what he traded
here<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.520> think<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.910> was<00:02:09.000> his<00:02:09.119> IRA<00:02:09.300> or<00:02:09.750> one<00:02:09.899> of

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
here I think it was his IRA or one of

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.990 
here I think it was his IRA or one of
his<00:02:10.050> retirement<00:02:10.379> accounts<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.700> small

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
his retirement accounts and a small

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.490 
his retirement accounts and a small
amount<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.540> regular<00:02:12.870> stock<00:02:13.110> account

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
amount in a regular stock account

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.800 
amount in a regular stock account
and<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:14.310> think<00:02:14.790> if<00:02:14.880> he<00:02:14.910> keeps<00:02:15.240> following<00:02:15.480> this

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
and I think if he keeps following this

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.230 
and I think if he keeps following this
method<00:02:16.050> he<00:02:16.410> will<00:02:16.560> do<00:02:16.710> very<00:02:16.950> well<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.460> make

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
method he will do very well and make

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.850 
method he will do very well and make
much<00:02:18.480> more<00:02:18.720> than<00:02:18.870> he<00:02:18.960> had<00:02:19.110> met<00:02:19.320> has<00:02:19.440> mentioned

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
much more than he had met has mentioned

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.000 
much more than he had met has mentioned
in<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.070> book<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:21.480> again<00:02:22.290> it's<00:02:22.470> Steve<00:02:22.680> Burns
