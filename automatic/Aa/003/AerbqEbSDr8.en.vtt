didn't realize that my address popped up

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.990 
didn't realize that my address popped up
so<00:01:25.520> I'm<00:01:25.700> just<00:01:25.880> going<00:01:26.120> to<00:01:26.210> order<00:01:26.860> some<00:01:28.000> random

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
so I'm just going to order some random

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.810 
so I'm just going to order some random
ones<00:01:29.230> but<00:01:30.230> these<00:01:30.410> are<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.680> 228<00:01:31.190> so<00:01:31.460> everyone

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
ones but these are the 228 so everyone

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.130

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
you order make sure it says 500 because

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.360
