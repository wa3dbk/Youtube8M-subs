 for adults only boys and girls 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.200
 Hi, I am Ruslan Usachev and today how 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.029
 see I am on the set of the new 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.440
 release it is time to throw because of him could not 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.790
 go to los angeles for the largest 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.350
 game fair and 3 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.030
 but I had the opportunity to give a number 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.129
 questions of developers of the largest 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.480
 interesting gaming innovations I did not want 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.860
 lose that opportunity therefore decided 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.690
 get settled v-shaped interactive 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.580
 interview your vkontakte group here in 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.619
 This I collected your questions 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.600
 developers and today show 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.310
 proper answers to them first to your 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.880
 questions will be answered by the screenwriter new 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.269
 parts assassin's creed 4 black flag 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.269
 my name is 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.470
 Nikita Ivanov are not interested in them 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.340
 develop each year a new part 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.170
 assassin's creed 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.030
 we are absolutely not tired of releasing 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.059
 assassin's creed annually as ours 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.100
 teams lining on the game is the second I'm 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.640
 started researching script writing and 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.550
 still around August September 2011 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.860
 so I washed but pleased with the work on 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.210
 this game and I'm absolutely not tired of 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.130
 annually in assassin's creed 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.960
 after such a statement I really 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.710
 I wonder how much they have now 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.090
 additionally in development is 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.530
 clean assassin's creed about which we 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.520
 do not yet know Timur Pakhomov 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.380
 wondered what actually happened 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.720
 assassin's creed 3 main character 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.220
 to the Indians Conor we have a ban on 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.479
 any discussion of future parts 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.100
 assassin's creed so we can 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.140
 talk only about what the development 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.750
 we have already told part of the family history 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.910
 and you makvin and sang your hands now it's lousy 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.920
 the past to tell about edward so 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.740
 that after passing suck creed 3 4 u 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.180
 will you all be from the family and bye 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.920
 background someone and but I found to do 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.570
 morning repair is often the case 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.280
 Alexander Kryuchkov asks too 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.420
 actually will be a composer new 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.610
 assassin's creed parts 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.979
 we are just about to see who 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.090
 the composer of the game right at that moment like me 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.920
 we say this already him but I will not yet 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.420
 not really straight at the finals my 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.069
 personal question once developer 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.289
 still from yubisoft maybe he knows 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:07.399
 when penguins finally come out vol 2 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:09.740
 through the concept there is a real he here 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.789
 general ego makes all these rumors 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.580
 screenshots 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.170
 I have absolutely no idea at the exhibition besides 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.640
 continuation of various already known 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.569
 projects were announced some 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.099
 new games for example 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.099
 racing simulator closed 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.160
 konstantin you havanis interested in what 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.020
 actually a new race will try 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.850
 stands out from a number of other racing 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.110
 projects and there will be gameplay 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.480
 innovations that will do it 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.390
 we have a lot of interesting innovations 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.680
 in the game so it is a very difficult question 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.630
 last five years we have been working on 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.780
 technology that would allow us 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.390
 create this vast world from the us in 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.350
 the second is the social component 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.790
 thanks to new consoles 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.400
 we can now connect to the game 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.080
 much more players from around the world then 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.710
 Does the end of the last table corners 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.650
 this machine we have hundreds of combinations 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.240
 cars and incorporate this into one game 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.940
 that is, not just the cars themselves 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.330
 various combinations of modifications 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.950
 it was a very difficult task personally i'm not 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.540
 a big fan of racing on it will be possible 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.400
 collect actually do not know Batmobile 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.900
 gave screw only for nikolay 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.850
 kovacevic wondered whether it would be possible 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.440
 for the hook to move freely throughout the world 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.910
 there is this open game world and not 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.100
 specified by the developers of the route 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.810
 judging by the smoke on the video that show 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.220
 announced the game could practically 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.890
 anywhere at least one year in another 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.620
 move this open world and you can 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.320
 go anywhere and not only on the roads 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.820
 break through the fence go forest 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.560
 or to the beach wherever you want 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.570
 you choose from new york to 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.730
 los angeles it only takes a couple 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.739
 hours just try but considering 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.170
 all those focus on passing with 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.970
 all friends, they are easier to race on 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.900
 how much will it be boring to play it if u 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.489
 you have no friends 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.560
 with actually twisted one 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.130
 play and be sure to constantly play with 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.489
 friends 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.500
 it fits perfectly to your style 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.680
 do you want to play it yourself 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.110
 with you one friend they added three too 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.380
 don't give or choose any of 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.810
 unfamiliar players will be a lot about too 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.940
 new friends are generally good but me personally 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.310
 Interested knows chalk when will bien 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.319
 gudanov forehead 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.380
 I'm sorry, I do not know 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.269
 not asking this all questions on 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.039
 today is the second part with the developers 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.630
 two other games will be in a few 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.210
 days ruslan usachev was with you 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.330
 subscribe to the good luck channel too 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.580
 it's dangerous to even talk about it 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.960
 I will have to kill you all now and 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.960
