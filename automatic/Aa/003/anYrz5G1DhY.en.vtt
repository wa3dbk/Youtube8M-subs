00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
matte innocence and this I would say is

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.440 
matte innocence and this I would say is
kind<00:01:53.930> of<00:01:53.990> like<00:01:54.229> a<00:01:54.259> light<00:01:54.710> brown<00:01:55.220> I<00:01:55.670> would

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
kind of like a light brown I would

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.749 
kind of like a light brown I would
definitely<00:01:56.840> say<00:01:57.110> this<00:01:57.350> has<00:01:57.590> like<00:01:58.070> a<00:01:58.340> gray

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
definitely say this has like a gray

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.300 
definitely say this has like a gray
undertone<00:01:59.540> which<00:01:59.900> is<00:02:00.049> very<00:02:00.320> in<00:02:00.590> at<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:00.920> moment

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
undertone which is very in at the moment

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.390 
undertone which is very in at the moment
I<00:02:01.520> actually<00:02:02.439> kind<00:02:03.439> of<00:02:03.500> like<00:02:03.680> it<00:02:03.860> it's<00:02:04.040> a<00:02:04.130> little

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
I actually kind of like it it's a little

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.010 
I actually kind of like it it's a little
different<00:02:04.909> I<00:02:05.060> don't<00:02:05.299> wear<00:02:05.509> these<00:02:05.720> type<00:02:05.990> of

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
different I don't wear these type of

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.499 
different I don't wear these type of
colors<00:02:06.170> but<00:02:06.710> I'm<00:02:07.579> actually<00:02:07.729> kind<00:02:08.119> of<00:02:08.149> liking

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
colors but I'm actually kind of liking

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.190 
colors but I'm actually kind of liking
it<00:02:09.549> with<00:02:10.549> like<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:10.729> brown<00:02:11.090> eyeshadow<00:02:11.510> I<00:02:11.900> think

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
it with like a brown eyeshadow I think

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.540 
it with like a brown eyeshadow I think
would<00:02:12.319> look<00:02:12.470> like<00:02:12.739> a<00:02:12.799> darker<00:02:13.250> brown<00:02:13.430> eyeshadow

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
would look like a darker brown eyeshadow

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.760 
would look like a darker brown eyeshadow
