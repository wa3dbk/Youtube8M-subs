00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 instead of the centrifuge will be installed 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.750
 such a cap 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.809
 he was pulled by a turner according to my drawing 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.630
 made here about. outside under 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.360
 oil scraper just this butter ring 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.980
 it is oil resistant 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.529
 slightly smaller than the diameter of the other not 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.039
 found but with preload already checked it 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.680
 just bursting it becomes tight and 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.840
 inside one more such ring 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.149
 inside to spout crankshaft and how 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:38.100
 seal so inside she stands this 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:44.730
 cap also dragged her to weigh it 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:48.600
 we are with the rings let month 92 grams 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.520
 for comparison the standard centrifuge here 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.000
 this flank 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:58.309
 we weigh 500 33 grams that is hands 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.469
 on the flywheel I want to ease and how are you weighty 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.790
 cap instead of centrifuges I installed 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.220
 and fixed it so self-made 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:12.150
 the lock washer made two holes along 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.670
 the edges there are enough metal 2 bend 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.880
 and it was just a cube originally from 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.189
 metal i bent off the edge all here on 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.040
 sealant planted a ring about which 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.810
 spoke down him raspedlo on even a little bit 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.869
 you are okay, but we have everything 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.880
 tightly pressed tight too sealant 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.180
 thin thin layer on both sides 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.770
 missed tightened everything here we tight 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.510
 sits on the bows were given in for repair 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.820
 replacing the guide on the VAZ bit 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:49.100
 I had to redo them as I was told 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:52.430
 those who repaired and plus here at 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.450
 refinement here looked in each head 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:01.310
 over the hole here at the bottom of us 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:08.060
 standing here like this down the hole here 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:12.740
 there is a thread in my m16 step and a half I 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.230
 I do not remember and will study there 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.020
 Here is a fitting 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.240
 here we are just screwed revived in 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.930
 he will have such a bolt 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:27.970
 two copper washers will be with a hole this 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.260
 bolt I twisted together with these tubes with 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.520
 automatic transmission of some kind 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.520
 car disassembly 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.680
 the tube will be put here cuddle 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:47.660
 bolt upwards from it will already be 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.489
 then we have watering either specifically filing 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.350
 Generally so that they get better at us 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.239
 rocker but also the heat was locked from 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.070
 heads 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.810
 we will also have a supply of oil here 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.140
 through the usual brake tube 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.910
 through fitting and which parents are here on 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.209
 will be studied under study 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:11.830
 further on send com 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:14.200
 valve priter laid course after 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.380
 repair i don't trust them anyway i 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:23.450
 valve itself then attack still priter 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:27.430
 basically polished well and still here 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.890
 I found out such nuance I am going to put 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:35.380
 8-hand springs for them found 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.380
 factory plates and 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.090
 I found crackers 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.450
 eight he has when 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:49.530
 that when you try on the valve low - key 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.970
 our stick is not bad sitting and I think 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.739
 take the usual difficult just 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.989
 drag the diameter of the landing under 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.459
 spring and it will be tight 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.750
 fix but put the bottom washers 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.940
 factory 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.580
 such here from the eight but with them too 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.630
 there is a nuance they have holes 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:16.440
 as the direct were pressed 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:18.299
 taller than normal burn from slot 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.109
 under the snap ring was made below 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.669
 here there is, respectively, and the diameter there 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.979
 he has more below 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.100
 we have a little ring here sits down this place 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:32.100
 where it should stand they do not go 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:34.530
 the ring we have his knee need somehow or 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.389
 squander it or it was necessary to advance them 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:42.810
 while what else do you need to brain 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:44.820
 to plant lower so the pusher were 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:50.030
 replaced by the Urals 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:53.550
 they are only standard and to install 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.530
 just need to drag them with her 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.070
 aluminum housing to the desired diameter 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.050
 what we have here Dnieper but still 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.780
 such a nuance 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:08.160
 front shoulder had to shorten what 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:10.700
 if you put it just flowing bead 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.280
 strongly forward bulges and it interferes 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:17.700
 gum here this sealing there 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:21.390
 it rests on does not interfere ie need 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:25.760
 shorten it somewhere two or three 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:28.380
 millimeter right now I have them above 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.560
 what sleep is this standard 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.560
 pusher 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:38.600
 we weigh seventy one grams and here 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:42.500
 this one this one weighs 54 grams 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:45.650
 he is a lion we will be heated by only one 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:49.370
 work here is done about. 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:52.340
 along the milling machine did not go just 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.620
 grinder machined at all and made a couple 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.020
 hole so that when vertical 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.120
 only install oil vapors 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.320
 which we will understand the engine 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.000
 filed here a little and better lubricated 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.420
 surface 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.150
 nobody pusher in the standard 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.640
 the Urals, and he doesn't even have one like that 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.100
 just rubs it will still fall 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:24.320
 it will be better here and so this is the case for 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:27.140
 us here so here it becomes 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:30.890
 becomes quite deep and already 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:32.810
 rezinochki nothing will interfere here it is 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.290
 fits tightly on sealant here 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.290
 we will plant
