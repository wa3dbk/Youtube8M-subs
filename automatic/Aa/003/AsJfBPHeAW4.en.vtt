00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
you do as well as you can I guess the

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.710 
you do as well as you can I guess the
biggest<00:00:04.259> recommendation<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.390> do<00:00:06.390> as<00:00:06.540> long

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
biggest recommendation is to do as long

biggest recommendation is to do as long
as<00:00:06.870> you<00:00:06.990> can<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.470> whatever<00:00:07.620> academic<00:00:08.309> program

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
is available to you at your school the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.680 
is available to you at your school the
great<00:00:11.610> thing<00:00:11.790> about<00:00:11.849> Harvard<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.570> they

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
great thing about Harvard is that they

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.509 
great thing about Harvard is that they
look<00:00:12.900> at<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.049> entire<00:00:13.290> picture<00:00:14.070> your

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
look at the entire picture your

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.540 
look at the entire picture your
application<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:16.170> means<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:17.430> know

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
application and that means that you know

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.660 
application and that means that you know
history<00:00:17.940> doesn't<00:00:18.119> offer<00:00:18.570> AP<00:00:19.640> Calculus<00:00:20.640> BC

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
history doesn't offer AP Calculus BC

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.210 
history doesn't offer AP Calculus BC

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
then that's not really good at being

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.830 
then that's not really good at being
