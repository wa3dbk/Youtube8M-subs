 entering the bean server serves 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.290
 then connect 38 percent is connecting 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:31.590
 thought for a moment but not anyway 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.729
 all servers are on some connect 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.909
 you can't finally got to 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.549
 download display recorder now almost

 put type 2 months to try to 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.939
 discredit now we did it but 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.600
 you can activate audio and volume e 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.520
 chat and ong means that you can talk 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.219
 with the others 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:03.780

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:07.259
 down under all our worlds here 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.289
 now it doesn't go because it should go 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.620
 under 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:15.250
 where it takes it goes under my should 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.319
 be a world with blue writing 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.989
 only that this does not go why not 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:25.109
 it's for 0.7 when I think so. 4.7.0 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.920
 maybe that's why it doesn't work 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:32.400
