Reverb<00:00:50.809> reissues<00:00:51.649> that<00:00:51.889> right<00:00:52.100> 68<00:00:53.030> 68<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.079> I

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:54.319 
Reverb reissues that right 68 68 so I

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:59.349 
Reverb reissues that right 68 68 so I
was<00:00:55.159> only<00:00:55.339> off<00:00:55.489> by<00:00:55.519> half<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:55.940> decade<00:00:58.359> silver

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359

so<00:01:04.010> that's<00:01:04.190> one<00:01:04.339> of<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:04.460> reasons<00:01:04.729> I<00:01:04.790> picked<00:01:05.089> it

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
so that's one of the reasons I picked it

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.280
