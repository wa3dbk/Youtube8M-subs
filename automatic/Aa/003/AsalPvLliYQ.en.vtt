00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
opinion that comic like I said this is

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.050 
opinion that comic like I said this is
where<00:04:10.920> in<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.160> second<00:04:11.460> issue<00:04:11.520> this<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:11.880> where

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
where in the second issue this is where

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.090 
where in the second issue this is where
it<00:04:12.150> gets<00:04:12.240> some<00:04:12.600> more<00:04:13.110> to<00:04:13.260> read<00:04:13.410> about<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.890> feels

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
it gets some more to read about it feels

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.349 
it gets some more to read about it feels
like<00:04:14.220> predator<00:04:14.610> 2<00:04:14.850> and<00:04:16.910> like<00:04:17.910> I<00:04:18.030> said<00:04:18.180> it's

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
like predator 2 and like I said it's

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.610 
like predator 2 and like I said it's
probably<00:04:18.480> even<00:04:18.960> though<00:04:19.140> it<00:04:19.200> doesn't<00:04:19.290> have<00:04:19.560> a

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
probably even though it doesn't have a

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.860 
probably even though it doesn't have a
lot<00:04:19.770> of<00:04:19.799> Batman<00:04:20.250> vs<00:04:20.609> predator<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.420> does<00:04:21.630> have

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
lot of Batman vs predator it does have

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.490 
lot of Batman vs predator it does have
that<00:04:22.020> element<00:04:22.380> of<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:23.270> prior<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.870> it's<00:04:25.260> just

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
that element of a prior to and it's just
