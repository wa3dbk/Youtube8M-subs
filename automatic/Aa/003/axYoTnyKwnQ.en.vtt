in a three-year development cycle like
this<00:00:52.000> we<00:00:52.450> probably<00:00:52.690> spend<00:00:53.230> almost<00:00:53.650> a<00:00:54.010> year<00:00:54.220> of

this we probably spend almost a year of
pre-production<00:00:54.700> and<00:00:55.180> then<00:00:55.690> it's<00:00:55.870> basically

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
pre-production and then it's basically

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.560 
pre-production and then it's basically
two<00:00:56.560> years<00:00:56.830> of<00:00:56.980> production<00:00:57.310> and<00:00:57.700> two<00:00:58.210> weeks<00:00:58.420> of

two years of production and two weeks of

more<00:01:55.270> time<00:01:55.540> eventually<00:01:56.200> they<00:01:56.440> just<00:01:56.470> drag<00:01:56.770> us

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
more time eventually they just drag us

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.080 
more time eventually they just drag us
away<00:01:56.979> from<00:01:57.100> our<00:01:57.280> desks<00:01:57.640> kicking<00:01:58.000> and

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
away from our desks kicking and

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.330 
away from our desks kicking and
screaming<00:02:00.600> well<00:02:01.600> we've<00:02:01.750> had<00:02:01.900> a<00:02:02.530> tool<00:02:02.920> in<00:02:03.250> our

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
screaming well we've had a tool in our

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.340 
screaming well we've had a tool in our
tool<00:02:03.670> belt<00:02:03.970> for<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.270> long<00:02:04.479> time<00:02:04.720> we<00:02:04.990> call<00:02:05.170> it<00:02:05.260> the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
tool belt for a long time we call it the

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.990 
tool belt for a long time we call it the
stripy<00:02:05.650> room<00:02:06.010> and<00:02:06.220> it's<00:02:06.340> evolved<00:02:06.790> over<00:02:06.850> the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
stripy room and it's evolved over the

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.300 
stripy room and it's evolved over the
years<00:02:07.120> and<00:02:07.659> now<00:02:08.140> it's<00:02:08.350> just<00:02:08.410> this<00:02:08.649> really<00:02:08.950> long

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
years and now it's just this really long

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.640 
years and now it's just this really long
corridor<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:10.209> has<00:02:10.420> every<00:02:11.110> single<00:02:11.140> material

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
corridor that has every single material

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.520 
corridor that has every single material
type<00:02:12.370> that's<00:02:12.700> used<00:02:12.910> in<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.180> game<00:02:13.360> so<00:02:14.320> we<00:02:14.500> can

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
type that's used in the game so we can

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.070 
type that's used in the game so we can
drop<00:02:14.860> every<00:02:15.160> character<00:02:15.640> vehicle<00:02:16.090> weapon<00:02:16.540> test

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
drop every character vehicle weapon test

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.560 
drop every character vehicle weapon test

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
reach there was absolutely nothing that

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.780 
reach there was absolutely nothing that
we<00:04:27.960> weren't<00:04:28.139> gonna<00:04:28.320> touch<00:04:28.650> everything<00:04:29.400> got

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
we weren't gonna touch everything got

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.750 
we weren't gonna touch everything got
either<00:04:30.060> reworked<00:04:30.990> from<00:04:31.199> the<00:04:31.380> ground<00:04:31.620> up<00:04:31.889> or<00:04:32.130> if

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
either reworked from the ground up or if

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.430 
either reworked from the ground up or if
we<00:04:33.000> started<00:04:33.690> with<00:04:33.720> something<00:04:34.199> that<00:04:34.320> we

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
we started with something that we

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.719 
we started with something that we
thought<00:04:34.650> was<00:04:34.830> working<00:04:35.190> pretty<00:04:35.310> well<00:04:35.430> in<00:04:35.639> the

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
thought was working pretty well in the

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.939 
thought was working pretty well in the
past<00:04:35.970> we<00:04:36.540> would<00:04:36.660> build<00:04:36.840> on<00:04:37.110> it<00:04:37.320> we<00:04:37.590> really<00:04:37.800> need

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
past we would build on it we really need

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:39.379 
past we would build on it we really need
to<00:04:38.040> feel<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.280> sense<00:04:38.490> of<00:04:38.580> danger<00:04:38.820> throughout

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389

revisiting<00:06:06.470> the<00:06:06.710> the<00:06:07.070> themes<00:06:07.370> that<00:06:07.610> I<00:06:07.700> had

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
revisiting the the themes that I had

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.120 
revisiting the the themes that I had
used<00:06:08.150> for<00:06:08.510> the<00:06:08.600> the<00:06:08.870> trilogy<00:06:09.320> it<00:06:09.650> was<00:06:09.860> its<00:06:10.010> own

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.110 

I<00:06:15.320> hint<00:06:16.320> at<00:06:16.530> a<00:06:16.560> few<00:06:16.830> themes<00:06:17.130> not<00:06:17.700> like<00:06:17.940> these

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
I hint at a few themes not like these

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.030 
I hint at a few themes not like these
are<00:06:18.330> the<00:06:18.690> beginnings<00:06:19.230> of<00:06:19.350> these<00:06:19.530> things<00:06:19.830> that

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
are the beginnings of these things that

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.160 
are the beginnings of these things that
get<00:06:20.190> more<00:06:20.370> blown<00:06:20.730> out<00:06:20.940> later<00:06:21.210> on<00:06:21.300> but<00:06:21.900> it's

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.170 
get more blown out later on but it's

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.020 
get more blown out later on but it's

stuff<00:06:53.930> is<00:06:54.020> easy<00:06:54.199> games<00:06:54.830> definitely<00:06:55.220> have<00:06:55.340> a

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400 
stuff is easy games definitely have a

it's<00:07:03.620> probably<00:07:04.009> one<00:07:04.160> of<00:07:04.190> the<00:07:04.310> most<00:07:04.430> complex

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.150 
it's probably one of the most complex

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.360 
it's probably one of the most complex
things<00:07:05.479> I've<00:07:05.750> ever<00:07:05.780> worked<00:07:06.199> on<00:07:06.470> it<00:07:06.800> is<00:07:07.039> really

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370 
things I've ever worked on it is really

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.610 
things I've ever worked on it is really
like<00:07:07.550> a<00:07:07.580> giant<00:07:08.240> jigsaw<00:07:08.599> puzzle<00:07:09.080> and<00:07:09.169> just

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620 
like a giant jigsaw puzzle and just

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.990 
like a giant jigsaw puzzle and just
organizing<00:07:10.039> all<00:07:10.250> the<00:07:10.370> pieces<00:07:10.550> and<00:07:10.910> then

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 
organizing all the pieces and then

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.820 
organizing all the pieces and then
seeing<00:07:11.660> them<00:07:11.780> all<00:07:11.960> come<00:07:12.169> together<00:07:12.349> at<00:07:12.680> the<00:07:12.800> end

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:12.830 
seeing them all come together at the end

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.339 
seeing them all come together at the end
is<00:07:13.220> really<00:07:13.550> satisfying<00:07:13.910> and<00:07:14.509> it's<00:07:15.199> just

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:15.349 
is really satisfying and it's just

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:17.770 
is really satisfying and it's just
making<00:07:15.639> audio<00:07:16.639> and<00:07:16.970> entertainment<00:07:17.569> in<00:07:17.690> a
