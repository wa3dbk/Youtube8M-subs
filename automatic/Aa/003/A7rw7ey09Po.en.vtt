00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.719
 about planetary transits by 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.850
 start as we know the natal chart is 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.030
 constituted of the planets that are 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.150
 find at the time of birth 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:23.150
 hence a static image is a 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.220
 fixed image and in fact we see the 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.590
 planets in blue that are fixed 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.080
 and at the same time we see the planets in 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.379
 move those planets in motion 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.079
 they are the planets of the present moment 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:38.510
 are the planets in transit obviously 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.179
 what stands out is the moon seems that 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.489
 run for the speed that goes 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:45.769
 in comparison to the other planets 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.629
 after the sun mercury venus always 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:51.769
 move in block mercury does not separate 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.280
 more than 28 degrees from the sun venus of 48 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:58.309
 degrees so they are always found 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.800
 we also see each other 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.839
 retrograde movements are not always 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.720
 planets advance but also 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.610
 they can even back away except the sun and 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.020
 the moon if we observe the sun and the moon 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.170
 they always go 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.539
 direct can not retrograde and then 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.729
 the aspects that are forming the 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:20.350
 planets obviously we have to see the 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.049
 different colors there are tensions 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.150
 that obviously influence in a way 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:31.240
 negative and generate certain difficulties 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.799
 to integrate the planetary and 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.460
 then obviously there are also the 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:39.250
 harmonious aspects that favor the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.409
 energy of the planets involved in 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.920
 question and so that way we go 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:48.460
 studying planetary transits 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.490
 seeing each what aspects they form with 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.670
 others at this time if we observe 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.190
 we see a pluton in transit that is 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.090
 static it's no wonder that pluton 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.640
 It takes 250 years to go around the 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.340
 zodiac while the moon only 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.569
 it takes 28 days so there's no 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.840
 conceptual difference pretty 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.690
 meaningful 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.080
 Pluto in transit forms a square 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.730
 with uranium that's going to be an aspect 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.670
 generational and so we are seeing 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.380
 different aspects for example we see in 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.190
 this moment in the sun 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.750
 that is approaching the same sun like this 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.430
 that there is a conjunction the sun 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.070
 to the sun that is the moment of 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.500
 solar revolution when one birthday 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.940
 there is mercury also in a way aspect 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.940
 to the sun finally venus 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.030
 and so on we are seeing the 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.670
 movement always the moon 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.950
 is the one that stands out the most 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.190
 touching all the points of the letter 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.989
 natal again and again so an aspect 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:01.300
 of the moon is not as significant as 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.209
 as the aspect that can form a 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.120
 transpersonal planet if pluton by 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.910
 transits form an aspect with some 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.510
 our home planet that transit 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.489
 planetary will last years the moon 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.530
 obviously with its fast travel it's 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.920
 little significant its transit 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.630
 planetary should be taken more than anything the 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.810
 present moment of the moon towards the 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.000
 full waning moon or if we are in a 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.860
 new and there if we can say that it is 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.480
 strongly significant its influence 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.610
 so we are observing the planets 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.580
 we can know the times jupiter takes 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:44.080
 one year in changing sign for transit 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.820
 sat one or two and a half years mercury 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.030
 just like venus and the sun go 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.880
 touring the zodiac the sun 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.670
 it takes only one month in fact 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:59.020
 I change one sign to another after the 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:02.200
 planet pluton 250 years to turn around 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.710
 to the zodiac in the case of neptune which is 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.830
 the second slowest planet 14 years in 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:12.190
 change sign the case of uranus is 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:15.610
 seven years per sign for 2011 they will 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.340
 there are significant changes now it's not going 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:22.450
 to move to the sign of Aries in a way 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.260
 Ultimately like leaves neptune 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.930
 aquarium to pass to the pisces sign 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.030
 so we watch the transits 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.270
 planetaries that are forming the 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.510
 different planets and in that way we see 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.520
 how the stars influence for 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.090
 our present moment and obviously 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.250
 know how to manage that energy 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.950
 What collection is to take and also from what 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.630
 way to get the most out of 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.100
 all this luck in 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.100
 cosmic guide
