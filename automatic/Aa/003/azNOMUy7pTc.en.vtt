00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
so that you're protecting the wood as

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.009 
so that you're protecting the wood as
best<00:03:22.330> you<00:03:22.540> can

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
best you can

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.479 
best you can
this<00:03:23.320> is<00:03:23.470> going<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.650> take<00:03:23.830> about<00:03:24.040> two<00:03:24.280> coats

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
this is going to take about two coats

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.759 
this is going to take about two coats
let<00:03:25.060> it<00:03:25.180> dry<00:03:25.360> thoroughly<00:03:25.420> between<00:03:26.230> each<00:03:26.410> coat

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
let it dry thoroughly between each coat

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.759 
let it dry thoroughly between each coat
and<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.670> best<00:03:27.880> easiest<00:03:28.540> way<00:03:28.720> I<00:03:28.750> found<00:03:29.080> to<00:03:29.560> let

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
and the best easiest way I found to let

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.979 
and the best easiest way I found to let
this<00:03:30.040> dry<00:03:30.310> is<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.940> fill<00:03:31.120> a<00:03:31.150> small<00:03:31.630> container

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
this dry is to fill a small container

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.440 
this dry is to fill a small container
with<00:03:32.260> sand<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.830> then<00:03:33.090> just<00:03:34.090> push<00:03:34.269> it<00:03:34.420> right

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
with sand and then just push it right

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.300 
with sand and then just push it right
down<00:03:34.600> into<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.200> sand

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
down into the sand

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.759 
down into the sand
okay<00:03:38.459> so<00:03:38.879> once<00:03:39.090> your<00:03:39.329> two<00:03:39.930> coats<00:03:40.260> have<00:03:40.500> dried

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
okay so once your two coats have dried

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.759 
okay so once your two coats have dried
thoroughly<00:03:41.069> it's<00:03:42.030> now<00:03:42.209> time<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.569> write<00:03:43.230> on<00:03:43.439> our

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
thoroughly it's now time to write on our

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.750 
thoroughly it's now time to write on our
garden<00:03:44.189> tag<00:03:45.230> I'm<00:03:46.230> gonna<00:03:46.379> take<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.920> sharpie<00:03:47.519> in

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
garden tag I'm gonna take the sharpie in

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.750 
garden tag I'm gonna take the sharpie in
the<00:03:48.030> nice<00:03:48.209> contrasting<00:03:49.049> color<00:03:49.549> make<00:03:50.549> sure<00:03:50.730> our

surface<00:03:51.299> doesn't<00:03:51.689> have<00:03:51.840> anything<00:03:52.140> on<00:03:52.470> it

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.230 

and<00:04:00.100> then<00:04:00.250> just<00:04:00.460> write<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.820> name<00:04:01.000> of<00:04:01.030> the

like so let that dry for a few minutes

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.530 
like so let that dry for a few minutes
the<00:04:14.320> next<00:04:14.620> step<00:04:14.800> is<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.340> protect<00:04:15.760> this<00:04:16.000> from

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
the next step is to protect this from

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.820 
the next step is to protect this from
weathering<00:04:16.870> with<00:04:17.200> some<00:04:17.440> wipe-on<00:04:17.770> poly

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
weathering with some wipe-on poly

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.220 
weathering with some wipe-on poly
urethane<00:04:18.610> and<00:04:18.850> if<00:04:19.450> you're<00:04:19.600> not<00:04:19.750> familiar<00:04:19.959> with

again<00:04:31.240> make<00:04:31.450> sure<00:04:31.480> that<00:04:31.810> you're<00:04:31.960> getting<00:04:32.140> it

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
again make sure that you're getting it

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.650 
again make sure that you're getting it
underneath<00:04:33.190> as<00:04:33.610> best<00:04:34.210> you<00:04:34.390> can

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
underneath as best you can

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.420

where<00:04:34.930> it's<00:04:35.050> attached<00:04:35.410> you<00:04:36.010> just<00:04:36.190> want<00:04:36.370> to

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
where it's attached you just want to

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.220 
where it's attached you just want to
protect<00:04:36.760> it<00:04:36.940> from<00:04:36.970> weathering<00:04:37.420> so<00:04:37.750> these<00:04:37.990> last

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
protect it from weathering so these last

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.320 
protect it from weathering so these last
a<00:04:38.470> good<00:04:38.650> long<00:04:38.800> time<00:04:39.070> and<00:04:39.460> notice<00:04:40.090> that<00:04:40.210> we're

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
a good long time and notice that we're

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.880 
a good long time and notice that we're
really<00:04:40.450> going<00:04:40.780> down<00:04:40.960> two-thirds<00:04:41.530> of<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.770> way

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
really going down two-thirds of the way

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.980 
really going down two-thirds of the way
that's<00:04:42.310> fine<00:04:42.880> because<00:04:43.210> we're<00:04:43.570> going<00:04:43.690> to<00:04:43.750> dip

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
that's fine because we're going to dip

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.490 
that's fine because we're going to dip
the<00:04:44.200> end<00:04:44.410> in<00:04:45.150> this<00:04:46.150> stuff<00:04:46.480> because<00:04:47.230> this<00:04:47.380> is

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
the end in this stuff because this is

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.350 
the end in this stuff because this is
going<00:04:47.650> to<00:04:47.710> go<00:04:47.830> in<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.070> soil<00:04:48.400> and<00:04:48.700> we<00:04:49.120> want<00:04:49.300> to

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
going to go in the soil and we want to

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.940 
going to go in the soil and we want to
make<00:04:49.480> sure<00:04:49.510> that<00:04:49.870> it's<00:04:50.050> protected<00:04:50.620> from<00:04:50.650> the

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
make sure that it's protected from the

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.010 
make sure that it's protected from the
soil<00:04:51.250> so<00:04:51.760> that<00:04:51.880> it<00:04:51.970> doesn't<00:04:52.300> rot<00:04:52.390> the<00:04:52.600> wood<00:04:52.780> and

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
soil so that it doesn't rot the wood and

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.440 
soil so that it doesn't rot the wood and
that's<00:04:53.260> what<00:04:53.500> this<00:04:53.620> is<00:04:53.770> going<00:04:53.950> to<00:04:54.010> accomplish

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:19.140 
the tag down like this so that that can

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.490 
the tag down like this so that that can
dry<00:07:19.440> and<00:07:20.190> this<00:07:21.150> is<00:07:21.300> going<00:07:21.570> to<00:07:21.720> take<00:07:21.990> I<00:07:22.290> would

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 
dry and this is going to take I would
