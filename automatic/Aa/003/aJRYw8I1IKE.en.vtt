because I know most of you don't like

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.660 
because I know most of you don't like
really<00:00:30.849> long<00:00:31.000> videos<00:00:31.360> so<00:00:31.660> let<00:00:31.810> me<00:00:32.610> start<00:00:33.610> with

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
really long videos so let me start with

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.430 
really long videos so let me start with
my<00:00:34.180> thinner<00:00:34.860> I'm<00:00:35.860> actually<00:00:36.070> using<00:00:36.399> Windex

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
my thinner I'm actually using Windex

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.020 
my thinner I'm actually using Windex
this<00:00:38.440> is<00:00:38.560> the<00:00:38.680> blue<00:00:38.860> stuff<00:00:39.160> and<00:00:39.430> what<00:00:39.940> I've

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
this is the blue stuff and what I've

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.320 
this is the blue stuff and what I've
done<00:00:40.239> is<00:00:40.570> I've<00:00:41.020> filled<00:00:41.530> my<00:00:42.100> airbrush<00:00:42.970> Cup<00:00:43.650> with

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
done is I've filled my airbrush Cup with

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.780 
done is I've filled my airbrush Cup with
about<00:00:46.330> 3/4<00:00:47.110> or<00:00:47.380> half<00:00:47.860> of<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:48.280> amount<00:00:48.490> that<00:00:48.670> I

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
about 3/4 or half of the amount that I

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.040 
about 3/4 or half of the amount that I
actually<00:00:48.970> think<00:00:49.240> I'm<00:00:49.390> going<00:00:49.570> to<00:00:49.600> want<00:00:49.840> in

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
actually think I'm going to want in

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.580 
actually think I'm going to want in
terms<00:00:50.320> of<00:00:50.500> liquid<00:00:51.450> and<00:00:52.450> I<00:00:52.840> use<00:00:52.990> the<00:00:53.170> cup<00:00:53.320> to<00:00:53.470> do

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
terms of liquid and I use the cup to do

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.550 
terms of liquid and I use the cup to do
that<00:00:53.770> so<00:00:54.010> I<00:00:54.040> get<00:00:54.220> a<00:00:54.250> good<00:00:54.490> eyeball<00:00:54.850> measurement

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
that so I get a good eyeball measurement

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.380 
that so I get a good eyeball measurement
and<00:00:56.560> I'm<00:00:56.680> going<00:00:56.830> to<00:00:56.860> put<00:00:57.010> that<00:00:57.190> in<00:00:57.610> here<00:00:57.670> yes

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
and I'm going to put that in here yes

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.930 
and I'm going to put that in here yes
there<00:00:58.690> is<00:00:58.840> a<00:00:58.870> little<00:00:59.170> blue<00:00:59.410> tint<00:00:59.980> to<00:01:00.400> that<00:01:00.640> but

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
there is a little blue tint to that but

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.120 
there is a little blue tint to that but
it's<00:01:01.060> not<00:01:01.240> going<00:01:01.390> to<00:01:01.450> really<00:01:01.600> affect<00:01:02.130> the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
it's not going to really affect the

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.679 
it's not going to really affect the
paint<00:01:03.430> at<00:01:03.579> all<00:01:03.700> so<00:01:04.449> I'm<00:01:04.629> using<00:01:04.869> a<00:01:06.420> vomit<00:01:07.420> Brown

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
paint at all so I'm using a vomit Brown

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.570 
paint at all so I'm using a vomit Brown
and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.640 

I'm<00:01:12.580> going<00:01:13.000> to<00:01:14.520> get<00:01:15.520> some<00:01:15.760> paint<00:01:16.060> with<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:16.780> brush

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
I'm going to get some paint with a brush

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.390 
I'm going to get some paint with a brush
and<00:01:18.740> start<00:01:19.520> mixing<00:01:19.850> it<00:01:20.270> in<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:20.840> cup<00:01:21.310> now<00:01:22.310> the

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
and start mixing it in the cup now the

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.600 
and start mixing it in the cup now the
consistency<00:01:22.820> that<00:01:23.390> I'm<00:01:23.540> going<00:01:23.870> for<00:01:23.900> I<00:01:24.520> know<00:01:25.520> a

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
consistency that I'm going for I know a

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.950 
consistency that I'm going for I know a
lot<00:01:25.730> of<00:01:25.760> people<00:01:26.000> like<00:01:26.090> to<00:01:26.180> say<00:01:26.390> milky

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
lot of people like to say milky

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.320 
lot of people like to say milky
consistency<00:01:27.160> and<00:01:28.160> that<00:01:28.190> really<00:01:28.730> means<00:01:28.940> very

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
consistency and that really means very

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.560 
consistency and that really means very
little<00:01:30.220> what<00:01:31.220> I<00:01:31.250> like<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.640> use<00:01:31.850> is<00:01:32.120> the<00:01:32.330> side<00:01:32.540> of

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
little what I like to use is the side of

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.660 
little what I like to use is the side of
the<00:01:32.840> cup<00:01:33.050> see<00:01:33.620> how<00:01:33.800> thin<00:01:34.070> that<00:01:34.100> is

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
the cup see how thin that is

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.210 
the cup see how thin that is
that's<00:01:35.570> way<00:01:35.870> too<00:01:35.930> thin<00:01:36.640> you<00:01:37.640> want<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.940> see<00:01:38.120> it

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
that's way too thin you want to see it

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.980 
that's way too thin you want to see it
you<00:01:40.220> want<00:01:40.400> to<00:01:40.460> see<00:01:40.610> some<00:01:40.850> pigment<00:01:41.300> sticking<00:01:41.840> to

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
you want to see some pigment sticking to

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.480 
you want to see some pigment sticking to
the<00:01:42.110> edge<00:01:43.570> when<00:01:44.570> it's<00:01:44.690> all<00:01:44.810> set<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:45.980> I'm<00:01:46.280> just

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
the edge when it's all set so I'm just

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.069 
the edge when it's all set so I'm just
going<00:01:46.610> to<00:01:46.700> keep<00:01:46.880> mixing<00:01:47.060> until<00:01:48.520> they<00:01:49.520> get

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
going to keep mixing until they get

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.050 
going to keep mixing until they get
the<00:01:51.590> consistency<00:01:52.219> that<00:01:52.490> I'm<00:01:52.609> looking<00:01:52.640> for

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
the consistency that I'm looking for

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.910 
the consistency that I'm looking for
still<00:01:53.420> too<00:01:53.659> thin<00:01:53.960> this<00:01:54.259> is<00:01:54.409> actually<00:01:54.770> probably

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
still too thin this is actually probably

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:16.180 
still too thin this is actually probably
going<00:01:55.189> to<00:01:55.280> take<00:01:56.799> quite<00:01:57.799> a<00:01:57.859> bit<00:01:58.009> of<00:01:58.070> paint<00:01:58.369> here

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.220 

starting<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:16.940> get<00:02:17.030> there<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.570> can<00:02:17.720> see<00:02:17.960> how

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
starting to get there you can see how

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:25.750 
starting to get there you can see how
it's<00:02:18.620> starting<00:02:18.710> to<00:02:19.130> be<00:02:19.690> thicker<00:02:20.690> on<00:02:20.990> the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:39.130 

thicker<00:02:26.300> on<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.569> sides

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.590 

getting<00:02:39.890> closer

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.410 

[Applause]

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.640 

you<00:02:50.080> start<00:02:50.319> to<00:02:50.410> see<00:02:50.560> how<00:02:50.800> it's<00:02:51.490> really<00:02:52.650> really

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
you start to see how it's really really

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.290 
you start to see how it's really really
getting<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:53.950> nice<00:02:54.099> I<00:02:54.310> would<00:02:54.430> say<00:02:54.760> this<00:02:54.970> is<00:02:55.090> more

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
getting a nice I would say this is more

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:02.040 
getting a nice I would say this is more
like<00:02:55.540> cream<00:02:56.640> than<00:02:57.640> milk

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.500 

maybe<00:03:02.620> half-and-half

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
maybe half-and-half

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.440 
maybe half-and-half
and<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:04.870> think<00:03:04.930> that's<00:03:05.739> about<00:03:05.950> God<00:03:06.790> right<00:03:07.180> there

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
and I think that's about God right there

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.270 
and I think that's about God right there
you<00:03:07.629> can<00:03:07.780> see<00:03:07.810> how<00:03:08.140> it's<00:03:08.379> actually<00:03:11.280> it's

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
you can see how it's actually it's

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.839 
you can see how it's actually it's
leaving<00:03:12.670> behind<00:03:12.819> quite<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.950> bit<00:03:15.190> of<00:03:15.310> pigment<00:03:15.489> on

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
leaving behind quite a bit of pigment on

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.820 
leaving behind quite a bit of pigment on
the<00:03:16.060> side<00:03:16.330> I'm<00:03:17.140> going<00:03:17.319> to<00:03:17.379> go<00:03:17.440> just<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:17.799> little

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
the side I'm going to go just a little

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.520 
the side I'm going to go just a little
bit<00:03:18.220> thicker<00:03:18.549> than<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:23.019> make<00:03:23.170> sure<00:03:23.379> that

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
bit thicker than that to make sure that

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
bit thicker than that to make sure that
I've<00:03:23.620> really<00:03:23.890> got<00:03:24.069> what<00:03:24.519> I'm<00:03:24.610> looking<00:03:24.910> for

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:45.630 

let's<00:03:32.700> put<00:03:32.910> this<00:03:33.060> around<00:03:34.550> there<00:03:35.570> look<00:03:36.570> at<00:03:36.630> that

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.250 

it's<00:03:46.180> still

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
it's still

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.160 
it's still
coming<00:03:48.920> off<00:03:49.069> of<00:03:49.099> the<00:03:49.400> side<00:03:49.640> a<00:03:49.670> bit<00:03:50.120> but<00:03:50.959> it<00:03:51.080> is

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
coming off of the side a bit but it is

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.619 
coming off of the side a bit but it is
leaving<00:03:51.440> pigment<00:03:52.040> behind<00:03:52.459> which<00:03:52.970> is<00:03:53.209> what<00:03:53.510> I'm

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
leaving pigment behind which is what I'm

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:58.780 
leaving pigment behind which is what I'm
looking<00:03:53.659> for<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:56.349> could<00:03:57.349> probably<00:03:57.920> go<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.370> little

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
looking for I could probably go a little

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.520 
looking for I could probably go a little
bit<00:03:58.909> thicker<00:03:59.150> than<00:03:59.390> that<00:03:59.540> and<00:03:59.810> for<00:04:00.200> this<00:04:00.319> case

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
bit thicker than that and for this case

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.809 
bit thicker than that and for this case
because<00:04:00.709> this<00:04:00.950> is<00:04:01.040> going<00:04:01.129> to<00:04:01.220> be<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.340> base<00:04:01.549> coat

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
because this is going to be a base coat

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:13.820 
because this is going to be a base coat
I<00:04:02.090> am<00:04:02.750> going<00:04:03.049> to<00:04:03.110> go<00:04:04.030> bit<00:04:05.030> thicker

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.390 

and<00:04:13.920> that<00:04:14.550> looks<00:04:14.730> perfect

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.120 

see<00:04:20.910> how<00:04:21.120> it

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
see how it

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.650 
see how it
it's<00:04:23.250> leaving<00:04:23.880> behind<00:04:24.500> a<00:04:26.360> nearly<00:04:27.360> opaque

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
it's leaving behind a nearly opaque

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.390 
it's leaving behind a nearly opaque
layer<00:04:30.660> of<00:04:30.930> paint<00:04:31.230> on<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:31.560> side<00:04:31.770> of<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.190> cup

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
layer of paint on the side of the cup

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.150 
layer of paint on the side of the cup
that<00:04:33.270> is<00:04:33.300> how<00:04:33.660> I<00:04:33.690> know<00:04:33.870> when<00:04:34.530> I'm<00:04:34.650> ready<00:04:34.860> and

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
that is how I know when I'm ready and

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.490 
that is how I know when I'm ready and
you<00:04:35.340> can<00:04:35.520> use<00:04:35.640> this<00:04:35.790> method<00:04:36.000> of<00:04:36.380> brushing<00:04:37.380> up

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
you can use this method of brushing up

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.860 
you can use this method of brushing up
the<00:04:37.620> side<00:04:37.800> of<00:04:37.830> a<00:04:38.010> clear<00:04:38.250> cup<00:04:39.830> to<00:04:40.830> really<00:04:41.130> tell

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
the side of a clear cup to really tell

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.020 
the side of a clear cup to really tell
where<00:04:42.870> your<00:04:43.170> mix<00:04:43.410> is<00:04:43.560> at<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:44.040> that<00:04:44.760> is

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
where your mix is at and that is

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.540 
where your mix is at and that is
probably<00:04:45.360> I<00:04:45.540> found<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.290> best<00:04:46.500> way<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:47.070> eyeball

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
probably I found the best way to eyeball

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.850 
probably I found the best way to eyeball
it<00:04:49.520> and<00:04:50.520> that's<00:04:51.090> it<00:04:51.330> it's<00:04:51.540> ready<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.900> go<00:04:52.050> so<00:04:52.800> I

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
it and that's it it's ready to go so I

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:01.830 
it and that's it it's ready to go so I
hope<00:04:53.190> you<00:04:53.280> found<00:04:53.400> that<00:04:53.520> useful
