because everybody was at the same level
and<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.290> thought<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.769> think<00:00:14.700> with<00:00:15.450> with<00:00:15.690> reason

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
and I thought I think with with reason

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.189 
and I thought I think with with reason
that<00:00:16.260> seven<00:00:16.650> days<00:00:16.830> in<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.609> row<00:00:17.930> real<00:00:18.930> hard

play<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.779> next<00:00:27.960> day<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.939> it's<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:31.189> could<00:00:32.189> it

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
play the next day so it's a it could it

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.450 
play the next day so it's a it could it
could<00:00:32.969> be<00:00:33.270> fatigued<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:34.380> no<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:34.829> not<00:00:35.040> and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
could be fatigued but no it's not and

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.549 
could be fatigued but no it's not and
I'm<00:00:35.610> legging<00:00:35.969> excuse<00:00:36.360> them<00:00:36.540> for<00:00:37.350> at<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
I'm legging excuse them for at the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.660 
I'm legging excuse them for at the
beginning<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> game<00:00:38.190> because<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
beginning of the game because the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.940 
beginning of the game because the
reality<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.090> if<00:00:39.960> you're<00:00:40.230> fatigued<00:00:40.649> then

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
reality is if you're fatigued then

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.100 
reality is if you're fatigued then
usually<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.399> fade<00:00:41.640> out<00:00:41.820> midway<00:00:42.809> through<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
usually you fade out midway through the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.080 
usually you fade out midway through the
midway<00:00:43.739> through<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:43.980> game<00:00:44.070> now<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
midway through the game now it's the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.029 
midway through the game now it's the
opposite<00:00:45.480> happen<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.620> means<00:00:46.800> we're

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
opposite happen so that means we're

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.950 
opposite happen so that means we're
ready<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.309> start<00:00:47.460> thinking<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.629> we're<00:00:48.809> going

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
ready to start thinking so we're going

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.540 
ready to start thinking so we're going
to<00:00:49.050> take<00:00:49.170> care<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.620> that's<00:00:50.129> something

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
to take care of that that's something

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.910 
to take care of that that's something
that's<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.940> that's<00:00:51.199> that's<00:00:52.199> been<00:00:52.440> acceptable

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
that's it that's that's been acceptable

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.799 
that's it that's that's been acceptable
to<00:00:53.160> start<00:00:53.399> like<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.030> then<00:00:54.600> we're<00:00:54.719> going

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
to start like that and then we're going

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.610 
to start like that and then we're going
to<00:00:54.870> make<00:00:54.960> sure<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.230> doesn't<00:00:55.410> happen<00:00:55.649> again

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
to make sure it doesn't happen again

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.670 
to make sure it doesn't happen again

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
from midway through to the end of the

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.469 
from midway through to the end of the
game<00:01:01.960> we<00:01:02.500> were<00:01:02.590> all<00:01:02.710> over<00:01:03.010> them<00:01:03.190> and<00:01:04.180> you<00:01:04.299> look

we're working hardly worth nursery but
it<00:01:59.800> was<00:01:59.920> like<00:02:00.069> everything<00:02:00.280> else<00:02:00.550> it<00:02:01.239> was<00:02:01.330> power

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:01.599 
it was like everything else it was power

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
just not moving our feet then we got

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.380 
just not moving our feet then we got
them<00:02:05.619> going<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.039> I<00:02:06.250> think<00:02:06.940> after<00:02:07.030> that<00:02:07.300> we

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
them going and I think after that we

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.609 
them going and I think after that we
were<00:02:07.479> starting<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.840> click<00:02:08.200> we<00:02:08.380> should<00:02:08.530> get

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
were starting to click we should get

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.000 
were starting to click we should get
some<00:02:08.830> chemistry<00:02:09.220> out<00:02:09.369> there

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.949 

I<00:02:12.099> mean<00:02:12.730> how<00:02:12.909> do<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.090> address<00:02:13.390> something<00:02:13.689> like

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
I mean how do you address something like

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.059 
I mean how do you address something like
that<00:02:14.170> though<00:02:14.290> because<00:02:14.439> it<00:02:14.620> seems<00:02:14.830> like<00:02:14.950> more

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
that though because it seems like more

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.069 
that though because it seems like more
of<00:02:15.129> a<00:02:15.220> mental<00:02:15.459> thing<00:02:15.730> that<00:02:16.209> if<00:02:16.299> not<00:02:16.480> it'sit's

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
of a mental thing that if not it'sit's

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.410 
of a mental thing that if not it'sit's
both<00:02:17.590> its<00:02:17.950> mental<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.579> physical<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.299> it's

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
both its mental and physical and it's

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.509 
both its mental and physical and it's
the<00:02:19.599> activation<00:02:20.140> before<00:02:20.470> games<00:02:20.709> you<00:02:21.220> got<00:02:21.400> to
