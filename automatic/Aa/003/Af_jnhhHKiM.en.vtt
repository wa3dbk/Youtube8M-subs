new<00:00:10.800> camera<00:00:11.190> but<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.120> current<00:00:12.780> model

new camera but it is the current model

new camera but it is the current model
it<00:00:13.259> hadn't<00:00:13.530> been<00:00:13.620> out<00:00:13.679> for<00:00:13.950> all<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.400> long<00:00:15.049> the

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
it hadn't been out for all that long the

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.930 
it hadn't been out for all that long the
reason<00:00:16.500> why<00:00:16.680> we're<00:00:17.100> taking<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.550> look<00:00:17.699> at<00:00:17.789> this

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
reason why we're taking a look at this

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.849 
reason why we're taking a look at this
one<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.300> because<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.930> actually<00:00:19.289> reached<00:00:19.619> out<00:00:19.800> to

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
one is because I actually reached out to

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.529 
one is because I actually reached out to
our<00:00:20.070> friends<00:00:20.250> at<00:00:20.520> Nikon<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.240> asked

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
our friends at Nikon and asked

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.810 
our friends at Nikon and asked
specifically<00:00:22.199> for<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.769> camera<00:00:23.310> not<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
specifically for this camera not the

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.900 
specifically for this camera not the
newer<00:00:23.970> ones<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.960> camera<00:00:25.619> because<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.550> think

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
newer ones this camera because I think

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.599 
newer ones this camera because I think
it's<00:00:27.180> probably<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.689> best<00:00:27.980> all-in-one<00:00:28.980> pocket

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
it's probably the best all-in-one pocket

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.970 
it's probably the best all-in-one pocket

changed over the years as compared to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.220 
changed over the years as compared to
the<00:01:51.480> older<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.200> maybe<00:01:52.530> slightly<00:01:53.070> taller

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
hang on to don't lose that as compared

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.110 
hang on to don't lose that as compared
to<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.460> old<00:02:02.760> one<00:02:03.000> which<00:02:03.360> had<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.110> automatic

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
the glass is a little bit bigger this

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.940

compensation<00:02:27.930> on/off<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:29.070> these<00:02:29.160> things<00:02:29.400> have

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
compensation on/off so these things have

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.740

notice that this camera also has a hot
shoe<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.560> can<00:02:34.770> put<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.690> flash<00:02:36.690> in<00:02:37.080> here

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
shoe so that you can put a flash in here

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.680 
shoe so that you can put a flash in here
which<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.250> nice<00:02:38.459> because<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:39.150> can<00:02:39.180> even<00:02:39.450> use<00:02:39.660> a

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
which is nice because you can even use a

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.500 
which is nice because you can even use a
big<00:02:40.200> full<00:02:40.770> sized<00:02:41.160> flash<00:02:41.610> like<00:02:41.940> you'd<00:02:42.120> use<00:02:42.330> on<00:02:42.450> a

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510

DSLR<00:02:43.260> now<00:02:44.190> when<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.459> take<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.640> look<00:02:44.790> at<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.000> back

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
DSLR now when we take a look at the back

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.650 
DSLR now when we take a look at the back
the<00:02:45.540> older<00:02:46.260> model<00:02:46.620> had<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.310> screen<00:02:47.910> integrated

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
the older model had a screen integrated

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.740 
the older model had a screen integrated
in<00:02:48.810> there<00:02:49.050> but<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.800> new<00:02:49.980> one<00:02:50.250> has<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:51.030> screen

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
in there but the new one has a screen

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.610 
in there but the new one has a screen
that<00:02:52.050> flips<00:02:53.040> out<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.730> swivels<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.840> does<00:02:55.440> all

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
that flips out and swivels and does all

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.500 
that flips out and swivels and does all
kinds<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.070> fancy<00:02:56.310> stuff<00:02:56.760> here<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:57.030> we<00:02:57.360> can

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
kinds of fancy stuff here so we can

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.280 
kinds of fancy stuff here so we can
leave<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.870> flat<00:02:58.050> like<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:59.030> or<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.810> can<00:03:01.019> you

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
leave it flat like that or you can you

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.050 
leave it flat like that or you can you
know<00:03:01.410> get<00:03:01.769> it<00:03:01.920> at<00:03:02.100> different<00:03:02.519> angles<00:03:02.610> which<00:03:02.910> is

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
know get it at different angles which is

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.670 
know get it at different angles which is
nice<00:03:03.239> because<00:03:03.510> let's<00:03:04.320> say<00:03:04.470> if<00:03:04.560> we<00:03:04.590> were

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
nice because let's say if we were

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.280 
nice because let's say if we were
holding<00:03:05.010> this<00:03:05.370> camera<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.630> let's<00:03:07.110> say<00:03:07.230> I

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
holding this camera and let's say I

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.620 
holding this camera and let's say I
wanted<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.590> hold<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:07.890> up<00:03:07.980> high<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.580> can<00:03:09.209> swivel

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
wanted to hold it up high I can swivel

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.320 
wanted to hold it up high I can swivel
that<00:03:09.959> angle<00:03:10.530> down<00:03:10.560> towards<00:03:11.519> me<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:11.970> can<00:03:12.120> see

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
that angle down towards me so I can see

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.890 
that angle down towards me so I can see
it<00:03:12.480> or<00:03:12.660> I<00:03:13.250> could<00:03:14.250> hold<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:14.970> low<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.269> I<00:03:15.630> can<00:03:15.810> be

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
it or I could hold it low and I can be

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.509 
it or I could hold it low and I can be
looking<00:03:16.200> right<00:03:16.380> at<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.560> so<00:03:16.830> that's<00:03:17.070> that's

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
looking right at it so that's that's

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.370 
looking right at it so that's that's
very<00:03:17.700> nice<00:03:18.090> one<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.900> other<00:03:19.019> things<00:03:19.230> I

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
very nice one of the other things I

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.170 
very nice one of the other things I
instantly<00:03:19.980> notice<00:03:20.340> just<00:03:20.489> by<00:03:20.580> grabbing<00:03:20.880> hold

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
instantly notice just by grabbing hold

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.650 
instantly notice just by grabbing hold
of<00:03:21.330> this<00:03:21.480> was<00:03:22.140> you'll<00:03:22.800> see<00:03:23.130> that<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:24.239> older

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
of this was you'll see that the older

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.160 
of this was you'll see that the older
model<00:03:25.019> had<00:03:25.380> a<00:03:25.799> little<00:03:26.400> rubberized<00:03:27.239> grip<00:03:27.870> here

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
model had a little rubberized grip here

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.920 
model had a little rubberized grip here
but<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.890> grip<00:03:29.190> is<00:03:29.370> much<00:03:29.730> more<00:03:30.030> pronounced<00:03:30.750> on

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
but the grip is much more pronounced on

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.039 
but the grip is much more pronounced on
the<00:03:30.989> new<00:03:31.680> version<00:03:32.330> which<00:03:33.330> is<00:03:33.510> nice<00:03:33.750> because

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
the new version which is nice because

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.630 
the new version which is nice because
when<00:03:34.380> I<00:03:34.410> grabbed<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.860> hold<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.130> it<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.280> mean<00:03:35.459> it

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
when I grabbed a hold of it I mean it

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.910 
when I grabbed a hold of it I mean it
feels<00:03:35.790> really<00:03:36.209> really<00:03:36.630> secure<00:03:37.440> right<00:03:37.680> there

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
feels really really secure right there

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.009 
feels really really secure right there
in<00:03:38.040> your<00:03:38.100> hand<00:03:38.400> okay<00:03:39.269> let's<00:03:39.630> see<00:03:39.750> what<00:03:39.870> else

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
in your hand okay let's see what else

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.110 
in your hand okay let's see what else
we've<00:03:40.170> got<00:03:40.410> we've<00:03:41.040> got<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.220> little<00:03:41.370> switch<00:03:41.790> back

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
we've got we've got a little switch back

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.190 
we've got we've got a little switch back
here<00:03:42.480> which<00:03:42.660> popped<00:03:42.989> up<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:44.840> flash<00:03:45.840> the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
here which popped up that flash the

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.140 
here which popped up that flash the
integrated<00:03:46.709> flash<00:03:46.980> which<00:03:47.340> these<00:03:47.640> are<00:03:47.760> not<00:03:47.910> bad

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
integrated flash which these are not bad

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.240 
integrated flash which these are not bad
but<00:03:48.209> certainly<00:03:48.959> not<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.769> equal<00:03:50.070> of<00:03:50.190> the

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
but certainly not the equal of the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.440 
but certainly not the equal of the
external<00:03:50.730> flashes<00:03:51.350> we<00:03:52.350> have

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
external flashes we have

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.619 
external flashes we have
an<00:03:53.830> HDMI<00:03:54.830> output<00:03:55.129> port<00:03:55.910> so<00:03:56.150> we<00:03:56.180> could<00:03:56.420> plug

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
an HDMI output port so we could plug

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.920 
an HDMI output port so we could plug
this<00:03:56.840> in<00:03:57.080> and<00:03:57.290> show<00:03:57.590> things<00:03:57.890> off<00:03:58.069> right<00:03:58.400> on<00:03:58.430> a

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
this in and show things off right on a

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.900 
this in and show things off right on a
TV<00:03:59.930> we've<00:04:00.440> also<00:04:00.590> got<00:04:00.890> a<00:04:00.920> little<00:04:01.129> AV<00:04:01.580> port

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
TV we've also got a little AV port

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.600 
TV we've also got a little AV port
that's<00:04:02.150> gonna<00:04:02.330> use<00:04:02.510> a<00:04:02.540> specialized<00:04:03.230> cable<00:04:03.709> on

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
that's gonna use a specialized cable on

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.300 
that's gonna use a specialized cable on
the<00:04:05.330> bottom<00:04:05.720> here<00:04:05.989> we've<00:04:06.170> got<00:04:06.349> our<00:04:06.410> battery

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
the bottom here we've got our battery

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.920 
the bottom here we've got our battery
cover<00:04:07.819> door<00:04:08.150> and<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:09.349> SD<00:04:09.920> card<00:04:10.220> goes<00:04:11.120> right<00:04:11.660> in

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
cover door and the SD card goes right in

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.120 
cover door and the SD card goes right in
there<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:13.900> what<00:04:14.900> do<00:04:15.019> we<00:04:15.080> have<00:04:15.140> on<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:15.980> other

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
there and what do we have on the other

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.849 
there and what do we have on the other
side<00:04:16.459> here<00:04:17.000> nothing<00:04:17.840> just<00:04:18.079> the<00:04:18.139> hinge<00:04:18.410> okay

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
side here nothing just the hinge okay

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.750 
side here nothing just the hinge okay
and<00:04:19.250> let's<00:04:20.150> see<00:04:20.329> Oh<00:04:20.630> a<00:04:20.750> GPS<00:04:21.680> this<00:04:22.639> is

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
and let's see Oh a GPS this is

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.940 
and let's see Oh a GPS this is
interesting<00:04:22.970> there's<00:04:23.360> a<00:04:23.419> little<00:04:23.690> GPS<00:04:23.990> port<00:04:24.710> so

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
interesting there's a little GPS port so

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.770 
interesting there's a little GPS port so
I<00:04:24.979> guess<00:04:25.190> we<00:04:25.310> can<00:04:25.430> use<00:04:25.610> an<00:04:25.760> external<00:04:26.150> GPS

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
I guess we can use an external GPS

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.440 
I guess we can use an external GPS
device<00:04:27.139> on<00:04:27.350> that<00:04:27.410> and<00:04:27.910> here<00:04:28.910> is<00:04:29.060> one<00:04:29.270> of<00:04:29.360> the

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
device on that and here is one of the

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.710 
device on that and here is one of the
biggest<00:04:29.930> reasons<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:30.800> love<00:04:31.130> this<00:04:31.520> camera<00:04:32.060> this

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
biggest reasons I love this camera this

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.629 
biggest reasons I love this camera this
is<00:04:33.020> a<00:04:33.410> microphone<00:04:34.220> input<00:04:34.930> port<00:04:35.930> so<00:04:36.770> that<00:04:37.070> means

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
is a microphone input port so that means

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.460 
is a microphone input port so that means
when<00:04:38.030> we're<00:04:38.210> shooting<00:04:38.660> video<00:04:38.960> and<00:04:39.229> if<00:04:39.350> we

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
when we're shooting video and if we

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.230 
when we're shooting video and if we
could<00:04:39.620> shoot<00:04:39.740> Full<00:04:40.040> 1080p<00:04:40.220> video<00:04:40.910> with<00:04:41.120> this

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
could shoot Full 1080p video with this

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.469 
could shoot Full 1080p video with this
thing<00:04:41.479> we<00:04:41.990> can<00:04:42.139> use<00:04:42.350> an<00:04:42.500> external<00:04:43.070> mic<00:04:43.580> now<00:04:43.940> one

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
thing we can use an external mic now one

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.870 
thing we can use an external mic now one
thing<00:04:44.720> it<00:04:44.840> doesn't<00:04:45.139> have<00:04:45.350> that<00:04:45.919> I<00:04:45.950> really

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
thing it doesn't have that I really

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.580 
thing it doesn't have that I really
really<00:04:47.360> wish<00:04:47.570> they<00:04:47.750> would<00:04:47.870> build<00:04:47.990> in<00:04:48.200> and<00:04:48.410> make

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
really wish they would build in and make

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.650 
really wish they would build in and make
it<00:04:48.620> almost<00:04:48.830> perfect<00:04:49.430> would<00:04:49.850> be<00:04:49.880> a<00:04:50.000> headphone

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
it almost perfect would be a headphone

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.920 
it almost perfect would be a headphone
jack<00:04:51.200> so<00:04:51.560> that<00:04:52.370> we<00:04:52.520> could<00:04:52.790> listen<00:04:53.389> to<00:04:53.600> the

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
jack so that we could listen to the

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.469 
jack so that we could listen to the
audio<00:04:54.290> we're<00:04:54.500> capturing<00:04:54.740> and<00:04:55.310> be<00:04:56.240> able<00:04:56.330> to

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
audio we're capturing and be able to

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.690 
audio we're capturing and be able to
adjust<00:04:56.600> the<00:04:56.960> levels<00:04:57.350> if<00:04:57.889> you<00:04:57.979> did<00:04:58.190> that<00:04:58.430> I

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
adjust the levels if you did that I

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.000 
adjust the levels if you did that I
would<00:04:59.570> basically<00:04:59.780> just<00:05:00.229> carry<00:05:00.800> this

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
would basically just carry this

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.529 
would basically just carry this
everywhere<00:05:01.430> I<00:05:01.490> went<00:05:01.729> and<00:05:02.000> never<00:05:02.330> need

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
everywhere I went and never need

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.020 
everywhere I went and never need
anything<00:05:02.780> else<00:05:03.050> okay<00:05:03.289> so<00:05:04.039> that's<00:05:04.280> an<00:05:04.460> overview

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
anything else okay so that's an overview

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.909 
anything else okay so that's an overview
of<00:05:05.240> the<00:05:05.419> body<00:05:05.630> itself<00:05:06.110> let's<00:05:06.500> look<00:05:06.680> at<00:05:06.770> what

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
of the body itself let's look at what

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.070 
of the body itself let's look at what
else<00:05:06.950> we<00:05:07.250> get<00:05:07.430> here<00:05:07.729> we're<00:05:08.570> going<00:05:08.810> to<00:05:08.930> get<00:05:09.020> a

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
else we get here we're going to get a

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.800 
else we get here we're going to get a
strap<00:05:09.650> so<00:05:09.680> that<00:05:10.070> will<00:05:10.400> attach<00:05:10.729> just<00:05:11.060> like<00:05:11.539> this

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
strap so that will attach just like this

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.150 
strap so that will attach just like this
other<00:05:12.350> one<00:05:12.590> does<00:05:12.800> I'm<00:05:13.070> sure<00:05:13.450> we<00:05:14.450> have<00:05:14.720> a

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
other one does I'm sure we have a

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.529 
other one does I'm sure we have a
charger<00:05:17.200> we<00:05:18.200> have<00:05:18.410> a<00:05:18.440> battery<00:05:18.919> and<00:05:19.490> then<00:05:20.389> we

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
charger we have a battery and then we

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.090 
charger we have a battery and then we
have<00:05:20.840> a<00:05:21.260> USB<00:05:21.860> cable<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:23.770> it<00:05:24.770> looks<00:05:24.950> like

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
have a USB cable and it looks like

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.920 
have a USB cable and it looks like
actually<00:05:25.250> the<00:05:25.490> USB<00:05:25.880> cable<00:05:26.060> plugs<00:05:26.479> into<00:05:26.720> that

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
actually the USB cable plugs into that

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.159 
actually the USB cable plugs into that
funky<00:05:27.350> little<00:05:27.380> AV<00:05:28.070> port<00:05:28.729> there<00:05:29.030> and<00:05:29.539> that's<00:05:29.960> it

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
funky little AV port there and that's it

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.580 
funky little AV port there and that's it
that's<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.680> whole<00:05:30.740> shape<00:05:31.400> match<00:05:31.669> so<00:05:32.590> next

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
that's the whole shape match so next

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.260 
that's the whole shape match so next
step<00:05:33.830> is<00:05:34.070> I'm<00:05:34.340> going<00:05:34.370> to<00:05:34.490> take<00:05:34.610> some<00:05:34.850> sample

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
step is I'm going to take some sample

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.719 
step is I'm going to take some sample
photos<00:05:35.510> and<00:05:36.080> videos<00:05:36.380> of<00:05:36.410> this<00:05:36.740> thing<00:05:36.979> and<00:05:37.280> I'll

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
photos and videos of this thing and I'll

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.400 
photos and videos of this thing and I'll
share<00:05:38.090> those<00:05:38.389> so<00:05:38.630> you<00:05:38.690> guys<00:05:38.870> can<00:05:39.050> see<00:05:39.260> what

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
share those so you guys can see what

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.159 
share those so you guys can see what
kind<00:05:39.590> of<00:05:39.620> quality<00:05:40.190> that<00:05:40.430> it<00:05:40.880> can<00:05:41.060> do<00:05:41.270> and<00:05:41.510> then

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
kind of quality that it can do and then

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.740 
kind of quality that it can do and then
we're<00:05:42.710> gonna<00:05:42.830> go<00:05:43.010> right<00:05:43.340> into<00:05:43.849> some<00:05:44.120> tutorials

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
we're gonna go right into some tutorials

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.420 
we're gonna go right into some tutorials
how<00:05:44.960> to<00:05:44.990> do<00:05:45.260> cool<00:05:45.620> stuff<00:05:45.650> with<00:05:46.130> it<00:05:46.280> because

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
how to do cool stuff with it because

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.629 
how to do cool stuff with it because
this<00:05:46.700> camera<00:05:47.180> will<00:05:47.660> do<00:05:47.840> raw<00:05:48.200> photographs<00:05:49.099> so

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
this camera will do raw photographs so

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.460 
this camera will do raw photographs so
that<00:05:49.789> means<00:05:49.970> we<00:05:50.120> can<00:05:50.270> use<00:05:50.450> it<00:05:50.630> for<00:05:50.840> bracketed

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
that means we can use it for bracketed

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.610 
that means we can use it for bracketed
shots<00:05:51.800> do<00:05:52.160> HDR<00:05:53.090> we<00:05:53.660> can<00:05:53.840> do<00:05:54.080> like<00:05:54.410> I<00:05:54.560> said

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
shots do HDR we can do like I said

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.029 
shots do HDR we can do like I said
before<00:05:54.950> 1080p<00:05:55.880> video<00:05:56.300> it<00:05:57.080> has<00:05:57.200> all<00:05:57.500> full

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
before 1080p video it has all full

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.420 
before 1080p video it has all full
manual<00:05:58.580> controls<00:05:59.590> nice<00:06:00.590> stuff<00:06:01.039> you<00:06:01.250> can<00:06:01.340> do

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
manual controls nice stuff you can do

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.540 
manual controls nice stuff you can do
almost<00:06:01.729> everything<00:06:02.210> with<00:06:02.539> an<00:06:02.720> SLR<00:06:03.400> with<00:06:04.400> this
