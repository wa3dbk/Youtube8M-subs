your best guess of what to expect so I I

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.799 
your best guess of what to expect so I I
think<00:01:02.100> it'll<00:01:02.340> be<00:01:02.370> there'll<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:02.850> some<00:01:03.510> changes

think it'll be there'll be some changes

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.140 
think it'll be there'll be some changes
to<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> case<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.979> think<00:01:05.400> it'll<00:01:05.820> be<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.939> little

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
to the case I think it'll be a little

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.480 
to the case I think it'll be a little
slimmer<00:01:06.420> little<00:01:06.900> sleeker<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.619> will<00:01:07.830> I

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
slimmer little sleeker if you will I

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.370 
slimmer little sleeker if you will I
think<00:01:08.939> well<00:01:09.119> they'll<00:01:09.330> probably<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> gold

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
think well they'll probably be a gold

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.250 
think well they'll probably be a gold
option<00:01:10.830> like<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> iphone<00:01:11.760> 5s<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.990> will

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
option like in the iphone 5s it will

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.249 
option like in the iphone 5s it will
have<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.799> new<00:01:14.150> majan<00:01:15.150> it'll<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.509> a7<00:01:16.140> and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
m7 processors the 64-bit processor and

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.940 
m7 processors the 64-bit processor and
it'll<00:01:19.890> certainly<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.360> iOS<00:01:21.360> 7<00:01:21.750> compatible<00:01:22.290> um

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.480 
are going to be creating more powerful
software<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.350> device<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.740> again<00:01:59.189> going

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
software for the device and again going

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.649 
software for the device and again going
back<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.790> said<00:02:00.030> earlier<00:02:00.119> it's<00:02:00.509> a

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
back to I said earlier it's a

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.359 
back to I said earlier it's a
consumption<00:02:01.200> device<00:02:01.320> people<00:02:01.770> want<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.040> use<00:02:02.340> it

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
consumption device people want to use it

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.920 
consumption device people want to use it
to<00:02:02.700> play<00:02:02.909> games<00:02:03.890> things<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.930> once

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
to play games things like that and once

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.889 
to play games things like that and once
we<00:02:07.229> start<00:02:07.619> with<00:02:08.520> getting<00:02:08.910> all<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.599> content

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
we start with getting all that content

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.949 
we start with getting all that content
for<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> 64-bit<00:02:11.550> realm<00:02:11.879> on<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.840> new

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
for this in the 64-bit realm on the new

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.760 
for this in the 64-bit realm on the new
iPad

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
iPad

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.640 
iPad
and<00:02:13.890> as<00:02:14.370> well<00:02:14.670> as<00:02:14.850> in<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> iphone<00:02:15.540> it's<00:02:16.410> just

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
and as well as in the iphone it's just

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.590 
and as well as in the iphone it's just
going<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.830> snowball<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.490> that'll<00:02:18.150> more

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
going to snowball and that'll more

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.870 
going to snowball and that'll more
devices<00:02:19.170> have<00:02:19.560> more<00:02:19.800> content<00:02:20.280> people<00:02:20.790> are

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
devices have more content people are

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.640 
devices have more content people are
happier<00:02:21.210> they<00:02:21.420> buy<00:02:21.570> more<00:02:21.810> devices<00:02:22.260> there's

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
happier they buy more devices there's

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.860 
happier they buy more devices there's
more<00:02:22.830> content<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.550> just<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.150> feedback<00:02:24.510> loop

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
more content it just is to feedback loop

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.350 
more content it just is to feedback loop
that<00:02:24.900> fits<00:02:25.320> it<00:02:25.470> feeds<00:02:25.920> upon<00:02:26.070> itself<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.150> I

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
that fits it feeds upon itself so and I

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.870 
that fits it feeds upon itself so and I
think<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.990> key<00:02:28.260> for<00:02:28.530> investors<00:02:29.070> how

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
think this is the key for investors how

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.970 
think this is the key for investors how
does<00:02:30.210> this<00:02:30.390> play<00:02:30.600> into<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:31.320> future<00:02:31.650> in

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
does this play into the future in

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.280 
does this play into the future in
Apple's<00:02:32.730> future<00:02:33.120> success<00:02:33.570> where<00:02:33.930> does<00:02:34.110> this

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
Apple's future success where does this

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.220 
Apple's future success where does this
fit<00:02:34.560> in<00:02:34.800> oh<00:02:35.060> it's<00:02:36.060> going<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.330> be<00:02:36.480> massive<00:02:36.750> and

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
fit in oh it's going to be massive and

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.950 
fit in oh it's going to be massive and
again<00:02:37.680> if<00:02:38.310> we<00:02:38.370> look<00:02:38.760> at<00:02:38.880> what<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.330> ipad<00:02:39.930> is

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
again if we look at what the ipad is

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.410 
again if we look at what the ipad is
doing<00:02:40.650> it's<00:02:40.890> one<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.430> most<00:02:41.790> widely

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
doing it's one of the most widely

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.520 
doing it's one of the most widely
adopted<00:02:43.940> devices<00:02:44.940> in<00:02:45.180> history<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:45.840> terms<00:02:45.900> of

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
adopted devices in history in terms of

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.890 
adopted devices in history in terms of
speed<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:46.950> adoption<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.760> it's<00:02:48.450> only<00:02:48.630> going<00:02:48.840> to

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
speed of adoption and it's only going to

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.560 
speed of adoption and it's only going to
get<00:02:49.050> better<00:02:49.320> from<00:02:49.590> here<00:02:49.680> not<00:02:50.400> only<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:51.240> it

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
get better from here not only is is it

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.290 
get better from here not only is is it
changing<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.740> way<00:02:52.860> we<00:02:52.890> compute<00:02:53.490> right<00:02:54.120> we're

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
changing the way we compute right we're

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.870 
changing the way we compute right we're
moving<00:02:54.660> maybe<00:02:55.140> away<00:02:55.590> from<00:02:56.010> even<00:02:56.490> more<00:02:56.700> away

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
moving maybe away from even more away

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.970 
moving maybe away from even more away
from<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.180> desktop<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.810> laptop<00:02:58.230> but<00:02:58.860> it's

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
from the desktop and laptop but it's

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.860 
from the desktop and laptop but it's
also<00:02:59.160> going<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.670> change<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.300> way<00:03:00.420> we<00:03:00.600> consume

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
also going to change the way we consume

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.350 
also going to change the way we consume
content<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.580> could<00:03:02.760> be<00:03:02.790> disrupting

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
content so it could be disrupting

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.190 
content so it could be disrupting
television<00:03:03.990> cable<00:03:04.880> music<00:03:05.880> it's<00:03:06.210> you<00:03:07.110> know

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
television cable music it's you know

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.590 
television cable music it's you know
it's<00:03:07.350> really<00:03:07.830> going<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.400> be<00:03:08.490> a<00:03:08.580> huge<00:03:09.150> device

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
it's really going to be a huge device

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.170 
it's really going to be a huge device
for<00:03:09.870> Apple<00:03:10.230> again<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.920> i<00:03:10.980> think<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.670> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
for Apple again and i think the the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.360 
for Apple again and i think the the
stock<00:03:12.690> is<00:03:12.900> not<00:03:13.080> reflecting<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.650> at<00:03:13.980> all<00:03:14.070> in

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
stock is not reflecting that at all in

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.160 
stock is not reflecting that at all in
my<00:03:14.520> opinion<00:03:14.820> excellent<00:03:15.480> will<00:03:15.600> do<00:03:15.720> thank<00:03:16.020> you
