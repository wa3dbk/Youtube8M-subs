00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.510
 Grows Baby welcomes you and today I have prepared a video that we have come 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.000
 asking how to teach the child to brush his teeth. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.470
 Regardless of the recommendations that you give your dentist only share 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:37.930
 how to stimulate in your little one the coordination eye hand and brush and also the movements 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:45.700
 that you will have to gradually stimulate until the child reaches to be brushed 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.700
 correctly teeth. 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:59.630
 One week before stimulates hand and brush eye starting as a game the child should start 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:07.130
 to learn to take the brush with the bristles towards the front and with movements from above 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:17.050
 down this is the first step these first movements up down down up will be 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.800
 fundamental 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:26.960
 The second step now do it to one side to the other side to side remember that the movements 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:35.810
 They are with the brush facing the little mouth of the child and at the height of his mouth up 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.500
 down to one side and the other. 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.130
 To continue stimulating hand brush and eye closes these exercises now doing it 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:53.380
 in a circular way teach the little one how to move his hand around and leave 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:01.340
 moving through the mouth without introducing the brush everything you are doing on the outside. 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.369
 Made these first movements for about a week for five minutes now 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:17.260
 close this stimulation teaching the little one to put paste to his brush and for this you 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:25.040
 you should carry around another week for five minutes daily just the fact of 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:36.349
 the child opens the paste put a little of it in the brush this is demanding 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:44.569
 tremendous precision so do not despair and give all the time necessary for you to perform 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:52.379
 This act if daily the little one will be learning now to place pasta. 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:03:00.569
 And to take advantage of this pasta that the little one has placed in his brush, he now invites 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.740
 make those same movements with one of your toys can be a big doll or 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.879
 a small doll and the important thing is that he returns to perform the same exercises 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:19.689
 It is not about brushing the doll 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:27.129
 Exactly it's about exercising hand with brush. 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:33.879
 Two moments that you should stimulate in the child for around two weeks for five 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:43.879
 minutes and respect to rinse the mouth I suggest that the day you go to formalize the brushing 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:52.079
 you teach him directly how to take the water and not swallow it just swallow his mouth 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.840
 I'm Consuelo and I appreciate the likes that you leave us and share our videos.
