00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
 Hello my name is Alexei Moscow 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.259
 wiring located in the suburbs 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.719
 we will also be coffees around the world 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.160
 bathhouse 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:20.330
 300 squares near is dum-dum in 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.289
 two times less than a steam bath here 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:29.580
 ten squares in strength 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:38.059
 that is the main resting place here 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:38.059
 there will be such a comment 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:57.449
 This is what I need. We took it. 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.710
 do not connect it we do in stages 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.649
 everything depends on everything 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.390
 in between doing at this stage we 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.710
 we will lay all the wires 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.720
 cable the whole thing output set 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.280
 podrozetniki on the facade walls on 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.150
 external that is exactly bonuses and 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.159
 take out tails 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.540
 leave bunches that's where we become 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.390
 partitions, that is, until you become 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.500
 when you get up partitions is another question 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.500
 floor and here will rise 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.900
 14 centimeters there is a pie 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.990
 this happens almost everywhere and 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.870
 warm floor here on the floor as we are here 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.320
 we will do that is this gap 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.660
 this is the distance of the void board itself 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.070
 they will drive trays 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.220
 that is, retreat from the edge here are three 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.350
 centimeter, and we will have a tray for 200 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.320
 around the perimeter here and on the second 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.100
 accordingly, it is almost the same 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:02.000
 put the mass there place here removed 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:08.320
 two power supplies ie working backup 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.320
 from here , the house here will stand with 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.590
 in this way, the whole assembly will be 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.540
 produce in the metal sleeve 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.560
 so the floor will now rise large 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.610
 such a resonance that in the metal hands 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:35.500
 we do in general according to the project of this house 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:39.799
 the project that is the project pavel theme 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:44.000
 goodwood project all wiring done in pvc 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:49.670
 pipe that is to self-reliant whom to 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.540
 pipe in pipes in nothing for the whole installation 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.650
 twice just made wooden houses about 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.959
 normal technology 1 then in 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:03.739
 metal pipe the second is in copper 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:07.190
 pipe too hidden wiring was that is 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.540
 here it turned over like that 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.510
 the forum 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.940
 I climbed the sites of one company has already forgotten 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.850
 which one i think made the media on 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.150
 The questions are exactly the firm that does 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.959
 glued timber 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.360
 they were allowed to do in PVC pipe they 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.280
 knocked out then you paid or what to us 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.040
 allowed they took the official piece of paper 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.920
 and their homes are not being taken ill of you one 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:35.540
 firm from all Moscow 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:40.790
 therefore the project is approved but the owner 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:44.859
 wanted to in metal scrap watch out for 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:48.530
 so how are we going to show it how 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:51.829
 Enclosures made faÃ§ade walls and 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.639
 that is, there we have a house in the house already 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:57.829
 done done to say the least in a boorish way 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:01.130
 somehow we 'll get everything closed as not 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:04.090
 let me show you all for now 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.090
 watch the air
