00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
lose access to the kitchen as long as it

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.490 
lose access to the kitchen as long as it
doesn't<00:01:31.520> lose<00:01:31.580> access<00:01:32.000> to<00:01:32.150> food<00:01:32.390> but<00:01:33.350> your

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
doesn't lose access to food but your

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.810 
doesn't lose access to food but your
family<00:01:33.830> really<00:01:34.159> can't<00:01:34.370> afford<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.670> lose

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.969
