00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.570
 tutorial about five minutes 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.640

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.570
 continue when we are above 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.510

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:55.309

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.549
 comparisons and this one is nickel so 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.860
 that's it, we'll start from 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.500

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.330

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.369
 do all this with you for anzin 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.860
 a lot easier then we will you 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.310
 go and land on this page 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.659
 undo noodles is here if you have 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.560
 windows you download version 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.000
 glitch 12 and the mac os here the 5.0 so 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.979
 I'm on windows so I 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.220
 download windows and den room 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.360
 19 only like that and then for he goes 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.850
 have to download the application on 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.099
 the android is from his computer 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.840
 from his phone 

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:52.550
 so it's very simple I just 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.890
 installed then flying then we will have 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.319
 need this picture then when you 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.069
 do not you first have to run that so 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:02.599
 we run more pda then 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:05.450
 so here I am already installed no 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:08.330
 plus do ok anyway to hesmond 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.569
 install uninstall it's 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.910
 too silly huh go here's that 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.260
 normally you have that the event does not 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.920
 not be uninstalled at first here it is 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.319
 makes you accept ex so that's where 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.310
 he installs everything so normally I 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.050
 think you have a small window 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.239
 he asks you to install or not you 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.830
 have it installed etc let you like 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.720
 that we leave you b so you go 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.510
 must connect to the phone in usb on 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.239
 your pc 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.530
 click on finish and you're done there 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.510
 I have already done so 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.489
 open the app on your phone 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.459
 and where you normally have this page 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.650
 there and he asks you to activate active 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.760
 and no we do not ask you you have to 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.530
 activate this bts 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.909
 so here you activate and then after 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.379
 asks you to download 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.209
 the application is suitable to download 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.250
 but to you have only seen you 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.459
 have already downloaded execution is 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.799
 installed all of that so that's normally 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.040
 then when you did that so there 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:06.549
 I have already done tap tap tap non 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.750
 wait for hockey and that's great because 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.970
 that you will be able to read the sms 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.099
 answered all that and more so that's it 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.290
 you clicked on the small icons 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.730
 masked which you are going to do this is it so 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.060
 in fact then his mass did right click 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.159
 above 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.829
 here I am going to do disconnect because 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:23.409
 normally it must not be connected 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.970
 suddenly this is what it looks like 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:27.489
 that you will make known internet 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.040
 usb when you called on this button 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.459
 here and connected and now 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:37.449
 you can surf the internet 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.620
 it's sublime it's great here so I 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.030
 showed you how to navigate 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.840
 internet and then you can even 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.599
 send cross messages so start up 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.190
 the messengers I do not know what is 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.109
 that's the paid version 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.449
 a year after the free version you 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.430
 do you still have internet which is good 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:56.590
 seen that I'm internally hours I 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.040
 fun for life on the internet it's 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.780
 get bored - that's clear like that 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.340
 good I internet to a field thanks to 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.930

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.879
 so I will tell you more for a neighbor 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.150

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.269
 an apple application this mode the same I 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.709
 do not know if it's the same but I have 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.479
 discovered this application since the 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.120
 beginning of an internship I was interested 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.760
 and I wondered but shit purifies 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.450
 logo of the shot 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.160
 bah suddenly I am forced to use 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.530
 my phone but since I have original 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.720
 already largely what's that then I 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.720
