in Puerto Rico and there is a population

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.069 
in Puerto Rico and there is a population
explosion<00:00:34.950> we've<00:00:35.910> seen<00:00:36.149> literally<00:00:36.600> hundreds

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
explosion we've seen literally hundreds

explosion we've seen literally hundreds
up<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.440> trees<00:00:37.680> as<00:00:37.860> we're<00:00:38.010> coming<00:00:38.250> through

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
up in the trees as we're coming through

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.250 
up in the trees as we're coming through
big<00:00:39.030> ones<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.360> they're<00:00:39.450> causing<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.930> lot<00:00:40.230> of

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260

they've<00:00:43.079> tried<00:00:43.260> different<00:00:43.469> ways<00:00:43.739> of

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
they've tried different ways of

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.459 
they've tried different ways of
capturing<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:45.030> moving<00:00:45.600> them<00:00:45.719> out<00:00:45.870> but<00:00:46.110> they

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
capturing of moving them out but they

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.660 
capturing of moving them out but they
just<00:00:46.649> can't<00:00:46.890> handle<00:00:47.190> them<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.460> we're<00:00:47.610> gonna

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
just can't handle them so we're gonna

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.310 
just can't handle them so we're gonna
see<00:00:48.000> what<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.390> do<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> population

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
see what we can do with the population

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.020 
see what we can do with the population
this<00:00:49.829> might<00:00:50.010> be<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.399> good<00:00:50.489> airgun

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
this might be a really good airgun

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
I'll be showing some footage of that a

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.040 
I'll be showing some footage of that a
little<00:00:59.460> bit<00:00:59.550> later<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.510> we're<00:01:00.629> gonna<00:01:00.719> go<00:01:00.899> out

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
little bit later but we're gonna go out

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.840 
little bit later but we're gonna go out
we're<00:01:01.199> gonna<00:01:01.320> collect<00:01:01.620> these<00:01:01.829> iguanas<00:01:02.070> they

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
we're gonna collect these iguanas they

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.490 
we're gonna collect these iguanas they
go<00:01:03.000> anywhere<00:01:03.090> from<00:01:03.539> about<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.199> know<00:01:04.320> from

they<00:01:09.720> lay<00:01:09.930> up<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.470> three<00:01:10.680> clutches<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.159> eggs

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
they lay up to three clutches of eggs

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.390 
they lay up to three clutches of eggs
with<00:01:11.700> up<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.970> 70<00:01:12.360> eggs<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.960> year<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.010> can<00:01:14.100> see

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
with up to 70 eggs a year so you can see

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.640 
with up to 70 eggs a year so you can see
the<00:01:14.549> kind<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.810> potential<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:15.900> exponential

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
the kind of potential for exponential

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.609 
the kind of potential for exponential
growth<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.369> could<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.640> explosive<00:01:18.619> so

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
growth that just could be explosive so

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.440 
growth that just could be explosive so
the<00:01:19.740> guns<00:01:19.920> I'm<00:01:20.070> going<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.280> use<00:01:20.430> are<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.000> I'm

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
the guns I'm going to use are the I'm

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.940 
the guns I'm going to use are the I'm
going<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:21.750> using<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.110> hats<00:01:22.290> ins<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.680> 30

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
going to be using the hats ins in 30

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.969 
going to be using the hats ins in 30
caliber<00:01:23.369> both<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.509> 30<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.020> 357<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
caliber both the 30 and the 357 and the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.219 
caliber both the 30 and the 357 and the
carnivore<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.729> think<00:01:27.600> they're<00:01:27.689> gonna<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.869> ideal

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
carnivore I think they're gonna be ideal

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.050 
carnivore I think they're gonna be ideal
I'm<00:01:28.530> gonna<00:01:28.680> try<00:01:28.860> also<00:01:29.189> some<00:01:29.369> stuff<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.759> 20

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
I'm gonna try also some stuff for the 20

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.999 
I'm gonna try also some stuff for the 20
to<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.450> locals<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.290> go<00:01:31.439> out<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.710> shoot<00:01:31.890> them

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
to the locals that go out and shoot them

with this pellet this is a big iguana
shot<00:05:02.370> about<00:05:02.580> 40<00:05:03.510> 45<00:05:03.870> yards<00:05:04.410> out<00:05:04.830> of<00:05:04.979> a<00:05:05.070> tree<00:05:05.580> and

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
shot about 40 45 yards out of a tree and

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.010 
shot about 40 45 yards out of a tree and
this<00:05:07.680> gun<00:05:07.950> has<00:05:08.190> been<00:05:08.600> really<00:05:09.600> doing<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.840> job

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
this gun has been really doing the job

this gun has been really doing the job
one<00:05:10.200> of<00:05:10.260> things<00:05:10.440> I<00:05:10.530> like<00:05:10.650> about<00:05:10.710> a<00:05:10.950> trajectory

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
one of things I like about a trajectory

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.700 
one of things I like about a trajectory
is<00:05:11.850> flatter<00:05:12.180> and<00:05:12.479> I've<00:05:13.080> got<00:05:13.229> to<00:05:13.350> work<00:05:13.500> through

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
is flatter and I've got to work through

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.500 
is flatter and I've got to work through
a<00:05:13.740> lot<00:05:13.830> of<00:05:14.070> branches<00:05:14.310> and<00:05:14.639> twigs<00:05:14.790> in<00:05:15.120> here<00:05:15.330> and

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
a lot of branches and twigs in here and

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.540 
a lot of branches and twigs in here and
having<00:05:16.350> that<00:05:16.440> flat<00:05:16.680> trajectory<00:05:16.889> makes<00:05:17.430> it

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
having that flat trajectory makes it

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.310 
having that flat trajectory makes it
simpler<00:05:17.880> for<00:05:17.940> me<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.210> estimate<00:05:18.600> where<00:05:19.289> the

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
simpler for me to estimate where the

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.260 
simpler for me to estimate where the
pellets<00:05:19.740> gonna<00:05:19.919> hit<00:05:20.160> you<00:05:21.060> know<00:05:21.150> I've<00:05:21.240> been

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
pellets gonna hit you know I've been

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.820 
pellets gonna hit you know I've been
hitting<00:05:21.600> a<00:05:21.660> lot<00:05:21.780> of<00:05:21.840> tree<00:05:22.110> branches<00:05:22.530> in<00:05:22.740> the

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
hitting a lot of tree branches in the

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.050 
hitting a lot of tree branches in the
way<00:05:22.950> where<00:05:23.130> I<00:05:23.190> thought<00:05:23.340> it<00:05:23.400> had<00:05:23.520> a<00:05:23.610> perfect

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
way where I thought it had a perfect

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.870 
way where I thought it had a perfect
perfect<00:05:24.720> shot<00:05:24.900> but<00:05:25.169> then<00:05:25.410> this<00:05:26.070> is<00:05:26.250> typical<00:05:26.760> of

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
perfect shot but then this is typical of

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.880 
perfect shot but then this is typical of
