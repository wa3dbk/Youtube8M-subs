00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.090 
same time I'm a huge fan of schedules
and<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.479> think<00:01:18.720> everyone<00:01:19.229> should<00:01:19.259> have<00:01:19.590> one<00:01:19.650> but

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
and I think everyone should have one but

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.469 
and I think everyone should have one but
the<00:01:20.250> issue<00:01:20.400> with<00:01:20.580> most<00:01:20.790> families<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.360> that

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
the issue with most families is that

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.609 
the issue with most families is that
your<00:01:21.630> schedules<00:01:22.020> are<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.229> all<00:01:22.409> different

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
your schedules are in all different

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.249 
your schedules are in all different
places<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.640> what<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.939> do<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.210> keep<00:01:24.659> an<00:01:24.810> actual

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
places so what I do is keep an actual

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.380 
places so what I do is keep an actual
paper<00:01:25.470> calendar<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:26.189> my<00:01:26.250> refrigerator<00:01:26.700> where

everyone<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:27.930> see<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.140> every<00:01:28.740> single<00:01:28.979> day

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
everyone can see it every single day

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.920 
everyone can see it every single day
that<00:01:29.939> creates<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.390> stress-free<00:01:30.750> environment

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930
