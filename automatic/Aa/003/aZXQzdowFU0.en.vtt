00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
and they think that that's the that's

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.249 
and they think that that's the that's
the<00:01:59.490> best<00:01:59.820> game<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.360> series<00:02:00.600> even<00:02:00.810> though<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.170> I

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
the best game the series even though I I

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.109 
the best game the series even though I I
consider<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.130> first<00:02:02.340> one<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> best

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
consider the first one to be the best

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.569 
consider the first one to be the best
game<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.570> series<00:02:03.780> but<00:02:03.960> still<00:02:04.409> um<00:02:04.680> people

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
going to make now what is it coming out

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.020 
going to make now what is it coming out
by<00:02:48.200> my<00:02:48.350> assumptions<00:02:48.980> somewhere<00:02:49.700> in<00:02:50.739> 2016<00:02:51.739> I<00:02:52.030> I

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
by my assumptions somewhere in 2016 I I

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.630 
by my assumptions somewhere in 2016 I I
doubted<00:02:53.810> it's<00:02:54.290> going<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.590> come<00:02:54.739> out<00:02:54.799> in<00:02:55.040> 2015

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
doubted it's going to come out in 2015

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.180 
doubted it's going to come out in 2015
by<00:02:56.060> because<00:02:56.540> they<00:02:57.110> have<00:02:57.290> relations<00:02:57.830> to<00:02:58.040> which

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
by because they have relations to which

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.190 
by because they have relations to which
is<00:02:58.280> coming<00:02:58.549> out<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:58.940> they<00:02:59.239> just<00:02:59.630> released<00:02:59.989> an

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
is coming out and they just released an

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.809 
is coming out and they just released an
HD<00:03:00.560> remasters<00:03:01.069> so<00:03:01.250> they're<00:03:01.400> probably<00:03:01.430> going

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
HD remasters so they're probably going

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.690 
HD remasters so they're probably going
to<00:03:01.940> take<00:03:02.090> their<00:03:02.299> time<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:04.190> know<00:03:04.310> start
