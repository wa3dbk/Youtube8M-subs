first one which going to do is place the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.389 
first one which going to do is place the
wheels<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.170> get<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.350> 2-way<00:00:46.770> from<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.039> site<00:00:47.219> in

wheels and get a 2-way from the site in

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.040 
wheels and get a 2-way from the site in
the<00:00:47.460> middle<00:00:47.520> then<00:00:48.090> place<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> wheel<00:00:48.719> over<00:00:48.750> here

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
the middle then place a wheel over here

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.450 
the middle then place a wheel over here
so<00:00:49.320> he<00:00:49.410> got<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.829> middle<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.219> that

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
so he got it in the middle like that

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.670 
so he got it in the middle like that
they<00:00:51.239> gonna<00:00:51.449> jump<00:00:51.719> away<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:52.170> blocks<00:00:52.410> and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
they gonna jump away for blocks and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.729 
they gonna jump away for blocks and
place<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> wheel<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> fifth<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.739> now

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
place a wheel on the fifth like that now

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.080 
place a wheel on the fifth like that now
we're<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.100> play<00:00:56.250> some<00:00:56.309> quartz<00:00:56.640> laps<00:00:56.910> and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
we're going to play some quartz laps and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.410 
we're going to play some quartz laps and
go<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.809> their<00:00:58.350> paint<00:00:59.309> place<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> block<00:01:00.030> here<00:01:00.270> and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
go to their paint place a block here and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.270 
go to their paint place a block here and
delete<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.780> block<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.199> place<00:01:01.770> two<00:01:02.039> over

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
delete that block and place two over

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.270 
delete that block and place two over
there<00:01:02.430> with<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> quartz<00:01:03.390> they're<00:01:03.690> upside<00:01:04.049> down

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
there with a quartz they're upside down

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.880 
there with a quartz they're upside down
facing<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.489> death<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.750> course<00:01:06.990> lap<00:01:07.229> two

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
facing to death and a course lap two

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.679 
facing to death and a course lap two
over<00:01:08.460> there<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.119> got<00:01:09.240> something<00:01:09.659> like

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
over there so you got something like

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.840 
over there so you got something like
this<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.369> that's<00:01:11.369> how<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.580> supposed<00:01:11.820> to

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
this and that's how it's supposed to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.280 
this and that's how it's supposed to
look<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.479> now<00:01:12.570> we're<00:01:12.689> going<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.900> place<00:01:13.049> another

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
look so now we're going to place another

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.560 
look so now we're going to place another
bridge<00:01:13.830> there<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.549> second<00:01:15.030> block<00:01:15.180> over

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
bridge there on the second block over

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.510 
bridge there on the second block over
here<00:01:15.600> from<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> end<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.500> place<00:01:17.250> another

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
here from the end and place another

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.749 
here from the end and place another
bridge<00:01:17.939> slab<00:01:18.380> like<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.650> over<00:01:19.979> there<00:01:20.159> with

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
bridge slab like that over there with

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.249 
bridge slab like that over there with
another<00:01:21.060> bridge<00:01:21.299> there<00:01:21.509> upside<00:01:21.900> down<00:01:22.049> like

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
another bridge there upside down like

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.440 
another bridge there upside down like
this<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.740> another<00:01:22.770> bridge<00:01:23.280> slab<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:24.090> top<00:01:24.150> of

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
this with another bridge slab on top of

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.210 
this with another bridge slab on top of
that<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.229> got<00:01:25.320> something<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.009> this

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
that so it got something like this this

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.649 
that so it got something like this this
is<00:01:26.280> supposed<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.880> like<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.210> till<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
is supposed to be like the till and

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.230 
is supposed to be like the till and
let's<00:01:28.650> place<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> core<00:01:29.220> slab<00:01:29.460> over<00:01:29.640> here<00:01:30.000> with

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
let's place a core slab over here with

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.770 
let's place a core slab over here with
quartz<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:31.140> facing<00:01:31.890> there<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.970> place<00:01:33.570> a

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
quartz there up facing there and place a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.469 
quartz there up facing there and place a
black<00:01:33.960> stain<00:01:34.170> glass<00:01:34.350> over<00:01:34.710> here<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.329> got

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
black stain glass over here so you got

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.170 
black stain glass over here so you got
something<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.909> then<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:38.939> want<00:01:39.150> to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
something like this then you want to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.999 
something like this then you want to
place<00:01:39.299> some<00:01:39.840> natural<00:01:40.140> another<00:01:40.650> rack<00:01:40.829> over

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
place some natural another rack over

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.569 
place some natural another rack over
here<00:01:41.369> too<00:01:41.670> like<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.619> gray<00:01:43.979> wall<00:01:44.220> over

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
here too like this with a gray wall over

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.780 
here too like this with a gray wall over
here<00:01:44.850> at<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.720> end<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.159> same<00:01:47.549> thing

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
here at the end and and the same thing
