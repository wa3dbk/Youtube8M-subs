00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 to 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.279
 ah 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.670
 hello I am a flood and I invite you to 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.259
 do things for yourself in this 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.599
 I'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:20.550
 paper snake to decorate the 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:22.919
 your child's room and make it fun 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.840
 for both to do it and also be 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:28.140
 the sales 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.050
 what we are going to need is 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.840
 fulfilled of paper in this vocation because 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.329
 I will choose it green because at 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.510
 general is a color with which the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.510
 snakes 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.100
 to use we start by drawing the head 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:56.469
 and from there we started 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.469
 by doing our spiral 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.230
 well here I already have two models by 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.490
 do 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:17.650
 we started to cut back obviously 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.650
 on the line that we already have drawn 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.800
 since we have our snake cut 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.350
 so with the tip in our scissors 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.110
 let's make a hole 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.030
 tiny teeny 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:03.390
 and we are going to put 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:08.270
 hemp thread so we're going to hang it 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.270
 you can look at one side of me 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.220
 we make a double knot so that we do not get 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.220
 alert 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.300
 since we have our thread placed in 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.940
 the head well placed since it 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.340
 We put in the original position where 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.610
 we started to cut and as you can 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.280
 observe 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:39.980
 so it must stay and it is ready 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.980
 our paper snake 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.480
 I am kind and I invite you to do the 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.480
 things for you
