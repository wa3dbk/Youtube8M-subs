now<00:00:00.420> let's<00:00:00.630> do<00:00:00.750> example<00:00:00.840> to<00:00:01.380> the<00:00:02.040> heights<00:00:02.280> of

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
now let's do example to the heights of

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.860 
now let's do example to the heights of
women<00:00:02.850> in<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.060> united<00:00:03.419> states<00:00:03.449> are

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
women in the united states are

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.809 
women in the united states are
approximately<00:00:04.650> normally<00:00:05.069> distributed<00:00:05.100> with

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
approximately normally distributed with

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.970 
approximately normally distributed with
a<00:00:06.060> mean<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.420> sixty<00:00:06.899> four<00:00:07.109> point<00:00:07.379> eight<00:00:07.529> inches

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
a mean of sixty four point eight inches

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.250 
a mean of sixty four point eight inches
the<00:00:08.580> heights<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:09.000> 11<00:00:09.420> players<00:00:09.570> on<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:09.990> recent

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
the heights of 11 players on a recent

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.999 
the heights of 11 players on a recent
roster<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.160> WNBA<00:00:11.910> team<00:00:12.269> are<00:00:12.650> these<00:00:13.650> in

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
roster of the WNBA team are these in

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.570 
roster of the WNBA team are these in
inches<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.440> there<00:00:16.440> sufficient<00:00:16.710> evidence<00:00:17.100> to

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
inches is there sufficient evidence to

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.820 
inches is there sufficient evidence to
say<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:17.940> this<00:00:18.300> sample<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.289> much<00:00:19.470> taller

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
say that this sample is so much taller

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.890 
say that this sample is so much taller
than<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.250> population<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.630> difference

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
than the population that this difference

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.140 
than the population that this difference
cannot<00:00:22.619> reasonably<00:00:23.250> be<00:00:23.369> attributed<00:00:24.150> to

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
cannot reasonably be attributed to

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.220 
cannot reasonably be attributed to
chance<00:00:24.630> alone<00:00:25.130> well<00:00:26.420> now<00:00:27.420> let's<00:00:27.720> do<00:00:27.930> some

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
chance alone well now let's do some

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.910 
chance alone well now let's do some
hypothesis<00:00:28.800> testing<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:30.029> here<00:00:30.869> are<00:00:31.439> null

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
hypothesis testing so here are null

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.459 
hypothesis testing so here are null
hypothesis<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:32.940> our<00:00:33.360> sample<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.079> just

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
hypothesis is that our sample is just

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.709 
hypothesis is that our sample is just
like<00:00:34.680> regular<00:00:35.100> women<00:00:35.670> right<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.590> mean<00:00:37.890> is

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
like regular women right so the mean is

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.040 
like regular women right so the mean is
64.8<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:41.550> alternative<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.629> i'm<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:42.960> going

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
64.8 the alternative and i'm just going

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.260 
64.8 the alternative and i'm just going
to<00:00:43.170> use<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> two-tailed<00:00:44.010> alternative<00:00:44.820> here<00:00:45.120> is

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
to use a two-tailed alternative here is

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.869 
to use a two-tailed alternative here is
that<00:00:45.870> they<00:00:46.230> are<00:00:46.260> not<00:00:46.820> like<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.780> population

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
that they are not like this population

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.700 
that they are not like this population
we<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.090> probably<00:00:51.570> guess<00:00:51.780> by<00:00:51.989> using<00:00:52.199> common

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
we can probably guess by using common

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.060 
we can probably guess by using common
sense<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.160> they're<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.610> average<00:00:54.239> taller<00:00:55.070> but

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
sense that they're on average taller but

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.209 
sense that they're on average taller but
we'll<00:00:56.489> do<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> two-tailed<00:00:57.890> two-tailed<00:00:58.890> test

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
we'll do a two-tailed two-tailed test

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.979 
we'll do a two-tailed two-tailed test
it's<00:00:59.460> actually<00:00:59.910> more<00:01:00.059> conservative<00:01:00.750> it's

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
it's actually more conservative it's

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.270 
it's actually more conservative it's
safer<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.710> go<00:01:01.890> with<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> two-tailed<00:01:02.730> test<00:01:04.280> so

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
safer to go with a two-tailed test so

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.179 
safer to go with a two-tailed test so
here<00:01:05.790> we'll<00:01:06.270> make<00:01:06.630> alpha<00:01:07.140> equal<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.740> point<00:01:08.070> 05

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
here we'll make alpha equal to point 05

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:16.160 
here we'll make alpha equal to point 05
and<00:01:09.770> it'll<00:01:10.770> be<00:01:10.890> two<00:01:11.220> tailed<00:01:12.619> and<00:01:14.869> let's<00:01:15.869> draw

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
and it'll be two tailed and let's draw

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.510 
and it'll be two tailed and let's draw
the<00:01:16.229> estan<00:01:16.860> here

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.139 

so<00:01:22.509> here<00:01:23.049> we<00:01:23.229> might<00:01:23.950> draw<00:01:24.280> these<00:01:24.520> boundaries

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
so here we might draw these boundaries

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.639 
so here we might draw these boundaries
and<00:01:26.460> because<00:01:27.460> it's<00:01:27.729> two-tailed<00:01:28.469> this<00:01:29.469> is

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
and because it's two-tailed this is

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:38.459 
and because it's two-tailed this is
point<00:01:29.979> 0<00:01:30.100> 25<00:01:30.929> point<00:01:31.929> 0<00:01:32.079> 2<00:01:32.170> 0<00:01:32.770> 0<00:01:36.119> 25<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:37.810> here

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
point 0 25 point 0 2 0 0 25 and here

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:41.699 
point 0 25 point 0 2 0 0 25 and here
it's<00:01:38.619> point<00:01:39.039> 95<00:01:39.759> all<00:01:40.659> right<00:01:40.780> so<00:01:40.959> altogether<00:01:41.439> it

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
it's point 95 all right so altogether it

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:46.440 
it's point 95 all right so altogether it
adds<00:01:42.009> up<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.340> point<00:01:43.240> one<00:01:44.100> all<00:01:45.100> right<00:01:45.369> so<00:01:46.240> now

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
adds up to point one all right so now

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.219 
adds up to point one all right so now
that<00:01:46.659> we<00:01:46.780> have<00:01:46.810> this<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:49.090> we<00:01:49.299> figure<00:01:49.569> out<00:01:49.780> the

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
that we have this can we figure out the

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.590 
that we have this can we figure out the
tea<00:01:50.590> well<00:01:51.280> in<00:01:51.459> order<00:01:51.579> to<00:01:51.729> figure<00:01:51.969> out<00:01:52.179> the<00:01:52.329> tea

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
tea well in order to figure out the tea

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.249 
tea well in order to figure out the tea
we<00:01:52.959> need<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.289> have<00:01:53.469> the<00:01:53.619> degrees<00:01:54.009> of<00:01:54.039> freedom

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
we need to have the degrees of freedom

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.699 
we need to have the degrees of freedom
if<00:01:56.259> you<00:01:57.220> go<00:01:57.579> to<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:58.239> download<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.349> go<00:01:59.649> to

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
if you go to the download and go to

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.609 
if you go to the download and go to
example<00:02:00.340> 2<00:02:00.520> i've<00:02:00.819> listed<00:02:01.270> this<00:02:01.689> data<00:02:01.989> here<00:02:02.349> for

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
example 2 i've listed this data here for

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.410 
example 2 i've listed this data here for
you<00:02:02.799> and<00:02:03.009> we<00:02:03.069> could<00:02:03.640> actually<00:02:03.789> find<00:02:04.209> the

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
you and we could actually find the

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.839 
you and we could actually find the
degrees<00:02:04.840> of<00:02:04.869> freedom<00:02:05.049> here<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:09.220> here<00:02:09.459> I'll<00:02:09.640> put

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
degrees of freedom here so here I'll put

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.780 
degrees of freedom here so here I'll put
step<00:02:10.269> 3<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:10.989> that<00:02:11.170> we<00:02:11.349> know<00:02:11.530> where<00:02:11.709> we<00:02:11.860> are<00:02:12.040> in

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
step 3 so that we know where we are in

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.940 
step 3 so that we know where we are in
step<00:02:13.000> 3<00:02:13.420> we<00:02:13.450> need<00:02:13.750> degrees<00:02:14.170> of<00:02:14.319> freedom<00:02:14.739> and

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
step 3 we need degrees of freedom and

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.390 
step 3 we need degrees of freedom and
that<00:02:15.400> would<00:02:15.549> be<00:02:15.579> count<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.829> all<00:02:17.829> of<00:02:18.040> these<00:02:18.130> guys

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
that would be count of all of these guys

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.220 
that would be count of all of these guys
or<00:02:19.000> gals<00:02:19.920> minus<00:02:20.920> 1<00:02:21.129> and<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:22.299> we<00:02:22.450> have<00:02:22.690> 11

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
or gals minus 1 and so we have 11

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.970 
or gals minus 1 and so we have 11
players<00:02:23.500> 10<00:02:24.370> degrees<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.879> freedom<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.980> let's

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
players 10 degrees of freedom and let's

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.110 
players 10 degrees of freedom and let's
find<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.430> critical<00:02:27.760> T<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:30.010> critical<00:02:30.579> T<00:02:30.850> would

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
find the critical T the critical T would

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.849 
find the critical T the critical T would
be<00:02:31.329> T<00:02:33.420> inverse<00:02:34.420> right<00:02:35.109> because<00:02:35.530> we<00:02:35.680> know<00:02:35.829> the

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
be T inverse right because we know the

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.220 
be T inverse right because we know the
probability<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.790> two-tailed<00:02:37.269> probability<00:02:38.049> 0

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.720 
point 0 5 and the degrees of freedom and
that<00:02:43.209> gives<00:02:43.420> us<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.780> positive<00:02:44.049> critical<00:02:44.799> T<00:02:45.160> so

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
that gives us the positive critical T so

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.559 
that gives us the positive critical T so
that's<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.389> positive<00:02:47.200> 2<00:02:48.100> point<00:02:48.430> 2<00:02:48.670> 3<00:02:49.269> and

that's a positive 2 point 2 3 and
negative<00:02:49.780> 2.23<00:02:50.650> those<00:02:51.040> are<00:02:51.190> our<00:02:51.340> critical

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
negative 2.23 those are our critical

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
boundaries anything outside of that we

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.699 
boundaries anything outside of that we
reject<00:02:54.609> the<00:02:54.760> null<00:02:56.099> let's<00:02:57.099> go<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.400> step<00:02:57.790> 4<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.590> in

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
reject the null let's go to step 4 so in

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.289 
reject the null let's go to step 4 so in
step<00:02:59.920> 4<00:03:00.220> we<00:03:00.370> could<00:03:00.519> start<00:03:00.760> dealing<00:03:00.970> with<00:03:01.269> a

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
step 4 we could start dealing with a

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.440 
step 4 we could start dealing with a
sample<00:03:01.690> so<00:03:02.470> let's<00:03:02.790> let's<00:03:03.790> figure<00:03:04.150> out<00:03:04.239> the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
sample so let's let's figure out the

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.319 
sample so let's let's figure out the
sample<00:03:04.900> T<00:03:05.230> in<00:03:05.530> order<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.370> do<00:03:06.549> that<00:03:06.700> we<00:03:07.000> need<00:03:07.030> the

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
sample T in order to do that we need the

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.250 
sample T in order to do that we need the
X<00:03:07.540> bar<00:03:07.959> minus<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.919> MU<00:03:09.250> divide<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.389> by<00:03:10.569> standard

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
X bar minus the MU divide it by standard

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.569 
X bar minus the MU divide it by standard
error<00:03:12.630> alright<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:13.870> we<00:03:14.799> need<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.099> know<00:03:15.280> the

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
error alright and so we need to know the

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.909 
error alright and so we need to know the
samples<00:03:16.859> average<00:03:17.859> so<00:03:18.459> X<00:03:18.760> bar<00:03:19.319> we<00:03:20.319> also<00:03:20.500> need<00:03:20.889> to

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:20.919 
samples average so X bar we also need to

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:24.030 
samples average so X bar we also need to
know<00:03:21.220> mu<00:03:21.790> we<00:03:22.690> also<00:03:22.840> need<00:03:23.109> to<00:03:23.139> know<00:03:23.260> standard

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
know mu we also need to know standard

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.400 
know mu we also need to know standard
error<00:03:24.310> right<00:03:24.819> and<00:03:25.060> standard<00:03:25.750> error<00:03:25.900> is<00:03:26.169> going

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
error right and standard error is going

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.580 
error right and standard error is going
to<00:03:26.500> be<00:03:26.590> s<00:03:26.799> divided<00:03:27.700> by<00:03:27.819> the<00:03:27.880> square<00:03:28.209> root<00:03:28.419> of<00:03:28.780> n

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
to be s divided by the square root of n

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.009 
to be s divided by the square root of n
I<00:03:29.940> like<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.090> write<00:03:31.239> all<00:03:31.389> these<00:03:31.509> things<00:03:31.780> down

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
I like to write all these things down

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.930 
I like to write all these things down
because<00:03:32.259> it<00:03:32.500> helps<00:03:32.799> me<00:03:33.009> figure<00:03:33.220> out<00:03:33.400> what<00:03:33.790> we

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
because it helps me figure out what we

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.520 
because it helps me figure out what we
need

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
need

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.980 
need
it's<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:34.830> a<00:03:34.860> shopping<00:03:35.220> list<00:03:35.430> do<00:03:35.880> you<00:03:35.970> know<00:03:36.090> so

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
it's like a shopping list do you know so

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.790 
it's like a shopping list do you know so
here<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.890> definitely<00:03:38.550> know<00:03:38.790> I<00:03:38.819> need<00:03:38.910> s<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:40.590> now

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
here I definitely know I need s so now

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.080 
here I definitely know I need s so now
that<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.069> have<00:03:41.160> written<00:03:41.520> all<00:03:41.670> these<00:03:41.880> things

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
that I have written all these things

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.960 
that I have written all these things
down<00:03:42.360> I<00:03:42.690> could<00:03:42.959> just<00:03:43.110> calculate<00:03:43.680> them<00:03:43.950> so<00:03:44.940> i

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
down I could just calculate them so i

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.970 
down I could just calculate them so i
need<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.510> average<00:03:46.140> i<00:03:48.200> also<00:03:49.200> need<00:03:49.530> them<00:03:49.680> you

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
need the average i also need them you

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.650 
need the average i also need them you

from the problem 64.8 get my excel Beck

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.570 
from the problem 64.8 get my excel Beck

all right sixty four point eight point
eight<00:04:05.850> and<00:04:06.620> i<00:04:07.620> need<00:04:07.890> to<00:04:08.010> get<00:04:08.130> my<00:04:08.190> standard

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
eight and i need to get my standard

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.060 
eight and i need to get my standard
error<00:04:09.360> but<00:04:09.660> before<00:04:09.989> I<00:04:10.019> do<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.260> I<00:04:10.590> need<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.920> get

error but before I do that I need to get

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:19.550 
error but before I do that I need to get
s<00:04:11.660> standard<00:04:12.660> deviation<00:04:16.400> and<00:04:18.260> then<00:04:19.260> once<00:04:19.470> I

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
s standard deviation and then once I

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.140 
s standard deviation and then once I
have<00:04:19.680> standard<00:04:20.010> deviation<00:04:20.579> I<00:04:20.790> could<00:04:20.970> take

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
have standard deviation I could take

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.630 
have standard deviation I could take
that<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.660> divide<00:04:22.380> it<00:04:22.410> by<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.740> square<00:04:23.130> root<00:04:23.460> of

that and divide it by the square root of
n<00:04:23.940> which<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.510> 11<00:04:26.390> so<00:04:27.390> that's<00:04:27.660> my<00:04:27.930> standard

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
n which is 11 so that's my standard

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.010 
n which is 11 so that's my standard
error<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:29.340> once<00:04:29.760> I<00:04:29.940> have<00:04:30.150> all<00:04:30.419> of<00:04:30.479> these

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.850 
error and once I have all of these
ingredients<00:04:31.370> now<00:04:32.370> I<00:04:32.400> could<00:04:32.880> assemble<00:04:33.180> my<00:04:33.510> tea

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
ingredients now I could assemble my tea

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.600 
ingredients now I could assemble my tea
which<00:04:34.860> is<00:04:35.070> X<00:04:35.340> bar<00:04:35.960> minus<00:04:36.960> mu<00:04:38.180> divided<00:04:39.180> by

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
which is X bar minus mu divided by

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.530 
which is X bar minus mu divided by
standard<00:04:41.610> error<00:04:41.850> and<00:04:42.410> I<00:04:43.410> get<00:04:43.620> a<00:04:44.180> seven<00:04:45.180> point

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
standard error and I get a seven point

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.650 
standard error and I get a seven point
nine<00:04:45.720> seven<00:04:46.290> so<00:04:46.680> that's<00:04:46.919> that's<00:04:47.400> way<00:04:48.300> higher

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
nine seven so that's that's way higher

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:56.830 
nine seven so that's that's way higher
than<00:04:49.580> 2.2<00:04:51.470> so<00:04:52.470> I'm<00:04:52.950> pretty<00:04:53.370> sure<00:04:53.490> I<00:04:53.940> can<00:04:54.950> step<00:04:55.950> 5

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
than 2.2 so I'm pretty sure I can step 5

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.719 
than 2.2 so I'm pretty sure I can step 5
reject<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:58.020> null<00:04:58.669> right<00:04:59.960> and<00:05:01.490> so<00:05:02.490> if<00:05:02.610> I<00:05:02.700> go

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
reject the null right and so if I go

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.190 
reject the null right and so if I go
back<00:05:02.940> to<00:05:03.150> my<00:05:03.360> problem<00:05:04.460> then<00:05:05.570> let<00:05:06.570> me<00:05:06.720> see<00:05:06.960> is

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
back to my problem then let me see is

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.350 
back to my problem then let me see is
there<00:05:07.890> sufficient<00:05:08.190> evidence<00:05:08.610> to<00:05:09.060> say<00:05:09.330> that

there sufficient evidence to say that
