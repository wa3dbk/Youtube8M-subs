wind<00:01:08.200> everything<00:01:10.260> engine<00:01:11.260> did<00:01:11.410> not<00:01:11.620> see<00:01:11.950> that

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
wind everything engine did not see that

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.880 
wind everything engine did not see that
but<00:01:12.430> ninja<00:01:12.910> didn't<00:01:13.390> get<00:01:13.510> hurt<00:01:13.690> too<00:01:13.960> much<00:01:14.140> i<00:01:14.410> was

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
but ninja didn't get hurt too much i was

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.550 
but ninja didn't get hurt too much i was
busy<00:01:15.070> talking<00:01:15.390> anywho<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:17.140> more<00:01:17.410> when

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
busy talking anywho and more when

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.590 
busy talking anywho and more when
everything<00:01:18.040> had<00:01:18.160> a<00:01:18.190> value<00:01:18.700> in<00:01:18.940> this<00:01:19.119> game<00:01:19.360> not

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
everything had a value in this game not

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.620 
everything had a value in this game not
so<00:01:19.780> much<00:01:19.990> so<00:01:20.800> half<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.220> random<00:01:22.180> stuff<00:01:22.450> you

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
so much so half the random stuff you

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.280 
so much so half the random stuff you
find<00:01:22.840> is<00:01:23.050> useless<00:01:23.650> which<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:25.479> pretty<00:01:25.810> poor

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
find is useless which is pretty poor

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.390 
find is useless which is pretty poor
mechanic<00:01:26.860> that's<00:01:27.040> like<00:01:28.500> did<00:01:29.500> they<00:01:29.680> buy<00:01:30.009> it<00:01:30.070> for

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
mechanic that's like did they buy it for

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.230 
mechanic that's like did they buy it for
free<00:01:31.350> then<00:01:32.350> how<00:01:32.590> did<00:01:32.650> they<00:01:32.920> get<00:01:33.100> it<00:01:33.250> it's<00:01:34.210> not

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
free then how did they get it it's not

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.020 
free then how did they get it it's not
worth<00:01:34.360> anything<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.860> a<00:01:35.979> flawed<00:01:36.250> mechanic<00:01:36.880> I

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
worth anything it's a flawed mechanic I

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.840 
worth anything it's a flawed mechanic I
think<00:01:37.300> it<00:01:38.290> keeps<00:01:38.440> you<00:01:38.619> from<00:01:38.740> getting<00:01:38.920> gold

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
think it keeps you from getting gold

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.730 
think it keeps you from getting gold
really<00:01:40.210> quickly<00:01:40.690> but<00:01:40.869> also<00:01:41.229> it<00:01:42.190> makes<00:01:42.490> sense

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
really quickly but also it makes sense

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.740 
really quickly but also it makes sense
this<00:01:44.740> is<00:01:44.890> the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
this is the

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.980 
this is the
I<00:01:48.180> retarded

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.440 

usually<00:01:52.770> somebody<00:01:52.950> down<00:01:53.250> there<00:01:53.450> sometime

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
usually somebody down there sometime

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.130 
usually somebody down there sometime
through<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.780> dog

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.420 

see<00:02:00.710> if<00:02:00.770> we<00:02:00.860> can<00:02:00.979> just<00:02:01.010> they're<00:02:01.820> down<00:02:01.940> there

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
see if we can just they're down there

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:17.120 
see if we can just they're down there
I<00:02:02.520> can<00:02:03.120> see<00:02:03.450> them<00:02:03.650> since<00:02:04.650> them

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.760 

yes<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.970> got<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.210> go<00:02:18.270> up<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.600> go<00:02:18.690> down<00:02:18.870> makes

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
yes you got to go up and go down makes

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.510 
yes you got to go up and go down makes
