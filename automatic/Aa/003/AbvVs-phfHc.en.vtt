00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.990
 your home welcome to android for 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.660
 he called and approached the good weather 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.210
 you're going out there, you're going to end 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.679
 week you go to the pool and say 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.960
 Please, I ran out of battery and today 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.609
 we came loaded that important today 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.050
 we bring a lot of accessories all 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.820
 they watch only Carlos as we speak 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.189
 with the people of chido and that we already want 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.570
 there I want to send products because 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.279
 we knew that we have a product of 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.599
 quality and we said today to send us 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.490
 some of the most elements 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.109
 representative of our catalog and 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.590
 we have these from here of which 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.590
 let's talk 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.690
 so without more let's start with a 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.010
 of the batteries that we said host this 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.350
 You not have to leave because 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.940
 the world is truly interesting 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.379
 the batteries the truth that why 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.030
 tell already we said these videos 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.949
 we only do it in a timely manner is 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.540
 something that we find some products 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.760
 let's say it's really worth it 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.440
 if you are an athlete if you go camping 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.790
 if you go to the pool this is one of 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.440
 the few batteries that really you 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.659
 can get a hard eye because it's 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.119
 quite differential the girl all 9000 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.009
 an external battery evidently of 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.780
 9000 thousand previous as you are 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.880
 imagining but that has an element 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.920
 very different since it is much more 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.750
 resistant of the usual is prepared 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.520
 Well, so we can take her there for 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.069
 those who do sports take it to 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.750
 snowboarding the countryside to the mountain 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.159
 where you want as it is more 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.920
 resistant carlos that has the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.630
 IP 66 protocol and this is very important 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.759
 that I know not that there is another battery 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.979
 at least that I know that you can 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.450
 do not immerse obviously not metais 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.460
 the pool with the battery which would be 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.020
 quite strange but you know that if 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.819
 it rains you give him a hose to 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.340
 clean whatever is held accurate and 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.229
 it will also increase dust or sand 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.909
 for example we can drop and see 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.350
 that there is no problem without dirty 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.049
 How good that we are in contact 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.390
 with the sand or with the earth even the 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.069
 people from zero tells us that they are 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.020
 certified for subway and media falls 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.880
 they have tried more than 12 addresses or 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.319
 we have not tried so much but yes 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.490
 it's true that we have not dropped and today 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.840
 is I do not say problem and another bullshit 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.869
 also that we liked it a lot and 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.039
 comes very straight for the kind of 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.720
 people who may be interested 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.910
 this battery is that as taught calls 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.980
 we have a small little arm 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.660
 hoop which we will be able to introduce 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.829
 in a carabiner on anything and 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.840
 take it for example hanging from the 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:21.239
 backpack yes very useful and as you can see also 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.860
 we can remove this small cap of 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.900
 rubber that hides the most important thing 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.329
 a battery evidently the connections 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.400
 usb you see we have an entry of 2 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.620
 amps to charge this battery and 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.690
 we have an output of 2 with one amps 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.940
 the greater amperage that these are giving 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.260
 batteries that we only have one we have 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.090
 seen in other batteries that we could 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.799
 download two devices is not the case 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.120
 to finish this battery only 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.920
 mention those that logically we have a 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.230
 button to turn it on and could not 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.150
 missing the four leds to indicate the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.920
 state of it effectively already 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.880
 now let's continue with another battery 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.130
 is 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.490
 little bit more traditional so to speak 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.230
 the power plus of 10 thousand 400 milliamps 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.420
 as you are seeing is a tad more 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.060
 larger than the previous one since they contain 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.620
 greater storage now that yes yes 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.730
 that there is something important and differential and 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.010
 is that here we can load 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.720
 carlos two devices taking their 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.800
 output of one amp and another output of 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.120
 two with this is one more matter 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.830
 traditional the other we have seen that for 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.970
 athletes is only for the 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.530
 people who want a little more 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.970
 10,000 milliamps the truth that no 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.430
 It is not bad and as it says it calls for 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.200
 to be able to load two today because more than 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.550
 enough important details that we 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.900
 has called attention we have a button and 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.880
 We have different LEDs 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.920
 notifications also to inform us 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.360
 of the state and the most striking thing and that 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.920
 sure you have noticed is the 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.600
 design looks very much like boxes 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.730
 of both and effectively this design of 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.100
 drum that was so famous was made as a result of 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.660
 japan and then on the internet and like 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.820
 Carlos who also has the same design 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.130
 since the ine in the eyes also the 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.110
 cable has the two milestones of the usb drum 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.330
 Bolt will go nombrecito having 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.100
 put and that is pretty eye-catching 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.230
 Carlos, because he has something very important 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.420
 since it has micro usb and also 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.560
 lighting charger for iphone already 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.300
 We have said we have selected over 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.610
 all devices that have something 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.140
 the value that they are differential and can 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.970
 have your partner or your brother you 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.310
 mother that I have an iphone you have to 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.650
 living with her has to respect him 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.090
 I understand that one day I wanted to pick it up 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.350
 in the neck at good prices you have 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.330
 that learn to live with it then you 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.950
 you're traveling and you know that the blows to 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.600
 can load the important this case 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.459
 It is available in different measures of 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.950
 our 25 centimeters there are more 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.170
 little one of 10 50 a meter and meter 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.520
 eighty I like long cables not 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.200
 is on the bedside table and sometimes 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.250
 you are suffering exact and one of the 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.780
 flashy things as we said 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.460
 previously apart from the design is that 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.800
 when you connect it as you can see there 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.140
 eyes that have the drum 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.730
 illuminate depending on whether you are charging 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.620
 from the device and it's already loaded 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.880
 there is nothing plugged in color change and 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.250
 it has been a very simple and fast way 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.690
 as you see in what state by not having to 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.280
 turn on the device to know if 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.900
 is one hundred percent of the load and now 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.660
 to finish calls the last one or 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.820
 gadget is not a battery I do not think that 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.890
 when we told you the same thing is that 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.800
 you do not want it to send here 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.480
 we have a mini drum a doll that 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.460
 has the peculiarity that also 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.260
 they light their eyes révolté cdom 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.849
 I keep this is the name that we put 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.819
 this is useless 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.199
 and this is just a bullshit that 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.270
 it's funny and it has a 5 button and 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:13.169
 the eyes light up and the arms are 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:15.479
 items that roll butt range but 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:20.279
 does not have no elbows on my knees 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:22.009
 to mark them yes but no no what is what 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:24.149
 there's so nothing hears these have been the 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.830
 accessories what we wanted to bring 

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:27.289
 today very focused especially to the 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.059
 autonomy we know that it is important 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.949
 quick review carlos bacteria 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:34.589
 resistant to water resistant to dust 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.689
 9,000 milliamps and that is also very 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:38.789
 easy to carry due to the salt that 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:40.080
 have here then we have one more battery 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.240
 conventional with a pretty design 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.519
 attractive 10 thousand 400,000 anterios and two 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.439
 exact cable connections that we have for 

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:48.240
 charge micro usb or also for a 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:49.889
 pretty interesting iphone in 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.509
 different sizes and one thing that does not 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.339
 brings nothing but cool things that 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:55.379
 they always say cool as always 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:57.419
 price section the section of 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:59.309
 description and so we leave down the 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.529
 purchase links of each one of them you 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:02.849
 Take a look how we say four 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:04.139
 four accessories batteries with a lot 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:07.099
 personality so nothing see you 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:07.099
 soon with more than now well
