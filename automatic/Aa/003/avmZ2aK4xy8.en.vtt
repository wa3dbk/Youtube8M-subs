00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
embedded in the wheel and we've made

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.150 
embedded in the wheel and we've made
sure<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.750> roll<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.260> car<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.649> such<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> way<00:00:50.129> that

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
sure to roll the car in such a way that

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.430 
sure to roll the car in such a way that
that's<00:00:50.460> straight<00:00:50.940> up<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.239> down<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
that's straight up and down we have the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.830 
that's straight up and down we have the
word<00:00:52.590> Porsche<00:00:53.100> which<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.270> brake<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
word Porsche which is on the brake and

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.020 
word Porsche which is on the brake and
then<00:00:55.350> we<00:00:55.469> have<00:00:55.620> some<00:00:55.829> custom<00:00:56.280> graphics<00:00:56.820> that

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
then we have some custom graphics that

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.880 
then we have some custom graphics that
are<00:00:57.149> further<00:00:57.420> down<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.899> car<00:00:58.140> that's<00:00:58.680> saying

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
are further down the car that's saying

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.880 
are further down the car that's saying
911s<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.449> my<00:01:00.600> framing<00:01:01.140> right<00:01:01.289> now<00:01:01.559> is

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
911s and so my framing right now is

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.619 
911s and so my framing right now is
pretty<00:01:02.160> much<00:01:02.370> from<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.059> front<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.420> wheel

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
pretty much from the front of the wheel

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.080 
pretty much from the front of the wheel
to<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.439> back<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.949> graphic<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.640> I'm

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
to the back of the graphic and I'm

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.390 
to the back of the graphic and I'm
shooting<00:01:06.479> at<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.810> very<00:01:07.229> shallow<00:01:07.710> depth<00:01:08.220> of

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
shooting at a very shallow depth of

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.390 
shooting at a very shallow depth of
field<00:01:08.460> I'm<00:01:08.850> shooting<00:01:09.240> wide<00:01:09.510> open<00:01:09.990> at<00:01:10.110> f/2<00:01:10.770> now

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
field I'm shooting wide open at f/2 now

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.179 
field I'm shooting wide open at f/2 now
the<00:01:11.460> reason<00:01:11.880> I'm<00:01:11.970> doing<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:13.200> want<00:01:13.890> this

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
the reason I'm doing that is I want this

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.870 
the reason I'm doing that is I want this
part<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:15.390> really<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.770> attention<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
part to really get the attention of the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.850 
part to really get the attention of the
viewer<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.630> want<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.020> part<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.560> sort<00:01:19.740> of

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
viewer and I want this part to sort of

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.310 
viewer and I want this part to sort of
be<00:01:20.070> secretive<00:01:20.939> not<00:01:21.600> something<00:01:22.020> that's<00:01:22.110> really

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
be secretive not something that's really

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.170 
be secretive not something that's really
an<00:01:22.740> important<00:01:23.400> part<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> photograph<00:01:24.150> but

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
an important part of the photograph but

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.240 
an important part of the photograph but
just<00:01:24.600> sort<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.840> there<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.290> lend<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.680> hint<00:01:26.009> so

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
I've set this camera up on a tripod I'm

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.649 
I've set this camera up on a tripod I'm
using<00:01:29.130> what<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.790> think<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.240> probably<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
using what I think is probably the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.210 
using what I think is probably the
perfect<00:01:30.840> tripod<00:01:31.380> for<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.650> Micro<00:01:31.979> Four<00:01:32.189> Thirds

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
perfect tripod for a Micro Four Thirds

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.130 
perfect tripod for a Micro Four Thirds
camera<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.000> new<00:01:33.240> Ben<00:01:33.450> romy<00:01:33.840> photo

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
camera tripod this is their carbon fiber

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.929 
camera tripod this is their carbon fiber
tripod<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.130> has<00:01:38.280> all<00:01:38.430> kinds<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.790> cool

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
tripod and it has all kinds of cool

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.490 
tripod and it has all kinds of cool
things<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.420> make<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.810> legs<00:01:40.020> go<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.259> all

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
things you can make the legs go in all

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.170 
things you can make the legs go in all
kinds<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.890> interesting<00:01:41.250> angles<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.000> why

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
kinds of interesting angles and why

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.450 
kinds of interesting angles and why
that's<00:01:42.390> important<00:01:42.930> here<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:43.860> follows

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
that's important here is as follows

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.910 
that's important here is as follows
notice<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.390> my<00:01:45.600> camera<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.350> pretty<00:01:46.770> much

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
notice that my camera is pretty much

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.420 
notice that my camera is pretty much
perpendicular<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.960> car<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.950> don't<00:01:50.220> want

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
perpendicular to the car you don't want

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.819 
perpendicular to the car you don't want
to<00:01:50.520> tilt<00:01:50.729> down<00:01:50.850> or<00:01:51.390> up<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> really<00:01:52.680> wide

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
to tilt down or up with a really wide

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.649 
to tilt down or up with a really wide
angle<00:01:53.280> lens<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:53.880> you'll<00:01:54.000> get<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> lot<00:01:54.450> of

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
angle lens because you'll get a lot of

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.380 
angle lens because you'll get a lot of
distortion<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.860> what<00:01:55.979> I'm<00:01:56.100> doing<00:01:56.130> here<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.939> I'm

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
distortion so what I'm doing here is I'm

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.389 
distortion so what I'm doing here is I'm
trying<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.810> keep<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.259> camera<00:01:58.950> somewhat

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
trying to keep the camera somewhat

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.760 
trying to keep the camera somewhat
perpendicular<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.600> car<00:02:00.810> that's<00:02:01.049> stage

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
perpendicular to the car that's stage

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.190 
perpendicular to the car that's stage
one<00:02:02.070> stage<00:02:02.310> two<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.969> don't<00:02:03.689> have<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> lot<00:02:04.170> of

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
one stage two I don't have a lot of

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.749 
one stage two I don't have a lot of
light<00:02:04.500> we're<00:02:04.740> working<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.250> here<00:02:05.430> with<00:02:05.579> some

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
that I can make my exposure manually and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.030 
that I can make my exposure manually and
if<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.750> look<00:02:21.959> here<00:02:21.990> you'll<00:02:22.380> see<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.860> I'm

my main point of focus and you can see

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.290 
my main point of focus and you can see
there's<00:02:28.590> an<00:02:28.680> histogram<00:02:29.310> here<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.850> this

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
there's an histogram here and this

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.630 
there's an histogram here and this
histogram<00:02:30.690> makes<00:02:31.230> sure<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.950> don't<00:02:32.310> blow

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
histogram makes sure that I don't blow

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.280 
histogram makes sure that I don't blow
out<00:02:32.819> any<00:02:33.060> highlights<00:02:33.480> I'm<00:02:33.810> purposely

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
out any highlights I'm purposely

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.410 
out any highlights I'm purposely
underexposing<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:35.610> particular<00:02:35.910> image

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
underexposing this particular image

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.880 
underexposing this particular image
because<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:37.020> want<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.350> be<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.470> little<00:02:37.650> more

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
because I want it to be a little more

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.160 
because I want it to be a little more
dramatic<00:02:38.069> I<00:02:38.700> could<00:02:39.180> add<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.420> little<00:02:39.600> bit<00:02:40.050> of

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
dramatic I could add a little bit of

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.260 
dramatic I could add a little bit of
exposure<00:02:40.530> here<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.100> probably<00:02:41.819> make<00:02:41.940> what

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
exposure here and probably make what

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.760 
exposure here and probably make what
would<00:02:42.390> be<00:02:42.480> considered<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.959> perfect<00:02:43.170> exposure

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
would be considered a perfect exposure

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.800 
would be considered a perfect exposure
for<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.100> for<00:02:44.250> artistic<00:02:44.790> reasons<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.300> want<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.630> go
