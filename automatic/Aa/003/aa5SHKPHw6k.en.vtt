00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.100
 I was recently asked for it 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.710
 to show a vegan karachi 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.220
 yes, this I would from beet 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.619
 do 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.519
 and yes I had that two sauces for it 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.310
 once a classic testo and then 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.300
 still be a school sauces if yes 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.040
 I should not know that 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.350
 classic kabak is actually coming out 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.329
 beef is made very thin 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.760
 is cut 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:45.660
 and basically, I 'm doing with the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:47.489
 red pray also to the peeler and if 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.120
 her a bread slicer at home 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.780
 unfortunately have carpet is not here then 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.949
 could even take the whole beetroot 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.710
 and these in very thin slices 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.180
 because I now only cut a counter 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.190
 it just has to go like that 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.140
 I will now a big piece 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.619
 from about as much as I did with the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.640
 Skull ran so do not come too wide 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:16.080
 and there creeps then run it 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:18.450
 write off and that can of course 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.240
 to serve on a plate and that 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.240
 put the best circular and always 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.240
 slightly overlapping one behind the other 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.670
 it takes a bit so to you 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.130
 soon is finished then goes first as 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.380
 you need sauces for the pesto first 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.090
 the pine nuts about three 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.400
 spoon and they will be first 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.430
 roasted a coated skillet 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.380
 and without fat you can heat up the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.450
 first break down on full stage but 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.829
 as soon as it is really hot you can 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.409
 In any case, turn it down about 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:57.110
 in the middle heat because the clinics 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.110
 otherwise they turn black a little too fast 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.880
 and they should already be brown 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.700
 enough space then you need one 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.789
 highest possible container and basil 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.690
 I have half a bunch here now 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.970
 could first of the slightly larger 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.170
 free styles 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.650
 then there can be something like that 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.620
 cooled caught him we know about 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.840
 half to 1 teaspoon salt and then 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.550
 first cold water approx 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:35.209
 three tablespoons and that could already be 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:37.160
 time for her and then comes one 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.799
 toe garlic, the can ye 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.450
 times chop with and why 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.660
 I give the players this and also 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.660
 No olive oil in it is because of that 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.599
 one olive oil or pureed or if one 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.260
 Body cells are too long to be operated on 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.459
 just pretty bitter 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.700
 so now led again briefly 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.670
 the tuber and in no case too long 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:06.170
 and then come back to about 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:09.560
 five to six tablespoons and that should 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.590
 a few and I ever lose that 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.769
 pesto says you need to sit again 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.970
 a coated pan without fat and 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.900
 about 34 kesha know and that equips 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.880
 her a little bit too 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.810
 as soon as they got politics 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.319
 take from the stove 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:34.040
 then you need a high tube again 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:36.230
 and of course, one or two 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.620
 teaspoon depending on how strong first 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:44.720
 mr then about three tablespoons 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:49.549
 soja saale a half is a teaspoon 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:54.739
 salt and of course the cashew kernels that 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.910
 it is mashed fine again so that 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.180
 at least it has the right consistency 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.670
 to pass on the capo nicely 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.120
 but if you like something more fluid 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.159
 you just want to have one more 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.510
 a little soy milk or another 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.900
 Add a little water 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:16.579
 now you can do the pesto and yourself 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:21.410
 easily spread on the body 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:30.919
 and so that every possible slice 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:30.919
 something comes off so clever cost 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:53.460
 So the runway already delicious that for 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:54.930
 Knut fans and themselves since is 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.170
 really strong but I think 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.760
 myself was wonderfully suited to red pray 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.770
 In any case , it is a very simple one 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.480
 before column falls a bit even if 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.840
 I can not stop myself bread machine like that 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:11.190
 as I am now but otherwise 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.020
 really very tasty thing yes in the 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.790
 I wish you much fun and 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.790
 last names and until the next
