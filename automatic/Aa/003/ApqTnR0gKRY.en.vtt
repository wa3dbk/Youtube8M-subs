00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.810 

so<00:00:20.710> I'm<00:00:20.769> gonna<00:00:20.890> start<00:00:21.189> with<00:00:21.250> the<00:00:21.400> talents<00:00:21.730> I

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
so I'm gonna start with the talents I

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.359 
so I'm gonna start with the talents I
think<00:00:22.029> most<00:00:22.419> benefits<00:00:22.900> demonology<00:00:23.529> on<00:00:24.220> the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
think most benefits demonology on the

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.220 
think most benefits demonology on the
first<00:00:24.579> row<00:00:24.849> I<00:00:25.029> chose<00:00:25.300> dark<00:00:25.630> regeneration

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
first row I chose dark regeneration

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.709 
first row I chose dark regeneration
usually<00:00:26.710> for<00:00:26.829> 30%<00:00:27.340> of<00:00:27.609> your<00:00:27.730> health<00:00:27.939> and<00:00:28.210> you

00:00:28.709 --> 00:00:28.719 
usually for 30% of your health and you

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:30.479 
usually for 30% of your health and you
can<00:00:28.750> still<00:00:29.050> run<00:00:29.289> around<00:00:29.439> and<00:00:29.800> cast<00:00:30.309> your

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
can still run around and cast your

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.040 
can still run around and cast your
spell's<00:00:30.759> walls<00:00:31.000> up

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
spell's walls up

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.170 
spell's walls up
it<00:00:32.320> can't<00:00:32.589> be<00:00:32.739> dispelled<00:00:33.460> it<00:00:33.730> can't<00:00:34.030> be

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
it can't be dispelled it can't be

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.729 
it can't be dispelled it can't be
interrupted<00:00:34.480> so<00:00:35.050> I<00:00:35.079> think<00:00:35.199> that's<00:00:35.470> far

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
interrupted so I think that's far

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.969 
interrupted so I think that's far
superior<00:00:35.920> to<00:00:36.190> so<00:00:36.460> leach<00:00:36.699> and<00:00:36.909> harvest<00:00:37.659> life<00:00:37.979> on

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:38.979 
superior to so leach and harvest life on

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:40.799 
superior to so leach and harvest life on
the<00:00:39.129> next<00:00:39.399> set<00:00:39.579> that<00:00:39.790> shows<00:00:40.000> mortal<00:00:40.570> coil

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
the next set that shows mortal coil

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.910 
the next set that shows mortal coil
heals<00:00:41.290> me<00:00:41.500> for<00:00:41.710> 62<00:00:42.159> K<00:00:42.430> which<00:00:42.760> is<00:00:42.909> 15%<00:00:43.390> and<00:00:44.110> also

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
heals me for 62 K which is 15% and also

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.469 
heals me for 62 K which is 15% and also
since<00:00:45.129> the<00:00:45.250> enemy<00:00:45.370> running<00:00:45.760> in<00:00:45.879> horror<00:00:46.120> for<00:00:46.300> 3

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:46.479 
since the enemy running in horror for 3

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.420 
since the enemy running in horror for 3
seconds<00:00:46.899> so<00:00:47.470> it's<00:00:47.589> extra<00:00:48.010> healing

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
seconds so it's extra healing

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.179 
seconds so it's extra healing
survivability<00:00:49.320> CC<00:00:50.320> and<00:00:50.589> I<00:00:50.710> think<00:00:50.890> where<00:00:51.009> ever

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:51.189 
survivability CC and I think where ever

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:52.770 
survivability CC and I think where ever
you<00:00:51.309> can<00:00:51.400> pick<00:00:51.610> those<00:00:51.850> up<00:00:51.879> you<00:00:52.600> should

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
you can pick those up you should

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.469 
you can pick those up you should
definitely<00:00:53.170> take<00:00:53.259> that<00:00:53.470> opportunity<00:00:54.360> since<00:00:55.360> I

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
definitely take that opportunity since I

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.259 
definitely take that opportunity since I
am<00:00:55.689> going<00:00:56.199> with<00:00:56.320> grim<00:00:56.769> our<00:00:56.890> sacrifice<00:00:57.489> on<00:00:58.119> the

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
am going with grim our sacrifice on the

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.479 
am going with grim our sacrifice on the
3rd<00:00:58.509> set<00:00:58.750> of<00:00:58.869> talents<00:00:59.229> I<00:00:59.320> chose<00:00:59.559> dark<00:00:59.949> bargain

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
3rd set of talents I chose dark bargain

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.749 
3rd set of talents I chose dark bargain

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:03.759 
I like this thing because it like

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:06.090 
I like this thing because it like

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
prevents all down for 8 seconds it can't

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.460 
prevents all down for 8 seconds it can't
be<00:01:06.280> broken<00:01:06.460> there<00:01:07.180> is<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.390> downside<00:01:07.930> to<00:01:07.960> F<00:01:08.259> on

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
be broken there is a downside to F on

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.469 
be broken there is a downside to F on
where<00:01:08.710> 50%<00:01:09.159> of<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.520> damage<00:01:09.850> prevented<00:01:10.329> is

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
where 50% of the damage prevented is

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.749 
where 50% of the damage prevented is
dealt<00:01:11.229> back<00:01:11.409> to<00:01:11.650> so<00:01:12.130> I<00:01:12.159> do<00:01:12.280> found<00:01:12.610> myself

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
dealt back to so I do found myself

dealt back to so I do found myself
having<00:01:13.119> to<00:01:13.329> help<00:01:13.509> my<00:01:13.600> survivals<00:01:14.079> and<00:01:14.229> heal<00:01:14.829> is

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
having to help my survivals and heal is

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.810 
having to help my survivals and heal is
just<00:01:15.220> to<00:01:15.280> survive<00:01:15.549> when<00:01:15.759> it's<00:01:15.880> done<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:17.820> with

the<00:01:18.970> 4th<00:01:19.240> set<00:01:19.420> of<00:01:19.540> taunts<00:01:19.869> I<00:01:19.990> decided<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.500> go

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
the 4th set of taunts I decided to go

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.920 
the 4th set of taunts I decided to go
with<00:01:20.649> blood<00:01:21.009> fear<00:01:21.250> /<00:01:21.729> unbound<00:01:22.210> will<00:01:22.509> though

with blood fear / unbound will though

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.899 
with blood fear / unbound will though
some<00:01:23.200> may<00:01:23.350> argue<00:01:23.530> that<00:01:23.650> unbound<00:01:24.159> wills<00:01:24.400> a<00:01:24.610> lot

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
some may argue that unbound wills a lot

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.670 
some may argue that unbound wills a lot
better<00:01:25.150> for<00:01:25.540> a<00:01:25.570> lot<00:01:25.780> of<00:01:25.810> different<00:01:26.170> reasons<00:01:26.290> I

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
better for a lot of different reasons I

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.620 
better for a lot of different reasons I
like<00:01:27.190> blood<00:01:27.430> fear<00:01:27.640> because<00:01:28.000> allows<00:01:28.420> me<00:01:28.540> to

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
like blood fear because allows me to

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.630

damage by 5% and when he activated by
25%<00:02:08.679> I<00:02:08.950> like<00:02:09.670> using<00:02:09.909> this<00:02:10.149> because<00:02:10.209> when<00:02:10.659> an

25% I like using this because when an

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.720 
25% I like using this because when an
