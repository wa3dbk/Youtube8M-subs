00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.389 

I've<00:00:00.840> been<00:00:01.110> having<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:01.500> hardest<00:00:01.829> time<00:00:01.949> making

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
I've been having the hardest time making

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.830 
I've been having the hardest time making
this<00:00:02.520> video<00:00:02.909> because<00:00:03.120> it's<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.570> really

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
this video because it's a really

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.930 
this video because it's a really
important<00:00:04.319> topic<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:04.859> yet<00:00:05.040> I<00:00:05.069> don't<00:00:05.220> seem<00:00:05.790> to

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
important topic and yet I don't seem to

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.690 
important topic and yet I don't seem to
be<00:00:06.060> able<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.690> think<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.740> way<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:07.919> convey<00:00:08.519> the

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
be able to think of a way to convey the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.930 
be able to think of a way to convey the
importance<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.630> topic<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.559> that's<00:00:11.490> the

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
importance of the topic and that's the

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.759 
importance of the topic and that's the
difference<00:00:12.389> between<00:00:12.450> learning<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.500> truth

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
difference between learning the truth

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.680 
difference between learning the truth
and<00:00:14.130> handling<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.299> truth<00:00:15.949> in<00:00:16.949> my<00:00:17.160> opinion<00:00:17.520> is

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
and handling the truth in my opinion is

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.269 
and handling the truth in my opinion is
entirely<00:00:18.690> different<00:00:19.109> skill<00:00:19.650> set<00:00:19.949> that's

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
entirely different skill set that's

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.429 
entirely different skill set that's
necessary<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.060> learn<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.570> truth<00:00:21.810> compared<00:00:22.350> to

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
necessary to learn the truth compared to

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.740 
necessary to learn the truth compared to
what's<00:00:22.650> necessary<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.310> handle<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.000> truth<00:00:24.300> and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
what's necessary to handle the truth and

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.759 
what's necessary to handle the truth and
if<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.830> don't<00:00:26.390> react<00:00:27.390> properly<00:00:28.170> when<00:00:28.740> you

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
if you don't react properly when you

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.009 
if you don't react properly when you
learn<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.130> truth<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.880> don't<00:00:30.090> handle<00:00:30.869> that

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
learn the truth and don't handle that

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.020 
learn the truth and don't handle that
information<00:00:31.320> correctly<00:00:32.219> then<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.759> didn't

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
information correctly then it didn't

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.490 
information correctly then it didn't
really<00:00:33.149> do<00:00:33.420> any<00:00:33.540> good<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.809> learn<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
really do any good to learn it in the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.430 
really do any good to learn it in the
first<00:00:34.710> place<00:00:35.149> so<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.270> my<00:00:36.450> opinion<00:00:36.570> handling

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
first place so in my opinion handling

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.220 
first place so in my opinion handling
the<00:00:37.590> truth<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.160> just<00:00:38.520> as<00:00:39.450> important<00:00:39.960> if<00:00:40.170> not

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
the truth is just as important if not

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.740 
the truth is just as important if not
more<00:00:40.440> important<00:00:41.399> than<00:00:41.610> learning<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
more important than learning it in the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.670 
more important than learning it in the
first<00:00:42.960> place<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.510> way<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:46.020> one<00:00:46.289> video

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
first place so in a way this one video

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.729 
first place so in a way this one video
is<00:00:47.899> potentially<00:00:48.899> more<00:00:49.079> important<00:00:49.500> than<00:00:49.620> all

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
is potentially more important than all

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.439 
is potentially more important than all
the<00:00:49.890> other<00:00:50.039> ones<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.550> mine<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.090> you'll<00:00:51.210> see

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
the other ones of mine that you'll see

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.850 
the other ones of mine that you'll see
and<00:00:52.280> and<00:00:53.420> yet<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:55.020> kind<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.410> dull<00:00:55.620> topic

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
and and yet it's kind of a dull topic

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.709 
and and yet it's kind of a dull topic
and<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.309> don't<00:00:56.370> know<00:00:56.699> how<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.969> make<00:00:57.539> it

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
and I don't know how to make it

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.910 
and I don't know how to make it
interesting<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.199> I've<00:00:58.410> been<00:00:58.559> really<00:00:58.800> been

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
interesting so I've been really been

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.529 
interesting so I've been really been
struggling<00:00:59.340> with<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.640> video<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.329> just

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
struggling with this video and I just

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.760 
struggling with this video and I just
want<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.719> get<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.960> out<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.260> way<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.590> can

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
want to get it out of the way so I can

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.050 
want to get it out of the way so I can
move<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.190> more<00:01:02.460> interesting<00:01:03.030> topics<00:01:04.790> in<00:01:05.790> my

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
move on to more interesting topics in my

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.570 
move on to more interesting topics in my
opinion<00:01:06.570> they're<00:01:07.110> two<00:01:07.680> skills<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.250> will

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
opinion they're two skills that will

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.609 
opinion they're two skills that will
really<00:01:08.790> help<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.210> lot<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.659> handling<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.350> truth

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
really help a lot in handling the truth

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.870 
really help a lot in handling the truth
and<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.400> patience<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.420> focus<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:13.790> lot<00:01:14.790> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
and that is patience and focus a lot of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.570 
and that is patience and focus a lot of
people<00:01:15.210> when<00:01:15.390> they<00:01:15.540> learn<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.170> truth<00:01:16.580> they

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
people when they learn the truth they

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.880 
people when they learn the truth they
will<00:01:17.850> soon<00:01:18.540> go<00:01:18.840> back<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.229> blocking<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.770> out

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
will soon go back to blocking it out

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.100 
will soon go back to blocking it out
again<00:01:20.280> or<00:01:20.490> forgetting<00:01:20.850> about<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.360> because

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
again or forgetting about it because

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.200 
again or forgetting about it because
they<00:01:22.290> don't<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:22.830> any<00:01:22.979> simple<00:01:23.580> way<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.820> adjust

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
they don't see any simple way to adjust

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.080 
they don't see any simple way to adjust
to<00:01:25.020> what<00:01:25.200> they've<00:01:25.380> learned<00:01:25.680> or<00:01:26.310> incorporated

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
to what they've learned or incorporated

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.200 
to what they've learned or incorporated
into<00:01:27.270> their<00:01:27.540> lives<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.140> useful<00:01:28.590> way<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.340> so

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
into their lives and useful way and so

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.109 
into their lives and useful way and so
they<00:01:30.560> don't<00:01:31.560> want<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.829> just<00:01:31.979> know<00:01:32.759> about<00:01:32.970> a

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
they don't want to just know about a

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.120 
they don't want to just know about a
problem<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.720> not<00:01:33.930> do<00:01:34.110> anything<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.009> they

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
problem and not do anything and so they

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.300 
problem and not do anything and so they
block<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.430> out<00:01:35.780> having<00:01:36.780> patience<00:01:37.320> though<00:01:37.590> can

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
block it out having patience though can

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.149 
block it out having patience though can
help<00:01:38.670> people<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.680> recognize<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.950> don't

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
help people to recognize that you don't

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.399 
help people to recognize that you don't
have<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.520> solve<00:01:41.759> everything<00:01:42.090> at<00:01:42.420> once<00:01:42.630> your

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
have to solve everything at once your

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.170 
have to solve everything at once your
life<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.979> probably<00:01:44.159> pretty<00:01:44.579> good<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> way<00:01:45.060> it

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
life is probably pretty good the way it

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.120 
life is probably pretty good the way it
is<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.079> can<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.409> be<00:01:46.590> happy<00:01:46.950> with<00:01:47.100> that

is and you can just be happy with that
and<00:01:47.549> if<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.939> can<00:01:48.119> incorporate<00:01:48.659> changes<00:01:49.500> that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
and if you can incorporate changes that

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.889 
and if you can incorporate changes that

about them endlessly feeling that

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.820 
about them endlessly feeling that

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
nothing can be done until society is

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.520 
nothing can be done until society is
awakened<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.640> society<00:03:37.270> isn't<00:03:37.630> as

kind of the beginning and if you don't

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.580 
kind of the beginning and if you don't
