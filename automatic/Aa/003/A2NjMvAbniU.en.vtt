00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
type plating that looks at least

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.299 
type plating that looks at least
somewhat<00:00:37.090> reminiscent<00:00:37.510> of<00:00:37.870> aircraft<00:00:38.470> that's

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
somewhat reminiscent of aircraft that's

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.130 
somewhat reminiscent of aircraft that's
what<00:00:39.879> the<00:00:39.970> idea<00:00:40.090> was<00:00:40.420> anyway<00:00:40.750> that's<00:00:40.900> why<00:00:41.019> he's

what the idea was anyway that's why he's

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.020 
what the idea was anyway that's why he's
got<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.320> angular<00:00:41.860> armor<00:00:42.220> plates<00:00:42.519> and<00:00:42.850> the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
got the angular armor plates and the

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.479 
got the angular armor plates and the
little<00:00:43.239> rivets<00:00:43.800> throughout<00:00:44.800> I<00:00:44.830> made<00:00:45.190> all<00:00:45.339> the

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
little rivets throughout I made all the

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.180 
little rivets throughout I made all the
rivets<00:00:45.729> gold<00:00:46.089> just<00:00:46.930> to<00:00:47.229> give<00:00:47.739> him<00:00:47.860> some<00:00:48.070> more

of the yellow the Hydra has without

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.110 
of the yellow the Hydra has without
giving<00:00:50.199> him<00:00:50.260> a<00:00:50.350> lot<00:00:50.530> of<00:00:50.559> yellow<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:51.940> these

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.520 
giving him a lot of yellow for these
characters<00:00:52.600> we<00:00:52.750> wanted<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:53.019> go<00:00:53.140> with<00:00:53.170> a<00:00:53.290> more

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
characters we wanted to go with a more

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.979 
characters we wanted to go with a more
black<00:00:53.860> and<00:00:53.890> green<00:00:54.430> scheme<00:00:55.299> with<00:00:55.570> mostly

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
black and green scheme with mostly

black and green scheme with mostly
silver<00:00:56.530> type<00:00:56.909> detailing<00:00:57.909> with<00:00:58.059> yellow<00:00:58.600> as<00:00:58.720> an

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
silver type detailing with yellow as an

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.439 
silver type detailing with yellow as an
accent<00:00:59.350> color<00:00:59.409> only<00:00:59.830> so<00:01:00.580> that's<00:01:00.760> what<00:01:00.909> I<00:01:00.940> did<00:01:01.059> I

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
accent color only so that's what I did I

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.990 
accent color only so that's what I did I
didn't<00:01:02.350> want<00:01:02.500> to<00:01:02.559> make<00:01:02.619> his<00:01:02.799> helmet<00:01:03.190> as<00:01:03.339> bright

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
didn't want to make his helmet as bright

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.910 
didn't want to make his helmet as bright
silver<00:01:04.449> as<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.900> bottom<00:01:05.229> just<00:01:05.440> cuz<00:01:05.590> I<00:01:05.650> think<00:01:05.830> it

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
silver as the bottom just cuz I think it

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.050 
silver as the bottom just cuz I think it
would<00:01:06.010> have<00:01:06.100> stood<00:01:06.310> out<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.520> little<00:01:06.760> bit<00:01:06.940> too

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
would have stood out a little bit too

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.990 
would have stood out a little bit too
much<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.750> it<00:01:07.930> would<00:01:08.020> have<00:01:08.140> looked<00:01:08.350> like<00:01:09.000> it

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
much and it would have looked like it

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.980 
much and it would have looked like it
was<00:01:10.090> probably<00:01:10.270> too<00:01:10.540> big

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
was probably too big

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.670 
was probably too big
due<00:01:11.170> to<00:01:11.200> optical<00:01:11.820> illusion<00:01:12.820> type<00:01:13.210> things<00:01:13.750> you

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
due to optical illusion type things you

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.380 
due to optical illusion type things you
don't<00:01:14.799> want<00:01:14.979> to<00:01:15.070> have<00:01:15.189> a<00:01:15.219> really<00:01:15.549> bright<00:01:15.939> egg

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
don't want to have a really bright egg

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.630 
don't want to have a really bright egg
shape<00:01:16.960> for<00:01:17.409> someone's<00:01:17.740> head<00:01:17.979> so<00:01:18.159> I<00:01:18.219> made<00:01:18.430> it<00:01:18.549> a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
shape for someone's head so I made it a

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.550 
shape for someone's head so I made it a
gunmetal<00:01:18.939> color<00:01:19.119> and<00:01:19.509> I<00:01:19.539> think<00:01:19.750> that<00:01:19.960> was

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
gunmetal color and I think that was

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.959 
gunmetal color and I think that was
probably<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:21.039> good<00:01:21.219> choice<00:01:21.520> because<00:01:21.670> it<00:01:21.880> would

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:21.969 
probably a good choice because it would

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:23.160 
probably a good choice because it would
have<00:01:22.090> looked<00:01:22.180> like<00:01:22.299> an<00:01:22.509> egg<00:01:22.659> head<00:01:22.869> literally

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
have looked like an egg head literally

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.529 
have looked like an egg head literally
if<00:01:23.859> I<00:01:23.979> made<00:01:24.159> it<00:01:24.280> too<00:01:24.430> bright<00:01:24.609> at<00:01:25.180> least<00:01:25.359> that's

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
if I made it too bright at least that's

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.260 
if I made it too bright at least that's
my<00:01:25.659> take<00:01:25.899> on<00:01:26.049> it<00:01:26.109> I<00:01:26.439> mean<00:01:27.159> a<00:01:27.189> jet<00:01:27.429> pack<00:01:27.609> for<00:01:27.969> him

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
my take on it I mean a jet pack for him

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.410 
my take on it I mean a jet pack for him
out<00:01:28.750> of<00:01:29.289> parts<00:01:29.799> that<00:01:30.039> nobody<00:01:30.700> else<00:01:30.880> probably

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
out of parts that nobody else probably

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.039 
out of parts that nobody else probably
has<00:01:31.600> ever<00:01:31.899> used<00:01:32.289> in<00:01:32.979> a<00:01:33.130> custom<00:01:33.520> figure<00:01:34.049> before

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
has ever used in a custom figure before

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.730 
has ever used in a custom figure before
ever<00:01:35.530> and<00:01:36.039> that<00:01:36.070> only<00:01:36.909> because<00:01:37.570> this<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.560> main

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
ever and that only because this the main

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.499 
ever and that only because this the main
part<00:01:39.130> of<00:01:39.219> it<00:01:39.369> is<00:01:39.609> actually<00:01:39.969> an<00:01:40.270> air

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
part of it is actually an air

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.849 
part of it is actually an air

I<00:01:54.549> added<00:01:55.119> fins<00:01:55.659> and<00:01:56.020> wings<00:01:56.409> to<00:01:56.770> it<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:57.219> I

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
I added fins and wings to it and I

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.599 
I added fins and wings to it and I
turned<00:01:58.060> it<00:01:58.179> into<00:01:58.299> a<00:01:58.390> jet<00:01:58.719> pack<00:01:58.929> so<00:01:59.490> there<00:02:00.490> you

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 
turned it into a jet pack so there you

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:02.969 
turned it into a jet pack so there you
go<00:02:00.789> Marc<00:02:01.270> it's<00:02:01.630> a<00:02:01.719> 100%<00:02:02.380> custom<00:02:02.799> air

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
go Marc it's a 100% custom air

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.279 
go Marc it's a 100% custom air
temperature<00:02:03.520> sensor<00:02:03.549> jet<00:02:04.270> pack<00:02:04.509> I<00:02:04.840> think<00:02:05.200> it

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
temperature sensor jet pack I think it

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:06.539 
temperature sensor jet pack I think it
worked<00:02:05.439> out<00:02:05.560> really<00:02:05.740> nice<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.189> had<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.369> little

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
worked out really nice I had a little

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.639 
worked out really nice I had a little
styrene<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:07.329> some<00:02:07.450> other<00:02:07.600> various<00:02:08.020> parts<00:02:08.470> and

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
styrene and some other various parts and

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.320 
styrene and some other various parts and
some<00:02:08.800> sculpting<00:02:09.130> in<00:02:09.399> it<00:02:09.490> I<00:02:09.670> think<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.179> looks

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
some sculpting in it I think it looks

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.910 
some sculpting in it I think it looks
like<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.479> pretty<00:02:10.690> cool<00:02:10.869> jet<00:02:11.140> pack<00:02:11.350> for<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.590> Hydra

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
like a pretty cool jet pack for a Hydra

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.640 
like a pretty cool jet pack for a Hydra
guy<00:02:12.069> and<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.730> added<00:02:12.910> some<00:02:13.080> like<00:02:14.080> bands<00:02:14.350> going

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
guy and I added some like bands going

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.530 
guy and I added some like bands going
around<00:02:14.980> his<00:02:15.160> arms<00:02:15.580> like<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:15.970> said<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.210> armored

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
around his arms like I said the armored

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.960 
around his arms like I said the armored
fighting<00:02:16.870> that's<00:02:17.020> all<00:02:17.170> sculpted<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.790> base

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
fighting that's all sculpted the base

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.210 
fighting that's all sculpted the base
body<00:02:19.269> is<00:02:19.629> protector<00:02:20.530> so<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.739> was<00:02:20.830> able<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:21.040> use

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
body is protector so I was able to use

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.700 
body is protector so I was able to use
that<00:02:21.250> centered<00:02:21.730> chest<00:02:21.970> piece<00:02:22.239> from<00:02:23.170> him

that centered chest piece from him

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.530 
that centered chest piece from him
then<00:02:24.190> just<00:02:24.310> put<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:24.580> hydro<00:02:24.850> logo<00:02:25.120> on<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.450> I

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
then just put the hydro logo on it I

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.940 
then just put the hydro logo on it I
took<00:02:25.600> his<00:02:25.840> wrist<00:02:26.050> things<00:02:26.350> off<00:02:26.590> because<00:02:26.770> we

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
took his wrist things off because we

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.100 
took his wrist things off because we
didn't<00:02:27.190> need<00:02:27.340> those<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:28.480> otherwise<00:02:28.810> he's<00:02:29.080> a

look like it has like reflections going

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.000 
look like it has like reflections going
on<00:02:41.950> in<00:02:42.100> it's<00:02:42.340> glossy<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:44.230> he's<00:02:44.440> got<00:02:44.620> golden

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
guns and just like I said golden details

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.010 
guns and just like I said golden details
throughout<00:02:48.160> just<00:02:48.460> to<00:02:48.580> kind<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.870> be<00:02:49.990> a

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
throughout just to kind of to be a

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.960 
throughout just to kind of to be a
little<00:02:50.260> reminiscent<00:02:50.590> of<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.040> classic<00:02:51.160> Hydra

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
little reminiscent of the classic Hydra

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.300 
little reminiscent of the classic Hydra
look<00:02:52.210> so<00:02:53.080> there<00:02:53.350> is<00:02:53.560> he's<00:02:53.710> got<00:02:53.830> all<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.040> the

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
look so there is he's got all of the

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.180 
look so there is he's got all of the
standard<00:02:55.080> protector<00:02:56.080> articulation<00:02:56.770> nothing

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
standard protector articulation nothing

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.770 
standard protector articulation nothing
was<00:02:57.340> lost<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.940> made<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.240> so<00:02:58.360> that<00:02:58.510> all<00:02:58.600> the

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
was lost I made it so that all the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.620 
was lost I made it so that all the
details<00:02:59.170> tuck<00:02:59.500> in<00:02:59.740> for<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.760> ab<00:03:00.880> crunch<00:03:01.300> and

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
details tuck in for the ab crunch and

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.350 
details tuck in for the ab crunch and
the<00:03:02.520> wall<00:03:03.520> for<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.760> back<00:03:03.940> part<00:03:04.150> of<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:04.270> ab

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
the wall for the back part of the ab

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.660 
the wall for the back part of the ab
crunch<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:05.500> that's<00:03:05.800> about<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.310> there's<00:03:06.490> not<00:03:06.610> a

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
crunch and that's about it there's not a

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.190 
crunch and that's about it there's not a
whole<00:03:06.940> lot<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.210> say<00:03:07.240> about<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:07.690> guy<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:07.900> guess

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
whole lot to say about this guy I guess

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.240 
whole lot to say about this guy I guess
I<00:03:08.320> could<00:03:08.470> talk<00:03:08.590> about<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.860> paint<00:03:09.070> for<00:03:09.220> a

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
I could talk about the paint for a

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.100 
I could talk about the paint for a
minute<00:03:09.520> the<00:03:09.640> green<00:03:09.880> is<00:03:10.030> dry<00:03:10.240> brushed<00:03:10.600> over

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
minute the green is dry brushed over

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.920 
minute the green is dry brushed over
black<00:03:12.010> it's<00:03:12.640> like<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.880> semi<00:03:13.390> it's<00:03:13.630> not<00:03:13.750> really

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
black it's like a semi it's not really

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.020 
black it's like a semi it's not really
glossy<00:03:14.320> it's<00:03:14.410> more<00:03:14.560> like<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.710> satin<00:03:15.250> just<00:03:15.940> so

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
glossy it's more like a satin just so

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.010 
glossy it's more like a satin just so
because<00:03:16.270> I<00:03:16.300> didn't<00:03:16.450> want<00:03:16.570> to<00:03:16.600> look<00:03:16.750> flat

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
because I didn't want to look flat

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.450 
because I didn't want to look flat
obviously<00:03:17.740> it<00:03:17.830> would<00:03:17.920> have<00:03:18.010> looked<00:03:18.100> weird

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
obviously it would have looked weird

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.030 
obviously it would have looked weird
like<00:03:18.640> cloth<00:03:18.940> I<00:03:19.270> wanted<00:03:20.110> to<00:03:20.230> look<00:03:20.350> more<00:03:20.830> like

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
like cloth I wanted to look more like

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.770 
like cloth I wanted to look more like
leather<00:03:21.250> or<00:03:21.400> something<00:03:21.730> like<00:03:21.850> that<00:03:21.910> vinyl<00:03:22.450> so

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
leather or something like that vinyl so

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.780 
leather or something like that vinyl so
that's<00:03:22.960> what<00:03:23.140> I<00:03:23.170> like<00:03:24.070> that's<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.550> kind<00:03:24.670> of

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
that's what I like that's the kind of

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.540 
that's what I like that's the kind of
finish<00:03:25.030> I<00:03:25.120> went<00:03:25.300> with<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.780> then<00:03:26.470> all<00:03:27.340> the

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
finish I went with and then all the

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.210 
finish I went with and then all the
metal<00:03:27.790> parts<00:03:27.820> are<00:03:28.180> actually<00:03:28.680> not<00:03:29.680> dry<00:03:29.920> brushed
