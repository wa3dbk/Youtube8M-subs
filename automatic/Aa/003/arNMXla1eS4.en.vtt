00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.900
On behalf of our 328,000 students, faculty, staff and alumni, it's my pleasure to welcome 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.630
you to the new academic year.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.650
Last year, our achievements raised SDSU's national profile, and

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.650
U.S. News and World Report magazine named us one of our nation's top "up-and-coming universities." 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.240
We established our Commuter Resource Center, our Pride Center, our Writing Center, our 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:36.120
Honors College and our alumni-led Aztec Mentor Program. Forbes magazine ranked us 18th in 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.470
the nation for entrepreneurship, and over 2,000 students had international experiences.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.549
It was a great year for our campus as we opened the new LEED-platinum Conrad Prebys Aztec 

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:52.030
Student Union and the renovated Storm-Nasatir-Hostler Hall.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.659
It was also a great year for research and creative endeavors. 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.839
Walt Oechel and Forest Rohwer were named among the "world's most influential scientific 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:02.019
minds," and 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:08.820
the Arts Alive SDSU initiative brought pop-up concerts and visual art to the entire campus.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.909
We also contributed to our community as the Sage Project improved quality of life

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.570
and sustainability in National City, and the Aztecs Rock Hunger drive raised 227,000

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.010
pounds of food for San Diegans in need. 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.240
Aztec athletics continued a golden era as our teams won seven conference championships, 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.310
the football team went to a fourth consecutive bowl game, men's basketball advanced to the Sweet 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.590
16 for the second time in our history and Shanieka Thomas won the national championship 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.960
in the triple jump.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.770
These are just a fraction of the many, many accomplishments of our faculty, students, 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.650
staff and alumni in the past year.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.840
In the coming year, we will initiate programs to increase student success, advance research 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.490
and creative endeavors and bring us together as one SDSU community.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.880
We also welcome over 100 new faculty and staff members and over 8,000 new students to our campus.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.590
It's going to be a great year.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.700
Thank you for everything you do to build our university and our community, and welcome to the 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.950
new year!
