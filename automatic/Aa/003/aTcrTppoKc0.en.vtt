 it is first of all the keyboard part 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.670
 quite innovative since it allows here 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.949
 to have a comfortable part that 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.290
 occupies the entire surface by cons who 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.800
 greatly affect the readability of the

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.760
 two inches holding the tablet without 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.230
 no prior discomfort the other aspect 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.120

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.460
 processor and a level of performance 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.550

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.970
 call the people have the opportunity to 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:39.580

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.160
 hair at the same time go straight 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.670
 on the internet for example other 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.860
 innovation that is directly related to 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.530
 his name since it's called galaxy 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.970
 since it comes with its notes

 directly the tablet without putting any 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.040
 traces which is rather useful when we 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.350
 flip on the app s not on va 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.530

 the interest of working in multi mode 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.200
 windows on a tablet that does not 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.330

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.070
 by pressing the button and doing 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.710
