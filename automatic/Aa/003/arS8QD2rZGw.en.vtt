00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.480
 michael bleach mill opened in 1993 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.030
 very first indoor go-kart track 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.730
 The Netherlands and Europe in Mijdrecht 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.049
 now 23 years later the doors of 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.150
 the right-wing branch 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.369
 forever i feel like i have just started and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.590
 we day the municipality was round 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.510
 must say the first municipality was that 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.640
 yes those which liked a project 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.990
 to enter with an entrepreneur and there 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.359
 are actually all different municipality 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.070
 wild dogs started getting permits 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.630
 for the cart track 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.160
 so yes my there is actually one 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.690
 kind of milestone for the in the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.910
 card bread but the visitor numbers 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.410
 of the right-wing branch are not 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.110
 more what they have been 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.460
 we have n't had it easy for years 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.309
 tags mutations on none 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.930
 been from another other owner 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.309
 before they go with fresh see again 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.449
 started at 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.890
 to breathe new life into the carp 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.750
 We also succeeded in building 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.590
 refurbished looks good but whatever 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.600
 just 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.910
 and not always easy it's there 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.020
 harold is ultimately yes 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.940
 there are quite a lot of people in the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.229
 municipality the round peat and bottom of the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.820
 immediate vicinity 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.890
 partena for more people know yes 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.840
 not find us good enough 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.270
 and it didn't stop completely 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.100
 Amsterdam Delft and Zandvoort remain the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.479
 jobs just opened 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.460
 but that does n't make it any less 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.110
 difficult on is very difficult to find your way 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.610
 I used to go here for it 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.930
 to one of the guys who works here 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.790
 that I like here 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.350
 as a little boy it ate my doctor 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.720
 to do at the bar 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.549
 and then when we just public yes i am 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.409
 just grew up in this in here 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.759
 this hall and this go-kart track is 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.509
 very difficult because difficult 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.490
 say goodbye 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.990

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.150
 our last opening day to corner and 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.400
 action cards for the price and then it 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.049
 15 was the golden cares if you 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.860
 brain hemispheres half a euro 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.520
 so yes that is on the last week yes 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.190
 difficult but it is there and after 23 years 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.610
