 its multiplayer modes and is that little is 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.330
 I knew the multiplayer mode of the last 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.619
 of us was the last secret that naughty 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.660
 dog had saved on the game 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.489
 but it has been less than two weeks of 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.199

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.420

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.449
 more than interesting section 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.399
 multiplayer beyond the story of 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.020
 survival of him and joel the 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.489
 protagonists of the individual mode the 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.620
 pandemic that has devastated the planet is 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.930
 a great context to elaborate this 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.489
 online competitive mode 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.199
 multiplayer of the last of us takes the 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.030
 name of sides and allows us to choose 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.699
 between one of the two factions in liza 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.140
 the hunters or the fireflies are 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.609
 two factions fight for the scarce 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.170
 resources that are left and can be 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.570
 face in two game modes 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.580
 survivors and collection of supplies 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.530
 Both modes allow games of a 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.060
 maximum of eight players four times 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.799
 faction 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.329
 in collection of supplies the two 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.280
 factions must eliminate the 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.750
 components of the opposite faction but 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.399
 collecting different packages 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.320
 supplies spread across the map 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.840
 will mean the difference between victory 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.250
 or defeat each team has 20 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.049
 lives and when these are over the 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.119
 game has ended the team wins with 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.159
 more deaths to his credit in the new 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.869
 survivors there are no resuscitations and 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.210
 the team that eliminates all the 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.740
 opposite each game in both modes 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.229
 they are counting as a day of 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.880
 survival in a total of 12 days that 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.280
