00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.966
 Oh let me know you got me swimming if I needed you 

00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:28.766
 Oh leave me because you're there 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.600
 Oh who would have thought 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.266
 Love that we build 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.533
 At last 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.866
 Oh let it 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:12.233

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.300
 Oh leave the ocean wide 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:42.566
 I swim if I needed you 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:50.066
 Oh, let it rain and rain 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.966
