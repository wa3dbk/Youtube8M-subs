 you wanted in the house and upstairs 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.260
 I already say such a ceiling fan 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.449
 has and yes if it is hot then it can 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.070

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.390
 there are then in the large version 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.210
 and not just sound so normal 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.860
 variant and not show you now 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.770
 Just how you get the power 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.260
 and still sown as a small feature 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.539
 even turn in a hand and in the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.170
 Inventory even if you have it strong 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.170
 because 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.520
 goes so her power needs wood and wood 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.220
 then the log and iron 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.750
 There is every kind of wood so you can 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.310
 her then this wood through dark wood 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.170
 or replace birch wood 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.180
 and there would have to be the respective stem 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.560
 but also replace for example if you 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.690
 The dark wood gold must be here 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.670
 dark processed wood and its dark 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.369
 Wood came to travel goods remained 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.710
 always wanted the same then just the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.259
 make first drawing simply grabbing a 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.060
 fan with solved without crafting box 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.570
 and here I show you quickly 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.479
 all variants of the normal wood stop that 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.670

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.470
 and the jungle wood all of these 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.479
 There are variants again with glos 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.149
 sound and as the name implies 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.979
 glos ton or how it suggests the 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.090
 of course, then shines in the dark 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.250
 one can now here in the house 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.690
 light if I recognize the way 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.989
 make it darker the torch too 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.970
 they shine then the strong ones 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:07.709
 I've just shown a recipe 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.840
 if you do then you have such a 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:13.069
 grabbed so a crafting field monastery 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.200
 and then down from the monastery 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.970
 fan that was more there 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.900
 not to say except that if you 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.040
 they are placed directly next to each other 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.500
 like a bit in a rom 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.230
 That's why it would be best for you to bake 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.060
 always a block next to each other though 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.739
 ever wanted to have several 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.590
 maybe that's enough, too 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.940
 already as a nice house decoration 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.480
