00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 It's a good person and the night is good, I'll go 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.589
 doing this scheme is like a test that 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.690
 I had already talked to you about a 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.120
 video party concluded paid well that makes 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.309
 about getting the most out of doubts 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.059
 possible in a few minutes of video 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.910
 huh 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.609
 so I did the first test by posting the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.010
 called alienation of hours times I go 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.689
 read a few questions here and already 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.099
 responding as if it were a ball-bat 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.260
 pretty fast right? 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.029
 So I'll start with what Richard Soares is 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.710
 I would like to speak your vision about 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.989
 manipulation of cardio and spas in a 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.370
 preparation focused basically on the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.610
 load handling 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.280
 you use it as a target for 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.540
 break the actor right out they come 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.489
 to power is speeding up the processes 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.879
 biochemicals such as toxin 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.690
 action is still speeding up the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.430
 policies 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.969
 It's okay, excuse me, I really like it. 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.570
 0 Marcelo fall the use of having four 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.559
 isolated form 63 has effectiveness aiming at 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.210
 Fat Burning 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.480
 yes man, it depends on your dosage 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.939
 again returning to the old question 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.210
 you used the thyroid brother as 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.010
 a feature of the plateau breaking 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.710
 precisely for its potential without going 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.049
 yes it's nice mimetic ok then he 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.549
 is helping with some of the 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.909
 hormones show and paste mines to 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.150
 accelerate the process of pyrolysis 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:27.840
 not always 3 it is recommended by 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.030
 same vision min marks vinícius milk 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.979
 usimed ant in cdl even if the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.159
 insulin administration exaggeration 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.710
 do not overdo it sometimes unnecessary ok me 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.960
 has proven to be effective for 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.250
 improve insulin sensitivity 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.430
 so i believe god if you 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.740
 know how to adjust your diet is valid 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.020
 lucas léo between almost meals of the day 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.430
 it would be better to use cinnamon in the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.110
 aim of increasing sensitivity to 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.820
 insulin or use it all in one 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.770
 moment the professional depends on how 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.450
 if you organized your old diet I like 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.439
 embu make high position so it 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.790
 interesting you use is cinnamon 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:06.840
 especially in meals with 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.080
 carlos rodrigo who aerobic off yes 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.030
 or not so I always do aerobic 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.440
 matheus henrique has healing is problem in 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.150
 high amounts of rock 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.620
 11 plus one liter per day of milk 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.050
 whereas there are no 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.700
 intolerance on the part of those who 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.470
 that are also embedded in the maps 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.780
 Clear day with no problem 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.940
 there are some studies there 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.640
 immunology that may show that 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.340
 Some compounds especially where the 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.340
 proteins in some derivatives they can 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.470
 have crosby action with some others 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.390
 composed of other foods right 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.070
 exists to a degree of percentage between 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.980
 things between some things and others for 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.470
 For example, people who are allergic to 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.240
 shrimp protein has a 75% chance 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.620
 also having problems with crab 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.180
 crab by nintendo boldenona 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.450
 old turn over to take all were 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.430
 11 lucas léo new shaft recovery 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.060
 after long periods and docile intruder is 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:07.410
 possible we will surely see other 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.170
 here one minute fernando marx the use of 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.760
 oil or fat mct at supper has the advantage 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.980
 against the use of other accounts by 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.390
 Eg eggs or expensive oil so 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.340
 sure they are proven 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.470
 used in order to speed up the 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.110
 metabolic processes ok triglycerides 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.700
 chain and it depends on 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.080
 How many hours are you going to sleep then? 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.820
 example you sleep a long time 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.989
 between 10 hours or less or 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.060
 even with less fat in the pumps is 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.620
 lucas loyal again is like a user who 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.510
 use a crude method to feel more 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.070
 core collateral of what you do not like 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.230
 if you are feeling any collateral 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.900
 thing doing wrong the name daniel 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.239
 Soares recommended string 5 htp the 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.620
 my students I can between 100 and 250 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.459
 lucas leal gets to respond to 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.010
 questions 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:57.480
 rafael martins de ano and jet eight weeks 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:00.269
 straight rolls with no comments 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:05.940
 fran goveia more expensive or less food in 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:07.980
 contrast later caio marcel 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.440
 but it is not just a test protocol 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.239
 valid or not worth the price I think 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.739
 interesting just you can 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.230
 maintain better concentrations 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.060
 paulo roberto as 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.230
 regularize the hormonal axis naturally 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.490
 in the right way 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:26.400
 for Ant Riverside Consulting 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.270
 and chrome inquiry useless to own 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.319
 fall is already going 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.129
 and increase your insulin sensitivity 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:36.000
 then it depends how you organize only the 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:38.550
 Your diet will find matheus aerial coast. 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.900
 fasting or late at night when it is already 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.669
 is fed 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.319
 there is some very great advantage of 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.550
 strategy on the other in terms of 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.919
 of fat loss 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.720
 Wow, I usually spend a fast after 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:54.840
 that the person is already doing card posted 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.819
 no beauty so know how to organize good 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.169
 beyond the cognitive benefits of ginkgo 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.669
 it can be used as a means to 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.889
 control the pressure by replacing 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.710
 aspirin guy there is the question the judge 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.630
 that it contains certain fiev sure that 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.120
 they are 30 and legs they proved 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.349
 decreases intracranial pressure but does not 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.400
 necessarily blood pressure 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.099
 systemic 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.810
 Okay already the aspirin guy she acts as a 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.490
 anticoagulant precisely because it 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.280
 decreases the production of prostaglandins 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.930
 a platelet and also in the endothelium that 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.050
 is also touted agent 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.669
 antiplatelet agent is the difference 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.710
 that the platelets have a useful life 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.539
 so once she gets aspirin 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.940
 silences the plate when the plate 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:36.300
 die as the effect of certain aspirin and 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.340
 the endothelium when it renews its 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.300
 proteins in action its five looks and 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.979
 gymnasium 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.810
 the effect is lost ok and Rodrigo queiroz 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.449
 clear positions and make some time to 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.300
 fast in valid invalid book 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.380
 if we put super valid guess 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.169
 excellent but it 's a strategy 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.150
 nutritional some time fast book 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.979
 Depends on my face, I fast. 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.840
 natural I'll feed myself around 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.699
 from nine o'clock in the morning then 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.669
 It's ten o'clock in the morning. 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.529
 lucas mapurunga use two advisors 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.349
 The same drug protocol has advantages 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:11.699
 example of that pt is not pro-test 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.169
 I see many worked courses 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:16.139
 first let's take this concept 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:19.469
 it's not drug it 's drug beauty drug 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:21.360
 illicit hypocrisy scoundrel is second with 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:23.240
 I already told you there at the time of the guy 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.550
 supplementary aid to concentrations 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.740
 rafael santos hcg possible putting lh 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.449
 in the range of 6 and little in average of how much 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.000
 time the body returns to produce a forehead 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:34.800
 endogenous treatment takes a few weeks 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.719
 this considering most of the fees 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.490
 controlled runners and prolactin 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:39.390
 load usually so protocols 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.580
 clinical 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:47.100
 aim at cg is for up to eight weeks 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.830
 Sure it 's so free up there I can get 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.200
 reference to you is called in the 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.510
 box health beginning of revolt in style 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.860
 any other rhythm of high intensity 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.750
 is more efficient at poles in 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.690
 compared to low intensity not 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:03.120
 necessarily right you can have a 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.970
 improvement in victory and both with the pace 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.950
 certain is seeking the manipulation of their 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.180
 androgen hormones when I can not 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.710
 train once you were already 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.120
 fully implemented 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.480
 taking into account that you know how to train 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.330
 my friend anderson war diet book 

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.160
 is valid is valid 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.860
 eduardo cardio markers before or after 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.000
 training went immediately before the 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.110
 I train stupid only if it's like 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.990
 heating 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:30.270
 I prefer showing dollars or war 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.190
 fsh and lh close to zero mean 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.760
 partial end most of the day in 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:37.380
 strike started and suffers with this doubt 

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.970
 So, man, what's up? 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.350
 government trophic hormones he is not 

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:42.720
 stimulating the production of testosterone 

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.430
 about that and killed hawk general 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.440
 close to zero 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.360
 Are you still going to have some swimmers there? 

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:53.670
 assets for you to completely suppress 

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:55.260
 their progeny and goes for a few months and is 

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:57.240
 This is what I 'm going to close here, it's okay. 

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.490
 thank you, I hope you like it 

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.590
 Do you like feedback ok? 

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:05.660
 and then I continue with this project to a 

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.660
 of the clubs is for you there, see you later
