00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.460
 hello everyone with you lime and today we 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:11.040
 We will review the mod that adds 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.650
 such an interesting splash so let's say 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.110
 upgrades or super minkravts skills 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.360
 so let's take a closer look at this bridge 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.279
 he's called somehow blur something in there 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.400
 In general, in my opinion some kind of some kind 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.619
 games well, in fact, mod secondary 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.500
 not really what this adds but very 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.300
 let's tell all so much 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.940
 first he adds such ore which 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.280
 called light or that itâ€™s just possible 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.729
 to find in the mine is not very difficult 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.320
 find something like iron from it 

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:42.989
 just white falls out 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.059
 no crystal no to the menu at the very 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.879
 It looks dumb but light falls out 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.379
 Well, everything in general and from this light can 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.210
 to paint here such 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.070
 cool flops let's consider these 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.110
 splash more in detail here I am already there 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.809
 compare now tell you about it exploded 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.650
 things here I have been the victim card 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.019
 just checked here in general the first 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.900
 so let's say on the trick is added 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.790
 called shock power of the from experience 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.880
 improvement still said so 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.680
 all upgrades are so mean 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.510
 she just adds causes not 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.810
 adds name-calling lightning just 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.150
 causes a lightning that will damage 5 and 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.130
 sets fire in general but also lightning can 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.610
 how does it work as usual lightning from 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.510
 she can make hay zombies out just 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.610
 change 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.830
 actually speak properly and 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.420
 chaps 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.730
 so in general, the next thing is called 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.190
 min-min and in short 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.780
 it turns out it is crafted from dynamite on 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.470
 in fact, this subject is very me 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.270
 liked 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.280
 let's see what he has to do 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.610
 just insert store menu 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.730
 just step on it and it turns out 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.740
 such a big enough bang 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.810
 I think he is even much more than 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.030
 just blow the principles a lot 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.680
 more profitable but the only thing that you are there 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.400
 suffer and a little blast so well 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.930
 such 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.220
 average such a blast but not bad following 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.940
 the next thing we crafted out 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.619
 snowball 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.230
 This thing is really very 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.720
 cool mean look around us 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.600
 four explosions such as 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.400
 about 1 blast was and the most 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.860
 the main thing you can just juzat 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.400
 and it does not concern us around us 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.340
 explosions 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.610
 we even do a blast to nick 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.580
 the site does not mean enough 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.459
 fun thing next we have 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.470
 kravets and arrows and so same light on 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.810
 it even hangs enchantment returns 3 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.120
 let's see what she does she 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.930
 it means shoots and shoots arrows 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.340
 simply 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.100
 and the damage will be with us 6 exactly 60 to 100 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.510
 quite such an average large even 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.209
 so you can say the most important thing 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.930
 see the rate of fire that is all 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.000
 much easier to be and also if just 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.340
 strike then disgusted as an adversary 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.250
 reads like in the country 3 an example is not there 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.110
 disappointed in the country 3 well, that is, it can 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.810
 somehow applied in pvp you can keep 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.590
 the enemy is at a distance sufficient 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.209
 useful stuff so the next one is crafting 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.360
 we and this is really arguing 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.070
 there is that useless thing 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.680
 now I will show what she does she 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.250
 just causes 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.780
 above you blast and everything above you just 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:33.159
 explosion give let's check it like I don't know 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:34.420
 let's dig deep on the very 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.400
 I really think it's a useless thing 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.519
 let's blow do not know let's go a little bit 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.650
 just below the cheese we explode a little bit 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.680
 vylez probably an explosion is enough 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.840
 nice but i just don't understand where it is 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.000
 may apply that is believe on 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.549
 the word blows up like the first pride just 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.340
 the explosion is just an explosion all but enough 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.200
 the next upgrade explodes high 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.510
 we called metro power-up means 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.150
 she's just crafted out of sugar and like 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.359
 let's see what she does she 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.510
 just hangs us the effect of speed on 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.639
 brought 5 seconds that is up to 5 seconds 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.829
 but this effect is very fast that is 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:14.469
 very quickly even really bad 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.419
 managed but cool enough 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.099
 there is a run you can fuck off super 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.799
 flat world there can generally run 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:22.509
 unreal fast sheets does not interfere 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.699
 the only negative is that this is an example here 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:29.590
 we just run into some further 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:32.680
 how to say bulge in general 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.960
 following shield power up means 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.270
 Kraft it from an apple actually 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.400
 This one is very cool 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.650
 really it does not do anything except 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.570
 how gives you just damage resistance 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.780
 3 that is, in any GDP but very much 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.590
 help and the next thing will help too 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.690
 tightly together 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.479
 called repair power-up as well as possible 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.090
 guess she just recovers 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:59.020
 means nothing words and instant 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:03.009
 treatment 3 is a pretty funny thing 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.960
 you can just fan with a friend and everything is well 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:07.419
 in general it is not global and 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.039
 background mod pretty cool 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.009
 which you can even add assembly 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.990
 lose and with you was line 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.819
 Thank you all for watching the likes 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.220
 comment subscribe to my 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.169
 The link to the mod is in the description 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.080
 also a reference to the group is also in 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.139
 describing a lot of interesting things to all 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.139
 until
