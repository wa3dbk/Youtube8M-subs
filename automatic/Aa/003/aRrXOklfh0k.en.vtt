one time that he said he thought it was
$25<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.280> it<00:01:25.490> was<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:25.940> so<00:01:26.030> oh<00:01:26.180> I<00:01:26.420> think<00:01:26.720> he's

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
$25 and it was and so oh I think he's

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.300 
$25 and it was and so oh I think he's
like<00:01:27.259> it<00:01:29.289> confirmation<00:01:30.289> bias<00:01:30.320> said<00:01:30.799> its<00:01:30.950> best

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
like it confirmation bias said its best

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.790

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
know I think yeah maybe he makes a bad

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:38.969 
know I think yeah maybe he makes a bad
decision<00:01:36.380> that's<00:01:37.009> his<00:01:37.159> own<00:01:37.310> fault<00:01:37.340> right<00:01:37.940> yeah

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
decision that's his own fault right yeah

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.230 
decision that's his own fault right yeah
maybe<00:01:39.979> we<00:01:40.159> shouldn't<00:01:40.399> worry<00:01:40.550> about<00:01:40.610> that<00:01:40.970> kind

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
maybe we shouldn't worry about that kind
