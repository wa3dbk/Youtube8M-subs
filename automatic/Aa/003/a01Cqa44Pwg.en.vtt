 9.0 well we can see the comparison 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:54.060
 between 2016 and pesos link 15 and 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:57.060
 they are practically the same requirements 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.370
 so if you ran 2015 very well 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.409
 2016 will also be going to the 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.049
 same fluency and the same quality as 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:06.510
 you ran the 2015 well let's hope that the 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.519
 PC version is much better than the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.040
 previous year because the graphs were 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.919
 more similar to today in the mind and 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.590
 we have that year if it 's 2016 from pc be 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:18.659
 more similar to that of many I hope that
