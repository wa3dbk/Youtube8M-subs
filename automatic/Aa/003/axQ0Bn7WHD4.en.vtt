way we can finally shoot some zombies so
in<00:00:08.460> order<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.730> add<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:08.940> zombie<00:00:09.360> what<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.630> want

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
in order to add a zombie what you want

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.950 
in order to add a zombie what you want
to<00:00:09.840> do<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.050> right<00:00:10.230> click<00:00:10.260> go<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:11.130> actor<00:00:11.969> axis

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
to do is right click go to actor axis

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.880 
to do is right click go to actor axis
zombie<00:00:13.889> grrrrrr<00:00:14.630> BER<00:00:15.630> ss<00:00:16.139> honor<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.710> that's

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
zombie grrrrrr BER ss honor and that's

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.200 
zombie grrrrrr BER ss honor and that's
going<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.490> spawn<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:17.850> little<00:00:18.090> guy<00:00:18.180> right

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
going to spawn this little guy right

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.060 
going to spawn this little guy right
here<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:19.109> we'll<00:00:19.199> line<00:00:19.380> them<00:00:19.410> up<00:00:19.590> where<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:19.920> want

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
here so we'll line them up where we want

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.620 
here so we'll line them up where we want
am<00:00:20.220> normally<00:00:20.640> he'll<00:00:20.760> be<00:00:20.880> outside<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.449> map

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
am normally he'll be outside of the map

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.700 
am normally he'll be outside of the map
and<00:00:21.869> then<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.350> come<00:00:22.470> through<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
and then have to come through the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.320 
and then have to come through the
windows<00:00:22.980> but<00:00:23.160> right<00:00:23.580> now<00:00:23.730> since<00:00:24.000> we're<00:00:24.180> just

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
windows but right now since we're just

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.880 
windows but right now since we're just
adding<00:00:24.480> an<00:00:24.689> optominute<00:00:25.170> inside<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.590> map<00:00:25.710> that

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
adding an optominute inside the map that

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.570 
adding an optominute inside the map that
way<00:00:25.980> we<00:00:26.130> can<00:00:26.250> see<00:00:26.430> them

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
way we can see them

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.950 
way we can see them
and<00:00:26.789> then<00:00:27.210> we'll<00:00:27.330> change<00:00:27.449> our<00:00:27.630> view<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.869> make

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
and then we'll change our view and make

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
and then we'll change our view and make
sure<00:00:27.990> there's<00:00:28.260> not<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> ground<00:00:28.830> or

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
sure there's not in the ground or

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.279 
sure there's not in the ground or
anything<00:00:29.130> like<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.400> like<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.779> then<00:00:31.170> what

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
anything like that like so and then what

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.179 
anything like that like so and then what
we're<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> do<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.800> we're<00:00:31.920> going<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.070> have

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
we're going to do is we're going to have

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.709 
we're going to do is we're going to have
to<00:00:32.279> give<00:00:32.399> him<00:00:32.550> some<00:00:32.730> values<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.329> first<00:00:33.540> we'll

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
to give him some values so first we'll

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:34.940 
to give him some values so first we'll
change<00:00:33.840> his<00:00:34.020> position<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.559> way<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.800> looks

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
change his position that way it looks

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.620 
change his position that way it looks
this<00:00:35.100> way<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.520> then<00:00:35.969> we'll<00:00:36.090> hit<00:00:36.180> n<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.480> our

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
this way and then we'll hit n on our

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.510 
this way and then we'll hit n on our
keyboard<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.110> bring<00:00:37.140> up<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.800> entity<00:00:38.250> window

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
keyboard to bring up the entity window

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.770 
keyboard to bring up the entity window
and<00:00:38.730> we're<00:00:38.940> going<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.120> give<00:00:39.270> them<00:00:39.360> some<00:00:39.600> keys

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
and we're going to give them some keys

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.240 
and we're going to give them some keys
and<00:00:40.020> values<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> first<00:00:40.829> one<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.190> to

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
and values so the first one is going to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.240 
and values so the first one is going to
be<00:00:41.370> script<00:00:41.700> underscore<00:00:42.600> note<00:00:42.930> worthy<00:00:43.860> one

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
be script underscore note worthy one

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.160 
be script underscore note worthy one
word<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.670> then<00:00:45.300> what<00:00:45.480> we're<00:00:45.719> going<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:46.050> is

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
word and then what we're going to do is

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.049 
word and then what we're going to do is
call<00:00:46.350> them<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.559> zombie<00:00:46.950> underscore<00:00:47.550> some<00:00:47.820> honor

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
call them a zombie underscore some honor

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.880 
call them a zombie underscore some honor
now<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.780> zombie<00:00:48.989> spawner<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.559> pretty<00:00:49.770> much

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
now the zombie spawner is pretty much

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.410 
now the zombie spawner is pretty much
just<00:00:50.100> going<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.309> say<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.579> hey<00:00:50.730> I'm<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.149> zombie

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
just going to say that hey I'm a zombie

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.090 
just going to say that hey I'm a zombie
spawner<00:00:51.539> then<00:00:52.320> what<00:00:52.469> we'll<00:00:52.590> do<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.800> we'll<00:00:52.920> add

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
spawner then what we'll do is we'll add

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.400 
spawner then what we'll do is we'll add
in<00:00:53.219> some<00:00:53.399> spawn<00:00:53.670> flags<00:00:53.940> right<00:00:54.120> here<00:00:54.410> spawn

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
in some spawn flags right here spawn

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.680 
in some spawn flags right here spawn
Flags<00:00:55.649> three<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.160> then<00:00:57.030> what<00:00:57.180> we'll<00:00:57.300> do<00:00:57.420> is

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
Flags three and then what we'll do is

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.060 
Flags three and then what we'll do is
the<00:00:57.899> next<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.230> will<00:00:58.379> be<00:00:58.410> called<00:00:58.680> script

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the next one will be called script

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.569 
the next one will be called script
underscore<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.359> spawn<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.129> we'll<00:01:02.129> hit<00:01:02.250> 1

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
underscore for spawn and we'll hit 1

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.179 
underscore for spawn and we'll hit 1
which<00:01:02.879> means<00:01:03.059> yes<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.680> instance

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
which means yes in this in this instance

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.910 
which means yes in this in this instance
and<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:06.299> we'll<00:01:06.450> go<00:01:06.600> count<00:01:07.070> 9<00:01:08.070> 9<00:01:08.430> 9<00:01:08.700> 9<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.920> then

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
and then we'll go count 9 9 9 9 and then

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.340 
and then we'll go count 9 9 9 9 and then
the<00:01:11.040> last<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.580> target<00:01:12.420> name<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:12.840> target

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the last one is target name so target

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.140 
the last one is target name so target
name<00:01:13.830> now<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> target<00:01:14.729> name<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:15.060> going

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
name now with the target name it's going

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.210 
name now with the target name it's going
to<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.390> your<00:01:15.630> zone<00:01:15.930> for<00:01:16.650> us<00:01:16.860> we're<00:01:17.070> going<00:01:17.159> to

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
to be your zone for us we're going to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.890 
to be your zone for us we're going to
call<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.490> start<00:01:17.790> underscore<00:01:18.240> zone<00:01:18.479> for<00:01:18.780> your

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
call it start underscore zone for your

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.499 
call it start underscore zone for your
zone<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.409> then<00:01:19.920> underscore<00:01:20.340> spawners<00:01:20.909> so

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
zone and then underscore spawners so

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.510 
zone and then underscore spawners so
your<00:01:21.810> zone<00:01:22.080> underscore<00:01:22.650> spawner<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.310> hit

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
your zone underscore spawner and hit

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.940 
your zone underscore spawner and hit
enter<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.390> there<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:24.900> go<00:01:25.049> we<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.680> zombie

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
enter and there we go we have a zombie

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.609 
enter and there we go we have a zombie
so<00:01:26.670> now<00:01:26.820> what<00:01:27.030> we'll<00:01:27.150> do<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.930> will<00:01:27.960> copy<00:01:28.380> him

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
so now what we'll do is we will copy him

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.350 
so now what we'll do is we will copy him
by<00:01:28.860> hitting<00:01:29.040> space<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.640> we'll<00:01:30.090> bring<00:01:30.240> them

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
by hitting space and we'll bring them

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.020 
by hitting space and we'll bring them
over<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:30.930> now<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.100> said<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.700> call<00:01:32.880> it

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
over here now like I said we call it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.200 
over here now like I said we call it
starts<00:01:33.450> own<00:01:33.689> underscores<00:01:34.380> zombies<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:36.030> in

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
starts own underscores zombies so in

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.670 
starts own underscores zombies so in
order<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.509> do<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.930> need<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> zone

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
order to do that we need to have a zone

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.410 
order to do that we need to have a zone
called<00:01:37.979> start<00:01:38.340> zone<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.880> what<00:01:39.030> we'll<00:01:39.180> do<00:01:39.270> is

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
called start zone so what we'll do is

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.859 
called start zone so what we'll do is
we'll<00:01:39.570> right-click<00:01:40.170> go<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.920> info<00:01:41.720> volume<00:01:42.720> and

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
we'll right-click go to info volume and

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:43.999 
we'll right-click go to info volume and
this<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> only<00:01:43.439> way<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.890> add<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
this is the only way you can add a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.160 
this is the only way you can add a
volume<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.939> make<00:01:45.090> sure<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.360> do<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.689> you

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
volume so make sure you do that you

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.630 
volume so make sure you do that you
can't<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.590> use<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> texture<00:01:47.220> volume<00:01:47.340> and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
can't just use the texture volume and

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.100 
can't just use the texture volume and
think<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.939> work<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.600> then<00:01:48.750> what<00:01:48.869> we'll<00:01:48.990> do<00:01:49.079> is

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
think it work and then what we'll do is

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.660 
think it work and then what we'll do is
we'll<00:01:49.320> drag<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.710> out<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.070> size<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.399> our<00:01:50.490> map

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
we'll drag this out the size of our map

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.620 
we'll drag this out the size of our map
so<00:01:51.659> we'll<00:01:51.840> do<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:54.030> we'll<00:01:54.180> do<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.420> as

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
so we'll do this and we'll do this as

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.569 
so we'll do this and we'll do this as
well<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.200> then<00:01:55.740> we'll<00:01:55.829> change<00:01:56.040> your<00:01:56.189> view<00:01:56.369> and

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
well and then we'll change your view and

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.370 
well and then we'll change your view and
pull<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.909> up<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.240> about<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> light<00:01:58.079> at<00:01:58.229> least

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
pull it up to about the light at least

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.109 
pull it up to about the light at least
and<00:01:58.680> then<00:01:59.310> what<00:01:59.430> we'll<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.610> hit<00:01:59.790> end<00:01:59.969> on<00:02:00.060> a

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
and then what we'll do is hit end on a

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.940 
and then what we'll do is hit end on a
keyboard<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.659> bring<00:02:00.689> up<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.439> we'll<00:02:01.799> give

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
keyboard to bring up this and we'll give

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.740 
keyboard to bring up this and we'll give
this<00:02:02.070> some<00:02:02.340> keys<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.700> values<00:02:02.729> as<00:02:03.119> well<00:02:03.299> this

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
this some keys and values as well this

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.840 
this some keys and values as well this
one<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.110> going<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.290> be<00:02:04.409> target<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.729> going

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
one is going to be target and it's going

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.690 
one is going to be target and it's going
to<00:02:05.939> target<00:02:06.210> our<00:02:06.600> start<00:02:07.369> underscore<00:02:08.369> zone

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
to target our start underscore zone

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.059 
to target our start underscore zone
underscore<00:02:09.360> spawners<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.530> pretty<00:02:10.770> much<00:02:10.920> in

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
underscore spawners so pretty much in

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.250 
underscore spawners so pretty much in
the<00:02:11.160> future<00:02:11.280> we'll<00:02:11.610> go<00:02:11.730> over<00:02:11.879> zoning<00:02:12.420> but<00:02:12.930> for

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the future we'll go over zoning but for

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.790 
the future we'll go over zoning but for
this<00:02:13.349> right

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
this right

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.340 
this right
now<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.280> volume<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:14.910> zone<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.600> has<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.230> have

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
now the volume is a zone it has to have

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.560 
now the volume is a zone it has to have
a<00:02:16.380> target<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.100> certain<00:02:17.460> spawner<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.120> then

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
a target of a certain spawner and then

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.240 
a target of a certain spawner and then
we'll<00:02:18.720> know<00:02:18.870> wherever<00:02:19.080> in<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.650> whenever<00:02:20.010> we're

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
we'll know wherever in it whenever we're

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.880 
we'll know wherever in it whenever we're
in<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.670> volume<00:02:21.000> we<00:02:21.840> will<00:02:21.990> be<00:02:22.140> targeting<00:02:22.650> the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
in this volume we will be targeting the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.260 
in this volume we will be targeting the
spawner<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.610> that's<00:02:23.760> pretty<00:02:23.910> much<00:02:24.000> what<00:02:24.240> that

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
spawner so that's pretty much what that

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.210 
spawner so that's pretty much what that
means<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.810> then<00:02:25.290> we'll<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:25.620> call<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:25.800> target

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
means and then we'll just call it target

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.920 
means and then we'll just call it target
name<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.210> going<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.420> be<00:02:27.540> your<00:02:27.720> zone

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
name and this is going to be your zone

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.650 
name and this is going to be your zone
name<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.350> start<00:02:28.620> zone<00:02:29.310> there<00:02:29.940> we<00:02:30.030> go<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.420> if

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
name so start zone there we go and if

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.210 
name so start zone there we go and if
you<00:02:30.750> did<00:02:30.900> everything<00:02:31.110> correctly<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.860> should

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
you did everything correctly you should

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.400 
you did everything correctly you should
see<00:02:32.400> some<00:02:32.670> yellow<00:02:32.940> lines<00:02:33.270> from<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.990> center<00:02:34.320> of

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
see some yellow lines from the center of

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.050 
see some yellow lines from the center of
your<00:02:34.500> map<00:02:34.680> or<00:02:34.860> wherever<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.700> actually<00:02:35.970> the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
your map or wherever it's actually the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.640 
your map or wherever it's actually the
center<00:02:36.240> of<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.480> volume<00:02:36.810> but<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.290> center<00:02:37.530> of

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
center of the volume but the center of

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.530 
center of the volume but the center of
the<00:02:37.710> volume<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.430> your<00:02:38.460> zombies<00:02:39.000> which<00:02:39.270> just

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
the volume to your zombies which just

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.300 
the volume to your zombies which just
means<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:39.900> hey<00:02:40.080> when<00:02:40.530> we're<00:02:40.710> in<00:02:40.830> this<00:02:41.010> zone

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
means that hey when we're in this zone

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.250 
means that hey when we're in this zone
these<00:02:41.790> zombies<00:02:42.210> are<00:02:42.240> going<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.600> spawn<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.170> you

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
these zombies are going to spawn so you

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.890 
these zombies are going to spawn so you
can<00:02:43.380> just<00:02:43.710> deselect<00:02:44.130> everything<00:02:44.400> hit<00:02:45.090> ctrl<00:02:45.570> s

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
can just deselect everything hit ctrl s

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.320 
can just deselect everything hit ctrl s
and<00:02:46.200> then<00:02:46.680> compile<00:02:47.220> your<00:02:47.460> map<00:02:47.640> all<00:02:48.000> right<00:02:48.180> so

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
and then compile your map all right so

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.420 
and then compile your map all right so
here<00:02:48.510> we<00:02:48.540> are<00:02:48.660> inside<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.170> glint<00:02:49.410> game<00:02:49.800> clean

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
here we are inside the glint game clean

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.940 
here we are inside the glint game clean
the<00:02:50.880> game<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:52.080> we're<00:02:52.350> just<00:02:52.410> gonna<00:02:52.530> wait<00:02:52.770> for

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
the game and we're just gonna wait for

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.170 
the game and we're just gonna wait for
the<00:02:53.040> zombies<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.490> spawn<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.700> forget<00:02:54.060> which

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
the zombies to spawn I forget which
