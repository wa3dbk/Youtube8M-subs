good<00:00:00.810> morning<00:00:01.140> this<00:00:01.260> is<00:00:01.439> Duane<00:00:01.650> and<00:00:02.159> merry

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
good morning this is Duane and merry

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.550 
good morning this is Duane and merry
Christmas<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.090> you

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:03.560 
Christmas to you

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.590 
Christmas to you
today<00:00:04.560> we're<00:00:04.680> gonna<00:00:04.770> look<00:00:05.009> at<00:00:05.220> at<00:00:05.400> three<00:00:06.120> kinds

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
today we're gonna look at at three kinds

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.690 
today we're gonna look at at three kinds
of<00:00:06.720> parallelism<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:08.220> do<00:00:08.340> that<00:00:08.550> we're

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
of parallelism and to do that we're

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.910 
of parallelism and to do that we're
gonna<00:00:08.760> take<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.210> song<00:00:09.480> white<00:00:10.200> Christmas<00:00:10.740> as

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
gonna take the song white Christmas as

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.810 
gonna take the song white Christmas as
an<00:00:11.309> example<00:00:11.900> but<00:00:12.900> as<00:00:13.170> usual<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.889> can<00:00:13.950> apply

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
an example but as usual you can apply

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.570 
an example but as usual you can apply
what<00:00:15.269> I'm<00:00:15.480> showing<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.650> white<00:00:17.039> Christmas

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
what I'm showing you in white Christmas

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.450 
what I'm showing you in white Christmas
to<00:00:17.850> many<00:00:18.750> many<00:00:18.990> other<00:00:19.199> songs<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:19.830> we're<00:00:20.369> not

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
to many many other songs so we're not

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.800 
to many many other songs so we're not
learning<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.880> song<00:00:21.060> we're<00:00:21.390> learning<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
learning a song we're learning the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.870 
learning a song we're learning the
principle<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.410> parallelism<00:00:23.039> there's<00:00:23.670> three

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
principle of parallelism there's three

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.790 
principle of parallelism there's three
kinds<00:00:24.240> I'm<00:00:24.359> going<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.600> I'd<00:00:25.140> like<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.560> show<00:00:25.740> you

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
kinds I'm going to I'd like to show you

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.740 
kinds I'm going to I'd like to show you
first<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.279> all<00:00:26.400> I'd<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.300> show<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.480> this

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
first of all I'd like to show you this

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:36.750 
first of all I'd like to show you this
kind<00:00:27.960> first<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.380> all<00:00:28.439> if<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.619> goes<00:00:28.800> like<00:00:28.949> this

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.610 

that<00:00:37.760> makes<00:00:38.270> kind<00:00:38.539> of<00:00:38.600> a<00:00:38.719> chime<00:00:39.020> sound<00:00:39.440> and

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
that makes kind of a chime sound and

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.560 
that makes kind of a chime sound and
what<00:00:39.770> it<00:00:39.890> is<00:00:40.039> is<00:00:40.309> your<00:00:40.520> right<00:00:40.699> hand<00:00:41.000> is<00:00:41.210> playing

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
what it is is your right hand is playing

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.509 
what it is is your right hand is playing
up<00:00:42.050> you<00:00:42.379> all<00:00:42.559> you<00:00:42.680> do<00:00:42.800> is<00:00:42.920> you<00:00:43.039> play<00:00:43.280> a<00:00:43.309> scale

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
up you all you do is you play a scale

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.180 
up you all you do is you play a scale
whatever<00:00:44.390> that<00:00:44.600> scale<00:00:44.930> is<00:00:45.199> I'm<00:00:45.469> going<00:00:45.829> the<00:00:45.949> C

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
whatever that scale is I'm going the C

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.509 
whatever that scale is I'm going the C
scale<00:00:46.489> but<00:00:46.760> you<00:00:47.120> can<00:00:47.719> play<00:00:47.930> D<00:00:48.410> scale<00:00:48.710> or<00:00:49.010> if

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
scale but you can play D scale or if

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:50.860 
scale but you can play D scale or if
scale<00:00:49.850> or<00:00:49.940> whatever<00:00:50.089> you<00:00:50.360> know<00:00:50.449> but<00:00:50.719> I'm

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
scale or whatever you know but I'm

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.479 
scale or whatever you know but I'm
playing<00:00:51.019> the<00:00:51.170> C<00:00:51.320> scale<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:51.800> I'm<00:00:52.190> playing<00:00:52.430> it

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
playing the C scale and I'm playing it

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:53.259 
playing the C scale and I'm playing it
with<00:00:52.610> both<00:00:52.790> hands

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
with both hands

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.490 
with both hands
but<00:00:53.809> under<00:00:54.079> my<00:00:54.110> right<00:00:54.470> hand<00:00:54.739> I'm<00:00:54.890> playing<00:00:54.920> 1/4

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
but under my right hand I'm playing 1/4

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.979 
but under my right hand I'm playing 1/4
on<00:00:57.500> 2<00:00:57.739> 3<00:00:58.010> 4<00:00:58.280> in<00:00:58.519> my<00:00:58.879> left<00:00:59.059> hand<00:00:59.269> I'm<00:00:59.360> playing<00:00:59.390> a<00:00:59.719> 6

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
on 2 3 4 in my left hand I'm playing a 6

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.560 
on 2 3 4 in my left hand I'm playing a 6
1<00:01:00.440> 2<00:01:00.649> 3<00:01:00.799> 4<00:01:01.190> 5<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:03.610> yeah<00:01:04.610> I<00:01:04.790> have<00:01:05.000> my<00:01:05.180> pedal

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
1 2 3 4 5 and yeah I have my pedal

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.200 
1 2 3 4 5 and yeah I have my pedal
depressed<00:01:06.020> my<00:01:06.200> sustain<00:01:06.619> pedal<00:01:07.009> depressed<00:01:07.399> and

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
depressed my sustain pedal depressed and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:17.969 
depressed my sustain pedal depressed and
so<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:08.630> to<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.170> sustained<00:01:09.679> sustained<00:01:10.490> so

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.700 

notice<00:01:18.700> I'm<00:01:18.880> playing<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.689> percussive<00:01:20.110> oh<00:01:20.409> I'm

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
notice I'm playing a percussive oh I'm

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.840 
notice I'm playing a percussive oh I'm
kind<00:01:21.009> of<00:01:21.070> striking<00:01:21.399> it<00:01:21.610> like<00:01:21.789> that<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.549> so

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
kind of striking it like that and so

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.999 
kind of striking it like that and so
what<00:01:25.060> you<00:01:25.180> get<00:01:25.329> is<00:01:25.390> is<00:01:25.689> kind<00:01:26.020> of<00:01:26.079> a<00:01:26.200> chime<00:01:26.500> sound

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
what you get is is kind of a chime sound

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.800 
what you get is is kind of a chime sound
and<00:01:27.310> that's<00:01:27.460> we're<00:01:28.030> maintaining<00:01:28.210> a<00:01:28.420> sound<00:01:28.659> but

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
and that's we're maintaining a sound but

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.959 
and that's we're maintaining a sound but
that's<00:01:28.960> parallelism<00:01:29.679> is<00:01:30.009> it<00:01:30.159> parallel<00:01:30.759> means

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
that's parallelism is it parallel means

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.779 
that's parallelism is it parallel means
you're<00:01:31.719> keeping<00:01:32.079> your<00:01:32.200> hands<00:01:32.649> frozen<00:01:33.340> and

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
you're keeping your hands frozen and

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.109 
you're keeping your hands frozen and
you're<00:01:33.939> moving<00:01:34.299> like<00:01:35.200> so<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:36.700> this<00:01:36.789> case<00:01:37.090> just

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
you're moving like so in this case just

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.210 
you're moving like so in this case just
down<00:01:37.720> I'm<00:01:38.110> playing<00:01:38.409> it<00:01:38.500> an<00:01:38.590> octave<00:01:38.890> higher

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
down I'm playing it an octave higher

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.160 
down I'm playing it an octave higher
because<00:01:39.520> it<00:01:39.759> has<00:01:39.909> more<00:01:40.119> of<00:01:40.179> a<00:01:40.270> sense<00:01:40.539> before<00:01:40.960> I

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
because it has more of a sense before I

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.380 
because it has more of a sense before I
do<00:01:41.259> that<00:01:41.409> I'm<00:01:41.710> playing<00:01:41.950> a<00:01:42.069> low<00:01:42.250> kind<00:01:42.880> of<00:01:43.030> a<00:01:43.119> bell

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
do that I'm playing a low kind of a bell

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.039 
do that I'm playing a low kind of a bell
sound<00:01:43.810> I'm<00:01:43.960> playing<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.319> C<00:01:44.530> chord<00:01:44.950> C<00:01:45.819> c/g<00:01:46.719> in

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
sound I'm playing the C chord C c/g in

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.210 
sound I'm playing the C chord C c/g in
my<00:01:47.170> left<00:01:47.409> hand<00:01:47.679> and<00:01:47.890> my<00:01:48.250> right<00:01:48.399> hand<00:01:48.610> CDE<00:01:49.390> G

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
putting in the second and kind of

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.669 
putting in the second and kind of
rolling<00:01:53.709> it<00:01:54.720> again<00:01:55.720> kind<00:01:56.049> of<00:01:56.110> percussively

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
rolling it again kind of percussively

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:14.290 
rolling it again kind of percussively
with<00:01:57.009> my<00:01:57.220> pedal<00:01:57.610> down

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.670 

if<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.480> like<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.810> use<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.380> as<00:02:16.560> an

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
if you like to use that as an

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.680 
if you like to use that as an
introduction<00:02:17.190> for<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.580> for<00:02:18.090> this<00:02:18.270> song<00:02:18.510> or

introduction for that for this song or
for<00:02:18.840> lots<00:02:18.960> of<00:02:19.140> songs<00:02:19.320> then<00:02:19.560> when<00:02:19.950> we<00:02:20.070> get<00:02:20.190> to

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310

something like that okay well that was I
started<00:06:28.150> to<00:06:28.360> teach<00:06:28.780> you<00:06:28.930> three<00:06:29.080> kind<00:06:29.320> of

started to teach you three kind of

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.840 
started to teach you three kind of
parallelism<00:06:29.620> but<00:06:30.040> it<00:06:30.220> really<00:06:30.400> turned<00:06:30.670> out<00:06:30.790> to

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.850 
parallelism but it really turned out to

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.650 
parallelism but it really turned out to
be<00:06:31.090> four<00:06:31.390> because<00:06:31.720> not<00:06:32.350> only<00:06:32.380> did<00:06:33.390> did<00:06:34.390> I<00:06:34.480> have

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
be four because not only did did I have

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.710 
be four because not only did did I have
that<00:06:34.870> kind<00:06:35.110> of<00:06:35.230> thing<00:06:35.440> but<00:06:35.620> I<00:06:36.630> mentioned<00:06:37.630> the

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
that kind of thing but I mentioned the

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.530 
that kind of thing but I mentioned the
parallel<00:06:38.200> six<00:06:38.560> leading<00:06:39.550> in<00:06:39.760> back<00:06:40.120> into<00:06:40.420> the

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
parallel six leading in back into the

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.600 
parallel six leading in back into the
melody<00:06:40.900> so<00:06:41.140> there's<00:06:41.650> some<00:06:41.830> ideas<00:06:41.950> about<00:06:42.430> how

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
melody so there's some ideas about how

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.000 
melody so there's some ideas about how
to<00:06:42.850> use<00:06:43.180> parallelisms<00:06:44.110> and<00:06:44.380> songs<00:06:44.710> and

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.010 
to use parallelisms and songs and

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.980 
to use parallelisms and songs and
remember<00:06:45.790> it<00:06:45.880> doesn't<00:06:46.030> apply<00:06:46.300> just<00:06:46.630> a<00:06:46.780> white

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
remember it doesn't apply just a white

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.320 
remember it doesn't apply just a white
Christmas<00:06:47.530> but<00:06:47.710> it<00:06:47.800> applies<00:06:48.040> to<00:06:48.310> every<00:06:49.090> time

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
Christmas but it applies to every time

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.420 
Christmas but it applies to every time
every<00:06:49.780> kind<00:06:50.020> of<00:06:50.080> song<00:06:50.350> where<00:06:50.980> you<00:06:51.010> have<00:06:51.310> an

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
every kind of song where you have an

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.370 
every kind of song where you have an
opportunity<00:06:51.790> to<00:06:52.180> go<00:06:52.360> up<00:06:52.480> a<00:06:52.570> half<00:06:52.750> step<00:06:52.930> or<00:06:53.320> a

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380 
opportunity to go up a half step or a
