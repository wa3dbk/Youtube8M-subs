but<00:00:04.780> this<00:00:04.960> is<00:00:05.140> our<00:00:05.260> soft<00:00:05.620> tissue<00:00:05.860> technique

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:06.400 
but this is our soft tissue technique

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.220 
but this is our soft tissue technique
for<00:00:06.640> the<00:00:06.790> for<00:00:07.180> the<00:00:07.270> lumbar<00:00:07.600> spine<00:00:07.660> and<00:00:08.170> the

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.230 
for the for the lumbar spine and the

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.680 
for the for the lumbar spine and the
lower<00:00:08.410> back<00:00:08.710> to<00:00:09.309> help<00:00:09.520> just<00:00:09.820> release<00:00:10.450> those

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 
lower back to help just release those

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.379 
lower back to help just release those
muscles<00:00:11.170> and<00:00:11.440> give<00:00:11.680> them<00:00:11.920> some<00:00:12.670> ability<00:00:13.360> to

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:13.389 
muscles and give them some ability to

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:14.970 
muscles and give them some ability to
move<00:00:13.629> around<00:00:13.690> a<00:00:14.020> little<00:00:14.110> bit<00:00:14.289> better<00:00:14.469> and<00:00:14.740> when

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
move around a little bit better and when

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.500 
move around a little bit better and when
they<00:00:15.070> have<00:00:15.219> those<00:00:15.400> tight<00:00:15.639> muscles<00:00:16.119> and<00:00:16.330> those

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
they have those tight muscles and those

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.450 
they have those tight muscles and those
injured<00:00:16.930> muscles<00:00:17.289> just<00:00:17.770> help<00:00:18.010> them<00:00:18.130> recover

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460 
injured muscles just help them recover

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.610 
injured muscles just help them recover
faster<00:00:19.060> so<00:00:19.539> we're<00:00:19.660> gonna<00:00:19.750> move<00:00:19.960> down<00:00:20.140> here<00:00:20.440> to

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:20.620 
faster so we're gonna move down here to

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.990 
faster so we're gonna move down here to
the<00:00:20.710> back<00:00:20.890> I'm<00:00:21.310> just<00:00:21.370> going<00:00:21.550> to<00:00:21.670> take<00:00:21.760> a<00:00:21.790> little

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
the back I'm just going to take a little

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.070 
the back I'm just going to take a little
bit<00:00:22.150> of<00:00:22.300> lotion<00:00:22.450> a<00:00:22.870> little<00:00:23.320> bit<00:00:23.410> on<00:00:23.560> each<00:00:23.710> side

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
bit of lotion a little bit on each side

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.880 
bit of lotion a little bit on each side
and<00:00:26.080> what<00:00:26.200> we're<00:00:26.320> gonna<00:00:26.380> do<00:00:26.620> is<00:00:26.710> we're<00:00:26.830> gonna

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.800 
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
get<00:00:27.220> in<00:00:27.340> here<00:00:27.700> and<00:00:27.930> we're<00:00:28.930> gonna<00:00:28.990> gently<00:00:30.810> move

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
get in here and we're gonna gently move

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.779 
get in here and we're gonna gently move
up<00:00:32.020> the<00:00:32.200> lumbar<00:00:32.529> spine<00:00:32.860> and<00:00:32.890> that<00:00:33.280> musculature

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:33.789 
up the lumbar spine and that musculature

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:35.459 
up the lumbar spine and that musculature
and<00:00:33.940> you<00:00:34.120> can<00:00:34.239> see<00:00:34.420> how<00:00:34.510> tight<00:00:34.809> she<00:00:34.840> is<00:00:35.200> through

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:35.469 
and you can see how tight she is through

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.389 
and you can see how tight she is through
there<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:37.690> can<00:00:37.870> see<00:00:38.079> our<00:00:38.199> body<00:00:38.530> move<00:00:38.949> as<00:00:39.249> we

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
there you can see our body move as we

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:40.619 
there you can see our body move as we
get<00:00:39.609> in<00:00:39.730> there<00:00:39.879> and<00:00:40.030> these<00:00:40.089> are<00:00:40.149> the<00:00:40.420> pair

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
get in there and these are the pair

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.479 
get in there and these are the pair
spinals<00:00:41.199> we<00:00:41.440> call<00:00:41.710> them<00:00:41.859> and<00:00:42.039> the<00:00:42.249> lumbar

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
spinals we call them and the lumbar

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.459 
spinals we call them and the lumbar
spine<00:00:42.579> these<00:00:42.999> muscles<00:00:43.480> right<00:00:43.569> here<00:00:43.809> along<00:00:44.319> the

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
spine these muscles right here along the

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.779 
spine these muscles right here along the
side<00:00:44.499> and<00:00:45.039> then<00:00:45.879> as<00:00:46.179> we<00:00:46.809> as<00:00:47.079> we<00:00:47.350> go<00:00:47.379> through<00:00:48.280> the

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
side and then as we as we go through the

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:50.099 
side and then as we as we go through the
soft<00:00:49.059> tissue<00:00:49.149> technique<00:00:49.719> we're<00:00:49.929> going<00:00:49.960> to

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
soft tissue technique we're going to

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:51.750 
soft tissue technique we're going to
move<00:00:50.319> off<00:00:50.499> to<00:00:50.530> the<00:00:50.710> sides<00:00:51.039> and<00:00:51.399> we're<00:00:51.550> going<00:00:51.729> to

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
move off to the sides and we're going to

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.250 
move off to the sides and we're going to
get<00:00:51.940> into<00:00:52.179> a<00:00:52.210> muscle<00:00:52.600> right<00:00:52.749> here<00:00:52.989> called

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
get into a muscle right here called

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.500 
get into a muscle right here called
quadratus<00:00:53.800> lumborum<00:00:53.979> and<00:00:54.579> it's<00:00:55.179> going<00:00:55.329> to<00:00:55.389> be

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
quadratus lumborum and it's going to be

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.360 
quadratus lumborum and it's going to be
really<00:00:55.960> tight<00:00:56.319> in<00:00:56.499> our<00:00:56.589> young<00:00:56.889> athletes

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
really tight in our young athletes

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.660 
really tight in our young athletes
especially<00:00:58.229> and<00:00:59.229> you<00:00:59.710> can<00:00:59.889> just<00:01:00.039> see<00:01:00.280> her<00:01:00.489> as

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
especially and you can just see her as

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.129 
especially and you can just see her as
we<00:01:00.850> get<00:01:01.059> through<00:01:01.329> here<00:01:01.359> and<00:01:01.569> we<00:01:01.780> find<00:01:01.989> those

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:02.139 
we get through here and we find those

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:04.910 
we get through here and we find those
tight<00:01:02.440> areas<00:01:02.829> her<00:01:03.339> body<00:01:03.609> just<00:01:03.909> almost<00:01:04.059> jumps

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
tight areas her body just almost jumps

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.289 
tight areas her body just almost jumps
so<00:01:05.920> that's<00:01:06.070> why<00:01:06.190> we<00:01:06.370> have<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.580> be<00:01:06.670> extra

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
so that's why we have to be extra

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:08.730 
so that's why we have to be extra
careful<00:01:07.510> through<00:01:07.930> there<00:01:08.110> and<00:01:08.320> then<00:01:08.500> we're

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
careful through there and then we're

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.960 
careful through there and then we're
just<00:01:08.770> going<00:01:09.010> to<00:01:09.040> move<00:01:09.220> over<00:01:09.490> here<00:01:09.610> to<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.760> side

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
just going to move over here to the side

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.940 
just going to move over here to the side
and<00:01:10.000> all<00:01:10.630> I'm<00:01:10.780> doing<00:01:10.840> with<00:01:11.110> this<00:01:11.410> hand<00:01:11.680> is<00:01:11.800> I'm

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
and all I'm doing with this hand is I'm

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.150 
and all I'm doing with this hand is I'm
placing<00:01:12.520> it<00:01:12.640> over<00:01:12.730> top<00:01:13.090> of<00:01:13.300> my<00:01:13.870> main<00:01:14.230> hand<00:01:14.620> to

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
placing it over top of my main hand to

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.270 
placing it over top of my main hand to
help<00:01:15.370> it<00:01:15.580> not<00:01:15.730> to<00:01:15.970> slip<00:01:16.330> because<00:01:17.200> that<00:01:17.440> that<00:01:17.920> is

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
help it not to slip because that that is

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.070 
help it not to slip because that that is
not<00:01:18.640> comfortable<00:01:19.000> when<00:01:19.450> your<00:01:19.570> hands<00:01:19.810> slipping

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
not comfortable when your hands slipping

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.510 
not comfortable when your hands slipping
all<00:01:20.290> over<00:01:20.320> those<00:01:20.650> muscles<00:01:21.040> we<00:01:21.190> want<00:01:21.370> to<00:01:21.430> make

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
all over those muscles we want to make

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.610 
all over those muscles we want to make
sure<00:01:21.670> it's<00:01:22.570> there<00:01:22.810> we're<00:01:23.050> not<00:01:23.170> pushing<00:01:23.410> any

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
sure it's there we're not pushing any

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.830 
sure it's there we're not pushing any
harder<00:01:24.040> just<00:01:24.220> light<00:01:24.520> pressure<00:01:24.850> getting

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
harder just light pressure getting

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.270 
harder just light pressure getting
through<00:01:26.170> there<00:01:26.410> and<00:01:26.590> then<00:01:26.710> we<00:01:26.800> get<00:01:26.920> into<00:01:27.190> that

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
through there and then we get into that

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.210 
through there and then we get into that
that<00:01:28.240> QL<00:01:28.750> muscle<00:01:29.170> right<00:01:29.320> here<00:01:32.010> and<00:01:33.010> we're

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
that QL muscle right here and we're

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.430 
that QL muscle right here and we're
gonna<00:01:33.280> do<00:01:33.550> about<00:01:33.670> 10<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.180> 15<00:01:34.570> strokes<00:01:34.990> on<00:01:35.290> each

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
gonna do about 10 to 15 strokes on each

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.940 
gonna do about 10 to 15 strokes on each
side<00:01:35.740> that<00:01:35.980> we're<00:01:36.100> gonna<00:01:36.220> move<00:01:36.430> over<00:01:36.700> here<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
side that we're gonna move over here and

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.080 
side that we're gonna move over here and
we're<00:01:39.100> going<00:01:39.190> to<00:01:39.250> get<00:01:39.370> that<00:01:39.520> left<00:01:39.820> side<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:42.090> so

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
we're going to get that left side and so

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.740 
we're going to get that left side and so
leah<00:01:43.390> is<00:01:43.510> really<00:01:43.900> tall<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.460> that<00:01:46.180> puts<00:01:46.360> a<00:01:46.450> lot

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
leah is really tall and that puts a lot

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.550 
leah is really tall and that puts a lot
of<00:01:46.810> pressure<00:01:47.260> on<00:01:47.410> her<00:01:47.620> lower<00:01:47.860> back

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.370 

so<00:01:52.369> this<00:01:52.670> is<00:01:52.850> needed<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.420> do<00:01:53.570> especially<00:01:54.140> even

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
so this is needed to do especially even

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.370 
so this is needed to do especially even
for<00:01:54.590> maintenance<00:01:55.100> once<00:01:55.970> or<00:01:56.150> twice<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.420> week<00:01:56.570> it

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
for maintenance once or twice a week it

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.289 
for maintenance once or twice a week it
doesn't<00:01:57.740> take<00:01:57.890> very<00:01:57.920> much<00:01:58.190> time<00:01:58.580> just<00:01:58.610> one<00:01:59.180> or

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
doesn't take very much time just one or

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.539 
doesn't take very much time just one or
two<00:01:59.330> minutes<00:01:59.840> to<00:02:00.380> help<00:02:00.560> your<00:02:00.770> athlete<00:02:01.100> recover

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549
