00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.300 
little zipper pocket and I'm guessing
you<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.490> put<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:57.229> don't<00:01:58.229> know<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.799> have<00:01:59.130> another

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
you can put I don't know I have another

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.709 
you can put I don't know I have another
pair<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.610> pants<00:01:59.820> at<00:01:59.969> half<00:02:00.119> these<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.659> I

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
pair of pants at half these and I

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.359 
pair of pants at half these and I
thought<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:00.930> could<00:02:01.140> fit<00:02:01.320> my<00:02:01.439> iPod<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.250> it

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
thought I could fit my iPod in it and it

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.490 
thought I could fit my iPod in it and it
didn't<00:02:02.790> fit<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.030> there<00:02:03.180> but<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.630> don't<00:02:04.320> know<00:02:04.380> you

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
didn't fit in there but I don't know you

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.320 
didn't fit in there but I don't know you
could<00:02:04.619> put<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.860> your<00:02:04.979> queues<00:02:05.490> or<00:02:06.530> cash<00:02:08.330> and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
could put like your queues or cash and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.360 
could put like your queues or cash and
then<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.140> got<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.379> tank<00:02:10.679> top<00:02:10.830> from<00:02:10.979> there<00:02:11.129> and

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
then I got this tank top from there and

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.600 
then I got this tank top from there and
this<00:02:11.550> was<00:02:11.790> only

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
this was only

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.000 
this was only
twelve<00:02:13.330> dollars<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.080> it's<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.650> same<00:02:14.830> pattern

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
twelve dollars and it's the same pattern

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.380 
twelve dollars and it's the same pattern
as<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.400> pant<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:15.910> wouldn't<00:02:16.180> wear<00:02:16.240> them

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
as a pant so I wouldn't wear them

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.300 
as a pant so I wouldn't wear them
together<00:02:16.800> but<00:02:17.800> I<00:02:17.830> thought<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.190> would<00:02:18.280> look

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
together but I thought it would look

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.180 
together but I thought it would look
good<00:02:18.610> with<00:02:18.670> my<00:02:18.880> pink<00:02:19.540> or<00:02:19.840> black<00:02:20.620> pants<00:02:20.950> or

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
good with my pink or black pants or

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.210 
good with my pink or black pants or
whatever<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.820> it's<00:02:22.750> racerback<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.010> kind

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
whatever and it's racerback and it kind

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.580 
whatever and it's racerback and it kind
of<00:02:24.280> has<00:02:24.460> a<00:02:24.490> built<00:02:24.910> in<00:02:25.410> like<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.530> built-in<00:02:26.920> bra

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
of has a built in like a built-in bra

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.650 
of has a built in like a built-in bra
you'll<00:02:29.590> see<00:02:29.800> that<00:02:29.970> but<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.000> would<00:02:31.210> still<00:02:31.420> wear<00:02:31.600> a

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
you'll see that but I would still wear a

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.820 
you'll see that but I would still wear a
sports<00:02:31.960> wear<00:02:32.080> underneath<00:02:32.290> because<00:02:32.530> it

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
sports wear underneath because it

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.660 
sports wear underneath because it
doesn't<00:02:33.100> give<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.310> much<00:02:33.520> support

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
doesn't give you that much support

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.640 
doesn't give you that much support
almost<00:02:34.120> like<00:02:34.480> really<00:02:35.080> small<00:02:35.260> boots<00:02:35.560> or

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
almost like really small boots or

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.650 
almost like really small boots or
something<00:02:35.950> um<00:02:36.250> again<00:02:36.850> this<00:02:37.180> is<00:02:37.300> kind<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.540> like

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
something um again this is kind of like

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.360 
something um again this is kind of like
the<00:02:37.750> same<00:02:37.900> material<00:02:38.440> super<00:02:38.770> stretchy<00:02:39.070> but

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
the same material super stretchy but

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.000 
the same material super stretchy but
thick<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.180> it's<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.960> don't<00:02:41.410> know<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.500> really<00:02:41.650> like

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
thick so it's I don't know I really like

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.970 
thick so it's I don't know I really like
sick<00:02:42.580> stretchy<00:02:43.030> material<00:02:43.240> and<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.740> last

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
sick stretchy material and the last

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.210 
sick stretchy material and the last
place<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.490> went<00:02:45.670> was<00:02:45.910> Old<00:02:46.360> Navy<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.890> got<00:02:48.040> two

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
place I went was Old Navy and I got two

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.740

tank<00:02:48.460> tops<00:02:48.700> from<00:02:48.820> there<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.240> these<00:02:49.390> were<00:02:49.570> both

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
tank tops from there and these were both

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.000 
tank tops from there and these were both
the<00:02:49.990> same<00:02:50.230> price<00:02:51.630> 1694<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:53.470> this<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:53.709> just<00:02:53.890> a

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
the same price 1694 so this is just a
