00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.690
 Left 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.840
 it does not fit really well but to 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.840
 demonstration to explain 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.809
 I can intersect in the upper area 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:01:12.840
 to give over the reins 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:01:39.000
 it does not happen particularly remains 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:42.320
 relatively clear above the bottom 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.369
 bitten each other 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.799
 works over the lever effect though 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.000
 I train it here relating the here 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.729
 Forward 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.409
 he pulls forward and then there is 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.409
 pressure on the neck 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:05.590
 and I cut it better 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:09.170
 the child would be my lower suit 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.429
 the chain will sleep down so hangs 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.170
 she still loose one more 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.110
 finger between now if I mean here my 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:20.320
 holding finger to his jaw 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:23.240
 under the child chain i take the suit 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:37.160
 then I notice that the air comes out 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:39.080
 you clearly something like that here 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.820
 leverage exclusion is not just 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.260
 That's on the lay 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.800
 It's not just that it's putting pressure on you 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.930
 had bitten tongue 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.050
 Over that put the pressure on the neck 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.200
 there are also the suits over the 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.410
 Kind chain the pressure on the under and 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.269
 this is so diagonally 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:05.530
 I'm talking about the so-called tongue freedom 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.530
 the ball in the middle on the head 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:39.799
 I cover myself 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:49.760
 up here I have the first stop this 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:52.629
 Hard bones could be here that's all 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:58.370
 stand by side 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:04:01.040
 but that is very important because it is here 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:25.810
 a certain angle yes gives this 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:25.810
 Bone could do this if I am you 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:40.830
 nice the folding trends here 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:43.960
 the piece I have here the angle 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.690
 that will be tight the pancreas please 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.970
 nonsense now he has the down here 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.280
 churches will disappear here 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.350
 is his throat 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.520
 how should he swallow now like 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.520
 should he still breathe? 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.140
 these are all structures that always 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.840
 are concerned with the piece here 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.300
 the head about it but we know people 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.310
 also all tension headache if us 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.070
 from the back of here up the head 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.080
 If you think about it then I draw 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.660
 make every angle tight and bring over 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.390
 a lever bit reprint here above 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:27.660
 still out of it and how many 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.660
 Horses do not have this cushion like him 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.380
 I have a little bit of everything 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:36.990
 much for the cervical spine 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.990
 if they go there 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:14.010
 I would only be with a certain 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:18.800
 to seek to ride then have 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:23.220
 I get this certain tonne as 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:29.100
 upset and caught up in no time 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:32.010
 that's gone very fast that is 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.630
 now really more annoying and so 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.880
 it looks for and that is a 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:39.750
 it is a hyper- spotted zion and 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:42.020
 i have nothing in here so easy 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.020
 is it 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:53.100
 if you think about it now 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:58.910
 horses in dressage exams for suit 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:07:02.640
 have the suits in their campaign 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:06.170
 then that is already fierce, and how little 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:09.840
 really train you need and such a 

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:12.830
 Giant as a massing guy there 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.120
 get in the role 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:18.800
 I do not need much for that 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.800
 nothing in hand here 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.630
 I am yes
