00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
this is a very cool replica the reason

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.950 
this is a very cool replica the reason
like<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.069> said<00:01:47.219> it<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.909> limited<00:01:48.329> edition<00:01:48.479> and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
like I said it is a limited edition and

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.010 
like I said it is a limited edition and
it's<00:01:49.740> limited<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.329> 2,000<00:01:51.329> pieces<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:51.899> this

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
it's limited to 2,000 pieces for this

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.919 
it's limited to 2,000 pieces for this
one<00:01:52.259> because<00:01:52.889> they<00:01:53.340> actually<00:01:53.549> made<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.119> foam<00:01:54.600> I

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
one because they actually made a foam I

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.539 
one because they actually made a foam I
think<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.289> like<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.439> foam<00:01:55.679> rubber<00:01:55.950> version

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
think it's like a foam rubber version

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.629 
think it's like a foam rubber version
for<00:01:56.909> cosplayers<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:58.499> for<00:01:58.770> kids<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.280> guess<00:01:59.459> I

00:01:59.629 --> 00:01:59.639 
for cosplayers and for kids I guess I

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:02.859 
for cosplayers and for kids I guess I
don't<00:01:59.759> know<00:02:00.170> they<00:02:01.170> sell<00:02:01.439> them<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.219> NECA

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
don't know they sell them on the NECA

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.289 
don't know they sell them on the NECA
eBay<00:02:03.869> page<00:02:04.139> actually<00:02:04.560> right<00:02:04.950> now<00:02:05.149> but<00:02:06.149> this

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
eBay page actually right now but this

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.969 
eBay page actually right now but this
one<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> little<00:02:06.929> harder<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.319> find<00:02:07.439> because

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
one is a little harder to find because

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.950 
one is a little harder to find because
it<00:02:08.130> was<00:02:08.250> only<00:02:08.580> sold<00:02:08.850> at<00:02:09.150> the<00:02:09.720> San<00:02:09.930> Diego
