00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
difficult at all really I've made a ton

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.930 
difficult at all really I've made a ton
of<00:02:07.829> these<00:02:08.190> before

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
of these before

of these before
and<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:10.110> then<00:02:10.349> you're<00:02:10.530> going<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.830> bend<00:02:11.099> this

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
and so then you're going to bend this

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.520 
and so then you're going to bend this
back<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.480> little<00:02:12.780> bit<00:02:12.959> okay

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
back a little bit okay

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.949 
back a little bit okay
and<00:02:13.830> you're<00:02:14.459> going<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.790> put<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> little<00:02:15.540> drop<00:02:15.810> of

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
and you're going to put a little drop of

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.960 
and you're going to put a little drop of
hot<00:02:16.380> glue<00:02:16.590> be<00:02:16.860> careful<00:02:17.250> with<00:02:17.400> your<00:02:17.580> thumb

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
hot glue be careful with your thumb

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.610 
hot glue be careful with your thumb
there<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.690> don't<00:02:18.750> want<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.020> kids<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.319> do<00:02:19.470> that

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
there you don't want the kids to do that

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.920 
there you don't want the kids to do that
part<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.220> could<00:02:20.370> do<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.580> part<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.180> so

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
part you could do that part and so

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.080 
part you could do that part and so
you're<00:02:22.110> just<00:02:22.140> gonna<00:02:22.470> put<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:22.800> little<00:02:23.310> drop<00:02:23.760> of

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
you're just gonna put a little drop of

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.660 
you're just gonna put a little drop of
glue<00:02:24.420> there<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.680> I've<00:02:26.069> already<00:02:26.340> given<00:02:26.430> it

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
glue there and so I've already given it

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.270 
glue there and so I've already given it
like<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:27.060> few<00:02:27.330> seconds<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:28.560> it's<00:02:28.680> not<00:02:28.770> as<00:02:29.040> hot

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
like a few seconds to so it's not as hot

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.280 
like a few seconds to so it's not as hot
so<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:29.580> don't<00:02:29.819> want<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:29.970> burn<00:02:30.180> myself<00:02:30.450> okay

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
so I don't want to burn myself okay

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.890 
so I don't want to burn myself okay
which<00:02:31.890> I've<00:02:32.040> done<00:02:32.220> lots<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.850> then<00:02:33.720> you're

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
which I've done lots and then you're

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.430 
which I've done lots and then you're
going<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.459> put<00:02:35.459> that<00:02:35.700> on<00:02:35.910> top<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.840> end<00:02:37.170> you're

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
going to put that on top that end you're

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.809 
going to put that on top that end you're
going<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.709> put<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:37.920> right<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.310> top<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.670> the

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
going to put that right on top of the

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.550 
going to put that right on top of the
glue<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.270> hold<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.690> down<00:02:39.720> with<00:02:40.110> your<00:02:40.140> thumb

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
glue and hold it down with your thumb

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.800 
glue and hold it down with your thumb
and<00:02:40.709> your<00:02:40.830> forefinger<00:02:41.430> okay<00:02:41.880> it's<00:02:42.540> already

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
and your forefinger okay it's already

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.460 
and your forefinger okay it's already
set<00:02:43.170> see<00:02:43.730> super<00:02:44.730> simple<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.270> make<00:02:45.410> there<00:02:46.410> you

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
set see super simple to make there you

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.199 
set see super simple to make there you
go<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.070> want<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.340> do<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.670> second<00:02:48.090> time

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
go so you want to do that a second time

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.080 
go so you want to do that a second time
so<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.510> end<00:02:48.690> up<00:02:48.810> with<00:02:48.870> two<00:02:49.170> of<00:02:49.260> these<00:02:49.350> halves

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
so you end up with two of these halves

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.900 
so you end up with two of these halves
which<00:02:51.110> for<00:02:52.110> times<00:02:52.320> sake<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.890> just<00:02:53.580> happen<00:02:53.820> to

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
which for times sake I just happen to

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.729 
which for times sake I just happen to
have<00:02:53.970> two<00:02:54.300> halves<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:55.170> you'll<00:02:55.350> be<00:02:55.470> able<00:02:55.530> to

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
have two halves so you'll be able to

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.410 
have two halves so you'll be able to
feel<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.100> roughness<00:02:56.459> of<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.730> glue<00:02:56.940> that<00:02:56.970> goes

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
feel the roughness of the glue that goes

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.490 
feel the roughness of the glue that goes
on<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.690> inside<00:02:57.720> okay<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.880> so<00:02:59.880> next<00:03:00.870> thing<00:03:01.050> I

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
on the inside okay and so next thing I

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.479 
on the inside okay and so next thing I
want<00:03:01.769> to<00:03:01.950> put<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.640> little<00:03:03.480> bit<00:03:03.600> of<00:03:03.660> glue<00:03:04.160> up<00:03:05.160> at

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
want to put a little bit of glue up at

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.550 
want to put a little bit of glue up at
the<00:03:05.610> top<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.660> feel<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.050> rough<00:03:07.230> edge<00:03:07.410> on

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
the top so you feel the rough edge on

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.720 
the top so you feel the rough edge on
the<00:03:07.620> bottom<00:03:07.680> that's<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.160> bottom<00:03:08.489> where<00:03:08.610> the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730
