00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
Minecraft but I like the way the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.270 
Minecraft but I like the way the
graphics<00:00:54.300> are<00:00:54.480> if<00:00:55.020> they<00:00:55.410> had<00:00:55.590> good<00:00:55.770> graphics

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
graphics are if they had good graphics

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.790 
graphics are if they had good graphics
it<00:00:56.430> wouldn't<00:00:56.730> be<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> same<00:00:57.000> minecraft<00:00:57.800> okay

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800
