is<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:36.440> device<00:00:36.949> for<00:00:37.309> that<00:00:37.519> probably<00:00:38.000> one<00:00:38.300> of

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
is the device for that probably one of

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.479 
is the device for that probably one of
the<00:00:38.449> simplest<00:00:38.750> ways<00:00:38.989> you<00:00:39.350> could<00:00:39.559> reliably<00:00:40.100> get

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
the simplest ways you could reliably get

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.119 
the simplest ways you could reliably get
a<00:00:40.519> microphone<00:00:40.910> connected<00:00:41.780> to<00:00:41.930> a<00:00:41.960> computer<00:00:42.199> Mac

a microphone connected to a computer Mac

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.910 
a microphone connected to a computer Mac
or<00:00:43.370> PC<00:00:43.600> so<00:00:44.600> you've<00:00:44.719> got<00:00:44.840> an<00:00:44.929> XLR<00:00:45.320> input<00:00:45.679> on<00:00:45.800> the

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
or PC so you've got an XLR input on the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.650 
or PC so you've got an XLR input on the
top<00:00:46.129> right<00:00:46.429> it<00:00:46.519> will<00:00:46.640> take<00:00:46.879> dynamic<00:00:47.510> or

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
top right it will take dynamic or

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.720 
top right it will take dynamic or
condenser<00:00:47.870> microphones<00:00:48.649> there<00:00:48.829> is<00:00:48.980> 48<00:00:49.489> volt

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
condenser microphones there is 48 volt

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.520 
condenser microphones there is 48 volt
phantom<00:00:50.059> power<00:00:50.239> that's<00:00:50.660> switchable<00:00:51.109> on<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.410> X

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
phantom power that's switchable on the X

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.020 
phantom power that's switchable on the X
to<00:00:51.710> you<00:00:51.859> so<00:00:52.039> you<00:00:52.129> can<00:00:52.219> use<00:00:52.370> it<00:00:52.429> with<00:00:52.579> condenser

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
to you so you can use it with condenser

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.299 
to you so you can use it with condenser
microphones<00:00:53.539> and<00:00:53.809> then<00:00:54.260> a<00:00:54.289> USB<00:00:54.829> output<00:00:55.190> that

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
microphones and then a USB output that

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:56.860 
microphones and then a USB output that
just<00:00:55.489> goes<00:00:55.609> right<00:00:55.850> into<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.179> USB<00:00:56.269> jack<00:00:56.719> on

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
just goes right into the USB jack on

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.139 
just goes right into the USB jack on
your<00:00:56.899> computer<00:00:57.379> it's<00:00:57.559> very<00:00:57.739> simple<00:00:58.100> there's<00:00:59.030> a

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
your computer it's very simple there's a

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.720 
your computer it's very simple there's a
analog<00:01:00.050> mic<00:01:00.320> gain<00:01:00.559> control<00:01:00.980> on<00:01:01.160> here<00:01:01.399> so<00:01:01.670> you

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
analog mic gain control on here so you

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.970 
analog mic gain control on here so you
can<00:01:01.969> optimize<00:01:02.149> the<00:01:02.480> signal<00:01:03.109> level<00:01:03.379> before<00:01:03.620> it

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
can optimize the signal level before it

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.590 
can optimize the signal level before it
goes<00:01:04.190> through<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:04.489> A<00:01:04.519> to<00:01:04.640> D<00:01:04.790> conversion<00:01:05.300> which

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
goes through the A to D conversion which

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.050 
goes through the A to D conversion which
is<00:01:05.630> pretty<00:01:05.960> important<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:06.770> also<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.550> three

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
is pretty important and also a three

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.030 
is pretty important and also a three
color<00:01:08.270> LED<00:01:08.930> on<00:01:09.110> here<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:09.530> that<00:01:09.680> you<00:01:09.770> know<00:01:09.920> if

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
color LED on here so that you know if

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.980 
color LED on here so that you know if
your<00:01:10.280> signal<00:01:10.760> level<00:01:11.150> is<00:01:11.240> set<00:01:11.420> properly<00:01:11.810> it's

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
your signal level is set properly it's

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.320 
your signal level is set properly it's
green<00:01:12.200> yellow<00:01:12.410> or<00:01:12.590> red<00:01:12.910> there's<00:01:13.910> a<00:01:14.000> headphone

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
time if you need to overdub you need to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.640 
time if you need to overdub you need to
be<00:01:22.100> able<00:01:22.190> to<00:01:22.310> stay<00:01:22.610> in<00:01:23.000> time<00:01:23.690> with<00:01:24.260> the

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
to you before the a to D conversion

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.760 
to you before the a to D conversion
allows<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.510> to<00:01:32.630> monitor<00:01:32.810> that<00:01:33.200> in<00:01:33.350> real<00:01:33.530> time

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
allows you to monitor that in real time

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.830 
allows you to monitor that in real time
so<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:34.100> don't<00:01:34.340> have<00:01:34.610> any<00:01:34.850> weird<00:01:35.150> delay<00:01:35.480> issues

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.870 
output and then this last knob at the
bottom<00:01:41.120> here<00:01:41.300> is<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.810> monitor<00:01:42.590> blend<00:01:43.250> control

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
bottom here is the monitor blend control

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.670 
bottom here is the monitor blend control
so<00:01:44.150> this<00:01:44.300> allows<00:01:44.540> you<00:01:44.690> to<00:01:44.780> customize<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:45.470> mix

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
so this allows you to customize the mix

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.280 
so this allows you to customize the mix
of<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.430> live<00:01:46.640> mic<00:01:46.940> signal<00:01:47.240> with<00:01:47.870> the<00:01:48.020> audio

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
of the live mic signal with the audio

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.560 
of the live mic signal with the audio
that's<00:01:48.500> coming<00:01:48.890> back<00:01:49.040> from<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.430> computer<00:01:49.880> so

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
that's coming back from the computer so

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.540 
that's coming back from the computer so
it's<00:01:50.780> great<00:01:51.020> if<00:01:51.440> you're<00:01:51.530> doing<00:01:51.590> podcast<00:01:52.310> and

it's great if you're doing podcast and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.010 
it's great if you're doing podcast and
again<00:01:52.790> just<00:01:52.910> need<00:01:53.120> one<00:01:53.270> microphone<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:53.900> get

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
again just need one microphone to get

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.630 
again just need one microphone to get
into<00:01:54.200> your<00:01:54.290> computer<00:01:54.770> or<00:01:54.920> if<00:01:55.010> you're<00:01:55.610> a

recording microphones so these are the
same<00:02:33.590> similar<00:02:34.310> applications<00:02:35.030> right<00:02:35.210> for

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
same similar applications right for

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.110 
same similar applications right for
studio<00:02:35.810> recording<00:02:35.840> home<00:02:36.710> studios<00:02:37.190> but<00:02:37.910> again

hopefully at a price point that that can

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.190 
hopefully at a price point that that can
allow<00:02:40.580> more<00:02:40.760> people<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.210> get<00:02:41.630> into<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.870> high
