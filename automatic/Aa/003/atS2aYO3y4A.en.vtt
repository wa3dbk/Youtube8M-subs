any other part of the body the first
thing<00:01:01.970> we<00:01:02.089> did<00:01:02.269> is<00:01:02.720> we<00:01:03.019> developed<00:01:03.170> a

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
thing we did is we developed a

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.219 
thing we did is we developed a
breathable<00:01:04.100> zone<00:01:04.460> on<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.699> bra<00:01:04.910> so<00:01:05.660> the<00:01:05.810> entire

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
breathable zone on the bra so the entire

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.380 
breathable zone on the bra so the entire
center<00:01:06.860> back<00:01:07.130> is<00:01:07.400> actually<00:01:07.550> breathable

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.170 

the<00:01:12.900> cup<00:01:13.650> area<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> bra<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.610> our<00:01:14.820> moisture

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
the cup area of the bra is our moisture

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.600 
the cup area of the bra is our moisture
management<00:01:15.660> zone<00:01:15.870> so<00:01:16.350> what<00:01:16.590> you'll<00:01:16.920> see<00:01:17.280> is

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
management zone so what you'll see is

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.250 
management zone so what you'll see is
our<00:01:17.910> materials<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.840> been<00:01:18.870> designed

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
our materials have been designed

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.590 
our materials have been designed
specifically<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.070> suck<00:01:20.850> more<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.420> more

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
specifically to suck more and more

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.990 
specifically to suck more and more
moisture<00:01:22.110> off<00:01:22.230> the<00:01:22.260> body<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:29.040> chest<00:01:29.430> ban<00:01:29.640> in

moisture off the body the chest ban in

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.050 
moisture off the body the chest ban in
particular<00:01:30.360> has<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.470> new<00:01:31.980> construction<00:01:32.550> and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
particular has a new construction and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.170 
particular has a new construction and
within<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.690> construction<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:35.160> allows<00:01:35.460> us<00:01:35.790> to

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
within that construction it allows us to

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.270 
within that construction it allows us to
stitch<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.780> moisture<00:01:37.110> management<00:01:37.290> fabric<00:01:37.980> on

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280

stitch the moisture management fabric on
the<00:01:38.370> outside<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.910> the<00:01:38.970> bra<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.840> there's<00:01:40.320> not<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the outside of the bra so there's not a

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.120 
the outside of the bra so there's not a
seam<00:01:41.460> chafing<00:01:42.180> against<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.600> body<00:01:43.130> it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
seam chafing against the body it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.420 
seam chafing against the body it
stretches<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:45.450> durable<00:01:45.810> over<00:01:46.140> time<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.920> it

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
stretches it is durable over time and it

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.630 
stretches it is durable over time and it
can<00:01:47.729> get<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.210> off<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.450> body<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:48.840> ease

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
can get on and off the body with ease

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.710 
can get on and off the body with ease
one<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.760> things<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.090> did<00:01:51.270> was<00:01:51.510> look

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
one of the things that we did was look

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.080 
one of the things that we did was look
at<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.990> type<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.229> thread<00:01:52.710> but<00:01:53.250> also<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.790> use

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
at the type of thread but also the use

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.690 
at the type of thread but also the use
of<00:01:54.120> the<00:01:54.390> thread<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.770> bra<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.460> we<00:01:56.580> were

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
of the thread in the bra but we were

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.660 
of the thread in the bra but we were
very<00:01:56.940> cognizant<00:01:57.690> of<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.680> type<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.130> stitches

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
very cognizant of the type of stitches

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.900 
very cognizant of the type of stitches
we<00:01:59.910> used<00:02:00.470> we<00:02:01.470> wanted<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.920> reduce<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.610> risk<00:02:02.760> of

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
we used we wanted to reduce the risk of

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.000 
we used we wanted to reduce the risk of
chafing<00:02:03.180> we<00:02:03.990> also<00:02:04.170> wanted<00:02:04.440> to<00:02:04.500> make<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:04.830> bra

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
chafing we also wanted to make the bra

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.880 
chafing we also wanted to make the bra
lighter<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.580> weight<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.810> all<00:02:07.050> the<00:02:07.200> bras<00:02:07.410> you

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
lighter in weight so on all the bras you

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.130 
lighter in weight so on all the bras you
will<00:02:08.010> see<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.700> now<00:02:09.030> all<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.420> trim<00:02:09.720> items

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
will see that now all the trim items

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.320 
will see that now all the trim items
have<00:02:10.890> gone<00:02:11.070> to<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.340> zig-zag<00:02:11.910> stitch

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
have gone to a zig-zag stitch

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.650 
have gone to a zig-zag stitch
application<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:14.130> some<00:02:14.400> cases<00:02:14.700> we<00:02:15.270> reduced

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
application and in some cases we reduced

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.089 
application and in some cases we reduced
the<00:02:15.870> weight<00:02:16.020> by<00:02:16.380> 10%

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
the weight by 10%

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.580

as<00:02:43.879> we<00:02:44.120> were<00:02:44.209> going<00:02:44.420> through<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.659> design

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
as we were going through the design

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.160 
as we were going through the design
process<00:02:45.489> we<00:02:46.489> discovered<00:02:47.269> that<00:02:47.780> one<00:02:48.019> of<00:02:48.049> the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
process we discovered that one of the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.289 
process we discovered that one of the
samples<00:02:48.709> that<00:02:48.890> came<00:02:49.159> from<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.459> factory<00:02:49.970> was<00:02:50.269> a

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
samples that came from the factory was a

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.170 
samples that came from the factory was a
molded<00:02:50.690> part<00:02:50.959> that<00:02:51.739> today<00:02:52.190> would<00:02:52.400> tell<00:02:52.670> us<00:02:52.819> was

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
molded part that today would tell us was

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.990 
molded part that today would tell us was
a<00:02:53.209> mistake<00:02:53.299> in<00:02:54.079> the<00:02:54.170> part<00:02:54.440> that<00:02:54.859> had<00:02:55.099> a<00:02:55.129> overuse

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
a mistake in the part that had a overuse

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.410 
a mistake in the part that had a overuse

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
of molding into space or mash but we saw

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.190 
of molding into space or mash but we saw
it<00:02:59.450> as<00:02:59.900> something<00:03:00.890> beautiful<00:03:01.040> because<00:03:01.640> we<00:03:02.420> saw

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
it as something beautiful because we saw
