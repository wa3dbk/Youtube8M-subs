00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
probably shouldn't have done that but

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.080 
probably shouldn't have done that but
you<00:01:01.980> know<00:01:02.480> Yolo<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.750> know<00:01:04.610> it<00:01:05.610> didn't<00:01:05.880> give<00:01:06.000> me

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
you know Yolo you know it didn't give me

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.460 
you know Yolo you know it didn't give me
anything<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.630> checked<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> bungee<00:01:07.350> app

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
anything and I checked the bungee app

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.320 
anything and I checked the bungee app
and<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.430> um<00:01:09.500> didn't<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.619> anything<00:01:10.799> special

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
and it um didn't have anything special

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.820 
and it um didn't have anything special
like<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.750> was<00:01:12.869> empty<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.619> it'll<00:01:13.799> probably

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
like it it was empty so it'll probably

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.469 
like it it was empty so it'll probably
be<00:01:14.189> something<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.549> future<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.150> area<00:01:15.420> is

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.690 
coming in later maybe they'll extend our
into<00:04:00.140> it<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.380> I'll<00:04:00.500> become<00:04:00.769> like<00:04:00.980> a<00:04:01.010> mini<00:04:01.340> raid

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
into it and I'll become like a mini raid

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.020 
into it and I'll become like a mini raid
I<00:04:02.090> don't<00:04:02.900> know<00:04:03.110> all<00:04:03.890> i<00:04:03.950> know<00:04:04.100> is<00:04:04.220> it<00:04:04.549> it's

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
I don't know all i know is it it's

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.810 
I don't know all i know is it it's
wasn't<00:04:05.690> that<00:04:05.810> hard<00:04:05.959> to<00:04:06.049> take<00:04:06.320> down<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:07.070> I<00:04:07.610> see

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
wasn't that hard to take down and I see

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.470 
wasn't that hard to take down and I see
no<00:04:07.940> reason<00:04:07.970> for<00:04:08.390> it<00:04:08.660> to<00:04:08.780> be<00:04:09.049> a<00:04:09.459> you<00:04:10.459> know<00:04:10.580> not

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
no reason for it to be a you know not

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.350 
no reason for it to be a you know not
here<00:04:11.810> right<00:04:11.989> now<00:04:12.019> so<00:04:12.580> as<00:04:13.580> you<00:04:13.700> can<00:04:13.820> see<00:04:13.970> I<00:04:14.000> pull

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
here right now so as you can see I pull

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.890 
here right now so as you can see I pull
up<00:04:14.390> my<00:04:14.540> ghost<00:04:14.810> to<00:04:15.110> locate<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.560> door<00:04:15.830> again<00:04:16.900> see

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
up my ghost to locate the door again see

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.849 
up my ghost to locate the door again see
where<00:04:18.080> the<00:04:18.200> exit<00:04:18.560> is<00:04:19.570> not<00:04:20.570> much<00:04:20.750> to<00:04:20.900> do<00:04:21.080> here

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
where the exit is not much to do here

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.760 
where the exit is not much to do here
but<00:04:22.069> it's<00:04:22.909> a<00:04:23.030> fun<00:04:23.180> little<00:04:23.330> area<00:04:23.719> when<00:04:24.439> its<00:04:24.590> open

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
but it's a fun little area when its open

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.830 
but it's a fun little area when its open
I<00:04:25.069> guess<00:04:25.250> it'll<00:04:25.430> give<00:04:25.639> you<00:04:25.759> some<00:04:26.449> what<00:04:26.629> of<00:04:26.659> a

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
I guess it'll give you some what of a

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.110 
I guess it'll give you some what of a
little<00:04:27.080> challenge<00:04:27.580> unless<00:04:28.580> you're<00:04:28.789> as<00:04:28.879> strong

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
little challenge unless you're as strong

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.469 
little challenge unless you're as strong
as<00:04:29.330> I<00:04:29.479> was<00:04:30.009> try<00:04:31.009> getting<00:04:31.159> out<00:04:31.340> this<00:04:31.490> window<00:04:31.759> it

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
as I was try getting out this window it

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:33.760 
as I was try getting out this window it
definitely<00:04:32.750> looks<00:04:33.020> like<00:04:33.139> i<00:04:33.229> could<00:04:33.409> get<00:04:33.500> over
