00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.400
 daily reruns 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.700
 then it shows how well it is day to day 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.140
 is a producer who has 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.640
 a studio and we also sell 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.500
 rather shows several bands only 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.630
 a lot happens there in 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.130
 fernando and sorocaba andreas kisser has the 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.620
 wire to make a game sound with 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.390
 thiaguinho has the rock part clothes can 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.580
 popular has everything always music is the 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.370
 gig there on Thursday denied us 9 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.560
 works only with rock and there is a field with 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.810
 Any opinion on the 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.480
 rock who thinks he has to come again 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.420
 I think it's stuffed so much later 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.280
 good thing has a lot of bad so it's a 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.270
 people to make a catadao anyway 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.280
 cool bands 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.740
 I think the coolest one that even chills 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.840
 therefore the cool band is one that 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.460
 makes music really the truth of it without 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.740
 think of being similar to that other 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.540
 or without wanting to succeed without doing 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.820
 question of being famous that radio is 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.920
 legal released a lot of band and without 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.040
 even so the strike complained of some 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.780
 thing and when it loses is when the country 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.580
 Stay there, I miss that time. 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.890
 longing top so now already 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.290
 valuing much more every little thing that 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.610
 happens and the new generation that has not arrived 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.980
 to live so much that you are a woman who 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.050
 He is 12 years old today when he was 76 years old. 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.060
 So you 're living it more willingly. 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.010
 with a reference always has a galera 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.230

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.130
 official but rock'n'roll and that is through 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.530
 lost right 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.750

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.540
 even more to make music with 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.100

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.810
