world world war one and then World War
two<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.589> there<00:01:04.799> was<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.040> League<00:01:05.220> of

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.770 
two and so there was the League of
Nations<00:01:05.729> they<00:01:05.909> try<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.150> get<00:01:06.330> started<00:01:06.600> then

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
Nations they try to get started then

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.530 
Nations they try to get started then
after<00:01:07.229> World<00:01:07.409> War<00:01:07.530> Two<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.189> was<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:09.119> United

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
after World War Two it was the United

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.870 
after World War Two it was the United
Nations<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.439> idea<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.799> coming<00:01:11.189> together<00:01:11.310> so

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
Nations the idea of coming together so

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.010 
Nations the idea of coming together so
that<00:01:11.909> nations<00:01:12.330> could<00:01:12.510> talk<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.840> each<00:01:12.930> other

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
that nations could talk to each other

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.350 
that nations could talk to each other
which<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.260> probably<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.650> pretty<00:01:13.799> good<00:01:14.010> idea<00:01:14.360> but

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
which is probably a pretty good idea but

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.880 
which is probably a pretty good idea but
it<00:01:15.479> being<00:01:15.689> run<00:01:15.960> by<00:01:15.990> people<00:01:16.439> without<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it being run by people without a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.190 
it being run by people without a
democratic<00:01:17.580> process<00:01:18.180> or<00:01:18.390> right<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.540> vote<00:01:18.930> for

democratic process or right to vote for
these<00:01:19.290> leaders<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> part<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.460> would

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
these leaders is the part that I would
