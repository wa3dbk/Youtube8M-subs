give the soil and stuff and hopefully

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.290 
give the soil and stuff and hopefully
happen<00:00:38.790> around<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.629> useful<00:00:40.170> time<00:00:40.410> maybe<00:00:41.300> that's

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
happen around a useful time maybe that's

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.970 
happen around a useful time maybe that's
the<00:00:42.390> plan<00:00:42.570> anyway<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:43.350> basically<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.680> beat

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
fingers Tekkit but first of all they

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.799 
fingers Tekkit but first of all they
actually<00:00:56.070> are<00:00:56.250> submission<00:00:56.879> from<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.300> people

which<00:01:01.559> means<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.829> can<00:01:01.949> feel<00:01:02.100> better<00:01:02.250> about

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
which means I can feel better about

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.310 
which means I can feel better about
myself<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:03.030> using<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.449> which<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.780> always<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
myself to using it which is always a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.649 
myself to using it which is always a
positive<00:01:04.589> thing<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.390> second<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:06.479> weight

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
positive thing and second for weight

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.359 
positive thing and second for weight
actually<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.380> more<00:01:07.560> recent<00:01:07.710> version<00:01:08.189> so

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
actually it's a more recent version so

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.429 
actually it's a more recent version so
it<00:01:08.400> actually<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:09.150> know<00:01:09.270> genuinely<00:01:09.750> had<00:01:09.990> its

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
it actually you know genuinely had its

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.770 
it actually you know genuinely had its
1.4<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:11.820> more<00:01:11.939> before<00:01:12.270> mod<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.659> has

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
1.4 like it's more before mod so it has

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.090 
1.4 like it's more before mod so it has
all<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:12.990> default<00:01:13.439> minecraft<00:01:13.530> stuff<00:01:13.920> like

nukes I think one once you go like that
slide<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> house<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.720> gets<00:01:45.780> rid<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.020> the

slide the house so it gets rid of the
rubber<00:01:46.320> trees<00:01:47.329> then<00:01:48.329> one<00:01:48.600> should<00:01:48.630> go<00:01:48.840> like

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
rubber trees then one should go like

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.289 
rubber trees then one should go like
there<00:01:50.040> may<00:01:50.369> be<00:01:52.610> yeah<00:01:53.610> once<00:01:53.880> once<00:01:54.210> you

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
there may be yeah once once you

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.700 
there may be yeah once once you
definitely<00:01:54.630> go<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.200> wall<00:01:55.350> here<00:01:55.590> so

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
gonna be the base basically the same

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.880 
gonna be the base basically the same
thing<00:02:09.360> they're<00:02:09.929> just<00:02:10.110> means<00:02:10.259> i<00:02:10.349> have<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.470> sort

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
of thought again so skip doing the same

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.820 
of thought again so skip doing the same
stuff

burning with it maybe I'm not sure how
it'll<00:02:44.520> work<00:02:44.580> would<00:02:45.000> just<00:02:45.150> stand<00:02:45.840> by<00:02:46.050> multiple

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
it'll work would just stand by multiple

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.650 
it'll work would just stand by multiple
places<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.040> can't<00:02:47.220> burn<00:02:47.400> out<00:02:47.580> or<00:02:47.610> ever<00:02:47.880> will

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
that that was a success I think let's

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.140 
that that was a success I think let's
watch<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.239> from<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.390> death<00:03:45.600> cam<00:03:46.940> yeah<00:03:47.940> that's

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
watch it from the death cam yeah that's

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.720 
watch it from the death cam yeah that's
that's<00:03:48.840> pretty<00:03:49.230> insane<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:49.890> don't<00:03:50.489> know<00:03:50.550> how<00:03:50.640> we

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
that's pretty insane I don't know how we

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.370 
that's pretty insane I don't know how we
find<00:03:50.940> our<00:03:51.090> way<00:03:51.180> back<00:03:51.209> there<00:03:51.390> I<00:03:51.870> think<00:03:52.290> they

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
find our way back there I think they

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.050 
find our way back there I think they
would<00:03:52.530> go<00:03:52.620> way<00:03:52.769> point<00:03:53.010> out<00:03:53.100> there<00:03:53.310> I<00:03:53.489> just<00:03:53.880> want

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
would go way point out there I just want

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.270 
would go way point out there I just want
to<00:03:54.120> go<00:03:54.180> inspect<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.750> damage<00:03:55.100> so<00:03:56.100> if<00:03:56.250> that

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
to go inspect the damage so if that

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.620 
to go inspect the damage so if that
actually<00:03:56.489> didn't<00:03:56.910> show<00:03:57.060> up<00:03:57.090> because<00:03:57.360> I<00:03:57.570> know

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
actually didn't show up because I know

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.900 
actually didn't show up because I know
that<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.410> makes<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:58.890> old<00:03:59.310> frame<00:03:59.700> rate

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
that it makes the the old frame rate

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.750 
that it makes the the old frame rate
drop<00:03:59.940> which<00:04:00.330> is<00:04:00.480> never<00:04:00.690> good<00:04:01.340> okay<00:04:02.340> so<00:04:02.400> there's

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
drop which is never good okay so there's

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.470 
drop which is never good okay so there's
a<00:04:02.820> big<00:04:03.140> okay<00:04:04.140> if<00:04:04.200> that's<00:04:04.350> odd<00:04:05.340> I<00:04:05.370> fell<00:04:06.090> down<00:04:06.120> the
