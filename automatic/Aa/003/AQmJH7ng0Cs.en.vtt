when<00:00:02.510> it's<00:00:02.630> time<00:00:02.840> to<00:00:03.020> check<00:00:03.199> the<00:00:03.260> turkey<00:00:03.530> for

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:03.830 
when it's time to check the turkey for

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.290 
when it's time to check the turkey for
doneness<00:00:04.069> you<00:00:04.580> really<00:00:04.819> want<00:00:04.970> to<00:00:05.029> use<00:00:05.149> an

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:05.300 
doneness you really want to use an

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.179 
doneness you really want to use an
instant-read<00:00:05.750> thermometer<00:00:05.779> one<00:00:06.710> like<00:00:06.920> this

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
instant-read thermometer one like this

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.749 
instant-read thermometer one like this
or<00:00:07.490> an<00:00:07.640> analogue<00:00:08.090> one<00:00:08.980> if<00:00:09.980> the<00:00:10.339> turkey<00:00:10.639> had

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 
or an analogue one if the turkey had

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:12.249 
or an analogue one if the turkey had
come<00:00:10.940> with<00:00:11.089> one<00:00:11.209> of<00:00:11.299> those<00:00:11.419> pop-up<00:00:11.690> timers

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 
come with one of those pop-up timers

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.079 
come with one of those pop-up timers
that's<00:00:12.440> in<00:00:12.650> the<00:00:12.740> breast<00:00:13.009> you<00:00:13.429> should<00:00:13.999> have

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
that's in the breast you should have

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:15.400 
that's in the breast you should have
just<00:00:14.240> discarded<00:00:14.780> that<00:00:14.809> before<00:00:15.230> you<00:00:15.379> even

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
just discarded that before you even

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.290 
just discarded that before you even
started<00:00:16.340> cooking<00:00:16.640> the<00:00:16.730> turkey<00:00:16.880> because

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
started cooking the turkey because

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.730 
started cooking the turkey because
they're<00:00:17.450> really<00:00:17.660> pretty<00:00:17.810> useless<00:00:18.230> they<00:00:18.560> don't

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
they're really pretty useless they don't

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.519 
they're really pretty useless they don't
they<00:00:19.130> don't<00:00:19.160> give<00:00:19.550> you<00:00:19.640> an<00:00:19.730> accurate<00:00:19.910> read

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
they don't give you an accurate read

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.050 
they don't give you an accurate read
where<00:00:21.529> you<00:00:21.650> want<00:00:21.830> to<00:00:21.920> insert<00:00:22.250> the<00:00:22.310> thermometer

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
where you want to insert the thermometer

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.880 
where you want to insert the thermometer
is<00:00:23.240> in<00:00:23.390> the<00:00:23.480> thick<00:00:23.660> part<00:00:23.990> of<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:24.140> thigh<00:00:24.470> right

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
is in the thick part of the thigh right

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.570 
is in the thick part of the thigh right
around<00:00:25.759> here<00:00:26.240> going<00:00:27.199> deep<00:00:27.589> but<00:00:27.859> don't<00:00:28.099> hit<00:00:28.369> the

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
around here going deep but don't hit the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.009 
around here going deep but don't hit the
bone<00:00:28.820> because<00:00:29.300> that's<00:00:29.480> not<00:00:29.599> going<00:00:29.779> to<00:00:29.839> give

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
bone because that's not going to give

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.960 
bone because that's not going to give
you<00:00:30.230> an<00:00:30.890> accurate<00:00:31.099> read<00:00:33.520> and<00:00:34.520> then<00:00:34.610> just<00:00:34.790> give

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
you an accurate read and then just give

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.100 
you an accurate read and then just give
it<00:00:35.060> a<00:00:35.180> few<00:00:35.630> seconds<00:00:35.990> to<00:00:36.110> give<00:00:36.680> you<00:00:36.770> a<00:00:36.830> reading

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.060 

you're<00:00:42.110> looking<00:00:42.350> for<00:00:42.500> a<00:00:42.560> temperature<00:00:42.890> of

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
you're looking for a temperature of

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.380 
you're looking for a temperature of
around<00:00:44.000> 165<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:45.050> 170<00:00:45.440> in<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:45.980> thigh<00:00:46.300> 170<00:00:47.300> is

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
around 165 to 170 in the thigh 170 is

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.360 
around 165 to 170 in the thigh 170 is
usually<00:00:47.720> good<00:00:47.900> for<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.200> thigh<00:00:48.380> so<00:00:49.250> this

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
usually good for the thigh so this

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.710 
usually good for the thigh so this
turkey<00:00:49.670> is<00:00:49.700> not<00:00:49.850> quite<00:00:50.150> there<00:00:50.360> I<00:00:50.420> would

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
turkey is not quite there I would

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.650 
turkey is not quite there I would
continue<00:00:51.170> to<00:00:51.260> check<00:00:51.500> it<00:00:51.760> every<00:00:52.760> 10<00:00:53.000> minutes<00:00:53.450> or

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
continue to check it every 10 minutes or

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.230 
continue to check it every 10 minutes or
so<00:00:53.740> the<00:00:54.740> closer<00:00:55.040> a<00:00:55.220> turkey<00:00:55.670> gets<00:00:55.880> to<00:00:56.060> being

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
so the closer a turkey gets to being

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.030 
so the closer a turkey gets to being
done<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:56.780> faster<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.260> temperature<00:00:57.710> seems<00:00:57.920> to

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
done the faster the temperature seems to

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.070 
done the faster the temperature seems to
climb<00:00:58.370> another<00:00:59.060> good<00:00:59.360> thing<00:00:59.390> to<00:00:59.690> do<00:00:59.840> is<00:00:59.960> to

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
climb another good thing to do is to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.810 
climb another good thing to do is to
check<00:01:00.290> both<00:01:00.560> thighs<00:01:00.860> because<00:01:01.400> sometimes

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
check both thighs because sometimes

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:13.440 
check both thighs because sometimes
turkeys<00:01:02.240> cook<00:01:02.450> unevenly

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.539 

this<00:01:14.289> part<00:01:14.560> of<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:14.770> thigh<00:01:14.979> is<00:01:15.039> a<00:01:15.189> little

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
this part of the thigh is a little

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.029 
this part of the thigh is a little
warmer<00:01:16.180> than<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.780> other<00:01:16.930> side<00:01:19.829> another<00:01:20.829> way

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
warmer than the other side another way

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.410 
warmer than the other side another way
you<00:01:21.100> can<00:01:21.280> tell<00:01:21.340> that<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.670> turkeys<00:01:21.969> not<00:01:22.179> done

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
you can tell that the turkeys not done

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.639 
you can tell that the turkeys not done
is<00:01:22.570> if<00:01:22.719> when<00:01:22.869> you<00:01:22.990> remove<00:01:23.289> the<00:01:23.439> thermometer

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
is if when you remove the thermometer

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.620 
is if when you remove the thermometer
you<00:01:24.159> see<00:01:24.369> pink<00:01:24.640> juices<00:01:25.060> coming<00:01:25.270> out<00:01:25.450> of<00:01:25.570> the

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
you see pink juices coming out of the

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:36.510 
you see pink juices coming out of the
hole<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:35.350> it's<00:01:35.530> about<00:01:35.679> a<00:01:35.740> half<00:01:35.950> an<00:01:36.069> hour<00:01:36.189> later

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
hole so it's about a half an hour later

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.660 
hole so it's about a half an hour later
and<00:01:36.789> it<00:01:36.850> looks<00:01:37.000> like<00:01:37.060> our<00:01:37.299> turkeys<00:01:37.659> done<00:01:38.670> if

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
and it looks like our turkeys done if

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.249 
and it looks like our turkeys done if
you've<00:01:39.909> stuffed<00:01:40.179> your<00:01:40.329> turkey<00:01:40.719> you<00:01:40.840> also<00:01:41.020> need

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
you've stuffed your turkey you also need

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.630 
you've stuffed your turkey you also need
to<00:01:41.289> take<00:01:41.439> the<00:01:41.590> temperature<00:01:41.770> of<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.219> stuffing

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
to take the temperature of the stuffing

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.169 
to take the temperature of the stuffing
in<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:42.880> center<00:01:44.580> you're<00:01:45.580> looking<00:01:45.849> for<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.090> to

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
in the center you're looking for it to

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.649 
in the center you're looking for it to
be<00:01:46.209> a<00:01:46.360> hundred<00:01:46.479> and<00:01:46.720> sixty-five<00:01:47.259> degrees<00:01:48.659> this

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
be a hundred and sixty-five degrees this

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.419 
be a hundred and sixty-five degrees this
stuffing<00:01:50.080> still<00:01:50.349> has<00:01:50.470> a<00:01:50.500> way<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:50.799> go<00:01:51.039> but<00:01:51.340> the

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
stuffing still has a way to go but the

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.550 
stuffing still has a way to go but the
turkeys<00:01:51.789> already<00:01:52.149> done<00:01:52.360> so<00:01:53.049> what<00:01:53.170> we<00:01:53.259> need<00:01:53.439> to

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
turkeys already done so what we need to

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.199 
turkeys already done so what we need to
do<00:01:53.740> is<00:01:54.009> spoon<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.399> stuffing<00:01:54.849> out<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.149> the

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
do is spoon the stuffing out of the

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.749 
do is spoon the stuffing out of the
turkey<00:01:55.599> into<00:01:55.840> a<00:01:56.020> baking<00:01:56.289> pan<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:56.979> continue<00:01:57.340> to

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
turkey into a baking pan and continue to

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.779 
turkey into a baking pan and continue to
bake<00:01:57.909> it<00:01:58.149> until<00:01:58.299> it<00:01:58.569> reaches<00:01:58.989> 165<00:01:59.829> degrees<00:02:00.009> so

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
bake it until it reaches 165 degrees so

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.609 
bake it until it reaches 165 degrees so
once<00:02:00.939> you<00:02:01.060> know<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.270> turkey<00:02:01.599> is<00:02:01.689> done<00:02:01.929> you<00:02:02.560> can

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
once you know the turkey is done you can

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.020 
once you know the turkey is done you can
go<00:02:02.799> ahead<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.039> transfer<00:02:03.459> it<00:02:03.549> to<00:02:03.610> a<00:02:03.700> platter

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
go ahead and transfer it to a platter

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.850 
go ahead and transfer it to a platter
and<00:02:04.420> then<00:02:05.020> you're<00:02:05.140> gonna<00:02:05.229> want<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.619> let<00:02:05.739> it

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
and then you're gonna want to let it

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.679 
and then you're gonna want to let it
rest<00:02:06.099> for<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.489> while<00:02:06.729> while<00:02:07.119> you<00:02:07.329> make<00:02:07.509> the

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
rest for a while while you make the

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.710 
rest for a while while you make the
gravy<00:02:07.929> and<00:02:08.349> get<00:02:09.250> everything<00:02:09.459> else<00:02:09.759> ready<00:02:10.239> the

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
gravy and get everything else ready the

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.390 
gravy and get everything else ready the
advantage<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.260> letting<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.500> turkey<00:02:11.860> rest<00:02:12.099> is

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
advantage to letting the turkey rest is

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.400 
advantage to letting the turkey rest is
that<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:13.060> juices<00:02:13.390> redistribute<00:02:13.540> within<00:02:14.290> the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
that the juices redistribute within the

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.890 
that the juices redistribute within the
meat<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.799> you<00:02:14.920> get<00:02:15.099> a<00:02:15.130> juicier<00:02:15.760> turkey<00:02:16.750> when

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
meat and you get a juicier turkey when

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.590 
meat and you get a juicier turkey when
you<00:02:16.989> go<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.170> carve<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.709> also<00:02:18.639> while<00:02:19.269> it<00:02:19.420> rests

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
you go to carve it also while it rests

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.300 
you go to carve it also while it rests
something<00:02:20.230> called<00:02:20.410> carryover<00:02:20.980> cooking

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
something called carryover cooking

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.680 
something called carryover cooking
happens<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.150> means<00:02:22.389> that<00:02:22.600> the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
happens and that means that the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.879 
happens and that means that the
temperature<00:02:23.109> of<00:02:23.139> the<00:02:23.290> turkey<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.709> going<00:02:23.769> to

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:23.889 
temperature of the turkey is going to

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:28.620 
temperature of the turkey is going to
continue<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.370> rise<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.730> bit<00:02:25.079> as<00:02:26.079> it<00:02:26.350> sits
