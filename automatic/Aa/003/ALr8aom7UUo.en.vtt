00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.789
 you think you have seen everything you are very 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.789
 wrong 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:16.200
 because in a few seconds more how will you live 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.200
 all unique expression 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.590
 good people here generate tagline in 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.960
 another new video in this case we're going 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.150
 to go to a special video about 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.400
 factions agree as they have not 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.129
 put logos new recordings 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.430
 static and what we are going to do we are going to 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.629
 a quick look at the agreement 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.550
 and we go there 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.960
 first we would have what is the layer of 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:59.620
 what is the hunter we would have what 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.840
 is the bracelet of what the sorcerer and 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.259
 the belt of what would be the titan of 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.440
 agreement three exotic things that doubt 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.080
 at least mine and I think that besides 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.509
 the other partners is also that if a 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.820
 put on this badge we can not 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.830
 put another piece what is of the 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.229
 armor go that would be a jilipoyez 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.420
 I think I put this in place of a 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.009
 piece of the armor according to these 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.200
 three things would be let's say the three 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.179
 badge of the dead beard 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.539
 we would continue and we will approach the 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.539
 future 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.440
 and let a splinter bis also 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.480
 these are 3 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.520
 of the future serna the colors and these 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.460
 are more alive there you have what is the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.880
 hunter's coat what would be the belt 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.920
 they take away and what would be the bracelet 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.620
 of the sorcerer according to the three things 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.710
 exotic as I am saying and the great 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.940
 doubt is we can put on a helmet 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.390
 exotic with this I do not think 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.820
 but good and we'll see and we 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.700
 would be the new monarchy 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.960
 what and where the same thing we have the layer of 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.050
 Hunter 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.140
 we have the bracelet of 60 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.780
 and we have the tan belt the rope 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.870
 also remembered capable of these three 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.420
 exotic things we have those four you know 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.790
 that have each faction agreed that 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.010
 are exclusive let's say imports 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.510
 they are hard to come by but 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.610
 they are cool and apart from cooling 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.320
 the four ships that other things good 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.120
 the four ships forgive the three ships 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.830
 of the functions are four knows by 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.990
 faction and grenade evaluation of agreement 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.700
 that you should never forget them and nothing 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.410
 Gentlemen, I hope you liked the 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.940

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.720

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.720
 Good wishes and even others
