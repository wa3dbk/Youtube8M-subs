00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.009
 luciano moggi review what you look at me 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.810
 on here 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.990
 luciana can not talk just a little something 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.790
 I can speak only a little thing that does not 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.980
 can not even be considered a shepherd. 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.800
 God's name knows what it is to lose. 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.800
 money is ridiculous scandal to the game right? 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.380
 man god religion and he has to have 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:28.080
 a free love drawing and it's not just him 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.990
 not so also where he posted 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.510
 on twitter it is different than you 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.360
 ended up recording with a false prophet 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.010
 which will be read in the bible because a shepherd 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.440
 he must first know who 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.360
 juliana padron is not the same as the broadcaster and 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.010
 options should then I have not kept 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.690
 any client that we are the way 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.000
 that I take up lord I do not think 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.730
 be false prophet luciano I think 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.210
 he is unprepared lay perhaps not 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.229
 be the other there was balance in truth 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.840
 same 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.470
 lucia exact uses that our religion 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.220
 platform that actually chooses the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.170
 religion is the person 's religion aa 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.750
 person chooses the religion he no longer 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.720
 choose people for that reason was the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.640
 europe say religion can you are 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.439
 My name is the second religion. 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.909
 one chooses religion but speaks of 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.970
 God we are not talking about God's will 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.490
 religion of the organization not of the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.759
 but of the organization is the person who 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.280
 choose her who knows what's good for her 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.130
 with neuraci box the best is the clothes that 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.740
 unleashes properties and it was cool that 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.820
 Brazil on the street got here I went 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.820
 put the ball away 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.520
 So this photo shows how 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.320
 there are 600 with the directory and its parent 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.300
 using I know that our releases 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.870
 starts accepting blacks 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.260
 the image that I think we are fine 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.570
 this one with this type of baby indicates 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.500
 he is a fominha player would have to 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.790
 example if one country is already fully 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.920
 unbalanced god that is not exact 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.320
 focus on the surgery honor were being so 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.330
 doing plastic surgeries and are not 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.660
 doctors then so when you know 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.920
 it's a holy father a pastor a priest has 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.910
 that have a reference to jesus and zoho 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.910
 Without today, my God, my God, people. 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.910
 it works
