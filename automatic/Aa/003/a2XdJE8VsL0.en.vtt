00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.840
 in this video I'll tell you cups and 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.200
 mobile phone 5 megapixel camera 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.230
 fu focus with fixed 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.760
 the focus is there is no automatic 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.599
 focusing 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.210
 there are no separate activation keys either 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.320
 so we run it through 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.710
 menu but they see there means an increase 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.589
 fourfold pictures 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.159
 reality if there is a switch to mode 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.559
 bigelow view photo 5 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:31.979
 megapixels and proper 

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:33.810
 number of frames 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.860
 on a stool viewing camcorder what 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.940
 there are settings further you can select a card 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.750
 memory or one memory tournament 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.310
 by name 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.210
 so how often do you 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.930
 let alone leave 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.110
 but you can turn off the sound by the way 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.710
 very convenient to turn off the sound 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.120
 then there is a burst mode 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.410
 defects the simplest m 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.280
 white balance I do not know who needs it but 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.780
 I do not remember the rarity can be like this 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.650
 turn over 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.580
 further as for the quality of shooting 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.960
 now again the test subject 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.820
 as for the shooting quality 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.650
 it seemed to me a very good module here 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.100
 installed as saying 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.690
 maker there is good suppression 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.250
 really but most likely to be 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.950
 because night photos 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.950
 good points are obtained percentage of what 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.630
 here pumped up business maybe 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.930
 at least the optics itself as you can see 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.290
 here here 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.420
 just such a plastic to her 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.080
 half of mayor milush n type assessment 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.940
 very similar at night small 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.440
 the first one is about the percentage of the father and 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.790
 text you can see 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.510
 photos from a small 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.530
 the distances here are basically not bad 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.290
 text 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.030
 percent legion switching from such 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.140
 way it records 640 by 480 but we are pretty 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.730
 mediocre at least 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.100
 exposure is selected 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.690
 tells and only 15 frames in 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.370
 second serve in the meantime very jacket like 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.930
 snow text but here's a snap click too much 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.599
 text 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.599
 wait g that is we can increase 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:17.769
 see what we have so Dakar 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.340
 and back highlighting again 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.159
 taking pictures of landscaping and 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.370
 an object that is more than two 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.189
 the meters are quite good 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.669
 I advise you to look and comfort 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.650
 text again review similar 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.219
 all the pictures from this device 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.449
 thanks, bye it's early 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:40.559
 f 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:42.439
 after all 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.359
 state of emergency
