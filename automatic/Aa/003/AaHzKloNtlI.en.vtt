five bombs and this is a really good

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.640 
five bombs and this is a really good
strategy<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:15.389> works<00:00:15.599> every<00:00:15.900> single<00:00:15.929> time<00:00:16.199> and

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
strategy it works every single time and

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.960 
strategy it works every single time and
I'm<00:00:16.770> going<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.920> show<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.160> exactly<00:00:17.520> what<00:00:17.850> you

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
I'm going to show you exactly what you

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.689 
I'm going to show you exactly what you
need<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.210> do<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.439> mean<00:00:19.710> I'm<00:00:19.949> assuming<00:00:20.189> at

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
need to do so I mean I'm assuming at

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.189 
need to do so I mean I'm assuming at
least<00:00:20.910> by<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.240> point<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.630> have<00:00:21.660> five

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
least by this point that you have five

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.509 
least by this point that you have five
bombs<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.710> might<00:00:22.890> have<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.100> make<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> different

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
bombs I might have to make a different

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.580 
bombs I might have to make a different
video<00:00:23.609> if<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.000> don't<00:00:24.330> have<00:00:24.510> bombs<00:00:24.750> but<00:00:25.080> here's

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
video if you don't have bombs but here's

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.929 
video if you don't have bombs but here's
exactly<00:00:26.070> what<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.279> want<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.550> do<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.699> want<00:00:26.880> to

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
exactly what you want to do you want to

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.150 
exactly what you want to do you want to
lead<00:00:27.090> them<00:00:27.180> over<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.140> wall<00:00:28.320> crouch<00:00:29.130> down

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
lead them over to the wall crouch down

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.250 
lead them over to the wall crouch down
so<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.580> don't<00:00:29.730> get<00:00:29.820> squished<00:00:30.090> make<00:00:30.750> him<00:00:30.990> go

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
so you don't get squished make him go

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.200 
so you don't get squished make him go
away<00:00:31.289> into<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.830> corner<00:00:32.189> there<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.790> you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
away into the corner there so that you

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.670 
away into the corner there so that you
won't<00:00:33.390> even<00:00:33.480> get<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.200> can<00:00:34.320> go<00:00:34.410> up<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
won't even get you you can go up to the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.290 
won't even get you you can go up to the
top<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.130> kind<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.309> check<00:00:35.610> for<00:00:35.880> more<00:00:36.059> bombs

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
top and kind of check for more bombs

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.209 
top and kind of check for more bombs
because<00:00:36.780> chances<00:00:37.200> are<00:00:37.260> there's<00:00:37.950> going<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.160> be

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
because chances are there's going to be

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.380 
because chances are there's going to be
lots<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.550> crates<00:00:38.790> up<00:00:38.910> top<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.300> you'll

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
lots of crates up top and you'll

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.610 
lots of crates up top and you'll
probably<00:00:39.540> find<00:00:39.780> bombs<00:00:40.140> like<00:00:40.320> there<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.590> just

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
probably find bombs like there I just

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.069 
probably find bombs like there I just
found<00:00:40.920> three<00:00:41.250> there's<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.270> pair<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.570> shoes<00:00:42.780> sure

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
found three there's a pair of shoes sure

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.869 
found three there's a pair of shoes sure
so<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.559> mean<00:00:43.739> there's<00:00:43.950> there's<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.309> lot<00:00:44.789> of

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
so I mean there's there's a lot of

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.459 
so I mean there's there's a lot of
chance<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.239> get<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> lot<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.660> bomb<00:00:45.780> repairs<00:00:46.200> so

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
chance to get a lot of bomb repairs so

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.430 
chance to get a lot of bomb repairs so
if<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.800> don't<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.550> five<00:00:48.180> bombs<00:00:48.480> well<00:00:49.350> you

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
if you don't have five bombs well you

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.840 
if you don't have five bombs well you
might<00:00:49.649> be<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.829> luck<00:00:50.100> there<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.489> go<00:00:50.610> up<00:00:50.700> top

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
might be in luck there if you go up top

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.299 
might be in luck there if you go up top
see<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.270> found<00:00:51.480> some<00:00:51.600> robes<00:00:51.780> etc<00:00:52.289> etc<00:00:52.379> so

see I just found some robes etc etc so

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.939 
see I just found some robes etc etc so

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
now I in particular in this run I'm

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.319 
now I in particular in this run I'm
trying<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> go<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> hill<00:00:56.820> run<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.210> I'm

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
trying to go for a hill run so I'm

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.540 
trying to go for a hill run so I'm
trying<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> look<00:00:57.780> here<00:00:58.590> at<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.010> book<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
trying to look here at the book of the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.740 
trying to look here at the book of the
Dead<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.210> see<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.480> kind<00:01:00.690> of

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
Dead and you can see it's kind of

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.900 
Dead and you can see it's kind of
flashing<00:01:01.010> like<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.370> there's<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.609> particular

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
flashing like so so there's a particular

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.230 
flashing like so so there's a particular
way<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.420> place<00:01:03.809> your<00:01:03.989> bombs<00:01:04.729> so<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.060> can

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
way to place your bombs so that you can

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.469 
way to place your bombs so that you can
blow<00:01:06.570> up<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.290> most<00:01:07.530> blocks<00:01:07.920> possible<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.330> you

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
blow up the most blocks possible and you

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.480 
blow up the most blocks possible and you
you<00:01:10.170> know<00:01:10.320> kind<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.650> takes<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.130> little<00:01:11.369> bit

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
you know kind of takes just a little bit

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.100 
you know kind of takes just a little bit
of<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.760> spelunky<00:01:12.119> player<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.600> notice<00:01:12.930> that

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
of a spelunky player to notice that

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.929 
of a spelunky player to notice that
there's<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.740> grid<00:01:14.100> there<00:01:14.460> there<00:01:14.670> are<00:01:14.729> certain

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
there's a grid there there are certain

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.390 
there's a grid there there are certain
squares<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.960> are<00:01:16.020> grid<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.250> is

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
squares that are grid like and this is

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.850 
squares that are grid like and this is
on<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> edge<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.330> grid<00:01:18.570> right<00:01:18.960> here<00:01:19.380> it's

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
on the edge of a grid right here it's

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.910 
on the edge of a grid right here it's
also<00:01:20.040> right<00:01:20.520> here<00:01:20.930> but<00:01:21.930> you'll<00:01:22.080> you'll<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:22.770> it

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
also right here but you'll you'll see it

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.670 
also right here but you'll you'll see it
once<00:01:23.729> once<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.570> place<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> bomb<00:01:25.110> you'll<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.470> what

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
once once I place a bomb you'll see what

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.130 
once once I place a bomb you'll see what
makes<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.490> grid<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.479> when<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.780> do<00:01:27.900> that

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
makes it so grid like when you do that

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.380 
makes it so grid like when you do that
you'll<00:01:28.590> blow<00:01:28.799> up<00:01:28.979> an<00:01:29.130> exact<00:01:29.610> shape<00:01:29.939> just<00:01:30.240> like

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
you'll blow up an exact shape just like

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.140 
you'll blow up an exact shape just like
this<00:01:30.540> almost<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.979> sorts<00:01:32.460> now<00:01:32.909> this

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
this almost like a you of sorts now this

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.660 
this almost like a you of sorts now this
happens<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.659> also<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.259> exact<00:01:34.680> with<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
happens to also be the exact with the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.700 
happens to also be the exact with the
Olmec<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.930> place<00:01:37.259> another<00:01:37.470> bomb

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
Olmec is so if you place another bomb

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.219 
Olmec is so if you place another bomb
and<00:01:37.950> make<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> shaft<00:01:38.759> downward<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.720> exact

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and make a shaft downward on that exact

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.620 
and make a shaft downward on that exact
crack<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.400> see<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.939> between<00:01:42.090> where

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
crack you can see in between where

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.840 
crack you can see in between where
there's<00:01:42.810> two<00:01:43.020> square<00:01:43.380> blocks<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.460> see

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
there's two square blocks you can see

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.510 
there's two square blocks you can see
we've<00:01:45.000> used<00:01:45.030> three<00:01:45.630> bombs<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.259> far<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.369> we're

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.670 
we've used three bombs so far and we're
going<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.820> use<00:01:48.060> exactly<00:01:48.930> five<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.500> there's

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
going to use exactly five so there's

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.130 
going to use exactly five so there's
four

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
four

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.590 
four

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
use a bomb here as well and that would

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.219 
use a bomb here as well and that would
be<00:02:07.580> six<00:02:07.820> bombs<00:02:08.060> but<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:08.750> don't<00:02:08.929> have<00:02:09.050> to

normal character will look but the

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.390 
normal character will look but the
snowman<00:02:32.330> sprite<00:02:32.660> get<00:02:33.170> your<00:02:33.890> spray<00:02:34.130> if<00:02:34.280> you

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
Teeter over the edge like that there you

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.470 
Teeter over the edge like that there you
go<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:35.989> will<00:02:36.290> trigger<00:02:36.590> Olmec<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.730> slam<00:02:38.150> down

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
go you will trigger Olmec to slam down

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.479 
go you will trigger Olmec to slam down
down<00:02:39.080> into<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.500> pit<00:02:39.739> and<00:02:39.920> then<00:02:40.010> there<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.220> go

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.160 
down into that pit and then there you go
that's<00:02:41.090> how<00:02:41.239> you<00:02:41.300> can<00:02:41.510> kill<00:02:41.690> Olmec<00:02:42.020> and

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170
