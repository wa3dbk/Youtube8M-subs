00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:07.890
 good but a barbecue to look for 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.550
 review I only see the presentation some 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:22.909
 coal stones out of the safety car 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:29.310
 They will roll with a paper or aluminum and 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:40.370
 put in the band was born with this 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:40.370
 method can see how it got noisy 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:48.449
 in the background there usually plays meat 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:52.620
 as if it were a problem in a 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:55.489
 barbecue all here at the end of each to 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.489
 normal kitchen 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:14.890
 Let's put it on my paper. 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:19.830
 let them lean against the sides and go 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.830
 also put a sausage 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.040
 can put around the same just does not give 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.710
 to mix you can find up to 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.160
 tongue can lean against the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:39.420
 only can not mix white meat and 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.840
 red meat in that stuff 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.840
 certain 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:02:00.900
 at first it's ready now it's just 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:02:03.300
 close now goes on high fire up to how 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.890
 catch start to sizzle 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.690
 when you start to find it low as 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.340
 expected 20 minutes exactly 20 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.970
 minutes you are ready and the wheels for 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.970
 cause of pressure 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:30.020
 the hertha like the map 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.560
 barbecue is not the same but already deceased 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.320
 now let's see how it got in its vast 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:41.020
 then exactly 20 minutes later 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:57.770
 will begin today started to lower the fire 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:03:00.100
 more than one wife, it was the pressure to stay 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.100
 with her 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.960
 haha ha 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.540
 seems reasonable 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.290
 There is no pitanga but ok 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.540
 in the past as I like 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:57.209
 the Korean in the middle will okay more 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:57.209
 passed on the last standard route 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.950
 on here 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.950
 the tongue 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.560
 fine 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.210
 We make a barbecue for a person.
