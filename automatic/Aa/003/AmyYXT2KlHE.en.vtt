00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
months ago so I have a good idea of how

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.050 
months ago so I have a good idea of how
well<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.930> works<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.530> how<00:01:40.829> i<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.490> use<00:01:41.729> it

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
well it works and how i like to use it

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.240 
well it works and how i like to use it
sort<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.659> my<00:01:42.840> daily<00:01:43.439> foundation<00:01:44.100> routine

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
sort of on my daily foundation routine

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.090 
sort of on my daily foundation routine
so<00:01:45.149> most<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> time<00:01:45.810> i<00:01:46.020> do<00:01:46.079> utilize<00:01:46.619> this

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
so most of the time i do utilize this

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.920 
so most of the time i do utilize this
deeper<00:01:47.579> shade<00:01:47.850> especially<00:01:48.420> since<00:01:48.659> it's

doesn't really good and do a good job of
setting<00:02:44.980> your<00:02:45.730> concealer<00:02:46.390> but<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.380> just<00:02:47.680> pretty

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
setting your concealer but I just pretty

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.740 
setting your concealer but I just pretty
much<00:02:48.010> used<00:02:48.430> like<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.670> regular<00:02:48.910> set<00:02:49.300> powder<00:02:49.540> that

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
much used like a regular set powder that

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.810 
much used like a regular set powder that
I<00:02:49.840> would<00:02:49.960> use<00:02:50.140> for<00:02:50.410> my<00:02:50.530> foundation<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:51.610> set

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
I would use for my foundation to set

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.790 
I would use for my foundation to set
this<00:02:52.000> concealer<00:02:52.480> because<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.170> does<00:02:53.350> like<00:02:53.590> a

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
this concealer because it does like a

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.630 
this concealer because it does like a
good<00:02:54.100> job<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:54.690> but<00:02:55.690> anyways<00:02:56.680> in<00:02:57.040> terms<00:02:57.340> of

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
good job of that but anyways in terms of

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.910 
good job of that but anyways in terms of
staying<00:02:58.060> power<00:02:58.360> I<00:02:58.810> don't<00:02:59.290> think<00:02:59.680> this

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
staying power I don't think this

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.300 
staying power I don't think this
concealer<00:03:00.400> palette<00:03:00.700> really<00:03:01.660> has<00:03:01.870> um<00:03:02.320> really

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
concealer palette really has um really

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.880 
concealer palette really has um really
like<00:03:03.900> maximum<00:03:04.900> staying<00:03:05.230> power<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:05.590> don't<00:03:05.770> think

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
like maximum staying power I don't think

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.920 
like maximum staying power I don't think
you<00:03:05.950> can<00:03:06.010> wear<00:03:06.310> this<00:03:06.910> concealer<00:03:07.360> on<00:03:07.480> your<00:03:07.720> face

you can wear this concealer on your face
for<00:03:08.380> like<00:03:08.740> 12<00:03:09.040> hours<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.820> would<00:03:09.970> last<00:03:10.270> the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
for like 12 hours and it would last the

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.190 
for like 12 hours and it would last the
entire<00:03:10.690> span<00:03:11.350> of<00:03:11.380> your<00:03:12.100> day<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:13.360> does<00:03:13.660> last<00:03:13.990> a

entire span of your day it does last a

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.780 
entire span of your day it does last a
good<00:03:14.350> amount<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.590> time<00:03:14.860> but<00:03:15.250> I<00:03:15.310> do<00:03:15.370> notice

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
good amount of time but I do notice

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.080 
good amount of time but I do notice
fading<00:03:16.630> maybe<00:03:16.870> after<00:03:17.320> five<00:03:18.310> or<00:03:18.490> six<00:03:18.700> hours<00:03:18.850> of

wear in terms of quality I do think it's

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.250

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.240 
concealer brush to apply it to your face

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
especially since when it is creamier

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.210 
especially since when it is creamier
like<00:03:48.459> that<00:03:48.700> it<00:03:49.570> will<00:03:50.170> settle<00:03:50.650> in<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:50.980> fine

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
like that it will settle in the fine

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.070 
like that it will settle in the fine
lines<00:03:51.490> in<00:03:51.730> your<00:03:51.760> face<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.330> up<00:03:52.570> here<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:52.840> little

able to see them a little bit through
the<00:04:34.780> concealer<00:04:35.380> so<00:04:35.680> it<00:04:35.800> will<00:04:36.070> not<00:04:36.250> give<00:04:36.490> you<00:04:36.520> a

getting<00:04:51.490> this<00:04:51.760> but<00:04:52.600> overall<00:04:52.990> I<00:04:53.140> do<00:04:53.380> think<00:04:53.680> it's

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
getting this but overall I do think it's

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.440 
getting this but overall I do think it's
a<00:04:53.890> good<00:04:54.010> purchase<00:04:54.250> especially<00:04:55.000> for<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.270> price

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
a good purchase especially for the price

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.000 
a good purchase especially for the price
you<00:04:56.230> get<00:04:56.440> point<00:04:57.280> 14<00:04:57.910> ounces<00:04:58.330> of<00:04:58.570> products<00:04:59.410> for

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
you get point 14 ounces of products for

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.700 
you get point 14 ounces of products for
about<00:05:00.610> twelve<00:05:00.970> dollars<00:05:01.480> and<00:05:01.810> then<00:05:02.170> does<00:05:02.410> come

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
about twelve dollars and then does come

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.950 
about twelve dollars and then does come
with<00:05:02.890> a<00:05:03.130> variety<00:05:03.460> in<00:05:04.090> this<00:05:04.330> concealer<00:05:04.720> palette

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
with a variety in this concealer palette

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.560 
with a variety in this concealer palette
as<00:05:05.290> opposed<00:05:06.160> to<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:06.490> Boeing<00:05:06.730> concealer<00:05:07.330> which

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
as opposed to the Boeing concealer which

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.620 
as opposed to the Boeing concealer which
is<00:05:07.720> just<00:05:07.930> one<00:05:08.140> concealer<00:05:08.710> that<00:05:08.920> only<00:05:09.630> offers

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
is just one concealer that only offers

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
is just one concealer that only offers
point<00:05:11.110> 1<00:05:11.350> ounces<00:05:11.830> of<00:05:12.070> products<00:05:12.640> so<00:05:13.480> I<00:05:14.080> do<00:05:14.350> think

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
point 1 ounces of products so I do think

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.540 
point 1 ounces of products so I do think
it<00:05:14.830> is<00:05:14.980> worth<00:05:15.520> checking<00:05:16.030> out<00:05:16.150> and<00:05:16.510> it's<00:05:17.140> a

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
it is worth checking out and it's a

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.710 
it is worth checking out and it's a
little<00:05:18.550> bit<00:05:18.640> more<00:05:18.850> expensive<00:05:19.120> than<00:05:19.450> some

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
little bit more expensive than some

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.750 
little bit more expensive than some
other<00:05:20.230> drug<00:05:20.620> store<00:05:20.860> concealers<00:05:21.370> but<00:05:21.640> I<00:05:21.670> do

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
other drug store concealers but I do

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.820 
other drug store concealers but I do
think<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.570> quality<00:05:22.810> is<00:05:23.200> a<00:05:23.230> little<00:05:23.320> bit<00:05:23.620> more

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
think the quality is a little bit more

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.240 
think the quality is a little bit more
elevated<00:05:24.250> in<00:05:24.580> comparison<00:05:25.150> to<00:05:25.300> those<00:05:25.450> so<00:05:26.290> yeah

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
elevated in comparison to those so yeah

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.790 
elevated in comparison to those so yeah
I<00:05:27.280> do<00:05:27.460> really<00:05:27.760> think<00:05:28.030> it's<00:05:28.180> worth<00:05:28.870> trying<00:05:29.200> or

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
I do really think it's worth trying or

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.220 
I do really think it's worth trying or
worth<00:05:30.070> like<00:05:30.630> purchasing<00:05:31.630> if<00:05:31.900> you<00:05:32.020> know<00:05:32.170> if
