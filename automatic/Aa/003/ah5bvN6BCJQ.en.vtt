this little clear sticker it feels kind

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.760 
this little clear sticker it feels kind
of<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.750> one<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.780> these<00:01:21.990> four<00:01:22.290> by<00:01:22.409> fours<00:01:22.650> I

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.499

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.560 
let's gonna do it quick solve a mess to
have<00:02:28.950> centered<00:02:29.370> more<00:02:29.580> youth<00:02:29.730> shades<00:02:30.000> which<00:02:30.390> I

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
have centered more youth shades which I

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.080 
have centered more youth shades which I
don't<00:02:30.630> really<00:02:30.900> like<00:02:34.520> because<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.760> green<00:02:35.970> and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
don't really like because the green and

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.750 
don't really like because the green and
orange<00:02:36.209> looked<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.570> similar<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:37.140> let's<00:02:37.410> just

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
orange looked you similar but let's just

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:59.810 
orange looked you similar but let's just
get<00:02:38.760> this<00:02:38.880> solve<00:02:39.120> in<00:02:57.920> alright<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:59.130> this<00:02:59.250> table

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
get this solve in alright so this table

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.790 
get this solve in alright so this table
doesn't<00:03:00.150> lock<00:03:00.269> up<00:03:00.480> or<00:03:00.660> pop<00:03:00.840> at<00:03:00.989> all<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.350> don't

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
doesn't lock up or pop at all I don't

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.170 
doesn't lock up or pop at all I don't
think<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.160> will<00:03:02.310> pop<00:03:02.519> it's<00:03:02.700> take<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.910> look<00:03:03.090> at

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
think it will pop it's take a look at

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.170 
think it will pop it's take a look at
the<00:03:03.300> pieces<00:03:03.769> so<00:03:04.769> here<00:03:05.040> we<00:03:05.190> see<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.519> edge<00:03:05.700> and

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
the pieces so here we see the edge and

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.360 
the pieces so here we see the edge and
the<00:03:06.510> corners<00:03:07.470> this<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:07.950> how<00:03:08.040> they<00:03:08.160> fit

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
the corners this is how they fit

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.900 
the corners this is how they fit
together<00:03:12.620> here<00:03:13.620> with<00:03:13.680> me<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:13.920> have<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.519> wheel<00:03:14.730> on

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
together here with me I have a wheel on

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.420 
together here with me I have a wheel on
corner<00:03:15.450> on<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.200> left<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.709> an<00:03:16.769> L<00:03:16.890> on<00:03:17.040> corner<00:03:17.370> on

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
corner on the left and an L on corner on

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.310 
corner on the left and an L on corner on
the<00:03:17.519> right<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:18.299> as<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.600> can<00:03:18.690> see<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.989> Elven

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
the right and as you can see the Elven

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.250 
the right and as you can see the Elven
corner<00:03:19.650> has<00:03:19.769> an<00:03:19.890> extra<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.459> little<00:03:21.330> thing<00:03:22.110> right

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
corner has an extra a little thing right

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.530 
corner has an extra a little thing right
there<00:03:22.470> on<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.739> stock<00:03:23.010> so<00:03:23.519> here<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:23.970> have<00:03:24.120> the

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
there on the stock so here I have the

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.330 
there on the stock so here I have the
edge<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.290> more<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:25.590> weigh<00:03:25.709> long<00:03:25.920> on<00:03:26.160> the

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
edge of the more you weigh long on the

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.210 
edge of the more you weigh long on the
left<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:26.880> on<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.060> right<00:03:27.150> is<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.690> out<00:03:27.870> long

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
left and on the right is the out long

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.940 
left and on the right is the out long
now<00:03:29.220> let's<00:03:29.370> get<00:03:29.519> this<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.880> focus<00:03:30.239> in<00:03:30.860> so<00:03:31.860> you

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
now let's get this to focus in so you

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.680 
now let's get this to focus in so you
can<00:03:32.040> see<00:03:32.160> that<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.640> torpedo<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.450> lot

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
can see that the torpedo is a lot

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.520 
can see that the torpedo is a lot
smaller<00:03:34.080> on<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:35.660> out<00:03:36.660> long<00:03:36.930> than<00:03:37.110> it<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.290> on

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
smaller on the out long than it is on

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.820 
smaller on the out long than it is on
the<00:03:37.620> way<00:03:37.739> long<00:03:38.600> so<00:03:39.600> also<00:03:39.959> I'm<00:03:40.200> not<00:03:40.350> quite<00:03:40.799> sure

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
the way long so also I'm not quite sure

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.020 
the way long so also I'm not quite sure
if<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.070> can<00:03:41.160> see<00:03:41.340> because<00:03:41.489> of<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.790> lighting

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
if you can see because of the lighting

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.840 
if you can see because of the lighting
on<00:03:42.360> black<00:03:42.570> puzzles<00:03:42.989> but<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.650> edge<00:03:43.799> right<00:03:44.370> here

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
on black puzzles but the edge right here

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.850 
on black puzzles but the edge right here
is<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.090> lot<00:03:45.360> more<00:03:45.510> rounded<00:03:45.959> on<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.470> out<00:03:46.680> long

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
is a lot more rounded on the out long

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.530 
is a lot more rounded on the out long
that<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.130> is<00:03:47.250> on<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.430> way<00:03:47.580> long<00:03:47.790> which<00:03:48.360> might

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
that it is on the way long which might

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.380 
that it is on the way long which might
make<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.900> little<00:03:48.930> bit<00:03:49.170> smoother<00:03:49.620> and

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
make it a little bit smoother and

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.130 
make it a little bit smoother and
probably<00:03:51.390> have<00:03:51.510> less<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.660> a<00:03:51.810> chance<00:03:52.020> to

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
probably have less of a chance to

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.010 
probably have less of a chance to
actually<00:03:52.530> lock<00:03:52.709> up<00:03:53.420> so<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:54.510> can<00:03:54.599> buy<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.780> more

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
actually lock up so you can buy the more

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.270 
actually lock up so you can buy the more
you<00:03:55.050> out<00:03:55.260> long<00:03:55.470> which<00:03:55.650> is<00:03:55.770> also<00:03:55.920> referred<00:03:56.130> to

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
you out long which is also referred to

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.410 
you out long which is also referred to
as<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.640> moyu<00:03:56.819> weilong

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
as the moyu weilong

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.960 
as the moyu weilong
three<00:03:57.930> on<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.800> cubicle<00:03:59.099> about<00:03:59.250> us<00:03:59.550> who<00:03:59.819> was

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
three on the cubicle about us who was

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.610 
three on the cubicle about us who was
kind<00:04:00.360> enough<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.660> send<00:04:00.870> me<00:04:00.990> this<00:04:01.080> as<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.260> tester

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
kind enough to send me this as a tester

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.770 
kind enough to send me this as a tester
cube<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.790> can<00:04:02.910> get<00:04:03.030> it<00:04:03.120> on<00:04:03.209> their<00:04:03.599> site

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
cube and you can get it on their site

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.410 
cube and you can get it on their site
for<00:04:04.020> sixteen<00:04:04.380> dollars<00:04:04.550> and<00:04:05.550> I<00:04:06.060> think<00:04:06.330> the

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
for sixteen dollars and I think the

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.170 
for sixteen dollars and I think the
price<00:04:06.630> might<00:04:07.080> drop<00:04:07.349> soon<00:04:08.069> because<00:04:08.520> uh<00:04:08.550> usually

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
price might drop soon because uh usually

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.520 
price might drop soon because uh usually
more<00:04:09.330> puzzles<00:04:09.690> are<00:04:09.780> pretty<00:04:09.959> expensive<00:04:10.140> at

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
more puzzles are pretty expensive at

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.589 
more puzzles are pretty expensive at
first<00:04:10.770> because<00:04:10.980> of<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.489> high<00:04:11.730> demand<00:04:11.910> but

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
first because of the high demand but

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:13.699 
first because of the high demand but
then<00:04:12.720> eventually<00:04:12.840> they'll<00:04:13.319> come<00:04:13.349> out<00:04:13.530> with<00:04:13.650> a

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
then eventually they'll come out with a

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:14.960 
then eventually they'll come out with a
new<00:04:13.830> one<00:04:13.980> and<00:04:14.220> then<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.370> prices<00:04:14.700> will<00:04:14.819> lower

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
new one and then the prices will lower

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.300 
new one and then the prices will lower
it<00:04:15.090> but<00:04:15.930> this<00:04:16.410> is<00:04:16.560> an<00:04:16.680> amazing<00:04:16.889> free<00:04:17.160> right

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
it but this is an amazing free right

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.860 
it but this is an amazing free right
three<00:04:17.519> out<00:04:17.609> of<00:04:17.639> the<00:04:17.760> box<00:04:17.940> there<00:04:18.660> will<00:04:18.750> be<00:04:18.780> a

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
three out of the box there will be a

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.860 
three out of the box there will be a
review<00:04:19.230> my<00:04:19.760> school<00:04:20.760> ends<00:04:21.180> in<00:04:21.269> a<00:04:21.329> month<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.720> I

time during summer to make reviews which

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.600 
time during summer to make reviews which
I<00:04:25.290> for<00:04:25.770> all<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.919> public's<00:04:26.190> I've<00:04:26.280> been<00:04:26.370> getting

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
I for all the public's I've been getting

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.420 
I for all the public's I've been getting
lately<00:04:27.570> so<00:04:28.380> one<00:04:28.530> thing<00:04:28.740> I<00:04:28.800> also<00:04:28.980> want<00:04:29.250> to<00:04:29.310> say

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
lately so one thing I also want to say

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.670 
lately so one thing I also want to say
before<00:04:29.520> I<00:04:29.820> end<00:04:30.270> this<00:04:30.389> this<00:04:30.600> unboxing<00:04:31.229> is<00:04:31.380> that

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
before I end this this unboxing is that

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.920 
before I end this this unboxing is that
I<00:04:31.950> think<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.490> stock<00:04:32.729> tension<00:04:33.090> in<00:04:33.210> stock<00:04:33.630> lube

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
I think the stock tension in stock lube

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.200 
I think the stock tension in stock lube
it's<00:04:34.530> perfect<00:04:34.919> I<00:04:35.010> will<00:04:35.220> not<00:04:35.340> be<00:04:35.520> adding<00:04:35.910> any<00:04:36.000> of

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
it's perfect I will not be adding any of

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.150 
it's perfect I will not be adding any of
my<00:04:36.389> old<00:04:36.450> it<00:04:36.690> because<00:04:37.320> I<00:04:37.410> think<00:04:37.680> that<00:04:37.830> once<00:04:38.040> I

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
my old it because I think that once I

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.530 
my old it because I think that once I
started<00:04:38.430> doing<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:38.700> bunch<00:04:38.880> of<00:04:38.970> solves<00:04:39.240> on<00:04:39.360> this

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
started doing a bunch of solves on this

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.440 
started doing a bunch of solves on this
the<00:04:40.320> dry<00:04:40.620> scratchy<00:04:40.950> feeling<00:04:41.370> which<00:04:42.150> has

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
the dry scratchy feeling which has

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.550 
the dry scratchy feeling which has
already<00:04:42.570> kind<00:04:42.840> of<00:04:42.870> gone<00:04:42.990> down<00:04:43.200> a<00:04:43.229> little<00:04:43.410> bit

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
already kind of gone down a little bit

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.530 
already kind of gone down a little bit
after<00:04:43.680> she<00:04:44.190> solves<00:04:44.520> with<00:04:44.639> a<00:04:44.669> gun<00:04:44.880> off-camera<00:04:45.240> I

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
after she solves with a gun off-camera I

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.810 
after she solves with a gun off-camera I
think<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.470> scratchy<00:04:47.190> feeling<00:04:47.460> will<00:04:47.610> go<00:04:47.639> away

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
think the scratchy feeling will go away

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.390 
think the scratchy feeling will go away
just<00:04:48.120> like<00:04:48.180> on<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.419> faint<00:04:48.660> she<00:04:49.400> one

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
just like on the faint she one

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.650 
just like on the faint she one
interesting<00:04:50.790> thing<00:04:50.820> I've<00:04:51.150> heard<00:04:51.270> about<00:04:51.419> them

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
interesting thing I've heard about them

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.969 
interesting thing I've heard about them
will<00:04:51.810> you<00:04:51.870> out<00:04:52.020> long<00:04:52.200> or<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.560> more<00:04:52.740> you<00:04:52.830> wait

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
will you out long or the more you wait

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.159 
will you out long or the more you wait
long<00:04:53.100> version<00:04:53.310> three<00:04:53.669> is<00:04:53.850> that<00:04:54.510> somebody

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
long version three is that somebody

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.020 
long version three is that somebody
compared<00:04:55.470> it<00:04:55.530> to<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.979> feel<00:04:56.400> of<00:04:56.430> a<00:04:56.669> more<00:04:56.910> you

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
compared it to the feel of a more you

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.450 
compared it to the feel of a more you
owe<00:04:57.360> sue<00:04:58.200> or<00:04:58.560> rush<00:04:58.710> for<00:04:58.889> it<00:04:58.919> and<00:04:59.130> I<00:04:59.190> think<00:04:59.250> that

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
owe sue or rush for it and I think that

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.120 
owe sue or rush for it and I think that
semi<00:04:59.880> accurate<00:05:00.290> the<00:05:01.290> more<00:05:01.470> us<00:05:01.830> to<00:05:01.950> is<00:05:02.039> an

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
semi accurate the more us to is an

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.340 
semi accurate the more us to is an
amazing<00:05:02.460> 4x4<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:03.330> the<00:05:03.630> through<00:05:03.810> every<00:05:04.110> stage

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
on this is really easy this is probably

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:08.750 
on this is really easy this is probably
as<00:05:07.470> good<00:05:07.500> as<00:05:07.860> some<00:05:08.100> of<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.220> speed<00:05:08.430> cubes<00:05:08.700> out

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
as good as some of the speed cubes out

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.040
