you're coming or what the movement of

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369

always<00:01:29.560> big<00:01:29.950> there<00:01:30.460> is<00:01:30.490> lots<00:01:30.939> of<00:01:31.149> breeding<00:01:31.630> but

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
always big there is lots of breeding but

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:43.919

there<00:01:32.590> is<00:01:32.710> a<00:01:32.829> downside<00:01:41.789> so<00:01:42.789> there<00:01:43.329> tends<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:43.810> be

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
there is a downside so there tends to be
