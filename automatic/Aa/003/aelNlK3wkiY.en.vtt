piece of plastic this is so gross this
has<00:02:10.530> got<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.069> change<00:02:11.120> Blendtec

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
has got to change Blendtec

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.240

I mean there are all kinds of people
that<00:02:15.489> are<00:02:15.580> complaining<00:02:15.970> about<00:02:16.330> these<00:02:17.019> jars

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
that are complaining about these jars

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.640 
that are complaining about these jars
these<00:02:18.010> wide<00:02:18.420> wide<00:02:19.420> side<00:02:20.110> or<00:02:20.620> wild<00:02:21.099> side<00:02:21.340> jars

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
these wide wide side or wild side jars

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.180 
these wide wide side or wild side jars
this<00:02:23.650> is<00:02:24.060> really<00:02:25.060> wrong<00:02:25.300> now<00:02:25.989> I<00:02:26.019> I<00:02:26.620> purchased

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
this is really wrong now I I purchased

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.740 
this is really wrong now I I purchased
this<00:02:27.640> champ<00:02:28.330> HP<00:02:29.050> probably<00:02:29.980> in<00:02:30.069> 2004<00:02:30.910> got<00:02:31.630> it

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
this champ HP probably in 2004 got it

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.570 
this champ HP probably in 2004 got it
replaced<00:02:32.200> after<00:02:32.530> about<00:02:32.830> five<00:02:33.190> six<00:02:33.430> years

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
replaced after about five six years

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.470 
replaced after about five six years
because<00:02:34.480> this<00:02:35.410> jar<00:02:35.830> started<00:02:36.819> leaking<00:02:37.000> but<00:02:37.360> you

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
because this jar started leaking but you

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.390 
because this jar started leaking but you
know<00:02:37.569> I<00:02:37.780> had<00:02:37.989> several<00:02:38.319> thousand<00:02:38.680> blends<00:02:38.950> on<00:02:39.220> it

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
know I had several thousand blends on it

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.460 
know I had several thousand blends on it
in<00:02:39.489> six<00:02:39.790> years<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:40.239> mean<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.599> can't<00:02:40.959> remember<00:02:41.260> how

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
in six years I mean I can't remember how

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.610 
in six years I mean I can't remember how
many<00:02:41.530> but<00:02:41.709> it<00:02:41.920> was<00:02:42.010> gone<00:02:42.340> but<00:02:43.330> then<00:02:43.599> it<00:02:43.989> started

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
many but it was gone but then it started

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.990 
many but it was gone but then it started
every<00:02:44.890> time<00:02:45.069> I<00:02:45.099> would<00:02:45.340> blend<00:02:45.549> this<00:02:45.670> was<00:02:45.849> after

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
every time I would blend this was after

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.350 
every time I would blend this was after
the<00:02:46.180> warranty<00:02:46.569> I<00:02:47.019> would<00:02:47.530> get<00:02:47.709> this<00:02:48.360> this

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
the warranty I would get this this

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.080 
the warranty I would get this this
remnant<00:02:49.750> this<00:02:50.590> little<00:02:50.860> dust<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.670> looks<00:02:51.880> like

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
remnant this little dust it looks like

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.680 
remnant this little dust it looks like
black<00:02:52.599> particles<00:02:53.590> of<00:02:53.739> dust<00:02:54.090> or<00:02:55.090> something

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
black particles of dust or something

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.199 
black particles of dust or something
little<00:02:55.959> bits<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:56.380> metal<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:57.010> so<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:57.940> thought

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
little bits of metal and so I thought

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.240 
little bits of metal and so I thought
it's<00:02:58.510> time<00:02:58.840> for<00:02:59.019> a<00:02:59.049> new<00:02:59.170> blender<00:02:59.620> I<00:02:59.829> still<00:03:00.220> use

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
it's time for a new blender I still use

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.640 
it's time for a new blender I still use
this<00:03:00.579> to<00:03:00.760> grind<00:03:00.970> up<00:03:01.090> some<00:03:01.360> things<00:03:01.569> and<00:03:01.959> now<00:03:02.410> I'm

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
this to grind up some things and now I'm

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.699 
this to grind up some things and now I'm
thinking<00:03:02.860> how<00:03:03.750> often<00:03:04.750> every<00:03:04.930> time<00:03:05.230> we<00:03:05.380> blend

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
thinking how often every time we blend

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.430 
thinking how often every time we blend
something<00:03:06.280> are<00:03:06.459> we<00:03:06.579> being<00:03:06.819> contaminated<00:03:07.440> by

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
something are we being contaminated by

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.690 
something are we being contaminated by
shreds<00:03:09.099> of<00:03:09.489> plastic<00:03:10.299> or<00:03:10.510> little<00:03:10.900> bits<00:03:11.110> of<00:03:11.260> dust

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
shreds of plastic or little bits of dust

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.030 
shreds of plastic or little bits of dust
so<00:03:12.700> this<00:03:13.000> has<00:03:13.180> got<00:03:13.360> to<00:03:13.569> change<00:03:13.769> Blendtec<00:03:14.769> if

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
so this has got to change Blendtec if

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.280 
so this has got to change Blendtec if
any<00:03:15.670> of<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:16.090> consumers<00:03:16.630> out<00:03:16.810> there<00:03:17.049> are

their parts in China probably are they

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.099 
their parts in China probably are they
