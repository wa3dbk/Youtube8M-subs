00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.360
 good day to all the video today is 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.570
 quite expected by you and I know 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.119
 that is a tutorial of my hair 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.770
 exactly as I do the waves in 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.890
 my hair that in that sense I use it 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.320
 with iron to make it softer and 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.840
 most delicate and not with profundity d'Or 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.149
 is much more formed so if 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.399
 they want to see how to make these waves 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.140
 that are pretty soft for any 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.630
 kind of occasion personally I 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.090
 I use for my day to day but if you have 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.690
 a special occasion and you want to see a 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.170
 little sexier with this super hair that 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.100
 massa fawn that I love I invite you 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.530
 to keep watching the video 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.070
 one 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.070
 to me 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.440
 to me 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.560
 Y 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.560
 yes 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.880
 exactly two movements with the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.920
 iron as they could see but now it 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.510
 I'll explain it better the first 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.850
 movement for example I have this same 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.920
 unlock is the iron 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.660
 what I do is take it back and 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.240
 using it this way and so the 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.220
 wave is backwards and the second 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.270
 movement that I do I 'm going to try it with 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.820
 the same 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.430
 This is the iron and what I do is like that 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.100
 and I do it forward the same 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.260
 movement and so the wave is left towards 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.160
 forward you will wonder why 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.230
 two movements and not only one 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.880
 It is so that our hair does not 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.890
 is so masters has not be very 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.700
 very fake hairdressing but they want 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.890
 these most messy waves I do it from 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.530
 this way first backwards and then 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.590
 go interspersing between forward and 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.590
 behind 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.150
 yes 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.709
 but reaching the upper area of my 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.200
 head I have hair a lot more 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.560
 cortitos and what I do to make the 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.360
 wave is only take it any 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.879
 version for example I'm going to take this 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.599
 here for me to see it and what I do with 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:07.330
 I iron them and I always do them 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.580
 waves backwards throughout the area where 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.940
 I have more short projects and this is 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.680
 the result that is much more 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.870
 comfortable 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.870
 as you have sent softer 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.690
 Yes Yes 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.440
