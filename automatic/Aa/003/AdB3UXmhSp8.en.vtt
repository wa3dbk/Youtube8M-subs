about<00:00:02.760> the<00:00:03.000> new<00:00:03.540> steam<00:00:04.440> controller<00:00:04.890> changes

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
about the new steam controller changes

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.400 
about the new steam controller changes
that<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.850> steam<00:00:06.120> database<00:00:06.390> people<00:00:06.990> found

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
that the steam database people found

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.089 
that the steam database people found
online<00:00:08.480> I<00:00:09.480> just<00:00:09.870> I've<00:00:10.530> had<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.800> couple<00:00:10.950> of

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
online I just I've had a couple of

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.549 
online I just I've had a couple of
people<00:00:11.340> ask<00:00:11.550> me<00:00:11.670> about<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:12.059> so<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.509> figured<00:00:13.170> I

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
people ask me about it so I figured I

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.780 
people ask me about it so I figured I
should<00:00:13.830> just<00:00:14.009> post<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.250> video<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.490> know<00:00:14.639> it's

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
should just post a video I know it's

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.400 
should just post a video I know it's

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
still have my original steam controller

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.269 
still have my original steam controller
but<00:00:21.090> i<00:00:21.119> do<00:00:21.330> not<00:00:21.660> have<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.350> any<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.920> updated

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
but i do not have the any of the updated

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.390 
but i do not have the any of the updated
ones<00:00:23.430> i've<00:00:24.470> talked<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.680> people<00:00:26.010> at<00:00:26.189> valve

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
ones i've talked to the people at valve

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.009 
ones i've talked to the people at valve
about<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.119> month<00:00:27.359> ago<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.570> they<00:00:27.750> said<00:00:27.869> that

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
about a month ago and they said that

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.810 
about a month ago and they said that
something<00:00:28.710> would<00:00:29.010> be<00:00:29.160> shipping<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.580> something

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
something would be shipping in something

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.849 
something would be shipping in something
so<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:29.970> i<00:00:30.090> could<00:00:30.150> give<00:00:31.019> back<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.439> old<00:00:31.679> one

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
so that i could give back this old one

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.490 
so that i could give back this old one
because<00:00:32.009> i<00:00:32.640> am<00:00:33.540> still<00:00:33.780> having<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.020> trackpad

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
because i am still having that trackpad

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.740 
because i am still having that trackpad
issue<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.950> I've<00:00:35.040> made<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.340> video<00:00:35.730> about<00:00:35.820> about

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
issue that I've made a video about about

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.240 
issue that I've made a video about about
a<00:00:36.780> month<00:00:36.960> ago<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.380> hopefully<00:00:37.890> that'll<00:00:38.070> happen

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
a month ago so hopefully that'll happen

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.950 
a month ago so hopefully that'll happen
and<00:00:38.520> maybe<00:00:38.670> i'll<00:00:39.300> get<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.540> take<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> look<00:00:39.899> at

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
and maybe i'll get to take a look at

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.220 
and maybe i'll get to take a look at
this<00:00:40.050> at<00:00:40.230> some<00:00:40.379> point<00:00:40.590> um<00:00:41.660> basically<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.020> big

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
this at some point um basically the big

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.069 
this at some point um basically the big
change<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:43.980> new<00:00:44.760> analog<00:00:45.239> stick<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
change is the new analog stick on the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.990 
change is the new analog stick on the
left<00:00:46.559> side<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.280> i<00:00:47.340> think<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.670> does<00:00:47.820> make<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
left side and i think that does make a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.770 
left side and i think that does make a
lot<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.180> sense<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.670> B<00:00:50.940> X<00:00:50.969> Y<00:00:51.270> button<00:00:51.510> layout

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
lot of sense the a B X Y button layout

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.279 
lot of sense the a B X Y button layout
on<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> bottom<00:00:52.710> right<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.539> thought<00:00:54.539> was<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> good

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
on the bottom right I thought was a good

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.950 
on the bottom right I thought was a good
change<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:56.489> having<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.090> mirrored<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
change but having that mirrored on the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.720 
change but having that mirrored on the
Left<00:00:58.230> didn't<00:00:58.710> make<00:00:58.800> as<00:00:58.920> much<00:00:59.039> sense<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.399> me<00:00:59.579> it

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
Left didn't make as much sense to me it

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.060 
Left didn't make as much sense to me it
was<00:00:59.969> kind<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.270> filling<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> form<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.590> d-pad

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
was kind of filling the form of a d-pad

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.600 
was kind of filling the form of a d-pad
but<00:01:02.699> having<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.329> d-pad<00:01:03.989> spaced<00:01:04.470> out<00:01:04.739> never

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
but having the d-pad spaced out never

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.690 
but having the d-pad spaced out never
really<00:01:05.850> felt<00:01:06.450> right<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> me<00:01:06.840> um<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:08.520> major

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
really felt right to me um the major

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.170 
really felt right to me um the major
d-pad<00:01:09.360> options<00:01:09.840> right<00:01:10.140> now<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.340> let<00:01:12.090> me

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
d-pad options right now with the let me

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.580 
d-pad options right now with the let me
see<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> think<00:01:12.720> I've<00:01:12.810> got<00:01:12.960> both<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.290> them<00:01:13.470> right

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
see I think I've got both of them right

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.679 
see I think I've got both of them right
here<00:01:13.820> with<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.110> PlayStation<00:01:16.110> 4<00:01:16.799> controller<00:01:17.689> all

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
here with a PlayStation 4 controller all

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.440 
here with a PlayStation 4 controller all
four<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.860> buttons<00:01:20.700> are<00:01:20.820> really<00:01:21.030> kind<00:01:21.390> of

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
four of the buttons are really kind of

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.300 
four of the buttons are really kind of
close<00:01:21.630> together<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.680> can<00:01:22.710> really<00:01:23.009> go<00:01:23.159> from

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
close together so you can really go from

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.530 
close together so you can really go from
one<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.670> another<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.090> they're<00:01:24.210> actually<00:01:24.330> all

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
one to another and they're actually all

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.010 
one to another and they're actually all
part<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> same<00:01:25.259> unit<00:01:25.680> um<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.869> can

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
part of the same unit um so you can

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.870 
part of the same unit um so you can
really<00:01:28.140> get<00:01:28.350> from<00:01:28.619> one<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.250> other<00:01:29.490> quite

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
really get from one to the other quite

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.280 
really get from one to the other quite
quickly<00:01:30.090> as<00:01:30.270> opposed<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.630> like<00:01:30.810> even<00:01:31.020> over

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
quickly as opposed to like even over

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.929 
quickly as opposed to like even over
here<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.570> triangle<00:01:33.570> circle<00:01:34.079> X<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.400> square

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
here on the triangle circle X and square

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.660 
here on the triangle circle X and square
they're<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> little<00:01:37.049> bit<00:01:37.229> further<00:01:37.470> apart<00:01:37.799> it

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
they're a little bit further apart it

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.160 
they're a little bit further apart it
wouldn't<00:01:39.210> feel<00:01:39.360> as<00:01:39.540> good<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.840> play<00:01:39.960> like<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
wouldn't feel as good to play like a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.870 
wouldn't feel as good to play like a
fighting<00:01:40.470> game<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.009> because<00:01:41.729> you'd

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
fighting game with this because you'd

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.300 
fighting game with this because you'd
have<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.210> be<00:01:42.600> moving<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.590> little<00:01:43.860> bit<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.220> it

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
have to be moving a little bit and it

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.889 
have to be moving a little bit and it
felt<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:45.180> was<00:01:45.360> even<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.659> little<00:01:45.780> bit

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
felt like it was even a little bit

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.010 
felt like it was even a little bit
further<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.409> those<00:01:46.649> initial<00:01:47.630> pictures<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.899> the

further on those initial pictures of the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.690 
further on those initial pictures of the
steam<00:01:49.229> controller<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.770> maybe<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.399> just<00:01:50.520> has

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
steam controller and maybe that just has

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.770 
steam controller and maybe that just has
to<00:01:50.820> do<00:01:50.909> with<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> size<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.540> overall

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
to do with the size of the overall

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.510 
to do with the size of the overall
controller<00:01:52.380> being<00:01:52.619> smaller<00:01:52.860> than<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.130> expect

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
controller being smaller than I expect

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.130 
controller being smaller than I expect
but<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.240> did<00:01:54.329> seem<00:01:54.360> like<00:01:54.659> there<00:01:54.810> was<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.930> lot<00:01:55.110> of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
but it did seem like there was a lot of

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.859 
but it did seem like there was a lot of
space<00:01:55.590> between<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.549> buttons<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.719> thought

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
space between the buttons and I thought

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.569 
space between the buttons and I thought
that<00:01:58.049> well<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.380> makes<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.649> lot<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.979> sense<00:01:59.100> when

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
that well that makes a lot of sense when

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.940 
that well that makes a lot of sense when
you've<00:01:59.700> got<00:01:59.790> to<00:02:00.090> not<00:02:00.540> be<00:02:00.780> hitting<00:02:01.049> button

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
you've got to not be hitting button

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.709 
you've got to not be hitting button
accidentally<00:02:02.490> when<00:02:02.640> you're<00:02:02.790> performing<00:02:03.360> a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
accidentally when you're performing a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.990 
accidentally when you're performing a
quick<00:02:04.020> action<00:02:04.469> which<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.399> main<00:02:05.579> purpose

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
quick action which is the main purpose

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.180 
quick action which is the main purpose
of<00:02:06.299> these<00:02:06.479> buttons<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> side<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.829> didn't

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
of these buttons on the side it didn't

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.889 
of these buttons on the side it didn't
make<00:02:08.310> as<00:02:08.429> much<00:02:08.550> sense<00:02:08.610> with<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> d-pad<00:02:09.629> where

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
make as much sense with a d-pad where

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.900 
make as much sense with a d-pad where
you<00:02:10.379> really<00:02:10.679> do<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> lot<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> time<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.730> want

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
you really do a lot of the time I want

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.180 
you really do a lot of the time I want
to<00:02:11.970> be

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
to be

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.530 
to be
moving<00:02:12.610> up<00:02:12.790> from<00:02:13.030> legged<00:02:13.390> down<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.400> forward

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
moving up from legged down to a forward

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.580 
moving up from legged down to a forward
especially<00:02:16.540> for<00:02:16.990> something<00:02:17.170> like<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.350> fighting

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
especially for something like a fighting

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.790 
especially for something like a fighting
game<00:02:17.710> so<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.070> really<00:02:18.220> didn't<00:02:18.490> make<00:02:18.550> sense

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
game so it really didn't make sense

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.430 
game so it really didn't make sense
having<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:20.830> as<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.400> d-pad<00:02:22.350> having<00:02:23.350> an

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
having that as the d-pad having an

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.540 
having that as the d-pad having an
analog<00:02:23.830> stick<00:02:24.190> as<00:02:24.370> opposed<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.300> a<00:02:25.330> d-pad<00:02:25.720> um<00:02:26.550> it

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
analog stick as opposed to a d-pad um it

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.070 
analog stick as opposed to a d-pad um it
does<00:02:27.820> work<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:29.170> mean<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:30.760> gets<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.420> lot<00:02:31.810> of<00:02:31.870> the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
does work I mean it gets a lot of the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.850 
does work I mean it gets a lot of the
things<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:32.680> want<00:02:33.040> from<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:34.860> movement

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
things that you want from that movement

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.590 
things that you want from that movement
control<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.520> it<00:02:36.760> makes<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.210> a<00:02:37.330> little<00:02:37.450> bit

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
control and it makes it a little bit

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.020 
control and it makes it a little bit
more<00:02:37.750> intuitive<00:02:38.320> i<00:02:38.410> think<00:02:38.670> i'm<00:02:39.670> not<00:02:39.850> sure<00:02:39.940> how

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
more intuitive i think i'm not sure how

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.050 
more intuitive i think i'm not sure how
i<00:02:40.060> feel<00:02:40.150> about<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.720> really<00:02:40.870> because<00:02:42.060> overall

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
i feel about it really because overall

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.920 
i feel about it really because overall
now<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.920> makes<00:02:45.220> sense<00:02:45.780> i<00:02:46.780> do<00:02:47.410> think<00:02:47.830> that<00:02:47.890> i

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
now it makes sense i do think that i

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.050 
now it makes sense i do think that i
don't<00:02:49.930> necessarily<00:02:50.080> see<00:02:50.680> why<00:02:50.800> you<00:02:50.860> can't<00:02:51.400> use

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
don't necessarily see why you can't use

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.690 
don't necessarily see why you can't use
the<00:02:52.570> trackpad<00:02:53.140> on<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.590> left<00:02:53.800> for<00:02:54.220> movement

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
the trackpad on the left for movement

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.730 
the trackpad on the left for movement
controls<00:02:55.390> i<00:02:55.600> think<00:02:56.140> that<00:02:56.200> one<00:02:56.380> of<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.530> big

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
controls i think that one of the big

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.670 
controls i think that one of the big
issues<00:02:56.920> that<00:02:57.700> makes<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.600> feel<00:02:59.020> frustrated<00:02:59.620> or

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
issues that makes it feel frustrated or

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.900 
issues that makes it feel frustrated or
at<00:02:59.800> least<00:02:59.950> what<00:03:00.100> i<00:03:00.130> suspected<00:03:01.260> was<00:03:02.260> just<00:03:02.500> that

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
at least what i suspected was just that

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.450 
at least what i suspected was just that
playing<00:03:03.910> on<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:04.270> trackpad<00:03:04.810> initially<00:03:05.770> you

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
playing on the trackpad initially you

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.880 
playing on the trackpad initially you
really<00:03:06.820> only<00:03:07.000> have<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.570> four-way<00:03:08.410> controls

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
really only have the four-way controls

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.680 
really only have the four-way controls
because<00:03:09.370> you're<00:03:10.140> simulating<00:03:11.220> wa<00:03:12.220> s<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:12.700> D<00:03:12.850> so

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
because you're simulating wa s and D so

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.510 
because you're simulating wa s and D so
it<00:03:13.870> might<00:03:14.140> not<00:03:14.230> feel<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.740> good<00:03:14.890> but<00:03:15.070> it<00:03:15.190> should

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
it might not feel is good but it should

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.370 
it might not feel is good but it should
theoretically<00:03:15.970> play<00:03:16.510> as<00:03:16.720> well<00:03:16.840> especially<00:03:17.080> if

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
theoretically play as well especially if

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.250 
theoretically play as well especially if
you<00:03:17.470> can<00:03:17.650> emulate<00:03:18.100> some<00:03:18.430> kind<00:03:18.640> of<00:03:19.260> joystick

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
you can emulate some kind of joystick

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.740 
you can emulate some kind of joystick
functionality<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.580> I<00:03:21.970> expected<00:03:22.420> that<00:03:22.570> was

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
functionality and I expected that was

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.650 
functionality and I expected that was
what<00:03:22.959> was<00:03:23.080> going<00:03:23.200> to<00:03:23.230> happen<00:03:23.320> but<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.700> guess<00:03:25.540> I'm

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
what was going to happen but I guess I'm

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.370 
what was going to happen but I guess I'm
fine<00:03:25.840> having<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:27.510> pad<00:03:28.510> there<00:03:28.780> like<00:03:28.959> there's

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
fine having the pad there like there's

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.930 
fine having the pad there like there's
nothing<00:03:29.470> wrong<00:03:29.739> with<00:03:29.800> that<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.640> thing<00:03:30.820> that

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
nothing wrong with that the thing that

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.370 
nothing wrong with that the thing that
I'm<00:03:31.030> concerned<00:03:31.060> about<00:03:31.570> is<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:31.930> we're<00:03:32.140> losing

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
I'm concerned about is that we're losing

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.150 
I'm concerned about is that we're losing
four<00:03:32.920> buttons<00:03:33.459> um<00:03:34.530> maybe<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:35.830> can<00:03:35.980> like

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
four buttons um maybe you can like

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.000 
four buttons um maybe you can like
depress<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.500> joystick<00:03:38.500> but<00:03:38.680> that's<00:03:38.830> unlikely

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
depress the joystick but that's unlikely

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.490 
depress the joystick but that's unlikely
I<00:03:39.340> don't<00:03:39.550> think<00:03:39.700> there's<00:03:39.850> any<00:03:40.060> modern<00:03:41.019> joist<00:03:41.260> I

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
I don't think there's any modern joist I

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.910 
I don't think there's any modern joist I
guess<00:03:41.950> yeah<00:03:42.250> wait<00:03:42.880> can<00:03:43.090> all<00:03:43.380> yeah<00:03:44.380> so<00:03:44.590> all<00:03:44.800> of

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
guess yeah wait can all yeah so all of

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.979 
guess yeah wait can all yeah so all of
them<00:03:45.540> both<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.780> ps4<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.459> 360<00:03:49.300> you<00:03:49.810> can

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
them both the ps4 and the 360 you can

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.229 
them both the ps4 and the 360 you can
press<00:03:50.200> in<00:03:50.500> on<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.920> joystick<00:03:51.400> so<00:03:52.090> you've<00:03:52.209> got

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
press in on the joystick so you've got

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.170 
press in on the joystick so you've got
one<00:03:52.530> button<00:03:53.530> but<00:03:53.860> you're<00:03:54.100> still<00:03:54.550> losing<00:03:54.850> three

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
one button but you're still losing three

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.740 
one button but you're still losing three
and<00:03:55.380> one<00:03:56.380> of<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.530> things<00:03:56.590> that<00:03:56.739> I<00:03:56.860> was<00:03:56.980> really

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
and one of the things that I was really

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.240 
and one of the things that I was really
excited<00:03:58.750> about<00:03:59.050> with<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.470> original<00:03:59.860> steam

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
excited about with the original steam

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.490 
excited about with the original steam
controller<00:04:00.610> was<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.690> fact<00:04:01.840> that<00:04:01.959> using<00:04:02.380> these

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
controller was the fact that using these

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.280 
controller was the fact that using these
eight<00:04:03.250> buttons<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:04.060> four<00:04:04.480> inside<00:04:04.840> here<00:04:05.170> and

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
eight buttons the four inside here and

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.220 
eight buttons the four inside here and
then<00:04:05.380> the<00:04:05.470> four<00:04:05.709> along<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.100> sides<00:04:06.459> um<00:04:07.230> what

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
then the four along the sides um what

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.990 
then the four along the sides um what
was<00:04:08.350> really<00:04:08.590> nice<00:04:08.769> about<00:04:08.920> that<00:04:09.040> was<00:04:09.340> it<00:04:09.730> did

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
was really nice about that was it did

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.380 
was really nice about that was it did
allow<00:04:10.120> you<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:10.810> play<00:04:11.530> games<00:04:11.830> more<00:04:12.730> easily<00:04:13.150> and

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
allow you to play games more easily and

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.150 
allow you to play games more easily and
quickly<00:04:13.480> that<00:04:14.170> you<00:04:14.260> otherwise<00:04:14.500> couldn't<00:04:14.920> that

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
quickly that you otherwise couldn't that

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.099 
quickly that you otherwise couldn't that
were<00:04:15.250> pc<00:04:15.670> games<00:04:15.940> and<00:04:16.209> that<00:04:16.330> was<00:04:16.480> kind<00:04:16.780> of<00:04:16.870> what

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
were pc games and that was kind of what

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.330 
were pc games and that was kind of what
I<00:04:17.169> was<00:04:17.320> hoping<00:04:17.470> for<00:04:17.680> with<00:04:17.980> the<00:04:18.160> steam

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
I was hoping for with the steam

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.110 
I was hoping for with the steam
controller<00:04:18.540> so<00:04:19.540> as<00:04:20.039> we<00:04:21.039> lose<00:04:21.340> buttons<00:04:21.880> that

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
controller so as we lose buttons that

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.810 
controller so as we lose buttons that
concerns<00:04:22.630> me

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
concerns me

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.240 
concerns me
these<00:04:24.750> buttons<00:04:25.020> on<00:04:25.140> the<00:04:25.230> back<00:04:25.380> I've<00:04:26.040> always

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
these buttons on the back I've always

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.740 
these buttons on the back I've always
thought<00:04:26.460> that<00:04:26.520> there<00:04:26.730> was<00:04:26.790> a<00:04:26.880> possibility<00:04:27.060> of

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
thought that there was a possibility of

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.000 
thought that there was a possibility of
splitting<00:04:28.020> them<00:04:28.170> up<00:04:28.290> i'm<00:04:28.470> guessing<00:04:28.980> that

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
splitting them up i'm guessing that

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.410 
splitting them up i'm guessing that
they've<00:04:29.310> tried<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:29.730> and<00:04:29.910> it<00:04:29.970> just<00:04:30.180> doesn't

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
they've tried that and it just doesn't

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.630 
they've tried that and it just doesn't
work<00:04:30.540> but<00:04:31.110> i'd<00:04:31.230> really<00:04:31.560> like<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:31.740> see<00:04:32.040> like<00:04:32.430> if

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
work but i'd really like to see like if

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.390 
work but i'd really like to see like if
you've<00:04:33.090> got<00:04:33.270> your<00:04:33.480> controller<00:04:34.140> like<00:04:34.530> this<00:04:34.770> you

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
you've got your controller like this you

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.730 
you've got your controller like this you
really<00:04:35.610> do<00:04:35.850> have<00:04:35.880> at<00:04:36.210> least<00:04:36.390> two<00:04:36.930> fingers<00:04:37.320> that

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
really do have at least two fingers that

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.160 
really do have at least two fingers that
could<00:04:38.040> have<00:04:38.670> a<00:04:38.700> split<00:04:39.090> here<00:04:39.270> somewhere<00:04:39.630> so<00:04:40.050> you

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
could have a split here somewhere so you

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.260 
could have a split here somewhere so you
get<00:04:40.380> another<00:04:40.590> two<00:04:40.950> out<00:04:41.100> of<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.880> controller

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
get another two out of the controller

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.480 
get another two out of the controller
that<00:04:42.480> way<00:04:42.660> but<00:04:43.260> it<00:04:43.950> depends<00:04:44.160> on<00:04:44.250> how<00:04:44.340> you're

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
that way but it depends on how you're

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.650 
that way but it depends on how you're
playing<00:04:44.610> it<00:04:44.790> because<00:04:44.940> you<00:04:45.210> probably<00:04:45.360> want

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
playing it because you probably want

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.900 
playing it because you probably want
your<00:04:46.170> ear<00:04:46.320> fingers<00:04:46.680> here<00:04:46.830> here<00:04:47.310> then<00:04:47.820> you've

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
your ear fingers here here then you've

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.420 
your ear fingers here here then you've
got<00:04:48.030> two<00:04:48.360> on<00:04:48.780> each<00:04:49.170> side<00:04:49.200> that<00:04:50.130> might<00:04:50.280> not<00:04:50.370> be

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
got two on each side that might not be

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.600 
got two on each side that might not be
good<00:04:50.550> for<00:04:50.730> younger<00:04:51.420> players<00:04:51.690> or<00:04:52.580> people<00:04:53.580> who

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
good for younger players or people who

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.940 
good for younger players or people who
have<00:04:53.970> smaller<00:04:54.180> hands<00:04:54.680> so<00:04:55.680> that's<00:04:55.830> something

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
have smaller hands so that's something

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.620 
have smaller hands so that's something
always<00:04:56.370> to<00:04:56.490> think<00:04:56.700> about<00:04:57.560> but<00:04:58.560> I<00:04:59.210> guess<00:05:00.210> I'm

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
always to think about but I guess I'm

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.390 
always to think about but I guess I'm
interested<00:05:01.200> to<00:05:01.230> see<00:05:01.470> how<00:05:01.590> this<00:05:01.620> plays<00:05:01.860> I<00:05:02.190> mean

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
interested to see how this plays I mean

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.180 
interested to see how this plays I mean
I<00:05:02.640> don't<00:05:03.600> know<00:05:03.690> I'm<00:05:03.990> just<00:05:04.320> speculating<00:05:04.740> and

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
I don't know I'm just speculating and

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.800 
I don't know I'm just speculating and
somebody<00:05:05.430> who's<00:05:05.580> thought<00:05:06.480> a<00:05:06.510> lot<00:05:06.690> of

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
somebody who's thought a lot of

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.740 
somebody who's thought a lot of
controllers<00:05:07.410> in<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.620> past<00:05:07.820> year<00:05:08.820> a<00:05:09.000> couple

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
controllers in the past year a couple

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.440 
controllers in the past year a couple
years<00:05:10.050> on<00:05:11.150> but<00:05:12.500> the<00:05:13.500> thing<00:05:13.710> that<00:05:13.740> I'm<00:05:13.950> most

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
years on but the thing that I'm most

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.970 
years on but the thing that I'm most
concerned<00:05:15.450> about<00:05:15.960> is<00:05:16.260> just<00:05:16.410> losing<00:05:16.710> those

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
concerned about is just losing those

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.300 
concerned about is just losing those
three<00:05:17.310> buttons<00:05:18.650> there<00:05:19.650> were<00:05:19.770> a<00:05:19.800> lot<00:05:19.860> of<00:05:19.980> games

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
three buttons there were a lot of games

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.440 
three buttons there were a lot of games
where<00:05:21.440> games<00:05:22.440> that<00:05:22.650> were<00:05:22.740> on<00:05:22.980> PC<00:05:23.490> that<00:05:24.090> assume

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
where games that were on PC that assume

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.700 
where games that were on PC that assume
that<00:05:24.480> you've<00:05:24.720> got<00:05:24.840> a<00:05:24.870> keyboard<00:05:25.290> and<00:05:25.380> because

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
that you've got a keyboard and because

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.170 
that you've got a keyboard and because
they<00:05:25.860> can<00:05:26.040> make<00:05:26.310> the<00:05:26.490> assumption<00:05:26.820> that<00:05:26.970> you've

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
they can make the assumption that you've

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.600 
they can make the assumption that you've
got<00:05:27.390> a<00:05:27.420> keyboard<00:05:27.840> they<00:05:28.410> can<00:05:28.680> require<00:05:29.220> buttons

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
got a keyboard they can require buttons

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.700 
got a keyboard they can require buttons
that<00:05:29.760> you<00:05:29.790> otherwise<00:05:30.000> wouldn't<00:05:30.360> use<00:05:30.630> or<00:05:31.050> they

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
that you otherwise wouldn't use or they

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.370 
that you otherwise wouldn't use or they
can<00:05:32.810> forego<00:05:33.810> weird<00:05:34.230> interfaces<00:05:34.950> so<00:05:35.580> like<00:05:36.380> I'm

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
can forego weird interfaces so like I'm

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.690 
can forego weird interfaces so like I'm
trying<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.710> think<00:05:37.740> i've<00:05:38.130> actually<00:05:38.550> played

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
trying to think i've actually played

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.480 
trying to think i've actually played
metro<00:05:39.420> last<00:05:39.600> light<00:05:39.780> on<00:05:40.050> a<00:05:40.080> console<00:05:40.620> but<00:05:41.280> things

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
metro last light on a console but things

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.540 
metro last light on a console but things
like<00:05:41.640> the<00:05:41.820> gas<00:05:42.060> mask<00:05:42.530> being<00:05:43.530> mapped<00:05:43.710> to<00:05:43.890> g<00:05:44.310> I

like the gas mask being mapped to g I
feel<00:05:45.270> like<00:05:45.360> there's<00:05:45.570> got<00:05:45.690> to<00:05:45.780> be<00:05:45.840> a<00:05:45.930> different

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
feel like there's got to be a different

feel like there's got to be a different
way<00:05:46.440> that<00:05:46.620> they're<00:05:46.740> dealing<00:05:47.040> with<00:05:47.070> it<00:05:47.310> on<00:05:47.430> a

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
way that they're dealing with it on a

way that they're dealing with it on a
controller<00:05:49.410> but<00:05:50.280> I<00:05:50.730> don't<00:05:51.510> know<00:05:51.600> where<00:05:51.720> you

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
controller but I don't know where you

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.080 
controller but I don't know where you
put<00:05:52.080> that<00:05:52.200> now<00:05:52.440> because<00:05:53.160> you<00:05:53.550> don't<00:05:53.700> have<00:05:53.880> like

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
put that now because you don't have like

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.650 
put that now because you don't have like
a<00:05:54.120> d-pad<00:05:54.570> which<00:05:54.810> usually<00:05:55.410> on<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:55.740> controller

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660

you've<00:05:57.660> got<00:05:57.840> the<00:05:57.990> eight<00:05:58.170> buttons<00:05:58.470> for<00:05:59.400> the

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
you've got the eight buttons for the

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.660 
you've got the eight buttons for the

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670 
right side and the left side because you

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.750 
right side and the left side because you
use<00:06:02.880> the<00:06:03.090> d-pad<00:06:03.690> a<00:06:03.900> lot<00:06:04.170> of<00:06:04.230> time<00:06:04.410> as<00:06:04.560> a<00:06:05.370> second

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
use the d-pad a lot of time as a second

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.100 
use the d-pad a lot of time as a second
set<00:06:05.880> of<00:06:05.910> just<00:06:06.150> buttons<00:06:06.480> if<00:06:06.750> you<00:06:06.840> want<00:06:06.990> to<00:06:07.050> do

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
set of just buttons if you want to do

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.110 
set of just buttons if you want to do
interface<00:06:07.530> stuff<00:06:07.800> and<00:06:08.010> that<00:06:08.550> might<00:06:08.760> feel<00:06:09.090> a

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
interface stuff and that might feel a

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.370 
interface stuff and that might feel a
lot<00:06:09.420> worse<00:06:09.450> with<00:06:10.290> a<00:06:10.320> joystick<00:06:12.110> just<00:06:13.110> because

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
lot worse with a joystick just because

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.530 
lot worse with a joystick just because
you<00:06:13.860> can't<00:06:14.040> be<00:06:14.160> as<00:06:14.250> per<00:06:14.430> site<00:06:14.580> so<00:06:14.760> like<00:06:14.880> maybe

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
you can't be as per site so like maybe

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.500 
you can't be as per site so like maybe
you<00:06:15.840> have<00:06:16.320> to<00:06:16.440> like<00:06:16.560> navigate<00:06:17.070> menus<00:06:17.310> in<00:06:17.580> I

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
you have to like navigate menus in I

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.050 
you have to like navigate menus in I
don't<00:06:19.290> know<00:06:19.350> like<00:06:19.410> a<00:06:19.620> Formula<00:06:20.100> One<00:06:20.250> game<00:06:20.700> I

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
don't know like a Formula One game I

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.120 
don't know like a Formula One game I
know<00:06:21.450> that<00:06:21.660> they<00:06:21.780> use<00:06:22.280> the<00:06:23.390> d-pad<00:06:24.390> to<00:06:25.260> switch

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
know that they use the d-pad to switch

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.730 
know that they use the d-pad to switch
between<00:06:26.450> like<00:06:27.450> going<00:06:27.900> through<00:06:28.050> your<00:06:28.350> brakes

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
between like going through your brakes

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.470 
between like going through your brakes
and<00:06:29.130> there's<00:06:29.280> a<00:06:29.370> lot<00:06:29.490> of<00:06:29.520> like<00:06:29.820> menu<00:06:30.150> stuff<00:06:30.360> to

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.480 
and there's a lot of like menu stuff to

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.540 
and there's a lot of like menu stuff to
do<00:06:30.570> or<00:06:30.690> like<00:06:30.870> line<00:06:31.200> changes<00:06:31.770> in<00:06:31.950> a<00:06:32.010> hockey<00:06:32.250> game

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
do or like line changes in a hockey game

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.900 
do or like line changes in a hockey game
and<00:06:33.020> doing<00:06:34.020> that<00:06:34.169> stuff<00:06:34.380> on<00:06:34.470> a<00:06:34.590> joystick

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
and doing that stuff on a joystick

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.900 
and doing that stuff on a joystick
doesn't<00:06:36.420> feel<00:06:36.600> as<00:06:36.750> good<00:06:36.810> um<00:06:37.110> you<00:06:37.590> can<00:06:37.910> slightly

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
doesn't feel as good um you can slightly

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.950 
doesn't feel as good um you can slightly
mess<00:06:39.270> up<00:06:39.450> and<00:06:39.770> it'll<00:06:40.770> be<00:06:40.920> less<00:06:41.820> obvious<00:06:42.060> from<00:06:42.870> a

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
mess up and it'll be less obvious from a

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.190 
mess up and it'll be less obvious from a
tactile<00:06:43.350> point<00:06:43.650> of<00:06:43.740> view<00:06:43.890> but<00:06:44.720> it<00:06:45.720> could<00:06:46.080> be

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
tactile point of view but it could be

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.750 
tactile point of view but it could be
annoying<00:06:47.360> so<00:06:48.360> I<00:06:48.720> think<00:06:49.350> that<00:06:49.560> this<00:06:49.800> change

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760 
annoying so I think that this change

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.710 
annoying so I think that this change
might<00:06:51.920> make<00:06:52.920> some<00:06:53.430> games<00:06:53.730> a<00:06:54.000> lot<00:06:54.030> easier<00:06:54.480> to

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 
might make some games a lot easier to

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.500 
might make some games a lot easier to
play<00:06:54.930> but<00:06:55.590> I<00:06:55.620> think<00:06:55.860> it<00:06:55.980> limits<00:06:56.400> the<00:06:56.490> scope<00:06:57.180> of

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:57.510 
play but I think it limits the scope of

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.420 
play but I think it limits the scope of
how<00:06:57.660> many<00:06:57.840> games<00:06:58.020> will<00:06:58.320> work<00:06:58.980> at<00:06:59.130> all<00:06:59.220> on<00:06:59.250> a

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
how many games will work at all on a

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.620 
how many games will work at all on a
steam<00:06:59.670> controller<00:07:00.060> and<00:07:00.180> I<00:07:00.210> think<00:07:00.390> that's<00:07:00.540> what

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.630 
steam controller and I think that's what

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.690 
steam controller and I think that's what
I'm<00:07:00.720> most<00:07:00.840> concerned<00:07:01.020> about<00:07:01.550> anyway<00:07:02.550> i<00:07:02.580> hope

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:02.700 
I'm most concerned about anyway i hope

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.160 
I'm most concerned about anyway i hope
this<00:07:02.850> answers<00:07:03.270> the<00:07:03.360> questions<00:07:03.750> that<00:07:03.840> a<00:07:03.960> few<00:07:04.140> of
