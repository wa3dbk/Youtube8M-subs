something closer to what originally was
that's<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.250> first<00:01:16.520> step<00:01:16.790> is<00:01:17.140> reestablishing

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
that's the first step is reestablishing

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.330 
that's the first step is reestablishing
the<00:01:18.259> color<00:01:19.720> here's<00:01:20.720> a<00:01:20.780> closer<00:01:21.079> view<00:01:21.229> of<00:01:21.740> this
