short computed trainings we'll continue
to<00:00:05.460> talk<00:00:05.640> in<00:00:05.879> this<00:00:06.060> video<00:00:06.330> about<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.990> network

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
to talk in this video about the network

utility application for Macintosh OS X

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.980 
utility application for Macintosh OS X
let's<00:00:12.240> start<00:00:12.540> it

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
let's start it

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:22.970 
let's start it
so<00:00:13.170> network<00:00:18.859> and<00:00:21.140> last<00:00:22.140> time<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:22.439> talked<00:00:22.859> about

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
so network and last time we talked about

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.609 
so network and last time we talked about
the<00:00:23.220> nets<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.850> net<00:00:24.029> stat<00:00:24.269> tab<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:25.199> showed

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
the nets the net stat tab and we showed

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.550 
the nets the net stat tab and we showed
how<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.090> display<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.660> routing<00:00:28.260> table

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
how it can display the routing table

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.980 
how it can display the routing table
information<00:00:29.210> we<00:00:30.210> can<00:00:30.420> use<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.720> information

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
information we can use this information

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.530 
information we can use this information
to<00:00:31.320> see<00:00:31.619> if<00:00:31.650> for<00:00:32.430> example<00:00:32.730> we<00:00:32.969> cannot<00:00:33.180> reach<00:00:33.420> a

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
to see if for example we cannot reach a

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.069 
to see if for example we cannot reach a
device<00:00:33.809> on<00:00:33.989> our<00:00:34.050> network<00:00:34.500> if<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> wrong

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
device on our network if we have a wrong

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.660 
device on our network if we have a wrong
entry<00:00:37.079> there<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.680> that's<00:00:38.070> actually<00:00:38.550> not

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
entry there that that's actually not

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.410 
entry there that that's actually not
valid<00:00:39.030> anymore

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
valid anymore

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.860 
valid anymore
the<00:00:40.320> next<00:00:40.590> tab<00:00:40.770> thing<00:00:41.309> needs<00:00:42.120> no<00:00:42.360> introduction

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
the next tab thing needs no introduction

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.889 
the next tab thing needs no introduction
and<00:00:44.450> it's<00:00:45.980> easy<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.730> make<00:00:47.910> sure<00:00:48.660> a

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
and it's easy it is to make sure a

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.110 
and it's easy it is to make sure a
remote<00:00:49.170> station<00:00:49.559> or<00:00:49.649> website<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.190> alive<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
remote station or website is alive the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.290 
remote station or website is alive the
ping<00:00:51.329> command<00:00:51.570> uses<00:00:52.219> the<00:00:53.219> ICMP<00:00:53.879> protocol

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
ping command uses the ICMP protocol

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.810 
ping command uses the ICMP protocol

a remote host if you live an accepting
connection<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:01.859> ICMP<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:04.979> ping<00:01:05.869> this

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
connection on ICMP so we can ping this

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.350 
connection on ICMP so we can ping this
PC<00:01:07.619> for<00:01:07.950> example<00:01:08.250> which<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.490> uh<00:01:08.520> another<00:01:09.150> piece

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
PC for example which is uh another piece

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.719 
PC for example which is uh another piece
in<00:01:09.479> our<00:01:09.630> network<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.740> see<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.280> it's

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
in our network and you can see that it's

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.300 
in our network and you can see that it's
alive<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.930> time<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.380> takes<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
alive and the time it takes for the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.600 
alive and the time it takes for the
round<00:01:14.520> trip<00:01:14.760> for<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> packet<00:01:15.540> round-trip<00:01:16.610> now

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
round trip for the packet round-trip now

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.330 
round trip for the packet round-trip now
the<00:01:18.299> time<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.570> leave<00:01:18.900> for<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.740> packet<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.250> so

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
the time to leave for the packet and so

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.100 
the time to leave for the packet and so
far<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.700> far<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.970> can<00:01:21.119> see<00:01:21.240> here<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.659> it's<00:01:21.840> it's

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
far so far you can see here so it's it's

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.950 
far so far you can see here so it's it's
uh<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.430> running

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
uh it's up and running

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.499 
uh it's up and running
the<00:01:24.960> lookup<00:01:25.409> command<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.250> similar<00:01:26.850> with<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
the lookup command is similar with the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.719 
the lookup command is similar with the
nslookup<00:01:28.110> command<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.799> windows<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.250> cisco

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
nslookup command in windows and cisco

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.910 
nslookup command in windows and cisco
routers<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.450> will<00:01:30.659> translate<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.530> machine

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
routers and it will translate a machine

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.270 
routers and it will translate a machine

websites like daba daba daba calm have

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.690 
websites like daba daba daba calm have
multiple<00:01:43.140> servers<00:01:43.350> across<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> globe<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
multiple servers across the globe of the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.789 
multiple servers across the globe of the
globe<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:44.939> you're<00:01:45.270> gonna<00:01:45.420> get<00:01:45.600> multiple<00:01:46.500> IPS

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
globe so you're gonna get multiple IPS

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.270 
globe so you're gonna get multiple IPS
for<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.540> there<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.630> go<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.049> these<00:01:49.920> are<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
for that there you go so these are the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.090 
for that there you go so these are the

route that a packet would take to reach
its<00:02:03.210> destination<00:02:03.649> okay<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:04.710> we're<00:02:05.009> gonna

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
its destination okay so we're gonna

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.160 
its destination okay so we're gonna
we're<00:02:05.490> gonna<00:02:05.670> trace<00:02:06.000> route<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.600> google.com

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
we're gonna trace route to google.com

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.229 
we're gonna trace route to google.com
for<00:02:07.530> example

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
for example

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.960 
for example
this<00:02:09.989> command<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.470> gonna<00:02:10.679> give<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.549> every

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
this command is gonna give you every

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.369 
this command is gonna give you every
single<00:02:12.000> hop<00:02:12.769> that<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:14.519> packages<00:02:15.060> take<00:02:15.810> to

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
single hop that the packages take to

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.550 
single hop that the packages take to

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
reach that specific server you can use
