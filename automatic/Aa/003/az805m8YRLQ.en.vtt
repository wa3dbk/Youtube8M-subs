system can't process fast enough in the
sewer<00:02:09.890> line<00:02:10.099> pretty<00:02:10.340> much<00:02:10.550> runs<00:02:10.849> through

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
sewer line pretty much runs through

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.000 
sewer line pretty much runs through
their<00:02:11.180> feet<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:11.629> it<00:02:12.230> comes<00:02:12.440> out<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.650> form<00:02:12.950> of

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
their feet and it comes out a form of

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.640 
their feet and it comes out a form of
pus<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.310> mucus<00:02:14.030> on<00:02:14.150> automated<00:02:14.690> feet<00:02:14.930> so<00:02:15.140> if

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
pus and mucus on automated feet so if

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.800 
pus and mucus on automated feet so if
this<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.430> know<00:02:16.580> gets<00:02:16.790> clogged<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.599> can

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810

so of course we know that your fat is

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.880 
so of course we know that your fat is

kinds of toxins inside their body

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.090 
kinds of toxins inside their body
because<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.320> fact<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.590> they<00:03:01.740> don't<00:03:01.920> sweat

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
because the fact that they don't sweat

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.360 
because the fact that they don't sweat
there<00:03:02.820> of<00:03:03.180> course<00:03:03.390> they<00:03:03.680> absorb<00:03:04.680> more<00:03:04.860> toxins

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
there of course they absorb more toxins

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.800 
there of course they absorb more toxins

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
got there so we know that every time we

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.220

of course came to chill out pork so

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.040 
of course came to chill out pork so

nine hours to actually digest it into
the<00:03:55.830> body<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:56.610> that<00:03:56.640> means<00:03:56.940> that<00:03:57.030> your<00:03:57.240> liver

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
the body so that means that your liver

destined to meet but will pork it takes

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.740 
destined to meet but will pork it takes
four<00:04:01.770> hours<00:04:01.800> so<00:04:02.400> your<00:04:02.820> body<00:04:02.940> actually<00:04:03.240> know

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
four hours so your body actually know

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.660 
four hours so your body actually know
since<00:04:03.990> the<00:04:04.050> process<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:04.590> fast<00:04:04.860> your<00:04:05.460> body

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
since the process so fast your body

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.260 
since the process so fast your body
absorbs<00:04:06.090> more<00:04:06.270> the<00:04:06.390> toxic<00:04:06.810> pesticide<00:04:07.200> report

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
absorbs more the toxic pesticide report

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.230

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
of worms and bacteria once you keep

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.800 
of worms and bacteria once you keep
throwing<00:05:13.500> to<00:05:13.820> deport<00:05:14.820> you<00:05:15.120> actually<00:05:15.510> become<00:05:15.630> a

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
throwing to deport you actually become a

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.150 
a whole porkness cooked and pork

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.130 
a whole porkness cooked and pork
supposed<00:07:40.390> to<00:07:40.450> be<00:07:40.540> cooked<00:07:40.750> at<00:07:40.870> a<00:07:40.900> certain

supposed to be cooked at a certain

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.550 
supposed to be cooked at a certain
temperature<00:07:41.530> so<00:07:42.460> even<00:07:43.000> though<00:07:43.030> he<00:07:43.900> you<00:07:44.230> see<00:07:44.410> he

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 
temperature so even though he you see he

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.820 
temperature so even though he you see he
cooked<00:07:45.100> us<00:07:45.220> on<00:07:45.370> a<00:07:45.690> pole<00:07:46.690> apparently<00:07:47.350> roasted

cooked us on a pole apparently roasted

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.820 
cooked us on a pole apparently roasted
it<00:07:47.950> so<00:07:48.520> you<00:07:48.580> can't<00:07:49.390> roast<00:07:49.600> the<00:07:49.780> pork<00:07:50.020> or<00:07:50.380> to<00:07:50.710> all

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:54.550 
meat especially something this thick so

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.150 
meat especially something this thick so
you<00:07:54.790> know<00:07:55.390> even<00:07:55.870> when<00:07:56.020> salted<00:07:56.500> or<00:07:56.650> if<00:07:57.010> you

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:57.160
