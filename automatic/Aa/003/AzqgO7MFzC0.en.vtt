for<00:01:24.150> example<00:01:24.180> what<00:01:24.990> would<00:01:25.140> eventually<00:01:25.380> happen

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
for example what would eventually happen

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.219 
for example what would eventually happen
to<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> rock<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:27.360> would<00:01:27.479> eventually<00:01:27.720> corrode

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
to the rock it would eventually corrode

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.469 
to the rock it would eventually corrode
from<00:01:28.710> whether<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.430> piece<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.820> sodium<00:01:30.210> metal

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
from whether the piece of sodium metal

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.719 
from whether the piece of sodium metal
would<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.720> touched<00:01:30.990> by<00:01:31.259> rainwater<00:01:31.580> what<00:01:32.580> would

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
would be touched by rainwater what would

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:44.710 
would be touched by rainwater what would
happen<00:01:33.060> then<00:01:33.360> well<00:01:33.960> let's<00:01:34.200> see

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.670 

here's<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.900> smaller<00:01:46.320> piece<00:01:51.170> nice<00:01:52.170> shiny

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
here's a smaller piece nice shiny

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.940 
here's a smaller piece nice shiny
surfaces<00:01:54.470> when<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.590> goes<00:01:55.770> into<00:01:56.010> the<00:01:56.190> water

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
surfaces when it goes into the water

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:05.890 
surfaces when it goes into the water
what's<00:01:58.950> happening<00:02:01.640> first<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:03.090> doesn't<00:02:03.360> sink

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.330 

that's<00:02:06.900> because<00:02:07.350> it's<00:02:07.590> reacting<00:02:08.160> with<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
that's because it's reacting with the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.940 
that's because it's reacting with the
water<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:09.240> separate<00:02:09.660> hydrogen<00:02:10.320> gas<00:02:10.530> out<00:02:10.920> of

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
water to separate hydrogen gas out of

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.310 
water to separate hydrogen gas out of
the<00:02:11.160> water<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.180> hydrogen<00:02:12.570> bubbles<00:02:13.080> make

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
the water and the hydrogen bubbles make

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.430 
the water and the hydrogen bubbles make
it<00:02:13.350> float<00:02:13.740> on<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.100> surface<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:15.420> does<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:16.110> by

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
it float on the surface it does this by

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.100 
it float on the surface it does this by
cut<00:02:16.740> becoming<00:02:17.250> ions<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.150> dissolving<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.080> the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
cut becoming ions and dissolving in the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.220 
cut becoming ions and dissolving in the
water<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:20.430> as<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.790> dissolves<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.630> sample<00:02:22.080> gets

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
water so as it dissolves the sample gets

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.860 
water so as it dissolves the sample gets
smaller<00:02:25.820> so<00:02:26.820> what<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.300> naturally

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
smaller so what is the naturally

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.070 
smaller so what is the naturally
occurring<00:02:27.900> form<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:29.070> sodium<00:02:29.280> metal<00:02:30.080> our

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
occurring form of sodium metal our

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.560 
occurring form of sodium metal our
balanced<00:02:31.620> chemical<00:02:31.920> equation<00:02:32.220> says<00:02:33.030> sodium

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
balanced chemical equation says sodium

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.680 
balanced chemical equation says sodium
metal<00:02:34.280> reacts<00:02:35.280> with<00:02:35.400> water<00:02:35.670> by<00:02:36.030> displacing

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
metal reacts with water by displacing

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.810 
metal reacts with water by displacing
hydrogen<00:02:37.680> from<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.920> water<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.610> making

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
hydrogen from the water and making

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.840 
hydrogen from the water and making
sodium<00:02:39.390> ions<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:39.900> hydroxide<00:02:40.350> ions<00:02:40.850> the

sodium ions and hydroxide ions the
naturally<00:02:42.420> occurring<00:02:42.450> form<00:02:43.350> is<00:02:43.590> sodium<00:02:44.040> ions

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
naturally occurring form is sodium ions

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.000 
naturally occurring form is sodium ions
not<00:02:46.170> sodium<00:02:47.040> metal
