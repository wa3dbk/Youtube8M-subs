00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.800
 we have I will not talk about drugs 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.869
 because they are there but we have a 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.070
 problem that worries me a lot that they are 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.070
 new technologies 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.019
 And besides, I already mentioned it and it would be 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.519
 Well I 'm saying that it's the same 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.010
 who have made mobiles for people 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.870
 very old and the old ones that with 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.090
 very large letters and with some functions 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.740
 very concrete because they do not do mobile 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.860
 for me 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:44.010
 appropriate to their ages 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.330
 because they do not warn the same thing 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.310
 that when you buy a package I was 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.470
 with Caesar the broken lung because no 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.740
 they make a warning from computers 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.960
 and the mobiles 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.880
 what leads to the misuse of mobile phones and 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.900
 of the internet and the responsibility that 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.900
 They can include minors 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.880

 what problem do we have two problems 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.000
 it's a drug that we already have kids that 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.590
 punishes them and we are detecting many 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.060
 drug addiction problems with the mobile phone and 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.850
 with internet 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.950
 the violence of my parents that are given 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.810
 account of excessive use consumption 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.220
 Excessive mobile and internet or 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.810
 they start to put the limit and the children 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.550
 they begin to have answers 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.020
 aggressive with parents 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.220
 this is a drug here you are the mobile 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.690
 or the internet hospital and that is what it gives to 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.750
 monkey that exist up syndrome 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.750
 abstinence 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.220
 who are not aware is an instrument 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.360
 typical for the commission of events 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.490
 criminal 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.660
 it is a crime against honor 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.660
 intimacy harassment 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.489
 fix the bad idea that they have 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.319
 of the right to privacy them 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.670
 consider minors who violate their 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.230
 intimacy when parents enter the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.610
 fourth and they start to register drawers 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.270
 they look at pockets and that's what 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.160
 they attempt against my privacy 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.020
 but nevertheless when they record a 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.790
 image and which they give by bluetooth or by 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.430
 internet from a partner of his that does not 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.079
 lose intimacy 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.459
 see how far the 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.590
 ignorance of what honor is and 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.569
 intimacy 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.200
 and it is a typical middle class crime 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.200
 and goes more
