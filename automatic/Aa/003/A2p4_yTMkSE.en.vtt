00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 execute all friends welcome to a 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.060
 new video today you will meet 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.170
 the 5 more supports open the league of 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.000
 legends number 5 a champion who can 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.160
 immobilize any enemy occupies 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.870
 this position they lionesses all the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.820
 skills that you already have are made 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.529
 to keep your enemy immobile so 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.210
 just hit to be able to reach your 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.070
 enemy to then hold him in that 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.320
 place while all of carry begins 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.970
 attack him if I think a champion that can 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.920
 resist a lot and is responsible for making it 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.850
 photos to some enemy I read in that champion 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.110
 that you must choose number 4 the mustache 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.790
 scale of the first positions 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.680
 thanks to the way he has to protect 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.480
 to your allies considering that 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.950
 we are at a goal where giants and 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.600
 tails with devourer combine in the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.610
 struggles but still fits perfect in those 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.469
 situations either to protect your 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.420
 team or their carry if any enemy 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.399
 they will fall or slow down their 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.930
 rivals to prevent it from escaping and 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.699
 thanks to your passive stun and 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.350
 leave them with no chance of surviving 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.000
 for motor not many benefits to your 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.770
 team is also not that difficult to 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.760
 use it so take it from support is 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.980
 a very good option 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.600
 number 3 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.300
 since its departure it has always been maintained 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.070
 in the tops the strange as I had already 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.720
 said before he is made to adapt 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.220
 to any situation as it may 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.900
 catch some enemy closes its 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.729
 hook save some ally by throwing him 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.830
 your lamp or slow down the enemy that 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.630
 he wants the important thing against her is 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.550
 know you can use your skills and 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.140
 especially to have aim since if 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.850
 hit your hook you can throw everything 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.500
 you like your rival and you give him the time 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.590
 necessary to all your team for avatars 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.510
 enemy if you know how to aim very well 3 this 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.120
 champion for you 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.190
 number 2 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.230
 no longer occupies position number 2 and 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.640
 should the current goal had jungles with 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.350
 devourer willing to kill the 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.180
 weak and with eyes great damage to 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.530
 eliminate whoever crosses you no longer 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.450
 will have the function of protecting your 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.340
 team at all times either giving them 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.290
 protecting the weak or pushing 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.270
 to his rivals with his ultimate and when 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.470
 everything turned in his favor using his tornado 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.540
 and it goes up double to prevent the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.160
 survivors escape the role that meets 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.760
 ya na is not so complex that's why you 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.210
 I recommend practicing with her 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.040
 number 1 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.360
 this champion has shown that he can 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.000
 to become one of the best supports 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.069
 since he came out in the nautilus ls s eles 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.050
 his skills allow him to attract a 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.910
 enemy and together with his passive stun 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.620
 a few moments besides that can 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.630
 resist a lot thanks to the shield that 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.160
 he gets with double ups for him he's very 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.630
 easy to start the team struggles already 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.060
 that you will only have to select who 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.170
 wants to throw them last in if you do not have 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.910
 he is a champion that gives him great 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.260
 benefits to all your team like the 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.550
 most support 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.470
 just that the form of initiation that 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.030
 has it is very impossible for it to fail 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.580
 this is why Nautilus occupies the 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.290
 position number one 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.000
 and before giving the farewell I wanted them 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.380
 comment on alpha draft which is 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.180
 another platform where this team creates 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.800
 with the pro player that you choose and so 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.690
 compete against others in that way 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.430
 you will win prizes and money is not necessary 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.350
 that you invest yours since you can 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.060
 compete for free weekly 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.830
 select your team and they will add 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.240
 points many subscribers have told me 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.010
 who have already managed to earn some dollars 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.360
 for free so if you know a lot 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.760
 about the children laws is your chance 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.900
 to make money easily the lic is the 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.050
 I leave in the description just in case 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.550
 they want to try their luck 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.380
 and good friends I hope you liked it 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.060
 this video remember that this top has 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.770
 been in my opinion and easily could 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.720
 enter other supports like trans bliss 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.950
