be<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.110> way<00:01:40.140> for<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> number<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.860> years<00:01:40.920> you've

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
be that way for a number of years you've

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.060 
be that way for a number of years you've
been<00:01:41.909> around<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.270> league<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.570> long<00:01:42.840> time<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
been around this league a long time the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.249 
been around this league a long time the
free<00:01:44.310> agency<00:01:44.790> period<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.420> everything<00:01:46.079> that

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
free agency period and everything that

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.319 
free agency period and everything that
happened<00:01:46.680> was<00:01:46.829> wild<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.640> year<00:01:47.909> tell<00:01:48.149> us<00:01:48.240> a

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
happened was wild this year tell us a

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.670 
happened was wild this year tell us a
little<00:01:48.450> bit<00:01:48.630> about<00:01:48.869> what<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.170> was<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.320> from

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
little bit about what it was like from

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.889 
little bit about what it was like from
your<00:01:49.950> seat<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.490> then<00:01:51.060> your<00:01:51.180> decision<00:01:51.659> to

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
your seat and then your decision to

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.920 
your seat and then your decision to
target<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.680> signed<00:01:53.040> JJ<00:01:53.369> Barea<00:01:53.790> well<00:01:54.570> because

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
target and signed JJ Barea well because

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.109 
target and signed JJ Barea well because
we<00:01:55.110> had<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.500> many<00:01:55.619> guaranteed<00:01:56.159> contracts<00:01:56.790> and

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
we had so many guaranteed contracts and

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.300 
we had so many guaranteed contracts and
especially<00:01:57.509> many<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.439> with<00:01:58.710> players<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.100> we

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
especially many of with players that we

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.160 
especially many of with players that we
wanted<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.790> have<00:02:00.060> here<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.540> didn't<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
wanted to have here we didn't have to

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.959 
wanted to have here we didn't have to
attack<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.649> free<00:02:01.860> agency<00:02:02.219> period<00:02:02.399> probably

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
attack this free agency period probably

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.130 
attack this free agency period probably
with<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.240> gust<00:02:03.540> oh<00:02:03.719> there's<00:02:03.930> some<00:02:04.049> other

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
with the gust oh there's some other

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.420 
with the gust oh there's some other
teams<00:02:04.409> did<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.770> really<00:02:04.979> had<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.100> rebuild

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
teams did that really had to rebuild

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.609 
teams did that really had to rebuild
their<00:02:05.610> roster<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.049> thought<00:02:07.320> we<00:02:07.469> had<00:02:07.500> a

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
their roster and so I thought we had a

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.650 
their roster and so I thought we had a
small<00:02:07.799> advantage<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.489> we<00:02:08.550> purposely<00:02:09.060> hope

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
small advantage that we purposely hope

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.449 
small advantage that we purposely hope
to<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:10.020> knowing<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.679> there<00:02:11.039> was<00:02:11.160> going<00:02:11.370> to

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
to have knowing that there was going to

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.080 
to have knowing that there was going to
likely<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.150> lockout

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
likely be a lockout

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.089 
likely be a lockout
so<00:02:13.599> we<00:02:13.750> were<00:02:13.900> able<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.319> make<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.500> very<00:02:14.739> specific

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
so we were able to make a very specific

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.970 
so we were able to make a very specific
targeted<00:02:15.879> list<00:02:16.060> four<00:02:16.870> or<00:02:16.959> five<00:02:17.110> names<00:02:17.440> you

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
targeted list four or five names you

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.030 
targeted list four or five names you
know<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.220> couple<00:02:18.489> of<00:02:18.670> bigs<00:02:18.879> smalls<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.040> tried

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
know a couple of bigs smalls and tried

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.380 
know a couple of bigs smalls and tried
to<00:02:21.099> figure<00:02:21.160> out<00:02:21.519> you<00:02:21.760> know<00:02:21.819> who<00:02:22.030> would<00:02:22.150> be<00:02:22.269> the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
to figure out you know who would be the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.570 
to figure out you know who would be the
best<00:02:22.540> fit<00:02:22.750> for<00:02:22.810> us<00:02:23.050> we<00:02:23.650> were<00:02:23.769> capable<00:02:24.040> perhaps

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
best fit for us we were capable perhaps

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.100 
best fit for us we were capable perhaps
of<00:02:24.819> getting<00:02:25.060> more<00:02:25.269> than<00:02:25.420> one<00:02:25.540> person<00:02:25.569> but

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
of getting more than one person but

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.910 
of getting more than one person but
probably<00:02:26.349> would've<00:02:26.560> had<00:02:26.709> to<00:02:26.800> do<00:02:26.890> a

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
probably would've had to do a

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.880 
probably would've had to do a
sign-and-trade<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:28.330> I<00:02:28.660> was<00:02:29.379> very<00:02:29.440> pleased

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
sign-and-trade so I was very pleased

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.740 
sign-and-trade so I was very pleased
with<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.220> addition<00:02:30.549> of<00:02:30.610> JJ<00:02:31.060> he<00:02:31.360> showed<00:02:31.599> in

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
with the addition of JJ he showed in

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.330 
with the addition of JJ he showed in
just<00:02:31.930> his<00:02:32.080> first<00:02:32.260> week<00:02:32.560> with<00:02:32.709> us<00:02:32.860> before<00:02:33.129> he

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
just his first week with us before he

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.789 
just his first week with us before he
got<00:02:33.459> hurt<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:34.420> he<00:02:34.510> could<00:02:34.660> be<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.810> really<00:02:35.349> big

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
got hurt that he could be a really big

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.339 
got hurt that he could be a really big
part<00:02:36.099> of<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.340> team<00:02:36.610> this<00:02:37.599> season<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.080> beyond

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
part of the team this season and beyond

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.680 
part of the team this season and beyond
and<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:39.250> think<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.549> it's<00:02:39.819> a<00:02:39.940> nice<00:02:40.120> fit<00:02:40.480> it

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
and I think that it's a nice fit it

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.229 
and I think that it's a nice fit it
added<00:02:41.200> depth<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.560> our<00:02:41.590> backcourt<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.459> most

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
added depth to our backcourt and most

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.910 
added depth to our backcourt and most
important<00:02:43.629> of<00:02:43.690> all<00:02:43.810> perhaps<00:02:44.110> it<00:02:44.470> added<00:02:44.739> some

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
important of all perhaps it added some

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.800 
important of all perhaps it added some
veteran<00:02:45.250> leadership<00:02:45.280> well<00:02:46.239> I<00:02:46.299> know<00:02:46.420> it's<00:02:46.630> just

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
veteran leadership well I know it's just

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.930 
veteran leadership well I know it's just
a<00:02:46.989> small<00:02:47.349> sample<00:02:47.829> size<00:02:48.010> two<00:02:48.310> preseason<00:02:48.730> games

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
a small sample size two preseason games

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.300 
a small sample size two preseason games
and<00:02:49.480> as<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.900> mentioned<00:02:50.049> JJ<00:02:50.650> not<00:02:50.829> playing<00:02:51.160> and

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
and as you mentioned JJ not playing and

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.979 
and as you mentioned JJ not playing and
one<00:02:51.430> of<00:02:51.549> them<00:02:51.670> Ricky<00:02:52.030> only<00:02:52.180> played<00:02:52.510> in<00:02:52.540> one<00:02:52.840> as

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
one of them Ricky only played in one as

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.960 
one of them Ricky only played in one as
well<00:02:53.140> do<00:02:53.709> you<00:02:53.799> like<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.190> way<00:02:54.310> this<00:02:54.459> teams<00:02:54.760> come

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
well do you like the way this teams come

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.520 
well do you like the way this teams come
together<00:02:55.120> in<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.569> short<00:02:55.840> training<00:02:56.110> camp<00:02:56.380> and

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
together in the short training camp and

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.890 
together in the short training camp and
what<00:02:56.680> you've<00:02:56.829> seen<00:02:57.099> especially<00:02:57.370> rallying<00:02:58.239> the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
what you've seen especially rallying the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.030 
what you've seen especially rallying the
way<00:02:59.019> they<00:02:59.140> did<00:02:59.290> in<00:02:59.410> their<00:02:59.500> final<00:02:59.860> preseason

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
way they did in their final preseason

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.949 
way they did in their final preseason
game<00:03:00.459> well<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.060> think<00:03:01.150> we've<00:03:01.450> had<00:03:01.569> terrific

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
game well I think we've had terrific

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.990 
game well I think we've had terrific
practices<00:03:02.860> that<00:03:03.280> have<00:03:03.370> been<00:03:03.519> very<00:03:03.730> focused

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
practices that have been very focused

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.030 
practices that have been very focused
coaches<00:03:04.900> have<00:03:05.019> been<00:03:05.049> very<00:03:05.319> demanding<00:03:05.590> of<00:03:05.860> what

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
coaches have been very demanding of what

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.350 
coaches have been very demanding of what
they<00:03:06.160> want<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.519> I<00:03:06.579> think<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.849> players<00:03:07.060> have

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
they want and I think the players have

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.850 
they want and I think the players have
responded<00:03:07.870> very<00:03:07.959> favorably<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.739> I

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
responded very favorably and I

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.160 
responded very favorably and I
especially<00:03:09.069> enjoyed<00:03:09.819> I<00:03:10.090> think<00:03:10.959> there's<00:03:11.110> a

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
especially enjoyed I think there's a

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.250 
especially enjoyed I think there's a
renewed<00:03:11.379> emphasis<00:03:12.190> on<00:03:12.340> defense<00:03:12.760> here

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
renewed emphasis on defense here

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.970 
renewed emphasis on defense here
organizationally<00:03:14.260> because<00:03:14.560> as<00:03:14.709> we<00:03:14.829> all<00:03:14.860> know

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
organizationally because as we all know

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.099 
organizationally because as we all know
that<00:03:15.519> was<00:03:16.120> such<00:03:16.269> a<00:03:16.299> problem<00:03:16.720> for<00:03:16.870> us<00:03:16.930> these

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
that was such a problem for us these

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.229 
that was such a problem for us these
last<00:03:17.380> two<00:03:17.560> years<00:03:17.769> so<00:03:18.519> i<00:03:18.549> think<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.850> practice

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
last two years so i think the practice

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.580 
last two years so i think the practice
have<00:03:19.389> been<00:03:19.510> terrific<00:03:19.690> i<00:03:20.019> wish<00:03:20.170> we<00:03:20.319> had<00:03:20.440> more

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590

of the you know the nature of the beast
is<00:03:24.400> here<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:25.299> would<00:03:25.450> have<00:03:25.540> been<00:03:25.600> better<00:03:25.660> to<00:03:26.019> you

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
for up for a number of reasons to minute

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.430 
for up for a number of reasons to minute
even<00:03:29.799> begin<00:03:30.549> to<00:03:30.639> enunciate<00:03:31.120> here<00:03:31.359> but<00:03:32.200> I<00:03:32.230> I

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
even begin to enunciate here but I I

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.349 
even begin to enunciate here but I I
think<00:03:33.010> that<00:03:33.220> you<00:03:33.549> know<00:03:33.639> it's<00:03:33.849> just<00:03:34.030> there's<00:03:34.299> a

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
think that you know it's just there's a

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.569 
think that you know it's just there's a
nice<00:03:34.569> feel<00:03:35.160> throughout<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.340> entire

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
nice feel throughout the entire

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.580 
nice feel throughout the entire
franchise<00:03:36.849> I<00:03:37.239> think<00:03:37.450> right<00:03:37.630> now<00:03:37.810> not<00:03:38.500> only

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
franchise I think right now not only

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.920 
franchise I think right now not only
about<00:03:38.829> this<00:03:39.160> season<00:03:39.400> but<00:03:39.670> I<00:03:39.760> think<00:03:40.000> people<00:03:40.630> can

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
about this season but I think people can

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.599 
about this season but I think people can
now<00:03:41.019> start<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.440> see<00:03:41.650> that<00:03:41.889> so<00:03:42.099> much<00:03:42.250> what<00:03:42.459> we've

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
now start to see that so much what we've

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:43.890 
now start to see that so much what we've
been<00:03:42.700> planning<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.419> last<00:03:43.569> couple<00:03:43.750> years

look for this team to improve the most I
hope<00:03:55.989> defensively<00:03:56.560> we've<00:03:57.430> been<00:03:57.630> frankly

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
hope defensively we've been frankly

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.629 
hope defensively we've been frankly
atrocious<00:03:59.169> defensively<00:03:59.799> the<00:04:00.069> last<00:04:00.250> couple<00:04:00.489> of

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
atrocious defensively the last couple of

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.569 
atrocious defensively the last couple of
years<00:04:00.700> and<00:04:01.150> I<00:04:01.720> think<00:04:02.079> that<00:04:02.410> yeah<00:04:03.099> we<00:04:03.250> had<00:04:03.370> two

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
years and I think that yeah we had two

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.490 
years and I think that yeah we had two
glaring<00:04:03.880> issues<00:04:04.359> last<00:04:04.540> year<00:04:04.720> and<00:04:05.049> i<00:04:05.109> would<00:04:05.349> put

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
glaring issues last year and i would put

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.580 
glaring issues last year and i would put
defense<00:04:05.980> one<00:04:06.370> in<00:04:06.669> and<00:04:06.910> then<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.590> the

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
defense one in and then the the

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.530 
defense one in and then the the
carelessness<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.489> casualness<00:04:10.030> with<00:04:10.359> the

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
carelessness the casualness with the

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.020 
carelessness the casualness with the
basketball<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.319> turnovers<00:04:11.859> the<00:04:12.099> silly

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
basketball the turnovers the silly

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.339 
basketball the turnovers the silly
turnovers<00:04:13.389> not<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.870> ones<00:04:14.049> that<00:04:14.200> were<00:04:14.290> even

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
turnovers not the ones that were even

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.520 
turnovers not the ones that were even
under<00:04:14.859> duress<00:04:14.889> and<00:04:15.489> so<00:04:16.120> if<00:04:16.359> we<00:04:16.510> can<00:04:16.690> manage<00:04:17.229> to

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
under duress and so if we can manage to

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.930 
under duress and so if we can manage to
get<00:04:17.680> better<00:04:17.859> than<00:04:18.039> just<00:04:18.220> simply<00:04:18.519> those<00:04:18.760> two

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
get better than just simply those two

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.219 
get better than just simply those two
areas<00:04:19.120> i<00:04:19.450> think<00:04:19.660> that<00:04:19.810> there's<00:04:19.989> enough

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
areas i think that there's enough

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.779 
areas i think that there's enough
scoring<00:04:20.590> on<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.889> team<00:04:21.099> production<00:04:21.640> on<00:04:21.700> the

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
scoring on the team production on the

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.790 
scoring on the team production on the
team<00:04:22.000> will<00:04:22.570> score<00:04:22.719> our<00:04:22.960> share<00:04:23.169> points<00:04:23.620> and<00:04:23.770> I

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
team will score our share points and I

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.100 
team will score our share points and I
think<00:04:24.039> that<00:04:24.159> Rick's<00:04:24.400> teams<00:04:24.729> have<00:04:25.599> always<00:04:25.930> been

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
think that Rick's teams have always been

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.710 
think that Rick's teams have always been
you<00:04:26.530> know

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
you know

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.410 
you know
potent<00:04:27.260> high<00:04:27.500> scoring<00:04:27.860> teams<00:04:28.220> so<00:04:29.030> we<00:04:29.240> can<00:04:29.330> get

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
potent high scoring teams so we can get

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.940 
potent high scoring teams so we can get
better<00:04:29.630> in<00:04:29.810> those<00:04:29.960> two<00:04:30.170> areas<00:04:30.200> in<00:04:30.650> that<00:04:30.770> order

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
better in those two areas in that order

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.130 
better in those two areas in that order
defense<00:04:31.460> in<00:04:31.730> turnovers<00:04:32.210> I<00:04:32.450> think<00:04:32.660> we'll<00:04:32.900> you

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
defense in turnovers I think we'll you

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.290 
defense in turnovers I think we'll you
know<00:04:33.680> have<00:04:33.980> a<00:04:34.010> lot<00:04:34.220> more<00:04:34.370> success<00:04:34.610> obviously

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
know have a lot more success obviously

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.640 
know have a lot more success obviously
than<00:04:35.450> we've<00:04:35.540> had<00:04:35.570> in<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.840> past<00:04:35.870> well

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650
