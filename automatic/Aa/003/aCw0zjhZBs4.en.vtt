animation used to perform a transition

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.769 
animation used to perform a transition
from<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.710> preview<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.520> program<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.180> can

show you one a real simple one here in

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.929 
show you one a real simple one here in
my<00:00:21.000> preview<00:00:21.420> side<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.460> soccer

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
my preview side and this is a soccer

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.359 
my preview side and this is a soccer
ball<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.359> flies<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.570> goes<00:00:25.320> full<00:00:25.619> screen<00:00:26.010> and

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
ball that flies in goes full screen and

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.959 
ball that flies in goes full screen and
then<00:00:26.760> flies<00:00:27.090> out<00:00:31.040> and<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.279> can<00:00:32.430> see<00:00:32.579> down<00:00:32.790> here

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
then flies out and you can see down here

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.700 
then flies out and you can see down here
in<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.120> lower<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.840> center<00:00:34.050> right<00:00:34.290> here<00:00:34.320> that

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
in the lower the center right here that

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.330 
in the lower the center right here that
is<00:00:34.920> 60<00:00:35.700> frames<00:00:36.000> long<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.530> two<00:00:37.829> second

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
is 60 frames long so it's a two second

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.430 
is 60 frames long so it's a two second
transition<00:00:38.969> 30<00:00:39.629> frames<00:00:39.960> per<00:00:40.170> second<00:00:41.719> now<00:00:42.719> I'll

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
transition 30 frames per second now I'll

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.819 
transition 30 frames per second now I'll
show<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.800> what<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.879> does<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.590> will<00:00:46.590> bring<00:00:46.739> up

show you what it does and will bring up

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.400 
show you what it does and will bring up
this<00:00:46.950> clip<00:00:47.250> here<00:00:47.760> now<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.570> hit<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:48.840> number

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
this clip here now if I hit this number

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.330 
this clip here now if I hit this number
for<00:00:49.739> overlay<00:00:50.219> you're<00:00:50.520> going<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.730> see<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> fly-in

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
for overlay you're going to see a fly-in

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.420 
for overlay you're going to see a fly-in
fly-out<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.789> then<00:00:54.030> perform<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> transition

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
fly-out and then perform the transition

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:04.460 
fly-out and then perform the transition
I'll<00:00:56.430> do<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.760> again<00:00:58.850> and<00:01:00.800> now<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.290> covers

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
I'll do it again and now so it covers

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.440 
I'll do it again and now so it covers
the<00:01:04.650> screen<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.430> can't<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the screen up so you can't see the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.130 
the screen up so you can't see the
transition<00:01:06.840> from<00:01:07.799> one<00:01:08.130> video<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.850> other

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
transition from one video to the other

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.670 
transition from one video to the other
and<00:01:11.180> just<00:01:12.180> set<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.600> up<00:01:12.840> I'm<00:01:13.229> going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> close

is checked once that's done click OK and
then<00:01:38.430> bring<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.850> sequence<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.110> now<00:01:40.200> I

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
then bring it to sequence in so now I

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.020 
then bring it to sequence in so now I
could<00:01:40.439> bring<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.650> up<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.729> scrub

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
could bring it up and I can scrub

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.480 
could bring it up and I can scrub
through<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:43.799> first<00:01:44.040> thing<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.220> do<00:01:44.340> online

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
through it the first thing you do online

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.090 
through it the first thing you do online
is<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.240> fourth<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.780> four<00:01:46.020> by<00:01:46.140> three<00:01:46.170> aspect

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
is to fourth it's a four by three aspect

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.149 
is to fourth it's a four by three aspect
ratio<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.420> I'm<00:01:48.869> going<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.320> double<00:01:49.770> click<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
ratio so I'm going to double click and

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.090 
ratio so I'm going to double click and
change<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.540> wide<00:01:51.899> screen

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
change it to a wide screen

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.260 
change it to a wide screen

operating<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.920> I'm<00:02:18.010> go<00:02:18.190> down<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.430> number<00:02:18.640> four

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
operating so I'm go down to number four

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.570 
operating so I'm go down to number four
and<00:02:19.870> what<00:02:20.590> should<00:02:20.680> be<00:02:20.890> aware<00:02:21.100> of<00:02:21.160> is<00:02:21.550> the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
and what should be aware of is the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.530 
and what should be aware of is the
duration<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.980> stinger<00:02:23.980> cut<00:02:24.280> point<00:02:24.670> the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
duration and the stinger cut point the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.570 
duration and the stinger cut point the
entire<00:02:25.840> duration<00:02:26.230> like<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.739> said<00:02:26.980> earlier<00:02:27.010> is

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
entire duration like I said earlier is

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.420 
entire duration like I said earlier is
two<00:02:27.940> seconds<00:02:28.540> 60<00:02:29.170> frames<00:02:29.530> two<00:02:29.860> seconds<00:02:30.340> in

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
two seconds 60 frames two seconds in

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.420 
two seconds 60 frames two seconds in
milliseconds<00:02:30.880> world<00:02:31.269> is<00:02:31.510> 2,000<00:02:32.350> so<00:02:32.980> i<00:02:33.010> type<00:02:33.250> in

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
milliseconds world is 2,000 so i type in

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.370 
milliseconds world is 2,000 so i type in
two<00:02:33.670> thousand<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:37.540> standard<00:02:37.870> goes<00:02:38.019> full

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
two thousand and the standard goes full

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.040 
two thousand and the standard goes full
screen<00:02:38.830> halfway<00:02:39.670> through<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.269> animation<00:02:40.780> so

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
screen halfway through the animation so

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.070 
screen halfway through the animation so
that's<00:02:41.260> once<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.890> one<00:02:42.069> second<00:02:42.459> point<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:43.750> then

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
that's once the one second point so then

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.590 
that's once the one second point so then
type<00:02:44.530> in<00:02:44.739> 1000<00:02:45.549> for<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.880> cut<00:02:46.120> point<00:02:48.299> now<00:02:49.299> for

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
type in 1000 for the cut point now for

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.720 
type in 1000 for the cut point now for
the<00:02:49.690> effect<00:02:49.989> duration<00:02:50.530> this<00:02:51.130> can<00:02:51.370> be<00:02:51.400> any

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
the effect duration this can be any

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.900 
the effect duration this can be any
number<00:02:51.819> from<00:02:52.420> one<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.049> two<00:02:53.590> thousand<00:02:54.190> just

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
number from one to two thousand just

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.460 
number from one to two thousand just
make<00:02:55.060> sure<00:02:55.209> it's<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.480> number<00:02:55.810> you<00:02:55.989> just<00:02:56.049> type<00:02:56.319> it

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
make sure it's a number you just type it

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.800 
make sure it's a number you just type it
in<00:02:56.530> one<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:56.890> you'll<00:02:56.980> be<00:02:57.069> fine<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.700> for<00:02:58.690> the

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
in one and you'll be fine and for the

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.600 
in one and you'll be fine and for the
effects<00:02:59.170> type<00:02:59.530> what's<00:02:59.980> it<00:03:00.070> going<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.250> do<00:03:00.400> so

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
effects type what's it going to do so

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.490 
effects type what's it going to do so
when<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.880> Stingers<00:03:01.209> thing<00:03:01.480> goes<00:03:01.720> full<00:03:02.049> screen

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
when the Stingers thing goes full screen

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.180 
when the Stingers thing goes full screen
what<00:03:05.670> transition<00:03:06.670> do<00:03:06.790> you<00:03:06.880> want<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.329> occur<00:03:07.690> in

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
what transition do you want to occur in

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.770 
what transition do you want to occur in
this<00:03:09.190> case<00:03:09.340> I<00:03:09.459> might<00:03:09.609> use<00:03:09.820> a<00:03:09.850> cut<00:03:10.209> since<00:03:10.660> you

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
this case I might use a cut since you

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.240 
this case I might use a cut since you
don't<00:03:10.840> really<00:03:11.140> see<00:03:11.380> anything<00:03:11.530> behind<00:03:11.769> it<00:03:12.100> it

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
don't really see anything behind it it

that's<00:03:36.930> about<00:03:37.110> it<00:03:37.260> for<00:03:37.410> this<00:03:37.800> little<00:03:38.010> tutorial

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
that's about it for this little tutorial

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.420 
that's about it for this little tutorial
