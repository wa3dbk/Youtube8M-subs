hopefully guys can see this it's going
to<00:02:20.690> pour<00:02:20.870> all<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.200> grain<00:02:21.700> into<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.940> big<00:02:23.450> bowl

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.750 

and<00:02:30.049> what<00:02:30.200> we're<00:02:30.349> going<00:02:30.379> to<00:02:30.530> do<00:02:30.680> is<00:02:30.799> put<00:02:31.640> this

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
and what we're going to do is put this

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.699 
and what we're going to do is put this
in<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.060> refrigerator<00:02:32.090> later<00:02:32.900> so<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.290> can<00:02:33.470> or

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
in the refrigerator later so it can or

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.199 
in the refrigerator later so it can or
after<00:02:33.980> we're<00:02:34.099> finished<00:02:34.129> here<00:02:34.519> so<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.090> can

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
after we're finished here so it can

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.399 
after we're finished here so it can
chill<00:02:35.480> for<00:02:35.659> a<00:02:35.690> while<00:02:35.750> because<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.110> grain<00:02:36.260> is

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
chill for a while because the grain is

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.890 
chill for a while because the grain is
still<00:02:36.620> kind<00:02:36.829> of<00:02:36.890> warm<00:02:37.400> from<00:02:37.849> cooking<00:02:38.239> add<00:02:38.390> the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.440 

and<00:02:54.260> then<00:02:54.500> we're<00:02:54.620> going<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.769> add<00:02:54.859> some<00:02:55.450> extra
