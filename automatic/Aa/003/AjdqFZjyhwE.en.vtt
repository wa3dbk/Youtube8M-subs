things were made TVs had fine tuning

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.910 
things were made TVs had fine tuning
adjustments<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:57.109> the<00:00:58.109> tolerances<00:00:58.680> weren't

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
adjustments so the tolerances weren't

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.349 
adjustments so the tolerances weren't
very<00:00:59.039> tight<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.609> these<00:00:59.820> could<00:01:00.030> be<00:01:00.149> out<00:01:00.329> of

very tight and these could be out of

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.090 
very tight and these could be out of
alignment<00:01:00.570> with<00:01:01.079> they<00:01:01.620> usually<00:01:01.829> have<00:01:02.070> a

channel three or four setting usually

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.990 
channel three or four setting usually
weren't<00:01:05.689> exact<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.990> those<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.740> your<00:01:08.400> TV<00:01:08.790> had<00:01:08.970> a

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.810 
weren't exact on those so your TV had a
fine<00:01:09.299> tuning<00:01:09.689> adjustment<00:01:10.200> where<00:01:10.400> if<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.670> was

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
fine tuning adjustment where if this was

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.190 
fine tuning adjustment where if this was
off<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> little<00:01:12.119> bit<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.479> could<00:01:12.600> find<00:01:12.869> tuner<00:01:13.049> on

off a little bit you could find tuner on
your<00:01:13.350> TV

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
your TV

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
age there's no fine tuning anymore

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.780 
age there's no fine tuning anymore
everything's<00:01:18.630> exact<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.890> what<00:01:20.100> we<00:01:20.250> need<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.610> do
