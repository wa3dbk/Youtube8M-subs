almost<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:31.349> has<00:00:31.529> some<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.859> similar

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
almost so this has some of the similar

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.850 
almost so this has some of the similar
sound<00:00:33.180> absorption<00:00:33.660> stuff<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.620> we've

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
sound absorption stuff going on we've

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.310 
sound absorption stuff going on we've
got<00:00:35.040> some<00:00:35.309> foam<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:36.000> all<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.630> paneling

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
got some foam on all of the paneling

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.310 
got some foam on all of the paneling
obviously<00:00:38.129> no<00:00:38.280> foam<00:00:38.520> where<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.820> window<00:00:39.090> is

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
obviously no foam where the window is

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.310 
obviously no foam where the window is
but<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.340> some<00:00:41.579> decent<00:00:42.329> thickness

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
but it is it is some decent thickness

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.810 
but it is it is some decent thickness
film<00:00:43.559> there<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.920> absorb<00:00:44.160> some<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.430> your<00:00:44.579> fan

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
film there to absorb some of your fan

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.630 
film there to absorb some of your fan
noise<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.469> and<00:00:46.469> then<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.860> terms<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.489> these

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
noise and and then in terms of these

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.130 
noise and and then in terms of these
other<00:00:47.850> panels<00:00:48.239> we've<00:00:48.360> got<00:00:48.510> some<00:00:48.690> back<00:00:48.840> here

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
other panels we've got some back here

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.619 
other panels we've got some back here
some<00:00:49.350> up<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.649> front<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.239> it<00:00:51.239> might<00:00:51.480> look

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
some up in the front and it might look

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.600 
some up in the front and it might look
like<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.530> cable<00:00:52.770> management<00:00:52.949> depth<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.579> a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
like the the cable management depth is a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.729 
like the the cable management depth is a
little<00:00:53.879> shallow<00:00:54.120> here<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.559> because

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
little shallow here but that is because

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.700 
little shallow here but that is because
as<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.579> will<00:00:56.699> see<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> b-roll<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:58.260> psu

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
as you will see in the b-roll the psu

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.709 
as you will see in the b-roll the psu
shroud<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.309> hiding<00:00:59.730> all<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.090> cabling<00:01:00.539> so

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
shroud here is hiding all the cabling so

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:01.880 
shroud here is hiding all the cabling so
you<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:00.930> actually<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.350> route<00:01:01.530> almost

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
you can actually just route almost

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.520 
you can actually just route almost
everything<00:01:02.309> through<00:01:02.940> there<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.719> one<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
everything through there and one of the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.469 
everything through there and one of the
cool<00:01:04.769> cale<00:01:05.489> management<00:01:05.970> features<00:01:06.270> is

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
cool cale management features is

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.710 
cool cale management features is
actually<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.159> GPU<00:01:08.159> cut<00:01:08.490> out<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.000> we've<00:01:09.510> got

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
actually this a GPU cut out so we've got

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.600 
actually this a GPU cut out so we've got
to<00:01:09.840> cut<00:01:09.990> out<00:01:10.110> right<00:01:10.290> here<00:01:10.530> where<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.890> cable

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
to cut out right here where the cable

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.830 
to cut out right here where the cable
can<00:01:11.760> come<00:01:11.939> up<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.210> go<00:01:12.360> straight<00:01:12.570> into<00:01:12.780> your

can come up and go straight into your

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.230 
can come up and go straight into your
GPU<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.799> don't<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.070> any<00:01:14.220> sneaking<00:01:14.700> going<00:01:15.119> on

interestingly you might have noticed a
lack<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.420> ugly<00:01:46.170> drive<00:01:46.409> scaffolding<00:01:47.130> first<00:01:48.000> of

lack of ugly drive scaffolding first of

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.520 
lack of ugly drive scaffolding first of
all<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.540> partly<00:01:48.810> goes<00:01:49.049> with<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> shroud

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
all that partly goes with the shroud

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.740 
all that partly goes with the shroud
right<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.159> making<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.090> little<00:01:51.570> bit

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
right it's it's making it a little bit

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.830 
right it's it's making it a little bit
more<00:01:51.899> appealing<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.560> look<00:01:52.680> at<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.329> inside<00:01:54.329> we

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
more appealing to look at and inside we

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.480 
more appealing to look at and inside we

in<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> front<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.740> sleek

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
