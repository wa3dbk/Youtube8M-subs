00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.750 

so<00:01:03.560> because<00:01:03.860> we're<00:01:03.980> using<00:01:04.159> two<00:01:04.460> different

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
so because we're using two different

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.950 
so because we're using two different
color<00:01:04.909> yarns<00:01:05.540> we're<00:01:05.900> just<00:01:06.110> going<00:01:06.409> to<00:01:06.650> pick<00:01:06.979> up

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
color yarns we're just going to pick up

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.690 
color yarns we're just going to pick up
one<00:01:08.960> color<00:01:09.290> of<00:01:09.440> each<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:10.430> we're<00:01:10.550> going<00:01:10.670> to

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
one color of each and we're going to

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:19.719 
one color of each and we're going to
line<00:01:10.970> them<00:01:11.120> up<00:01:11.240> in<00:01:11.420> our<00:01:11.540> hand<00:01:18.310> so<00:01:19.310> we<00:01:19.460> get<00:01:19.610> the

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
line them up in our hand so we get the

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.370 
line them up in our hand so we get the
colors<00:01:20.030> evenly<00:01:20.510> distributed<00:01:21.110> through<00:01:21.260> this

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
colors evenly distributed through this

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:42.630 
colors evenly distributed through this
tassel

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.550 

so<00:01:43.640> once<00:01:43.789> we<00:01:43.939> have<00:01:44.090> our<00:01:44.270> colors<00:01:44.750> distributed

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
so once we have our colors distributed

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.149 
so once we have our colors distributed
evenly<00:01:45.979> we're<00:01:46.820> going<00:01:46.939> to<00:01:47.000> take<00:01:47.329> our<00:01:48.159> finishing

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
evenly we're going to take our finishing

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.039 
evenly we're going to take our finishing
yarn<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.880> we're<00:01:50.450> going<00:01:50.600> to<00:01:52.090> fold<00:01:53.090> our<00:01:53.420> tassels

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
yarn and we're going to fold our tassels

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:01.840 
yarn and we're going to fold our tassels
in<00:01:54.289> half<00:01:56.020> over<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:58.759> finishing<00:01:59.240> yarn<00:02:00.850> then

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
in half over the finishing yarn then

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.130 
in half over the finishing yarn then
we're<00:02:01.969> going<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:02.149> take<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:02.689> and<00:02:02.959> we're<00:02:03.049> going

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
we're going to take that and we're going

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:12.040 
we're going to take that and we're going
to<00:02:03.229> tie<00:02:03.530> a<00:02:03.860> knot

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.300 

so<00:02:12.770> that<00:02:12.950> we<00:02:13.040> have<00:02:14.380> two<00:02:15.380> bundles<00:02:15.800> on<00:02:16.040> either

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
so that we have two bundles on either

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.960 
so that we have two bundles on either
side<00:02:18.280> you're<00:02:19.280> going<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.430> take<00:02:19.580> one<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.760> the

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
making sure that it is studying how you

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.360 
making sure that it is studying how you

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.339 

and<00:02:55.459> then<00:02:56.060> you're<00:02:56.239> just<00:02:56.269> going<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.870> finish<00:02:57.080> it

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349
