whole idea of claiming a boot to be more

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.530 
whole idea of claiming a boot to be more

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
powerful but I'm going to call it it's

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.370 
powerful but I'm going to call it it's
more<00:02:38.690> technological<00:02:39.440> line<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.800> that<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.490> uses

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
more technological line and that it uses

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.020 
more technological line and that it uses
some<00:02:42.670> newly<00:02:43.670> tech<00:02:43.910> new<00:02:44.120> technology<00:02:44.810> that<00:02:46.030> are

supposed to provide benefits when
striking<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.910> ball<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:52.360> I'll<00:02:53.360> talk<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.600> little

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
striking the ball and I'll talk a little

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.810 
striking the ball and I'll talk a little
bit<00:02:53.989> about<00:02:54.020> it<00:02:54.290> this<00:02:54.800> pad<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:55.370> see<00:02:55.489> here<00:02:55.700> is<00:02:55.790> a

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
bit about it this pad you see here is a

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.400 
bit about it this pad you see here is a
new<00:02:55.910> cut<00:02:56.239> it's<00:02:56.390> called<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.720> mookaite<00:02:57.050> impact

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
new cut it's called the mookaite impact

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.440 
new cut it's called the mookaite impact
panel<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:58.459> it's<00:02:58.580> basically<00:02:58.880> a<00:02:59.000> very<00:02:59.030> soft

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
panel and it's basically a very soft

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.110 
panel and it's basically a very soft
abrasive<00:03:00.020> rubber<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.560> if<00:03:01.190> struck<00:03:01.520> struck

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
abrasive rubber and if struck struck

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.990 
abrasive rubber and if struck struck
properly<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:02.900> got<00:03:03.530> a<00:03:03.560> free<00:03:03.830> kick<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.790> ball

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
properly I got a free kick the ball

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.550 
properly I got a free kick the ball
won't<00:03:05.120> spin<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.660> it<00:03:05.750> will<00:03:05.870> create<00:03:06.050> some<00:03:06.170> kind

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
won't spin and it will create some kind

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.130 
won't spin and it will create some kind
of<00:03:06.590> like<00:03:06.770> a<00:03:06.800> dipping<00:03:07.250> effect<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:07.850> thing<00:03:08.150> it's

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
of like a dipping effect and thing it's

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.270 
of like a dipping effect and thing it's
really<00:03:09.260> cool<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:09.860> then<00:03:10.010> these<00:03:10.190> uh<00:03:12.010> these<00:03:13.010> bio

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
really cool and then these uh these bio

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.490 
really cool and then these uh these bio
panels<00:03:13.820> are<00:03:14.000> called<00:03:14.209> Mizuno<00:03:14.600> calls<00:03:14.840> them<00:03:15.020> it's

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
panels are called Mizuno calls them it's

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.170 
panels are called Mizuno calls them it's
a<00:03:15.530> very<00:03:15.739> hard<00:03:16.100> rubber<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:16.640> it<00:03:16.730> almost<00:03:16.940> gives

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
a very hard rubber and it almost gives

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.320 
a very hard rubber and it almost gives
the<00:03:17.420> shoe<00:03:18.170> is<00:03:18.290> on<00:03:18.410> rigidity<00:03:18.980> like<00:03:19.209> almost<00:03:20.209> like

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
the shoe is on rigidity like almost like

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.870 
the shoe is on rigidity like almost like
a<00:03:20.390> shoe<00:03:20.570> has<00:03:20.720> its<00:03:20.900> own<00:03:20.959> skeleton<00:03:21.610> so<00:03:22.610> it<00:03:22.700> makes

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
a shoe has its own skeleton so it makes

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.759 
a shoe has its own skeleton so it makes
for<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.269> shoe<00:03:23.450> feels<00:03:23.720> really<00:03:24.170> almost<00:03:24.560> robotic

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
for the shoe feels really almost robotic

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.390 
for the shoe feels really almost robotic
and<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.940> comfort<00:03:26.269> level<00:03:26.360> is<00:03:26.630> just<00:03:26.870> fantastic

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
and the comfort level is just fantastic

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.840 
and the comfort level is just fantastic
ton<00:03:29.269> of<00:03:29.299> detail<00:03:29.720> goes<00:03:29.959> into<00:03:30.200> this<00:03:30.350> shoe<00:03:30.560> you

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
ton of detail goes into this shoe you

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.340 
ton of detail goes into this shoe you
can<00:03:31.850> see<00:03:32.030> there's<00:03:32.239> several<00:03:32.510> layers<00:03:32.840> in<00:03:33.230> this

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
can see there's several layers in this

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.130 
can see there's several layers in this
soleplate<00:03:33.769> one<00:03:34.730> being<00:03:35.330> carbon-fiber<00:03:35.959> I

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
soleplate one being carbon-fiber I

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.530 
soleplate one being carbon-fiber I
believe<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:37.010> it's<00:03:37.549> just<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.910> super

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
believe and it's just a super

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.699 
believe and it's just a super
comfortable<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.140> it's<00:03:39.230> just<00:03:39.350> it's<00:03:39.590> an

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
comfortable and it's just it's an

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.670 
comfortable and it's just it's an
awesome<00:03:39.920> soccer<00:03:40.730> shoe<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.900> then<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.380> newest

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
awesome soccer shoe and then the newest

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.110 
awesome soccer shoe and then the newest
one<00:03:42.830> I<00:03:42.860> probably<00:03:43.280> only<00:03:43.400> got<00:03:43.549> about<00:03:43.730> five<00:03:43.910> hours

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
one I probably only got about five hours

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.479 
one I probably only got about five hours
on<00:03:44.420> this<00:03:44.540> boot<00:03:44.799> but<00:03:45.799> I<00:03:45.830> think<00:03:46.070> I<00:03:46.130> know<00:03:46.190> enough

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
on this boot but I think I know enough

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.430 
on this boot but I think I know enough
about<00:03:46.580> it<00:03:46.790> to<00:03:46.940> talk<00:03:47.750> about<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:48.019> a<00:03:48.110> little<00:03:48.260> bit

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
about it to talk about it a little bit

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.570 
about it to talk about it a little bit
this<00:03:49.370> is<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.610> mesial<00:03:50.030> supersonic<00:03:50.540> wave<00:03:50.720> -

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
this is the mesial supersonic wave -

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.840 
this is the mesial supersonic wave -
basically<00:03:52.580> the<00:03:52.850> idea<00:03:53.209> when<00:03:53.810> Musial<00:03:54.260> claims<00:03:54.850> to

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
basically the idea when Musial claims to

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.910 
basically the idea when Musial claims to
be<00:03:56.049> technologically<00:03:57.049> advanced<00:03:57.410> in<00:03:57.590> this<00:03:57.739> shoe

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
be technologically advanced in this shoe

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:05.620 
be technologically advanced in this shoe
is<00:03:59.049> the<00:04:02.890> memory<00:04:03.890> foam<00:04:03.950> inserts<00:04:04.730> in<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.269> upper

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
is the memory foam inserts in the upper

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.580 
is the memory foam inserts in the upper
and<00:04:06.070> so<00:04:07.070> I<00:04:07.100> guess<00:04:07.340> you<00:04:07.489> can<00:04:07.640> compare<00:04:07.940> this<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.239> a

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
and so I guess you can compare this to a

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.020 
and so I guess you can compare this to a
ctr360<00:04:09.590> once<00:04:10.400> you'll<00:04:10.489> probably<00:04:10.610> do<00:04:10.850> in<00:04:10.970> the

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
ctr360 once you'll probably do in the

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.180 
ctr360 once you'll probably do in the
future<00:04:11.209> but<00:04:11.810> basically<00:04:12.320> what<00:04:12.500> happened<00:04:12.860> what

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
future but basically what happened what

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.000 
future but basically what happened what
they<00:04:13.310> did<00:04:13.489> is<00:04:13.730> they<00:04:13.970> put<00:04:14.530> memory<00:04:15.530> foam<00:04:15.680> you

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
they did is they put memory foam you

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.250 
they did is they put memory foam you
can't<00:04:16.220> see<00:04:16.459> it<00:04:16.579> but<00:04:16.700> you<00:04:16.790> can<00:04:16.820> feel<00:04:17.299> it<00:04:17.329> there

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
can't see it but you can feel it there

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.199 
can't see it but you can feel it there
is<00:04:18.410> on<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:19.130> outside<00:04:19.519> of<00:04:19.609> the<00:04:19.669> boot<00:04:19.850> see<00:04:20.090> the

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
is on the outside of the boot see the

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.690 
is on the outside of the boot see the
stitching<00:04:20.630> line<00:04:20.660> right<00:04:20.989> here<00:04:21.169> that<00:04:21.520> flows<00:04:22.520> all

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
stitching line right here that flows all

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.690 
stitching line right here that flows all
the<00:04:23.150> way<00:04:23.270> there<00:04:24.039> basically<00:04:25.039> this<00:04:25.250> part<00:04:25.520> of<00:04:25.640> the

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
the way there basically this part of the

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.930 
the way there basically this part of the
boot<00:04:25.820> section<00:04:26.210> of<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.390> boot

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
boot section of the boot

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.430 
boot section of the boot
has<00:04:27.360> very<00:04:27.660> thin<00:04:28.020> layer<00:04:28.290> of<00:04:28.320> micro<00:04:29.090> Sariah

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
has very thin layer of micro Sariah

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.590 
has very thin layer of micro Sariah
memory<00:04:31.440> foam<00:04:32.000> underneath<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.240> kangaroo

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
memory foam underneath the kangaroo

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.050 
memory foam underneath the kangaroo
leather<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:34.560> you<00:04:34.860> can<00:04:34.980> feel<00:04:35.160> it<00:04:35.190> ever<00:04:35.790> so

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
leather and you can feel it ever so

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.920 
leather and you can feel it ever so
slightly<00:04:36.090> it's<00:04:36.600> very<00:04:36.810> thin<00:04:37.110> and<00:04:37.800> then<00:04:37.980> here<00:04:38.400> a

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
slightly it's very thin and then here a

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.570 
slightly it's very thin and then here a
very<00:04:39.930> similar<00:04:40.260> stitching<00:04:40.770> pattern<00:04:40.920> to<00:04:41.370> the

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
very similar stitching pattern to the

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.150 
very similar stitching pattern to the
Meuse<00:04:42.270> no<00:04:42.420> Morelia<00:04:42.870> but<00:04:43.620> there's<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:43.890> slightly

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
Meuse no Morelia but there's a slightly

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.020 
Meuse no Morelia but there's a slightly
thicker<00:04:44.550> memory<00:04:45.330> foam<00:04:45.540> inserts<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:46.430> this<00:04:47.430> on

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
thicker memory foam inserts and this on

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.450 
thicker memory foam inserts and this on
the<00:04:48.660> instep<00:04:49.020> of<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:49.200> boot<00:04:49.380> so<00:04:50.190> basically

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
the instep of the boot so basically

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.130 
the instep of the boot so basically
they're<00:04:50.700> claiming<00:04:50.880> that<00:04:51.120> this<00:04:51.570> improves<00:04:52.020> your

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
they're claiming that this improves your

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.590 
they're claiming that this improves your
dribbling<00:04:52.560> I'm<00:04:53.490> not<00:04:53.760> something<00:04:54.120> that's<00:04:54.270> us

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
dribbling I'm not something that's us

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.440 
dribbling I'm not something that's us
such<00:04:55.200> a<00:04:55.230> believer<00:04:55.710> on<00:04:55.920> that<00:04:56.130> but<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.060> boot<00:04:57.240> is

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
such a believer on that but the boot is

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.170 
such a believer on that but the boot is
really<00:04:57.480> nice<00:04:57.990> super<00:04:58.500> high<00:04:58.650> quality<00:04:59.180> that

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
really nice super high quality that

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.990 
really nice super high quality that
another<00:05:00.390> unique<00:05:00.690> thing<00:05:00.750> about<00:05:01.170> this<00:05:01.350> boot<00:05:01.560> is

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
another unique thing about this boot is

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.780 
another unique thing about this boot is
the<00:05:03.000> stud<00:05:03.210> pattern<00:05:03.390> soleplate<00:05:04.670> basically<00:05:05.670> you

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
the stud pattern soleplate basically you

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.680 
the stud pattern soleplate basically you
get<00:05:06.030> kind<00:05:07.020> of<00:05:07.110> this<00:05:07.320> very<00:05:07.410> hybrid<00:05:08.690> conical

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
get kind of this very hybrid conical

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.250 
get kind of this very hybrid conical
bladed<00:05:10.470> stutter<00:05:11.010> and<00:05:11.450> I<00:05:12.450> don't<00:05:12.900> think<00:05:13.050> I've

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
bladed stutter and I don't think I've

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.600 
bladed stutter and I don't think I've
used<00:05:13.470> it<00:05:13.590> enough<00:05:13.680> to<00:05:13.860> make<00:05:14.010> a<00:05:14.040> fair<00:05:14.580> judgment

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
used it enough to make a fair judgment

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.030 
used it enough to make a fair judgment
but<00:05:15.600> overall<00:05:16.140> from<00:05:16.290> what<00:05:16.440> I<00:05:16.470> view<00:05:16.560> so<00:05:16.800> far<00:05:17.010> I

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
but overall from what I view so far I

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.320 
but overall from what I view so far I
really<00:05:17.370> like<00:05:17.640> it<00:05:18.410> works<00:05:19.410> really<00:05:19.680> well<00:05:19.980> and

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
really like it works really well and

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.750 
really like it works really well and
really<00:05:21.560> have<00:05:22.560> nothing<00:05:22.830> bad<00:05:22.980> to<00:05:23.040> say<00:05:23.220> about<00:05:23.520> any

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
really have nothing bad to say about any

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.190 
really have nothing bad to say about any
