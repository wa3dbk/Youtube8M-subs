a here's the HD PVR that I record most
of<00:00:58.410> my<00:00:58.500> game<00:00:58.680> play<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.510> the<00:01:00.510> inputs<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
front I'm not really sure they do i've

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.979 
front I'm not really sure they do i've
never<00:01:02.489> really<00:01:02.640> used<00:01:02.850> them<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.719> here's<00:01:03.899> where

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
never really used them but here's where

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.359 
never really used them but here's where
it<00:01:04.110> gets<00:01:04.140> complicated<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.949> see<00:01:05.129> all<00:01:05.250> these

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
it gets complicated you see all these

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.230 
it gets complicated you see all these
massive<00:01:05.939> strings<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.780> cord<00:01:07.110> along<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.530> back

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
massive strings of cord along the back

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.810 
massive strings of cord along the back
this<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.450> how<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:10.619> connect<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.250> htp<00:01:11.610> are

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
this is how you connect the htp are

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.609 
this is how you connect the htp are
essentially<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.659> plug<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.110> component

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
essentially you plug the component

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.830 
essentially you plug the component
cables<00:01:13.979> into<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.970> back<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.360> television

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
cables into the back of the television

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.570 
cables into the back of the television
go<00:01:16.710> ahead<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:16.920> show<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.100> really<00:01:17.310> quick

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
go ahead and show you that really quick

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.890 
go ahead and show you that really quick
you<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.150> components<00:01:18.630> right<00:01:18.780> back

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
you can see the components right back

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.710 
you can see the components right back
here<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:20.400> component<00:01:20.850> cables<00:01:21.210> then<00:01:21.390> flow

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
here and the component cables then flow

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.649 
here and the component cables then flow
to<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.140> back<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.759> HD<00:01:23.759> PVR<00:01:23.790> right<00:01:24.270> here<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
to the back of the HD PVR right here and

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.859 
to the back of the HD PVR right here and
then<00:01:25.970> there<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.150> separate<00:01:27.600> set<00:01:27.840> of

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
then there is a separate set of

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.399 
then there is a separate set of
component<00:01:28.470> cables<00:01:28.799> along<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> back<00:01:29.759> side<00:01:29.790> and

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
component cables along the back side and

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.640 
component cables along the back side and
that<00:01:31.409> flow<00:01:32.180> somewhere<00:01:33.380> normally<00:01:34.380> they<00:01:34.500> would

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
that flow somewhere normally they would

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.380 
that flow somewhere normally they would
flow<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> converter<00:01:36.150> right

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
flow to this this is a converter right

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.870 
flow to this this is a converter right
here<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.750> then<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> converter<00:01:37.829> would<00:01:38.579> flow

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
here and then the converter would flow

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.700 
here and then the converter would flow
to<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.240> other<00:01:39.360> side<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> hdmi<00:01:40.140> input

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
to the other side with the hdmi input

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.710 
to the other side with the hdmi input
and<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.340> hdmi<00:01:41.880> input<00:01:42.150> would<00:01:42.240> allow<00:01:42.420> me<00:01:42.450> to

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
and the hdmi input would allow me to

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.499 
and the hdmi input would allow me to
play<00:01:42.869> hdmi<00:01:43.619> quality<00:01:44.159> games<00:01:44.369> all<00:01:44.850> recording

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
play hdmi quality games all recording

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.240 
play hdmi quality games all recording
with<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.659> component<00:01:46.140> cables<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.979> then<00:01:47.130> you'd

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
with the component cables so then you'd

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.670 
with the component cables so then you'd
have<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.549> hdmi<00:01:48.000> cord<00:01:48.420> right<00:01:48.570> here<00:01:48.630> flow<00:01:49.619> to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
have the hdmi cord right here flow to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.219 
have the hdmi cord right here flow to
the<00:01:49.829> back<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.189> your<00:01:50.250> television<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:51.229> that's

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
the back of your television and that's

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.020 
the back of your television and that's
how<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.380> would<00:01:52.530> play<00:01:52.890> an<00:01:52.979> hdmi<00:01:53.430> quality<00:01:53.850> while

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
how you would play an hdmi quality while

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.420 
how you would play an hdmi quality while
recording<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.720> only<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:54.960> think<00:01:55.500> 480p<00:01:56.009> or<00:01:56.280> maybe

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
recording and only I think 480p or maybe

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.760 
recording and only I think 480p or maybe
720p<00:01:57.119> quality<00:01:58.049> on<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.439> on<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.860> Xbox<00:01:59.670> I

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
720p quality on the on the Xbox I

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.679 
720p quality on the on the Xbox I
haven't<00:02:01.770> hooked<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.130> up<00:02:02.280> yet<00:02:02.549> i<00:02:02.759> paid<00:02:03.479> eighty

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
haven't hooked this up yet i paid eighty

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.600 
haven't hooked this up yet i paid eighty
dollars<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.619> when<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:04.770> got<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.340> turned

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
dollars for and when I got it it turned

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.999 
dollars for and when I got it it turned
out<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.299> was<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.780> power<00:02:07.409> source<00:02:07.829> and

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
out that that was the power source and

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.520 
out that that was the power source and
that's<00:02:08.220> British<00:02:08.640> power<00:02:08.970> sources<00:02:09.360> i<00:02:09.629> guess<00:02:09.840> so

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
that's British power sources i guess so

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.110 
that's British power sources i guess so
it<00:02:10.770> didn't<00:02:10.979> work<00:02:11.099> for<00:02:11.129> me<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.550> i<00:02:12.000> was

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
it didn't work for me and i was

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.550 
it didn't work for me and i was
wondering<00:02:12.270> why<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.569> took<00:02:12.720> three<00:02:13.050> years<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.349> get

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
wondering why it took three years to get

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.240 
wondering why it took three years to get
a<00:02:13.620> thing<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.010> mail

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
a thing in the mail

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
a thing in the mail
because<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.550> was<00:02:14.640> stripping<00:02:14.880> from<00:02:15.120> Great

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
because it was stripping from Great

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.540 
because it was stripping from Great
Britain<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.570> guess<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:16.500> um<00:02:16.740> that<00:02:17.130> was<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.310> fail

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
Britain I guess so um that was a fail

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.100 
Britain I guess so um that was a fail
and<00:02:17.820> I<00:02:18.300> have<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.510> go<00:02:18.570> out<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.750> spend<00:02:18.900> another

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
and I have to go out and spend another

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.260 
and I have to go out and spend another
30<00:02:19.380> on<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> power<00:02:19.860> converter<00:02:20.130> so<00:02:20.970> that's<00:02:21.090> always

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
30 on a power converter so that's always

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.720 
30 on a power converter so that's always
fun<00:02:21.570> over<00:02:22.200> here<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:23.160> computer<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.700> I

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
fun over here is the computer that I

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.820 
fun over here is the computer that I
used<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.150> render<00:02:24.450> all<00:02:24.660> my<00:02:24.750> videos<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.740> the

used to render all my videos to the
setup<00:02:26.100> videos<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.060> mic<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.720> snowball

audio<00:02:34.820> this<00:02:35.820> is<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.090> computer<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:36.959> can't

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
audio this is the computer I can't

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.600 
audio this is the computer I can't
really<00:02:37.470> give<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.800> specs<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.280> think<00:02:38.490> it's

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
really give you the specs I think it's

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.110 
really give you the specs I think it's
about<00:02:38.850> 200<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.980> no<00:02:40.980> 500<00:02:41.550> here<00:02:41.730> let's<00:02:42.030> check

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
about 200 and no 500 here let's check

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.050 
about 200 and no 500 here let's check
really<00:02:42.450> quick<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.980> think<00:02:43.980> it's<00:02:44.100> 500<00:02:44.610> terabytes

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
really quick I think it's 500 terabytes

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.370 
really quick I think it's 500 terabytes
of<00:02:45.330> Orcs<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.350> not<00:02:46.620> five<00:02:46.770> terabytes<00:02:47.100> 500m<00:02:48.380> 500

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
of Orcs and not five terabytes 500m 500

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.180 
of Orcs and not five terabytes 500m 500
gigabytes<00:02:49.770> oh<00:02:50.070> let's<00:02:50.670> see<00:02:51.350> note<00:02:52.350> 285

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
gigabytes oh let's see note 285

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.949 
gigabytes oh let's see note 285
gigabytes<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.300> looks<00:02:54.450> like<00:02:54.510> two

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
gigabytes and it looks like two

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.680 
gigabytes and it looks like two
gigabytes<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.800> memory<00:02:56.070> so<00:02:57.000> that's<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.600> little

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
gigabytes of memory so that's a little

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.060 
gigabytes of memory so that's a little
bit<00:02:57.870> about<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.140> computer<00:02:58.410> it's<00:02:58.800> not<00:02:58.950> very

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
bit about the computer it's not very

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.430 
bit about the computer it's not very
fast<00:02:59.370> it's<00:02:59.760> actually<00:02:59.910> three<00:03:00.330> years<00:03:00.540> old<00:03:00.750> so

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
fast it's actually three years old so

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.110 
fast it's actually three years old so
you<00:03:02.100> know<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.220> don't<00:03:02.489> have<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.730> money<00:03:02.760> to

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
you know I don't have the money to

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.690 
you know I don't have the money to
upgrade<00:03:03.450> every<00:03:03.900> single<00:03:04.230> year<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:04.950> uh<00:03:04.980> I'm

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
upgrade every single year so uh I'm

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.580 
upgrade every single year so uh I'm
putting<00:03:06.150> my<00:03:06.239> money<00:03:06.390> this<00:03:06.690> year<00:03:06.750> toward<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.350> car

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
putting my money this year toward a car

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.500 
putting my money this year toward a car
maybe<00:03:08.340> next<00:03:08.670> year<00:03:08.820> I'm<00:03:08.970> going<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.180> get<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.390> new

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
maybe next year I'm going to get the new

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.040 
maybe next year I'm going to get the new
computer<00:03:09.930> we<00:03:10.140> shall<00:03:10.380> see<00:03:11.300> I<00:03:12.300> think<00:03:12.959> that's

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
computer we shall see I think that's

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.840 
computer we shall see I think that's
basically<00:03:13.440> everything<00:03:13.890> if<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.550> have<00:03:14.670> any
