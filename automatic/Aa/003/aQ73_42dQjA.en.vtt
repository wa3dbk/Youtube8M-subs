okay<00:00:00.630> so<00:00:00.690> here<00:00:01.530> is<00:00:01.709> our<00:00:01.829> ICT<00:00:02.370> system<00:00:02.970> on<00:00:03.149> scale

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
okay so here is our ICT system on scale

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.630 
okay so here is our ICT system on scale

timing<00:00:06.120> model<00:00:07.460> okay<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:08.790> this<00:00:08.910> should<00:00:09.120> be

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
timing model okay and this should be

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.209 
timing model okay and this should be
familiar<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.660> you<00:00:09.870> by<00:00:10.019> now<00:00:10.050> so<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.710> top<00:00:10.950> we

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
familiar to you by now so the top we

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.220 
familiar to you by now so the top we
have<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.519> absolute<00:00:11.820> server<00:00:12.059> flop<00:00:12.330> itself<00:00:12.750> so

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
have the absolute server flop itself so

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.490 
have the absolute server flop itself so
pacemaker<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.490> using<00:00:14.790> pulses<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.599> switch<00:00:16.230> which

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
pacemaker is using pulses a switch which

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.710 
pacemaker is using pulses a switch which
gates<00:00:16.770> them<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.640> accumulator<00:00:18.210> which<00:00:18.420> stores

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
gates them and accumulator which stores

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.170 
gates them and accumulator which stores
them<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.710> then<00:00:19.859> if<00:00:20.130> it's<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.400> standard

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
them and then if it's the standard

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.540 
them and then if it's the standard
duration<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:22.230> assumed<00:00:22.560> stored<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.130> long<00:00:23.310> term

duration we assumed stored in long term

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
duration we assumed stored in long term
memory<00:00:23.670> because<00:00:24.180> they're<00:00:24.300> gonna<00:00:24.420> have<00:00:24.539> to

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570

remember<00:00:25.230> over<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.769> series<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.640> several

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
remember over the series of several

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.570 
remember over the series of several
trials<00:00:27.439> their<00:00:28.439> short<00:00:28.769> term<00:00:28.830> memory<00:00:29.310> store

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
trials their short term memory store

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.089 
trials their short term memory store
where<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.599> comparison<00:00:31.019> duration<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.830> stored

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
where the comparison duration is stored

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.910 
where the comparison duration is stored
and<00:00:32.910> then<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:33.780> have<00:00:33.870> over<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> same<00:00:34.320> process

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
and then we have over the same process

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.100 
and then we have over the same process
that<00:00:34.950> compares<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:36.000> comparison<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
experimental block and the decision

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.240 
experimental block and the decision
process<00:00:44.879> makes<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.539> comparison<00:00:46.469> between<00:00:46.800> these

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
process makes a comparison between these

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.279 
process makes a comparison between these
two<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.450> if<00:00:48.629> they're<00:00:49.190> super<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.460> similar<00:00:51.289> then

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
two and if they're super is similar then

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.500 
two and if they're super is similar then
they<00:00:53.010> similar<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.550> each<00:00:53.640> other<00:00:53.789> similar<00:00:54.270> to

they similar to each other similar to
each<00:00:54.600> other<00:00:54.719> enough<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.739> will<00:00:55.860> say<00:00:56.010> yes<00:00:56.250> that

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
each other enough it will say yes that

will standard if they're different from
each<00:00:58.949> other<00:00:59.100> then<00:00:59.370> they'll<00:00:59.550> say<00:00:59.760> no<00:01:00.420> that

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
each other then they'll say no that

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.590

wasn't<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.989> standard<00:01:01.199> okay<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.570> should

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
wasn't the standard okay so you should

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.539 
wasn't the standard okay so you should
be<00:01:03.809> familiar<00:01:03.930> generally<00:01:04.860> doctor<00:01:05.159> regiments

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549

lecture<00:01:11.640> notes<00:01:12.049> on<00:01:13.049> PowerPoint<00:01:13.590> you'll<00:01:13.770> see

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
lecture notes on PowerPoint you'll see

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.679 
lecture notes on PowerPoint you'll see
that<00:01:14.220> there's<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> little<00:01:14.850> animation<00:01:15.180> shows

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
that there's a little animation shows

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.600 
that there's a little animation shows
you<00:01:15.869> how<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.049> system<00:01:16.560> works<00:01:17.750> ok<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.740> what<00:01:20.520> we

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
you how the system works ok so what we

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.960 
you how the system works ok so what we
want<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.880> know<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.920> what<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.490> about<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
want to know is what is it about the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.940 
want to know is what is it about the
operation<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.780> system<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.890> is

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
operation of this system that is

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.490 
operation of this system that is
difference<00:01:26.549> for<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.000> young<00:01:27.030> old<00:01:27.540> people<00:01:28.020> than

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
difference for the young old people than

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.100 
difference for the young old people than
it<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.009> old<00:01:29.369> model<00:01:29.909> people<00:01:30.150> ok<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
it is for the old model people ok and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.370 
it is for the old model people ok and
that's<00:01:31.409> when<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:31.710> use<00:01:31.890> computer<00:01:32.369> modeling

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
that's when we use computer modeling

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.630 
that's when we use computer modeling
it's<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.470> computer<00:01:34.950> model<00:01:35.130> what<00:01:35.400> we're<00:01:35.520> going

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
it's a computer model what we're going

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.370 
it's a computer model what we're going
to<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.329> we<00:01:36.990> are<00:01:37.110> going<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:38.900> get<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> computer

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
to do is we are going to get a computer

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.040 
to do is we are going to get a computer
program<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.579> perform<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:43.079> temple<00:01:43.500> general

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
program to perform this temple general

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.930 
program to perform this temple general
and<00:01:45.050> we're<00:01:45.830> gonna<00:01:45.920> give<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.190> computers<00:01:46.730> some

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
and we're gonna give the computers some

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.150 
and we're gonna give the computers some
instructions<00:01:47.570> about<00:01:48.140> how<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.470> performs<00:01:48.980> that

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
instructions about how it performs that

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.730 
instructions about how it performs that
task<00:01:49.220> so<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.450> computer<00:01:50.900> performs<00:01:51.500> that<00:01:51.680> task

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
task so the computer performs that task

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.370 
task so the computer performs that task
in<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.729> way<00:01:52.910> in<00:01:53.210> which<00:01:53.390> we<00:01:53.600> think<00:01:53.630> that<00:01:54.260> the

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
in the way in which we think that the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.800 
in the way in which we think that the
timing<00:01:54.650> system<00:01:54.979> operates<00:01:55.550> in<00:01:56.000> human<00:01:56.450> beings

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
timing system operates in human beings

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.640 
timing system operates in human beings
okay<00:01:58.390> right<00:01:59.390> so<00:01:59.660> we<00:01:59.990> just<00:02:00.080> don't<00:02:00.350> make<00:02:00.410> some

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
okay right so we just don't make some

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.290 
okay right so we just don't make some
more<00:02:00.770> space<00:02:03.369> okay<00:02:04.369> you<00:02:04.430> know<00:02:04.760> what<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:04.970> get<00:02:05.180> the

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
more space okay you know what to get the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.020 
more space okay you know what to get the
computer<00:02:05.690> to<00:02:05.810> do<00:02:05.960> this<00:02:06.320> what<00:02:06.920> we<00:02:07.070> need<00:02:07.310> is<00:02:07.610> an

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
computer to do this what we need is an

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.840 
computer to do this what we need is an
algorithm<00:02:08.420> okay<00:02:09.170> another<00:02:09.800> rhythm<00:02:10.220> is<00:02:10.340> just<00:02:10.580> a

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
algorithm okay another rhythm is just a

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.300 
algorithm okay another rhythm is just a
rule<00:02:11.360> that<00:02:11.720> we<00:02:11.840> give<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.110> computer<00:02:12.620> so<00:02:13.190> it

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
rule that we give the computer so it

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.910 
rule that we give the computer so it
knows<00:02:13.550> how<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.880> perform<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.600> experiment<00:02:15.470> okay

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
knows how to perform the experiment okay

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.720 
knows how to perform the experiment okay
and<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.700> other<00:02:16.730> method<00:02:17.180> we<00:02:17.270> use<00:02:17.450> is<00:02:17.959> this<00:02:18.730> it's

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
and the other method we use is this it's

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.440 
and the other method we use is this it's
the<00:02:20.090> computer<00:02:20.930> will<00:02:21.230> say<00:02:21.410> yes<00:02:21.770> if<00:02:22.450> the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
the computer will say yes if the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.680 
the computer will say yes if the
extended<00:02:24.080> duration<00:02:24.680> -<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:26.330> vampire

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
extended duration - the vampire

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.490 
extended duration - the vampire
saturation<00:02:27.970> /<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.030> power<00:02:29.390> saturation<00:02:30.110> is

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
saturation / the power saturation is

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.910 
saturation / the power saturation is
smaller<00:02:31.070> than<00:02:31.370> some<00:02:31.640> threshold<00:02:32.390> value<00:02:32.920> okay

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
smaller than some threshold value okay

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.120 
smaller than some threshold value okay
then<00:02:34.459> just<00:02:35.200> just<00:02:36.200> write<00:02:36.380> that<00:02:36.500> out<00:02:36.650> for<00:02:36.920> you

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
then just just write that out for you

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.760 
then just just write that out for you
okay<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.000> s<00:02:38.810> is<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:40.670> standard<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:42.530> meant

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
okay so s is the standard you meant

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.930 
okay so s is the standard you meant
either<00:02:43.040> standard<00:02:44.620> C<00:02:45.620> is<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.220> comparison<00:02:46.790> to

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
either standard C is the comparison to

00:02:46.940 --> 00:03:01.410 
either standard C is the comparison to
raishin<00:02:49.600> and<00:02:52.209> B<00:02:53.209> is<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.320> threshold<00:02:54.560> okay<00:02:59.890> if

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
raishin and B is the threshold okay if

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.990 
raishin and B is the threshold okay if
this<00:03:02.420> was<00:03:02.720> this<00:03:03.080> divided<00:03:03.739> by<00:03:03.769> this<00:03:03.890> is<00:03:04.370> smaller

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
this was this divided by this is smaller

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.789 
this was this divided by this is smaller
than<00:03:05.209> some<00:03:05.420> professional<00:03:05.840> value<00:03:06.200> then<00:03:06.590> the

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
than some professional value then the

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.250 
than some professional value then the
computable<00:03:07.430> system<00:03:07.910> will<00:03:08.030> say<00:03:08.180> yes<00:03:08.450> okay<00:03:09.080> and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
computable system will say yes okay and

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.190 
computable system will say yes okay and
this<00:03:09.890> is<00:03:09.950> what<00:03:10.400> we<00:03:10.549> are<00:03:10.640> imagining<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:11.959> city

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
this is what we are imagining the city

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.199 
this is what we are imagining the city
movies<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:12.739> human<00:03:13.010> beings<00:03:13.340> are<00:03:13.549> using<00:03:13.910> okay

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
movies of human beings are using okay

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.509 
movies of human beings are using okay
then<00:03:14.420> it's<00:03:14.570> reasonable<00:03:15.190> if<00:03:16.190> you're<00:03:16.340> wondering

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
then it's reasonable if you're wondering

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.850 
then it's reasonable if you're wondering
much<00:03:16.820> divided<00:03:17.329> by<00:03:17.480> T<00:03:17.810> that's<00:03:18.410> a<00:03:18.560> way<00:03:18.709> of

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
much divided by T that's a way of

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.530 
much divided by T that's a way of
getting<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.280> system<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.760> produce<00:03:19.850> a<00:03:20.269> scalar

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
getting the system to produce a scalar

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.120 
getting the system to produce a scalar
property<00:03:21.049> okay<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:21.530> don't<00:03:21.709> really<00:03:21.799> need<00:03:21.980> to

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
property okay you don't really need to

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.949 
property okay you don't really need to
worry<00:03:22.549> about<00:03:22.810> this<00:03:23.810> look<00:03:24.790> okay<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:26.209> this<00:03:26.810> way

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
worry about this look okay so this way

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.910 
worry about this look okay so this way
so<00:03:27.019> this<00:03:27.290> is<00:03:27.470> when<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.739> says<00:03:27.950> yes<00:03:28.870> when<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:30.260> say

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
so this is when it says yes when to say

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.430 
so this is when it says yes when to say
yes<00:03:31.870> okay<00:03:32.870> so<00:03:32.900> we're<00:03:33.110> going<00:03:33.200> to<00:03:33.260> give<00:03:33.410> that

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
yes okay so we're going to give that

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.930 
yes okay so we're going to give that
sitting<00:03:33.980> rules<00:03:34.160> of<00:03:34.310> computing

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
sitting rules of computing

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.550 
sitting rules of computing
okay<00:03:35.209> we're<00:03:35.750> also<00:03:35.930> going<00:03:36.170> to<00:03:36.230> tell<00:03:36.470> the

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
okay we're also going to tell the

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.860 
okay we're also going to tell the
computer<00:03:36.650> what<00:03:37.130> standard<00:03:37.640> is<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.150> then<00:03:38.750> on

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
computer what standard is and then on

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.530 
computer what standard is and then on
each<00:03:39.019> trial<00:03:39.320> we<00:03:39.530> tell<00:03:39.739> you<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.070> powers

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
each trial we tell you the powers

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.160 
each trial we tell you the powers
duration<00:03:40.810> is<00:03:41.939> now<00:03:42.939> obviously<00:03:43.450> if<00:03:43.810> we<00:03:43.989> just

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
duration is now obviously if we just

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.069 
duration is now obviously if we just
left<00:03:44.379> it<00:03:44.590> like<00:03:44.739> this<00:03:45.010> then<00:03:45.879> the<00:03:46.629> computers

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
left it like this then the computers

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.490 
left it like this then the computers
never<00:03:47.319> be<00:03:47.439> able<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.590> make<00:03:47.739> an<00:03:47.890> error<00:03:48.040> basically

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
never be able to make an error basically

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.679 
never be able to make an error basically
it's<00:03:50.500> never<00:03:50.739> going<00:03:50.980> to<00:03:51.069> say<00:03:51.849> yes<00:03:52.239> when<00:03:52.540> the

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:52.689 
it's never going to say yes when the

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:54.630 
it's never going to say yes when the
compassion<00:03:53.650> isn't<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:53.980> standard<00:03:54.159> there's<00:03:54.549> no

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
compassion isn't the standard there's no

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.429 
compassion isn't the standard there's no
because<00:03:54.819> they<00:03:54.939> know<00:03:55.180> when<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.900> capacity<00:03:56.379> is

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:56.439 
because they know when the capacity is

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.190 
because they know when the capacity is
substandard<00:03:56.859> okay<00:03:57.430> it's<00:03:58.120> too<00:03:58.329> perfect<00:03:58.599> here

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
substandard okay it's too perfect here

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.550 
substandard okay it's too perfect here
what<00:03:59.920> we<00:04:00.069> want<00:04:00.310> is<00:04:01.030> for<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.629> computer<00:04:02.170> model

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
what we want is for the computer model

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.210 
what we want is for the computer model
to<00:04:03.930> emulate<00:04:04.930> what's<00:04:05.680> going<00:04:05.920> on<00:04:06.040> with<00:04:06.159> the

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
to emulate what's going on with the

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.099 
to emulate what's going on with the
humans<00:04:06.670> basically<00:04:07.389> what<00:04:07.629> we<00:04:07.750> need<00:04:07.959> to

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
humans basically what we need to

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.140 
humans basically what we need to
introduce<00:04:08.319> some<00:04:08.560> variability<00:04:09.280> into<00:04:10.060> the

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
introduce some variability into the

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.300 
introduce some variability into the
system<00:04:10.450> because<00:04:11.439> we<00:04:11.530> know<00:04:11.650> that<00:04:11.680> human<00:04:12.040> beings

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
system because we know that human beings

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.770 
system because we know that human beings
aren't<00:04:12.489> perfect<00:04:13.000> that's<00:04:13.180> how<00:04:13.329> they<00:04:13.629> have

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
aren't perfect that's how they have

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.339 
aren't perfect that's how they have
variability<00:04:15.479> and<00:04:16.479> there<00:04:16.750> are<00:04:16.810> several<00:04:17.079> places

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
variability and there are several places

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:18.990 
variability and there are several places
in<00:04:17.709> which<00:04:17.829> we<00:04:18.009> could<00:04:18.130> have<00:04:18.250> imagined<00:04:18.789> there

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
in which we could have imagined there

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.020 
in which we could have imagined there
will<00:04:19.090> be<00:04:19.120> variability<00:04:19.690> in<00:04:20.049> system<00:04:20.880> that's<00:04:21.880> not

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
will be variability in system that's not

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.550 
will be variability in system that's not
obvious<00:04:22.419> one<00:04:22.630> it's<00:04:22.900> a<00:04:22.990> memory<00:04:23.349> of<00:04:23.440> the

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
obvious one it's a memory of the

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.860 
obvious one it's a memory of the
standard<00:04:24.039> we<00:04:24.490> know<00:04:24.699> that<00:04:24.910> human<00:04:25.270> memory<00:04:25.660> is

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
standard we know that human memory is

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.529 
standard we know that human memory is
variable<00:04:26.770> isn't<00:04:27.340> we<00:04:27.430> never<00:04:27.610> a<00:04:27.699> perfect<00:04:27.940> recall

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
variable isn't we never a perfect recall

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.529 
variable isn't we never a perfect recall
with<00:04:29.050> every<00:04:29.320> code<00:04:29.560> things<00:04:29.830> perfectly<00:04:30.370> so<00:04:31.060> to

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
with every code things perfectly so to

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.040 
with every code things perfectly so to
complete<00:04:31.780> this<00:04:32.050> this<00:04:33.060> algorithm<00:04:34.060> we<00:04:34.810> put<00:04:35.020> a

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
complete this this algorithm we put a

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.810 
complete this this algorithm we put a
little<00:04:35.199> star<00:04:35.530> here<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:36.250> that<00:04:36.400> means<00:04:36.550> that

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
little star here and that means that

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.659 
little star here and that means that
this<00:04:37.000> standard<00:04:37.660> has<00:04:38.020> some<00:04:38.320> variability<00:04:39.160> okay

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
this standard has some variability okay

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.909 
this standard has some variability okay
so<00:04:39.729> we're<00:04:40.240> assuming<00:04:40.570> that<00:04:41.110> our<00:04:41.620> long-term

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
so we're assuming that our long-term

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.659 
so we're assuming that our long-term
memory<00:04:42.190> has<00:04:43.180> some<00:04:43.539> variability<00:04:44.320> okay<00:04:45.039> and<00:04:45.490> we

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
memory has some variability okay and we

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.969 
memory has some variability okay and we
give<00:04:45.849> that<00:04:46.030> variability<00:04:46.510> a<00:04:47.050> parameter

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
give that variability a parameter

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.330 
give that variability a parameter
parameter<00:04:48.250> value<00:04:49.210> okay<00:04:49.630> and<00:04:49.870> in<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.860> SCT

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
parameter value okay and in the SCT

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.120 
parameter value okay and in the SCT
modeling<00:04:52.150> system<00:04:52.659> and<00:04:53.229> that<00:04:53.530> parameter<00:04:53.770> is

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
modeling system and that parameter is

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.250 
modeling system and that parameter is
called<00:04:54.520> C<00:04:55.050> okay

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
called C okay

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.439 
called C okay
basic<00:04:56.889> C<00:04:57.270> controls<00:04:58.349> how<00:04:59.349> variable<00:04:59.919> S<00:05:00.370> is<00:05:00.729> okay

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
basic C controls how variable S is okay

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.180 
basic C controls how variable S is okay
I'll<00:05:01.659> come<00:05:01.840> on<00:05:02.020> to<00:05:02.440> a<00:05:02.470> bit<00:05:02.680> more<00:05:02.710> detail<00:05:03.159> about

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
I'll come on to a bit more detail about

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.189 
I'll come on to a bit more detail about
what<00:05:03.370> I<00:05:03.460> mean<00:05:03.639> by<00:05:03.699> that<00:05:03.849> and<00:05:04.449> if<00:05:04.659> we<00:05:05.020> have<00:05:05.169> a

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
what I mean by that and if we have a

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.950 
what I mean by that and if we have a
parameter<00:05:05.800> to<00:05:06.039> control<00:05:06.639> how<00:05:07.150> variable<00:05:07.780> the

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
parameter to control how variable the

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.879 
parameter to control how variable the
the<00:05:08.650> memory<00:05:09.039> is<00:05:10.380> another<00:05:11.380> way<00:05:11.530> that<00:05:11.560> you<00:05:11.710> can

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
the memory is another way that you can

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.450 
the memory is another way that you can
imagine<00:05:12.130> the<00:05:12.430> system<00:05:13.349> would<00:05:14.349> be<00:05:14.590> different<00:05:15.010> in

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
imagine the system would be different in

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.779 
imagine the system would be different in
human<00:05:15.760> beings<00:05:16.229> is<00:05:17.229> the<00:05:17.500> threshold<00:05:17.710> value<00:05:18.130> okay

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
human beings is the threshold value okay

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.460 
human beings is the threshold value okay
you<00:05:19.330> might<00:05:19.510> have<00:05:19.690> so<00:05:19.990> we've<00:05:20.110> got<00:05:20.229> a<00:05:20.260> special

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
you might have so we've got a special

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.370 
you might have so we've got a special
operators<00:05:21.099> operating<00:05:21.610> down<00:05:21.760> here<00:05:22.229> you<00:05:23.229> can

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
operators operating down here you can

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.460 
operators operating down here you can
imagine<00:05:23.770> that<00:05:23.889> some<00:05:24.130> people<00:05:24.580> will<00:05:24.729> be<00:05:25.470> beta

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
imagine that some people will be beta

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.860 
imagine that some people will be beta
servicing<00:05:27.250> about<00:05:27.460> saying<00:05:27.760> yes<00:05:28.120> they<00:05:28.630> let<00:05:28.780> me

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
servicing about saying yes they let me

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.080 
servicing about saying yes they let me
say<00:05:29.050> yes<00:05:29.349> that<00:05:29.740> was<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.460> standard<00:05:30.699> when

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
say yes that was the standard when

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.029 
say yes that was the standard when
they're<00:05:31.210> absolutely<00:05:31.870> utterly<00:05:32.260> convinced<00:05:32.919> it

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
they're absolutely utterly convinced it

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.240 
they're absolutely utterly convinced it
definitely<00:05:33.400> was<00:05:33.520> a<00:05:33.550> standard<00:05:34.060> without

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
definitely was a standard without

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.610 
definitely was a standard without
okay<00:05:35.520> so<00:05:36.030> in<00:05:36.120> that<00:05:36.270> case<00:05:36.600> it<00:05:36.780> they<00:05:37.229> have<00:05:37.410> a<00:05:37.470> very

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
okay so in that case it they have a very

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.460 
okay so in that case it they have a very
small<00:05:37.770> such<00:05:38.250> a<00:05:38.280> old<00:05:38.820> value<00:05:39.240> other<00:05:39.960> people

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
small such a old value other people

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.830 
small such a old value other people
really<00:05:41.400> don't<00:05:41.610> care<00:05:41.880> if<00:05:42.150> they<00:05:42.570> sound<00:05:42.780> amazing

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
really don't care if they sound amazing

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.480 
really don't care if they sound amazing
I<00:05:43.380> understand<00:05:43.800> that<00:05:43.949> they're<00:05:44.100> going<00:05:44.220> to<00:05:44.340> say

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
I understand that they're going to say

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.280 
I understand that they're going to say
yes<00:05:44.760> okay<00:05:45.270> then<00:05:45.449> they're<00:05:45.630> more<00:05:45.720> excitable

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
yes okay then they're more excitable

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.890 
yes okay then they're more excitable
more<00:05:46.650> laps<00:05:46.919> of<00:05:47.040> days<00:05:47.479> okay<00:05:48.479> so<00:05:48.540> you<00:05:48.750> can

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
more laps of days okay so you can

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.680 
more laps of days okay so you can
control<00:05:49.290> how<00:05:50.040> much<00:05:50.070> service<00:05:50.639> people<00:05:51.120> how<00:05:51.389> lots

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
control how much service people how lots

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.540 
control how much service people how lots
of<00:05:51.810> days<00:05:52.020> before<00:05:52.260> this<00:05:52.500> system<00:05:52.860> is<00:05:53.070> by

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
of days before this system is by

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.689 
of days before this system is by
controlling<00:05:54.060> this<00:05:54.180> parameter<00:05:54.780> B<00:05:55.669> okay<00:05:57.260> now

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
controlling this parameter B okay now

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.280 
controlling this parameter B okay now
before<00:05:59.699> we<00:05:59.760> go<00:05:59.940> on<00:05:59.970> I<00:06:00.150> will<00:06:00.630> talk<00:06:00.810> a<00:06:00.840> little<00:06:01.050> bit

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
before we go on I will talk a little bit

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.950 
before we go on I will talk a little bit
more<00:06:01.320> about<00:06:01.850> what's<00:06:02.850> going<00:06:02.940> on<00:06:03.270> in<00:06:03.600> the

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
more about what's going on in the

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.150 
more about what's going on in the
long-term<00:06:04.380> memory

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
long-term memory

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.310 
long-term memory
okay<00:06:05.520> so<00:06:06.030> I'm<00:06:06.150> supposed<00:06:06.270> to<00:06:06.630> pause<00:06:06.990> the<00:06:07.139> tape

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
okay so I'm supposed to pause the tape

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.680 
okay so I'm supposed to pause the tape
and<00:06:08.419> what<00:06:09.419> they<00:06:09.539> stopped<00:06:09.780> making<00:06:10.139> it<00:06:10.289> clear
