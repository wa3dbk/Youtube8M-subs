off<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.530> understand<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.769> two<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.339> the

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
off I understand that two of the

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.459 
off I understand that two of the
Sudanese<00:00:54.329> gentlemen<00:00:54.749> in<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> first<00:00:55.170> class

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.209

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
were taken off the plane and I think

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.329 
were taken off the plane and I think
later<00:00:59.519> on<00:01:00.260> did<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.379> see<00:01:01.559> any<00:01:01.679> sign<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.949> troops

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
later on did you see any sign of troops

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:03.860 
later on did you see any sign of troops
at<00:01:02.519> all<00:01:02.670> around<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> aircraft

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
at all around the aircraft

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.340 
at all around the aircraft
I<00:01:04.730> don't<00:01:05.730> think<00:01:05.790> there<00:01:05.970> was<00:01:06.030> troops<00:01:06.540> as<00:01:06.870> such

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
I don't think there was troops as such

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.910 
I don't think there was troops as such
there<00:01:08.070> was<00:01:08.420> one<00:01:09.420> soldier<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.620> stage<00:01:10.860> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
there was one soldier of on stage a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.730 
there was one soldier of on stage a
corporal<00:01:11.550> and<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.810> think<00:01:13.170> he<00:01:13.320> must<00:01:13.440> have<00:01:13.590> been

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
corporal and I think he must have been

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.370 
corporal and I think he must have been
an<00:01:13.860> Air<00:01:14.010> Force<00:01:14.190> sergeant<00:01:15.000> they<00:01:15.930> came<00:01:16.170> through

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
an Air Force sergeant they came through

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.960 
an Air Force sergeant they came through
and<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.890> looked<00:01:17.190> as<00:01:17.310> though<00:01:17.340> they<00:01:17.580> picked<00:01:17.820> up

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
and it looked as though they picked up

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.420 
and it looked as though they picked up
the<00:01:18.090> Sudanese<00:01:18.510> passports<00:01:19.170> took<00:01:19.980> them<00:01:20.130> off<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
the Sudanese passports took them off the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.460 
the Sudanese passports took them off the
plane<00:01:20.640> looked<00:01:21.030> at<00:01:21.180> them<00:01:21.300> and<00:01:21.900> about<00:01:22.080> half<00:01:22.320> an
