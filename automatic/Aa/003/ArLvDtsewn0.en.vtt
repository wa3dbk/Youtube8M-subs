00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
that people who made it well it's

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.020 
that people who made it well it's
remarkable<00:01:25.330> and<00:01:25.659> there<00:01:26.080> is<00:01:26.200> certainly<00:01:26.560> a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
remarkable and there is certainly a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.180 
remarkable and there is certainly a
component<00:01:28.030> of<00:01:28.090> luck<00:01:28.560> involved<00:01:29.560> in<00:01:29.860> that<00:01:29.979> but

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.399 
component of luck involved in that but
what<00:01:30.430> I<00:01:30.460> think<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:31.000> longevity<00:01:31.409> really

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
what I think the longevity really

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.830 
what I think the longevity really
reflects<00:01:32.890> is<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.640> commitment<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:34.750> the

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
reflects is the commitment and the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.190 
reflects is the commitment and the
dedication<00:01:35.020> of<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.770> skill<00:01:36.190> of<00:01:36.400> the<00:01:36.930> team<00:01:37.930> of
