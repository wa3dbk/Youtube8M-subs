out there to be fair though that is a
really<00:02:53.030> easy<00:02:53.060> trap<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.720> fall<00:02:53.900> into<00:02:54.140> we've

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
really easy trap to fall into we've

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.570 
really easy trap to fall into we've
talked<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:54.830> much<00:02:54.890> about<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.280> dunning-kruger

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
talked so much about the dunning-kruger

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.280 
talked so much about the dunning-kruger
effect<00:02:55.610> before<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.630> this<00:02:56.720> is<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.900> perfect

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
effect before and this is a perfect

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.930 
effect before and this is a perfect
example<00:02:57.380> of<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.040> it's<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:58.370> much<00:02:58.430> easier<00:02:58.550> to

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
example of it it's so much easier to

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.580 
example of it it's so much easier to
point<00:02:59.090> out<00:02:59.270> someone<00:02:59.600> else's<00:02:59.810> mistakes<00:03:00.320> rather

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
point out someone else's mistakes rather

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.230
