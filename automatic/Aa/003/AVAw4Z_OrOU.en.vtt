00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:11.760 
to do a little bit past the intermediate

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
to do a little bit past the intermediate
tricks<00:00:12.030> uh<00:00:13.730> took<00:00:14.730> me<00:00:14.910> about<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.240> week<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.660> learn

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
tricks uh took me about a week to learn

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.359 
tricks uh took me about a week to learn
this<00:00:15.960> one<00:00:16.020> it's<00:00:16.410> pretty<00:00:16.590> difficult<00:00:16.860> but<00:00:17.220> once

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
this one it's pretty difficult but once

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.740 
this one it's pretty difficult but once
you<00:00:17.490> get<00:00:17.610> down<00:00:17.880> you're<00:00:18.150> just<00:00:18.180> throw<00:00:18.540> into<00:00:18.690> a

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
you get down you're just throw into a

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.519 
you get down you're just throw into a
lot<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.110> lines<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:20.100> pretty<00:00:20.279> cool

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
lot of lines and it's pretty cool

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.349 
lot of lines and it's pretty cool
most<00:00:22.529> people<00:00:22.859> don't<00:00:23.520> know<00:00:23.699> how<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.850> do<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.180> on

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
most people don't know how to do this on

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.269 
most people don't know how to do this on
flat<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.320> Ledge<00:00:25.590> or<00:00:25.680> anything<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.130> they

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
flat on a Ledge or anything but they

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.650 
flat on a Ledge or anything but they
know<00:00:26.400> how<00:00:26.520> to<00:00:26.550> do<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:26.910> tranny<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.449> guess

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
know how to do it in tranny so I guess

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.659 
know how to do it in tranny so I guess
that's<00:00:27.779> pretty<00:00:27.930> good<00:00:30.260> so<00:00:31.260> uh<00:00:31.369> let's<00:00:32.369> go<00:00:32.550> over

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
that's pretty good so uh let's go over

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.189 
that's pretty good so uh let's go over
how<00:00:32.760> learn<00:00:33.110> to<00:00:34.110> do<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> backside<00:00:35.010> snip<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.930> best

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
how learn to do a backside snip the best

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.079 
how learn to do a backside snip the best
way<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.610> think<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.909> is<00:00:39.120> as<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.400> 50/50<00:00:41.400> but

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089 
way to think of it is as a 50/50 but

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:55.189 
way to think of it is as a 50/50 but
over<00:00:42.960> rotation<00:00:43.500> at<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> end<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:53.540> it's<00:00:54.540> C<00:00:54.900> and

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
over rotation at the end so it's C and

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.250 
over rotation at the end so it's C and
then<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:55.979> just<00:00:56.369> I<00:00:56.519> completely<00:00:56.879> fifty<00:00:57.360> use<00:00:58.019> your

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
then I just I completely fifty use your

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.500 
then I just I completely fifty use your
shoulders<00:00:58.799> to<00:00:59.129> get<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.729> and<00:01:00.239> that's

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
shoulders to get on to it and that's

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.039 
shoulders to get on to it and that's
where<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> first<00:01:01.019> part<00:01:01.290> of<00:01:01.350> rotation<00:01:01.970> you'll

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
where the first part of rotation you'll

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:15.370 
where the first part of rotation you'll
lose<00:01:04.049> your<00:01:04.350> shoulders<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.790> get<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.840> it

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.020 

because<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.399> said<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.880> first

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
because like I said the first

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.209 
because like I said the first
presentation<00:01:18.780> interval<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.289> that<00:01:19.590> Axl<00:01:20.070> would

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
presentation interval is that Axl would

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:25.999 
presentation interval is that Axl would
not<00:01:20.579> make<00:01:20.759> up<00:01:20.969> the<00:01:21.090> wheel<00:01:24.590> is<00:01:25.590> you're<00:01:25.829> going<00:01:25.920> to

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
not make up the wheel is you're going to

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.010 
not make up the wheel is you're going to
do<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.219> part<00:01:26.460> twos<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:27.060> part<00:01:27.390> one<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.840> like

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
do the part twos like part one is like

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.980 
do the part twos like part one is like
half<00:01:28.259> rotation<00:01:28.859> and<00:01:29.130> then<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.729> rest<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.149> it<00:01:30.299> is

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
half rotation and then the rest of it is

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.840 
half rotation and then the rest of it is
over<00:01:31.409> rotation<00:01:32.039> so<00:01:32.130> you're<00:01:32.310> basically<00:01:32.549> coming

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
over rotation so you're basically coming

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.690 
over rotation so you're basically coming
up<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.299> you're<00:01:33.780> over<00:01:34.170> thing<00:01:34.530> which<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.249> kind

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
up and you're over thing which it's kind

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.980 
up and you're over thing which it's kind
of<00:01:35.759> two<00:01:35.939> parts<00:01:36.149> but<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.539> all<00:01:36.659> at<00:01:36.749> the<00:01:36.810> same

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
of two parts but it's all at the same

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.300 
of two parts but it's all at the same
time<00:01:37.460> come<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:40.310> really<00:01:41.310> quick<00:01:41.640> how<00:01:41.880> am<00:01:42.030> I

this is obviously the most stylish but
beginners<00:02:15.900> one<00:02:16.900> thing<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.230> health<00:02:17.440> actually

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
beginners one thing that health actually

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.350 
beginners one thing that health actually
is<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:19.150> no<00:02:19.350> stock<00:02:20.350> routine<00:02:20.739> is<00:02:21.040> if<00:02:21.819> you<00:02:22.000> have<00:02:22.150> to

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
is to no stock routine is if you have to

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.530 
is to no stock routine is if you have to
put<00:02:22.780> him<00:02:23.140> off<00:02:23.319> with<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:24.060> give<00:02:25.060> your<00:02:25.180> foot<00:02:25.390> hang

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
off the side of it and I think this will

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.900 
off the side of it and I think this will
do<00:02:28.510> when<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:29.080> get<00:02:29.319> into<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.739> he<00:02:30.549> will<00:02:30.730> just
