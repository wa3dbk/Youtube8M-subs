now zip ties have long been the norm for
cable<00:01:38.100> grouping<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> problem<00:01:39.150> with

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
cable grouping but the problem with

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.359 
cable grouping but the problem with
these<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.570> they're<00:01:39.990> ugly<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.590> they're<00:01:41.130> also

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
these is they're ugly and they're also

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.800 
these is they're ugly and they're also
problematic<00:01:41.970> because<00:01:42.090> every<00:01:42.420> time<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.659> want

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
problematic because every time you want

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.749 
problematic because every time you want
to<00:01:42.840> add<00:01:43.079> or<00:01:43.380> remove<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:44.070> cable<00:01:44.340> which<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.610> my

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
to add or remove a cable which in my

to add or remove a cable which in my
setup<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.210> quite<00:01:45.450> often<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:46.229> need<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.439> snip

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
setup is quite often you need to snip

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.980 
setup is quite often you need to snip
the<00:01:46.890> zip<00:01:47.070> tie<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.399> redo<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> whole<00:01:48.329> line<00:01:48.540> talk

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the zip tie and redo the whole line talk

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.109 
the zip tie and redo the whole line talk
about<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> pain<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.460> these<00:01:50.579> little<00:01:50.909> velcro

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
about a pain that these little velcro

zip<00:01:51.479> ties<00:01:51.659> are<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.869> tad<00:01:52.110> bit<00:01:52.320> more<00:01:52.350> expensive

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
zip ties are a tad bit more expensive

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.469 
zip ties are a tad bit more expensive
but<00:01:53.159> they're<00:01:53.280> super<00:01:53.490> handy<00:01:53.939> because<00:01:54.060> they<00:01:54.329> can

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
but they're super handy because they can

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.080 
but they're super handy because they can
be<00:01:54.630> loosened<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.619> retightened<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.700> command

not<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.540> mention<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.259> use<00:01:58.409> them

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
not to mention you can use them

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.230 
not to mention you can use them
basically<00:01:59.040> forever<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.850> they're<00:02:00.000> worth<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
basically forever so they're worth the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.270 
basically forever so they're worth the
extra<00:02:00.570> dollars<00:02:00.899> they<00:02:01.409> look<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.680> lot<00:02:01.799> nicer<00:02:01.950> too

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
extra dollars they look a lot nicer too

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.249 
extra dollars they look a lot nicer too
even<00:02:03.149> though<00:02:03.240> we<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.659> cables<00:02:03.960> grouped

even though we have the cables grouped
together<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:04.710> still<00:02:04.860> have<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.070> big<00:02:05.310> ugly<00:02:05.520> clump

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
together we still have a big ugly clump

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.210

takes<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.170> little<00:03:04.380> bit<00:03:04.560> more<00:03:04.620> work<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:06.120> is

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
takes a little bit more work and that is

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.900 
takes a little bit more work and that is
a<00:03:06.450> hot<00:03:06.840> glue<00:03:07.080> gun<00:03:07.110> yep<00:03:07.800> hot<00:03:08.250> glue<00:03:08.430> guns<00:03:08.670> can<00:03:08.880> be

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
a hot glue gun yep hot glue guns can be

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.970 
a hot glue gun yep hot glue guns can be
used<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.270> glue<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.450> electronics<00:03:10.140> powerstrips

apply a very thin coat of hot glue the

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.710 
apply a very thin coat of hot glue the
thinner<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.580> better<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:17.970> then<00:03:18.390> apply<00:03:18.660> the

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
thinner the better and then apply the

thinner the better and then apply the
glued<00:03:19.080> object<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.769> underside<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.370> your

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
glued object to the underside of your

desk as quickly as possible
now<00:03:22.860> it's<00:03:23.040> sturdy<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.400> can<00:03:23.610> hold<00:03:23.730> several

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
now it's sturdy and can hold several

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.539 
now it's sturdy and can hold several
pounds<00:03:24.450> without<00:03:24.540> issues<00:03:25.019> for<00:03:25.290> years<00:03:25.650> but<00:03:26.280> when

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
pounds without issues for years but when

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.979 
pounds without issues for years but when
it<00:03:26.670> comes<00:03:26.850> time<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.090> remove<00:03:27.540> what<00:03:27.870> you've

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
it comes time to remove what you've

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.780 
it comes time to remove what you've
glued<00:03:28.170> underneath<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.980> just<00:03:29.190> give<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:29.730> a

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
glued underneath you just give it a

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.280 
glued underneath you just give it a
little<00:03:29.910> wiggle<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.390> it's<00:03:30.570> set<00:03:30.780> free

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
little wiggle and it's set free

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.199 
little wiggle and it's set free
since<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.830> glue<00:03:32.010> has<00:03:32.190> been<00:03:32.519> dried<00:03:32.790> it's<00:03:33.030> very

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
since the glue has been dried it's very

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.150 
since the glue has been dried it's very
easy<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.630> peel<00:03:33.810> off<00:03:34.049> without<00:03:34.440> damage<00:03:34.799> anything

easy to peel off without damage anything

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.949 
easy to peel off without damage anything
it's<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.400> great<00:03:35.640> solution<00:03:35.820> if<00:03:36.269> drilling<00:03:36.690> into

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
it's a great solution if drilling into

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.410 
it's a great solution if drilling into
discs<00:03:37.320> isn't<00:03:37.769> your<00:03:37.920> thing<00:03:38.180> lastly<00:03:39.180> we<00:03:39.299> have

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
the power strips now I would recommend

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.130 
the power strips now I would recommend
trying<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.730> lay<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.060> power<00:03:42.239> strips<00:03:42.570> inside<00:03:42.989> of

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
trying to lay the power strips inside of

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.539 
trying to lay the power strips inside of
the<00:03:43.230> IKEA<00:03:43.560> Signum<00:03:43.920> because<00:03:44.130> that's<00:03:44.340> where<00:03:44.519> all

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549

you<00:03:46.950> don't<00:03:47.040> want<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.459> or<00:03:47.640> perhaps<00:03:47.820> you<00:03:48.120> have<00:03:48.150> a

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
you don't want to or perhaps you have a

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.449 
you don't want to or perhaps you have a
battery-powered<00:03:48.780> UPS<00:03:49.440> like<00:03:49.620> myself<00:03:49.830> that's

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
battery-powered UPS like myself that's

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.400 
battery-powered UPS like myself that's
obviously<00:03:51.090> not<00:03:51.269> an<00:03:51.420> option<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:51.959> so<00:03:52.140> blue

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
obviously not an option and so blue
