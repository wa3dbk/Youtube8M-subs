that doubler will correspond to the
juggles<00:02:06.100> on<00:02:07.019> these<00:02:08.019> ribs

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.500 

I'm<00:02:32.670> going<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.090> start<00:02:33.920> by<00:02:34.920> clicking<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.879> spar

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
I'm going to start by clicking the spar

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.429 
I'm going to start by clicking the spar
up<00:02:36.840> front<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.969> this<00:02:38.969> will<00:02:39.030> be<00:02:39.329> located<00:02:39.719> along

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
up front and this will be located along

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:46.819 
up front and this will be located along
the<00:02:40.980> top<00:02:41.400> up<00:02:41.760> here<00:02:44.840> right<00:02:45.840> like<00:02:46.079> this<00:02:46.469> and

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
the top up here right like this and

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.520 
the top up here right like this and
we'll<00:02:47.579> go<00:02:47.730> ahead<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:48.299> click<00:02:48.780> over<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.260> in

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
we'll go ahead and click over this in

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.910 
we'll go ahead and click over this in
place<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.019> will<00:02:52.139> slide<00:02:52.469> down<00:02:52.969> and<00:02:54.920> our

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
place and it will slide down and our

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.160 
place and it will slide down and our
goal<00:02:56.219> then<00:02:56.549> is<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.849> match<00:02:57.299> this<00:02:57.629> up<00:02:57.840> with<00:02:57.900> the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
goal then is to match this up with the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.099 
goal then is to match this up with the
horn<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:58.799> that<00:02:58.950> our<00:02:59.099> corner<00:02:59.549> is<00:02:59.730> not<00:03:00.299> above<00:03:00.930> the

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
horn so that our corner is not above the

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.509 
horn so that our corner is not above the
edge<00:03:01.319> but<00:03:01.650> as<00:03:01.799> close<00:03:01.980> as<00:03:02.220> possible<00:03:03.019> remove<00:03:04.519> the

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
edge but as close as possible remove the

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.879 
edge but as close as possible remove the
center<00:03:05.939> channel

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
center channel

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:11.270 
center channel
so<00:03:07.889> whatever<00:03:08.489> click<00:03:09.209> goes<00:03:09.450> are<00:03:09.629> necessary<00:03:10.280> to

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
so whatever click goes are necessary to

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.110 
so whatever click goes are necessary to
be<00:03:11.400> taken<00:03:11.790> off<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.930> take<00:03:13.169> the<00:03:13.409> channel<00:03:13.859> out<00:03:14.120> but

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
be taken off to take the channel out but

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.309 
be taken off to take the channel out but
we'll<00:03:15.329> leave<00:03:15.629> our<00:03:15.900> arm<00:03:16.439> in<00:03:17.129> place<00:03:18.049> we're<00:03:19.049> going

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
we'll leave our arm in place we're going

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.530 
we'll leave our arm in place we're going

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.170 
here that we installed we have three
more<00:03:43.660> here<00:03:44.380> according<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.459> our<00:03:45.490> plans<00:03:45.910> and

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
more here according to our plans and

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:59.380 
more here according to our plans and
then<00:03:46.959> one<00:03:47.530> more<00:03:47.830> just<00:03:48.340> around<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.880> corner

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.330 

we're<00:04:00.390> going<00:04:00.569> to<00:04:00.690> slip<00:04:00.990> some<00:04:01.350> heat-shrink

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
we're going to slip some heat-shrink

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.230 
we're going to slip some heat-shrink
tubing<00:04:03.030> over<00:04:04.069> each<00:04:05.069> of<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.490> five<00:04:05.760> wires<00:04:08.240> now

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
tubing over each of the five wires now

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.190 
tubing over each of the five wires now
we're<00:04:09.450> going<00:04:09.660> to<00:04:09.750> install<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.860> servo<00:04:12.200> our

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
we're going to install the servo our

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.710 
we're going to install the servo our
first<00:04:13.680> step<00:04:14.040> was<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:15.000> extend<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.780> plunger

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
first step was to extend the plunger

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.490 
first step was to extend the plunger
because<00:04:18.720> that<00:04:18.840> will<00:04:18.989> make<00:04:19.109> it<00:04:19.169> a<00:04:19.350> little

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
because that will make it a little

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.600 
because that will make it a little
easier<00:04:19.769> when<00:04:20.549> we<00:04:20.730> go<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:20.940> connect<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.720> end<00:04:22.610> now

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
easier when we go to connect the end now

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.650 
easier when we go to connect the end now
we<00:04:23.669> need<00:04:23.970> to<00:04:24.120> move<00:04:24.300> it<00:04:24.480> all<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.410> way<00:04:25.530> forward

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
we need to move it all the way forward

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.640 
we need to move it all the way forward
until<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.870> front<00:04:28.680> edge<00:04:28.950> of<00:04:29.340> our<00:04:29.490> skin<00:04:29.940> almost

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
until the front edge of our skin almost

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:45.410 
until the front edge of our skin almost
comes<00:04:31.650> up<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:33.350> line<00:04:34.350> on<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:35.820> hinge

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.480
