00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
and the reason for this is when you

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.310 
and the reason for this is when you
smile<00:00:59.149> and<00:00:59.449> I've<00:00:59.539> talked<00:00:59.840> about<00:01:00.019> this<00:01:00.170> before

smile and I've talked about this before
the<00:01:01.180> apple<00:01:02.180> of<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.359> cheek<00:01:02.600> lifts<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:03.469> then

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
the apple of the cheek lifts and then

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.920 
the apple of the cheek lifts and then
you<00:01:04.489> apply<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:04.820> blush<00:01:05.090> here<00:01:05.360> on<00:01:05.480> the<00:01:05.570> Apple

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
you apply the blush here on the Apple

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.660 
you apply the blush here on the Apple
but<00:01:06.620> when<00:01:06.830> you<00:01:06.950> stop<00:01:07.160> smiling<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:10.190> apple<00:01:10.610> of

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
but when you stop smiling the apple of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.210 
but when you stop smiling the apple of
the<00:01:10.760> cheek<00:01:10.970> lowers<00:01:11.480> and<00:01:11.750> it<00:01:12.050> goes<00:01:12.320> lower<00:01:12.890> down

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
the cheek lowers and it goes lower down

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.400 
the cheek lowers and it goes lower down
to<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.520> mouth<00:01:13.730> so<00:01:14.270> your<00:01:14.450> blusher<00:01:14.750> is<00:01:15.080> down

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
to the mouth so your blusher is down

here now as we age everything goes south

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.740 
here now as we age everything goes south

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
we want it to come back up which is why

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.160 
we want it to come back up which is why
I'm<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:22.000> important<00:01:23.000> about<00:01:23.120> applying<00:01:23.840> blusher

on<00:01:24.410> the<00:01:24.770> cheekbone<00:01:25.490> area<00:01:25.840> because<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:26.990> lifts

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
on the cheekbone area because it lifts

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.590 
on the cheekbone area because it lifts
the<00:01:27.560> facial<00:01:28.010> features<00:01:28.040> up<00:01:28.610> if<00:01:28.940> you've<00:01:29.390> got<00:01:29.570> a

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.370 
then yes maybe it's not the best place
to<00:01:34.370> put<00:01:34.730> it<00:01:34.880> but<00:01:35.300> a<00:01:35.450> lot<00:01:35.690> of<00:01:35.720> people<00:01:36.080> don't<00:01:36.230> have

blend<00:02:28.580> it<00:02:28.790> back<00:02:28.970> but<00:02:29.629> the<00:02:29.780> idea<00:02:30.080> is<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.230> not

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
blend it back but the idea is to not

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.830 
blend it back but the idea is to not
smile<00:02:30.890> to<00:02:31.099> not<00:02:31.310> lift<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.819> cheeks<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:32.569> that<00:02:32.720> the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
smile to not lift the cheeks so that the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.140 
smile to not lift the cheeks so that the
blush<00:02:33.049> can<00:02:33.319> lower<00:02:33.530> again<00:02:33.860> that<00:02:34.459> is<00:02:34.760> the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
blush can lower again that is the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.750 
blush can lower again that is the
blusher<00:02:36.140> tip<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.769> you<00:02:36.920> probably<00:02:37.129> don't<00:02:37.459> do

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
blusher tip that you probably don't do

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.110 
blusher tip that you probably don't do
but<00:02:38.420> should<00:02:38.720> make<00:02:39.620> don't<00:02:40.549> forget<00:02:40.819> to<00:02:40.909> thumbs
