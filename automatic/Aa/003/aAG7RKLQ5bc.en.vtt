start with number one and then go

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.429 
start with number one and then go
through<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.310> one<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.570> things<00:01:28.170> that's<00:01:28.320> very

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
through it one of the things that's very

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.590 
through it one of the things that's very
important<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.400> don't<00:01:29.579> see<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.939> icon<00:01:30.360> for

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
important if you don't see the icon for

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.710 
important if you don't see the icon for
Windows<00:01:31.280> 10<00:01:32.280> get<00:01:32.610> Windows<00:01:32.939> 10<00:01:33.210> on<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> bottom

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
Windows 10 get Windows 10 on the bottom

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.830 
Windows 10 get Windows 10 on the bottom
right<00:01:34.729> it<00:01:35.729> could<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.479> you're<00:01:36.659> not

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840

getting your windows updates and that is

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.530 
getting your windows updates and that is
probably<00:01:39.840> one<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.380> most<00:01:40.500> common<00:01:41.070> problems

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
probably one of the most common problems

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.240 
probably one of the most common problems
but<00:01:42.540> if<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.780> see<00:01:43.020> or<00:01:43.170> windows<00:01:43.470> updates<00:01:43.829> coming

that on a lot of tablets that are small

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.780 
that on a lot of tablets that are small

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
very often I've noticed that most people

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.839 
very often I've noticed that most people
with<00:02:17.640> small<00:02:18.299> tablets<00:02:18.810> seem<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.829> tell<00:02:20.519> me<00:02:20.700> that

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849

they don't have the icon and actually

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.970 
they don't have the icon and actually
I've<00:02:22.650> got<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:23.159> Windows<00:02:23.579> 8.1<00:02:23.819> tablet<00:02:24.510> here<00:02:24.989> that
