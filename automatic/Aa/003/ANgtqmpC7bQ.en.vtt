00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
high and then this section would wear

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.420 
high and then this section would wear
low<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.680> was<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.100> over<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.400> over

low and it was like that over and over

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.580 
low and it was like that over and over
again<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.880> even<00:01:06.570> before<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.020> tires<00:01:07.229> are<00:01:07.409> have

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.590 
again and even before the tires are have
gone<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.220> mean<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.610> really<00:01:08.790> pronounced<00:01:09.450> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.450 
gone I mean it's really pronounced and
man<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.320> messed<00:01:10.560> up<00:01:10.740> handling<00:01:11.159> something

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
man it messed up handling something

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.230 
man it messed up handling something
terrible<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:13.770> second<00:01:14.130> set<00:01:14.310> iran<00:01:14.700> higher

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
terrible so the second set iran higher

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.999 
terrible so the second set iran higher
air<00:01:15.509> pressure<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.229> did<00:01:16.470> get<00:01:16.619> more<00:01:16.830> mileage

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
air pressure and I did get more mileage

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.740 
air pressure and I did get more mileage
out<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.549> but<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> set<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.330> tires<00:01:18.509> are

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
out of it but that the set of tires are

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.740 
out of it but that the set of tires are
the<00:01:18.840> same<00:01:19.080> thing<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.340> time<00:01:20.520> i<00:01:20.580> put<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.060> bt

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
the same thing so this time i put the bt

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.980 
the same thing so this time i put the bt
0<00:01:22.049> 16<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> multi<00:01:24.240> compound<00:01:24.689> tyre

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
0 16 and this is a multi compound tyre

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.929 
0 16 and this is a multi compound tyre
the<00:01:25.200> center<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.530> harder<00:01:25.890> than<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.490> shoulder

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
the center is harder than the shoulder

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.289 
the center is harder than the shoulder
so<00:01:27.180> we're<00:01:28.490> straight<00:01:29.490> line<00:01:29.790> where<00:01:30.060> won't

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
so we're straight line where won't

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.330 
so we're straight line where won't
square<00:01:30.630> off<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.049> quickly<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.560> then<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:32.040> sides

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
square off so quickly and then the sides

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.910 
square off so quickly and then the sides
are<00:01:32.640> much<00:01:33.420> softer<00:01:33.689> for<00:01:34.049> cornering<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.560> i<00:01:34.650> love

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
done is i put bar end mirrors on these

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.859 
done is i put bar end mirrors on these
are<00:01:58.860> inexpensive<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.549> i'm<00:02:00.450> going<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.630> change

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
are inexpensive and i'm going to change

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.649 
are inexpensive and i'm going to change
them<00:02:01.110> i'm<00:02:01.350> going<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.560> go<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:02.540> more<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.600> a

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
them i'm going to go to a more of a

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.179 
them i'm going to go to a more of a
rectangular<00:02:04.229> shape<00:02:04.619> i<00:02:04.770> think<00:02:04.979> would<00:02:05.070> be

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
rectangular shape i think would be

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.540 
rectangular shape i think would be
better<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:07.649> old<00:02:07.829> mirrors<00:02:08.190> gave<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.459> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
better and the old mirrors gave you the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.200 
better and the old mirrors gave you the
bad<00:02:09.149> blind<00:02:09.509> spots

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
bad blind spots

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.140 
bad blind spots
so<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:12.010> can<00:02:13.010> also<00:02:13.160> recommend<00:02:13.580> those<00:02:13.850> they<00:02:14.060> may

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
so I can also recommend those they may

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.030 
so I can also recommend those they may
not<00:02:14.300> be<00:02:14.420> legal<00:02:14.750> where<00:02:14.870> you're<00:02:14.960> from<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.440> I

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
not be legal where you're from and I

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.260 
not be legal where you're from and I
want<00:02:16.220> some<00:02:16.400> parts<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.730> Europe<00:02:16.970> they're<00:02:17.120> not

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
want some parts of Europe they're not

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.230 
want some parts of Europe they're not
but<00:02:17.660> here<00:02:18.080> they<00:02:18.230> are<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.650> I<00:02:18.850> also<00:02:19.850> want<00:02:20.210> a

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
but here they are and I also want a

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.000 
but here they are and I also want a
bigger<00:02:20.450> feel<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.840> view<00:02:21.020> this<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:21.380> just<00:02:21.590> really

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
bigger feel to view this is just really

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.880 
bigger feel to view this is just really
kind<00:02:22.160> of<00:02:22.280> small<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.930> lens<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:24.500> I'm<00:02:24.680> going<00:02:24.830> to

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
kind of small of a lens so I'm going to

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.240 
kind of small of a lens so I'm going to
go<00:02:24.950> with<00:02:25.070> a<00:02:25.130> different<00:02:26.000> style<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.690> think<00:02:26.960> but<00:02:27.800> it

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
go with a different style I think but it

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.800 
go with a different style I think but it
got<00:02:28.430> rid<00:02:28.610> of<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.730> blind<00:02:28.910> spots<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.570> they<00:02:29.750> do

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
got rid of the blind spots and they do

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.510 
got rid of the blind spots and they do
work<00:02:30.110> well<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.590> lot<00:02:30.860> better<00:02:31.010> than<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.340> thought

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
work well a lot better than I thought

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.740 
work well a lot better than I thought
and<00:02:33.310> missy<00:02:34.310> with<00:02:34.490> recently<00:02:35.270> here<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.920> put<00:02:36.920> some

and missy with recently here I put some

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.150 
and missy with recently here I put some

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
the frame slider which kept the case off

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.480 
the frame slider which kept the case off

and I replaced it with these and the

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.820 
and I replaced it with these and the
bracket<00:03:05.570> on<00:03:05.660> these<00:03:05.870> these<00:03:06.050> are<00:03:06.110> from<00:03:06.350> t-rex

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
bracket on these these are from t-rex

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.220 
bracket on these these are from t-rex
racing<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:07.580> bracket<00:03:07.970> on<00:03:08.060> these<00:03:08.300> is<00:03:08.660> steel

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
racing and the bracket on these is steel

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.080 
racing and the bracket on these is steel
where<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.010> other<00:03:10.130> ones<00:03:10.340> were<00:03:10.430> aluminum<00:03:10.880> I

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
where the other ones were aluminum I

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.060 
where the other ones were aluminum I
don't<00:03:11.780> think<00:03:11.840> this<00:03:12.050> bracket<00:03:12.500> if<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:12.860> know<00:03:12.950> in

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
don't think this bracket if you know in

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.910 
don't think this bracket if you know in
a<00:03:13.130> harder<00:03:13.460> impact<00:03:13.880> or<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.560> crash<00:03:15.560> where<00:03:15.800> you're

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
a harder impact or a crash where you're

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.010 
a harder impact or a crash where you're
moving<00:03:16.130> I<00:03:16.520> don't<00:03:16.850> think<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:17.210> would<00:03:17.360> break<00:03:17.810> off

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
moving I don't think it would break off

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.990 
moving I don't think it would break off
like<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.500> aluminum's<00:03:18.950> would<00:03:19.430> I<00:03:19.460> didn't<00:03:19.850> like

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
like the aluminum's would I didn't like

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.900 
like the aluminum's would I didn't like
that<00:03:20.150> when<00:03:20.300> I<00:03:20.330> got<00:03:20.390> them<00:03:20.980> but<00:03:21.980> I<00:03:22.040> just<00:03:22.580> replace

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
that when I got them but I just replace

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.790 
that when I got them but I just replace
these<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:23.420> I<00:03:23.600> like<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.200> look<00:03:24.320> of<00:03:24.440> them<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:24.650> lot

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
these and I like the look of them a lot

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.820 
these and I like the look of them a lot
better<00:03:25.010> they<00:03:25.430> weren't<00:03:25.580> very<00:03:25.820> expensive<00:03:26.390> and

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
better they weren't very expensive and

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.040 
better they weren't very expensive and
the<00:03:27.830> the<00:03:28.310> brackets<00:03:28.700> steel<00:03:28.940> so<00:03:29.300> i<00:03:29.510> think<00:03:29.720> it's<00:03:29.960> a

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
the the brackets steel so i think it's a

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.680 
the the brackets steel so i think it's a
it's<00:03:30.080> a<00:03:30.410> upgrade<00:03:30.650> all<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.160> way<00:03:31.250> around<00:03:31.690> but

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
it's a upgrade all the way around but

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.650 
it's a upgrade all the way around but
when<00:03:32.990> i<00:03:33.020> dropped<00:03:33.590> it<00:03:33.740> it<00:03:34.130> damaged<00:03:34.580> this<00:03:34.850> it

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
when i dropped it it damaged this it

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.800 
when i dropped it it damaged this it
