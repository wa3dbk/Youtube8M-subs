00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
six and I have to admit it you guys were

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.780 
six and I have to admit it you guys were
right<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.170> think<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.099> was<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> final<00:00:32.520> result

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
right I think it was the final result

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.069 
right I think it was the final result
that<00:00:32.910> most<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.210> us<00:00:33.300> thought<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.899> game

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
that most of us thought and the game

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.569 
that most of us thought and the game
probably<00:00:34.350> played<00:00:34.679> out<00:00:34.859> how<00:00:35.190> we<00:00:35.249> thought<00:00:35.429> it

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
probably played out how we thought it

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.880 
probably played out how we thought it
would<00:00:35.789> as<00:00:35.940> well<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.019> the<00:00:37.140> day<00:00:37.289> it<00:00:37.589> wasn't

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
would as well but on the day it wasn't

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.229 
would as well but on the day it wasn't
the<00:00:37.980> galaxy's<00:00:38.370> best<00:00:38.579> soccer

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the galaxy's best soccer

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.079 
the galaxy's best soccer
they<00:00:39.600> were<00:00:39.659> uncharacteristically<00:00:40.530> sloppy

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:41.089 
they were uncharacteristically sloppy

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:43.160 
they were uncharacteristically sloppy
especially<00:00:42.089> in<00:00:42.179> the<00:00:42.269> final<00:00:42.570> third<00:00:42.780> with<00:00:43.050> an

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
especially in the final third with an

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.229 
especially in the final third with an
Isuzu<00:00:43.409> making<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:43.949> passing<00:00:44.339> and<00:00:45.120> on<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
Isuzu making and passing and on a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.369 
Isuzu making and passing and on a
different<00:00:45.600> day<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.749> think<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:45.989> maybe<00:00:46.230> they

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
different day I think that maybe they

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.840 
different day I think that maybe they
put<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.710> game<00:00:46.920> away<00:00:47.159> a<00:00:47.190> little<00:00:47.370> bit<00:00:47.550> earlier

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
put that game away a little bit earlier

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.099 
put that game away a little bit earlier
because<00:00:47.940> they<00:00:48.210> did<00:00:48.390> get<00:00:48.539> into<00:00:48.690> some<00:00:48.899> good

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
because they did get into some good

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.200 
because they did get into some good
spots<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.190> field<00:00:50.429> but<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:50.609> ultimately

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
spots on the field but just ultimately

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.630 
spots on the field but just ultimately
weren't<00:00:51.420> clean<00:00:51.749> well<00:00:52.499> as<00:00:52.739> all<00:00:52.920> great<00:00:53.069> teams<00:00:53.339> do

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
weren't clean well as all great teams do

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.489 
weren't clean well as all great teams do
they<00:00:54.089> find<00:00:54.269> a<00:00:54.359> way<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.510> win<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.719> game<00:00:54.749> yeah<00:00:55.229> and

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:55.499 
they find a way to win the game yeah and

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:57.529 
they find a way to win the game yeah and
I<00:00:55.620> think<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:56.159> was<00:00:56.309> space<00:00:56.550> there<00:00:56.879> for<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
I think there was space there for the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.540 
I think there was space there for the
place<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.019> happen<00:00:58.379> but<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.949> timing<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.429> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
place to happen but the timing of the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.639 
place to happen but the timing of the
runs<00:00:59.760> was<00:00:59.940> off<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.539> timing<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.019> the<00:01:01.170> passes<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
runs was off the timing of the passes a

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.250 
runs was off the timing of the passes a
lot<00:01:01.979> of<00:01:02.159> the<00:01:02.280> touches<00:01:02.729> and<00:01:02.999> in<00:01:03.539> fact<00:01:03.780> they<00:01:04.080> had

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
lot of the touches and in fact they had

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.100 
lot of the touches and in fact they had
one<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.620> their<00:01:04.769> lowest<00:01:05.309> possession<00:01:05.880> ratios<00:01:06.299> in

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
one of their lowest possession ratios in

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.870 
one of their lowest possession ratios in
the<00:01:07.320> final<00:01:07.649> third<00:01:07.829> of<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> all<00:01:08.250> season<00:01:08.549> their

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the final third of the all season their

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.670 
the final third of the all season their
fourth<00:01:09.149> worst<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.560> they

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
fourth worst and it's just that they

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.700 
fourth worst and it's just that they
couldn't<00:01:11.009> get<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.219> combinations<00:01:11.850> right<00:01:12.119> so

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
couldn't get the combinations right so

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.440 
couldn't get the combinations right so
but<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> lot<00:01:13.829> of<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.219> credit<00:01:14.460> has<00:01:14.969> to<00:01:15.240> go<00:01:15.390> to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
but a lot of that credit has to go to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.929 
but a lot of that credit has to go to
New<00:01:15.630> England<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.439> they<00:01:16.770> did<00:01:17.070> enough<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.729> keep

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
New England and they did enough to keep

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.910 
New England and they did enough to keep
themselves<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.780> game<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.320> thought<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
themselves in this game I thought the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.499 
themselves in this game I thought the
way<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.189> they<00:01:20.310> managed<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.820> first<00:01:21.090> half<00:01:21.299> was

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
way that they managed the first half was

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.630 
way that they managed the first half was
really<00:01:21.899> good<00:01:22.110> because<00:01:22.649> they<00:01:23.039> still<00:01:23.340> managed

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
really good because they still managed

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.639 
really good because they still managed
to<00:01:23.729> find<00:01:23.969> some<00:01:24.060> bouts<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.689> possession<00:01:25.289> to<00:01:25.439> kind

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
to find some bouts of possession to kind

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.469 
to find some bouts of possession to kind
of<00:01:25.770> slow<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.159> game<00:01:26.310> down<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.579> little<00:01:26.820> bit<00:01:27.030> and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
of slow the game down a little bit and

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.060 
of slow the game down a little bit and
actually<00:01:28.079> even<00:01:28.259> when<00:01:28.439> they<00:01:28.530> went<00:01:28.710> down<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
actually even when they went down the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.789 
actually even when they went down the
goal<00:01:29.250> they<00:01:29.670> kept<00:01:29.969> themselves<00:01:30.149> alive<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.049> they

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
goal they kept themselves alive and they

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.289 
goal they kept themselves alive and they
scored<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.460> really<00:01:32.640> gave<00:01:32.820> themselves<00:01:33.000> a

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
scored and really gave themselves a

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.090 
scored and really gave themselves a
chance<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.719> got<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.990> little<00:01:34.350> bit<00:01:34.469> unlucky<00:01:34.890> not

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
chance and got a little bit unlucky not

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.029 
chance and got a little bit unlucky not
to<00:01:35.159> go<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.640> penalties<00:01:36.060> yeah<00:01:36.359> absolutely<00:01:37.039> when

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
to go to penalties yeah absolutely when

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.639 
to go to penalties yeah absolutely when
you<00:01:38.250> watch<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.969> game<00:01:39.270> there<00:01:40.020> were<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> lot<00:01:40.619> of

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
you watch this game there were a lot of

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.529 
you watch this game there were a lot of
individual<00:01:41.280> efforts<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.789> impressed<00:01:42.180> me<00:01:42.359> but

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
individual efforts that impressed me but

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:43.730 
individual efforts that impressed me but
who<00:01:42.689> stood<00:01:42.930> out<00:01:43.049> for<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.289> guys

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
who stood out for you guys

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.770 
who stood out for you guys
I<00:01:43.770> thought<00:01:44.429> Marcellus<00:01:44.939> Arvest<00:01:45.240> was<00:01:45.390> very<00:01:45.570> good

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
I thought Marcellus Arvest was very good

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.090 
I thought Marcellus Arvest was very good
in<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.929> night<00:01:46.049> for<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.289> galaxy<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.039> know

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
in the night for the galaxy and I know

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.529 
in the night for the galaxy and I know
that<00:01:47.399> they<00:01:47.549> weren't<00:01:47.700> as<00:01:47.880> good<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.149> possession

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
that they weren't as good in possession

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.209 
that they weren't as good in possession
as<00:01:48.630> they<00:01:48.719> usually<00:01:48.869> are<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:49.799> maybe<00:01:50.009> he

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
as they usually are and so maybe he

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:52.310 
as they usually are and so maybe he
wasn't<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.090> facet<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> game<00:01:52.049> as<00:01:52.289> much

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
wasn't in that facet of the game as much

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.560 
wasn't in that facet of the game as much
as<00:01:52.590> he<00:01:52.710> usually<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:54.030> me<00:01:54.119> he<00:01:54.270> was<00:01:54.390> still

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
as he usually is but for me he was still

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.929 
as he usually is but for me he was still
all<00:01:54.750> over<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.109> field<00:01:55.320> with<00:01:55.439> his<00:01:55.560> work<00:01:55.710> great

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
all over the field with his work great

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.889 
all over the field with his work great
constantly<00:01:56.939> breaking<00:01:57.299> up<00:01:57.390> plays<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
constantly breaking up plays on the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.870 
constantly breaking up plays on the
defensive<00:01:57.929> end<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.530> field<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.070> really

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
defensive end of the field and really

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.069 
defensive end of the field and really
for<00:02:00.060> me<00:02:00.179> I<00:02:00.210> thought<00:02:00.420> he<00:02:00.479> was<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.780> difference

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
for me I thought he was a difference

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.569 
for me I thought he was a difference
maker<00:02:01.289> in<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.859> center<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> part<00:02:02.429> for<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
maker in the center of the part for the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.109 
maker in the center of the part for the
galaxy

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
galaxy

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.669 
galaxy
yeah<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.270> mean<00:02:03.539> he<00:02:03.689> had<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> great<00:02:04.079> pass<00:02:04.289> for<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
yeah I mean he had a great pass for the

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.160 
yeah I mean he had a great pass for the
assist<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.549> winning<00:02:05.789> goal<00:02:05.990> for<00:02:06.990> me<00:02:07.140> I

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
assist on the winning goal for me I

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.870 
assist on the winning goal for me I
loved<00:02:07.619> watching<00:02:07.829> AJ<00:02:08.340> delegate

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
loved watching AJ delegate

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.730 
loved watching AJ delegate
this<00:02:09.120> game<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.510> thought<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.960> way<00:02:10.050> he<00:02:10.260> balanced

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
this game I thought the way he balanced

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.650 
this game I thought the way he balanced
out<00:02:10.860> their<00:02:11.040> team<00:02:11.280> he<00:02:11.520> sniffed<00:02:11.940> out<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.540> many

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
out their team he sniffed out so many

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.990 
out their team he sniffed out so many
defensive<00:02:13.290> plays<00:02:13.530> made<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.400> hard<00:02:14.610> on<00:02:14.730> teal

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
defensive plays made it hard on teal

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.930 
defensive plays made it hard on teal
Bunbury<00:02:15.210> made<00:02:15.960> it<00:02:16.080> hard<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.350> Kellan<00:02:16.740> row

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
Bunbury made it hard on Kellan row

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.150 
Bunbury made it hard on Kellan row
covered<00:02:17.940> for<00:02:18.120> Omar<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> few<00:02:18.870> times<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.470> then<00:02:20.010> he

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
covered for Omar a few times and then he

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.100 
covered for Omar a few times and then he
also<00:02:20.400> initiated<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:21.210> lot<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.450> their<00:02:21.570> attack<00:02:21.870> by

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
also initiated a lot of their attack by

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.350 
also initiated a lot of their attack by
how<00:02:22.320> he<00:02:22.380> passed<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:23.010> ball<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.760> just<00:02:24.210> thought

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
how he passed the ball so I just thought

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.360 
how he passed the ball so I just thought
it<00:02:24.480> was<00:02:24.570> such<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.840> in<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.230> big<00:02:25.440> game<00:02:25.650> AJ<00:02:26.100> really

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
it was such a in a big game AJ really

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.400 
it was such a in a big game AJ really
showed<00:02:26.610> up<00:02:26.760> big<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.150> was<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.510> clean<00:02:27.840> all<00:02:27.870> night

showed up big and was so clean all night

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.040 
showed up big and was so clean all night
maybe<00:02:28.530> he<00:02:28.800> may<00:02:28.980> have<00:02:29.100> had<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:30.050> game-changing

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
maybe he may have had the game-changing

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.800 
maybe he may have had the game-changing
play<00:02:31.410> early<00:02:32.280> on<00:02:32.610> Charlie<00:02:33.180> Davies<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.630> mean<00:02:33.750> it

way<00:03:07.170> more<00:03:07.200> plays<00:03:07.770> than<00:03:07.800> he<00:03:08.100> normally<00:03:08.280> does<00:03:08.730> but

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
way more plays than he normally does but

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.110 
way more plays than he normally does but
he<00:03:09.900> arranges<00:03:10.260> himself<00:03:10.710> to<00:03:10.920> catch<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.970> last

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
he arranges himself to catch the last

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.210 
he arranges himself to catch the last
pass<00:03:12.510> from<00:03:12.810> Sarvis<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.530> then<00:03:13.950> how<00:03:14.160> he

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
pass from Sarvis and then how he

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.070 
pass from Sarvis and then how he
arranges<00:03:14.670> his<00:03:14.790> feet<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.210> just<00:03:15.390> simply<00:03:15.810> put<00:03:16.050> it

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
arranges his feet to just simply put it

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.290 
arranges his feet to just simply put it
in<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.380> corner<00:03:16.740> was<00:03:17.370> fantastic<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.180> in<00:03:18.240> the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
in the corner was fantastic and in the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.580 
in the corner was fantastic and in the
end<00:03:18.450> he<00:03:18.960> made<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.230> difference

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
end he made the difference

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.200 
end he made the difference

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
possibly the best MLS team we've ever

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.090 
possibly the best MLS team we've ever
seen<00:03:39.380> it's<00:03:40.380> difficult<00:03:40.740> for<00:03:40.890> me<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.070> answer

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
seen it's difficult for me to answer

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.130 
seen it's difficult for me to answer
that<00:03:41.430> question<00:03:41.580> since<00:03:42.570> I've<00:03:42.750> only<00:03:42.900> been<00:03:43.020> in

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
that question since I've only been in

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.630 
that question since I've only been in
league<00:03:43.260> since<00:03:43.470> 2004<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.280> they're<00:03:44.370> obviously

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
league since 2004 and they're obviously

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.730 
league since 2004 and they're obviously
some<00:03:44.850> great<00:03:45.120> teams<00:03:45.470> especially<00:03:46.470> in<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.590> late

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
some great teams especially in the late

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.949 
some great teams especially in the late
nineties<00:03:47.160> yeah<00:03:47.550> but<00:03:48.270> since<00:03:48.450> I've<00:03:48.660> been<00:03:48.780> in<00:03:48.900> the

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
nineties yeah but since I've been in the

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.050 
nineties yeah but since I've been in the
league<00:03:49.140> I<00:03:49.290> think<00:03:49.320> that<00:03:49.709> they<00:03:49.800> are<00:03:49.830> and<00:03:50.730> I<00:03:50.820> think

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
league I think that they are and I think

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.760 
league I think that they are and I think
that<00:03:51.209> they<00:03:51.630> just<00:03:51.660> can<00:03:52.020> hurt<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.350> in<00:03:52.440> so<00:03:52.650> many

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
that they just can hurt you in so many

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.610 
that they just can hurt you in so many
different<00:03:53.190> ways<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:54.150> look<00:03:54.180> at<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.630> style<00:03:55.470> of

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
different ways you look at the style of

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.870 
different ways you look at the style of
play<00:03:55.860> now<00:03:55.890> they<00:03:56.160> play<00:03:56.340> an<00:03:56.459> entertaining

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
play now they play an entertaining

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.910 
play now they play an entertaining
soccer<00:03:57.240> they<00:03:57.540> can<00:03:57.660> possess<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.140> ball<00:03:58.290> when

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
soccer they can possess the ball when

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.170 
soccer they can possess the ball when
it's<00:03:59.040> not<00:03:59.250> on<00:03:59.280> for<00:03:59.730> them<00:03:59.850> on<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.000> night

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
it's not on for them on the night

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.490 
it's not on for them on the night
they're<00:04:00.630> so<00:04:00.840> dangerous<00:04:01.050> on<00:04:01.410> the

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
they're so dangerous on the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.840 
they're so dangerous on the
counter-attack<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:02.310> so<00:04:02.520> there's<00:04:02.700> such<00:04:02.820> a

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
counter-attack and so there's such a

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.520 
counter-attack and so there's such a
well-rounded<00:04:03.390> team<00:04:03.720> on<00:04:03.900> both<00:04:04.080> sides<00:04:04.320> of<00:04:04.470> the

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
well-rounded team on both sides of the

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.980 
well-rounded team on both sides of the
ball<00:04:04.740> very<00:04:05.400> organized<00:04:05.880> obviously<00:04:06.540> very<00:04:06.780> well

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
ball very organized obviously very well

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.400 
ball very organized obviously very well
coached

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
coached

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.170 
coached
so<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:07.890> would<00:04:08.220> say<00:04:08.370> for<00:04:08.550> my<00:04:08.640> time<00:04:08.850> in<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.060> league

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
so I would say for my time in the league

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.610 
so I would say for my time in the league
I<00:04:09.330> think<00:04:09.570> I<00:04:09.720> would<00:04:09.990> have<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.260> say<00:04:10.410> they're<00:04:10.590> the

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
I think I would have to say they're the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.980 
I think I would have to say they're the
best<00:04:10.709> team<00:04:10.920> I've<00:04:11.130> played<00:04:11.310> against<00:04:11.959> when<00:04:12.959> I

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
best team I've played against when I

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.990 
best team I've played against when I
look<00:04:13.200> at<00:04:13.380> it<00:04:13.410> they<00:04:13.770> scored<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.340> most<00:04:14.459> goals

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
look at it they scored the most goals

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.440 
look at it they scored the most goals
here<00:04:15.210> they<00:04:15.690> gave<00:04:15.840> up<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.320> fewest<00:04:17.030> +32<00:04:18.030> goal

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
here they gave up the fewest +32 goal

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.500 
here they gave up the fewest +32 goal
differential<00:04:19.190> MVP<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.400> league<00:04:20.510> probably

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
differential MVP of the league probably

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.530 
differential MVP of the league probably
the<00:04:21.630> best<00:04:21.840> coach<00:04:22.140> ever<00:04:22.820> so<00:04:23.820> there's<00:04:24.120> all<00:04:24.360> the

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
the best coach ever so there's all the

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.510 
the best coach ever so there's all the
stats<00:04:24.810> and<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.080> variables<00:04:25.590> but<00:04:26.130> like<00:04:26.370> you

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
stats and the variables but like you

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.940 
stats and the variables but like you
said<00:04:26.760> for<00:04:27.030> me<00:04:27.090> it's<00:04:27.570> how<00:04:27.930> they<00:04:28.170> play<00:04:28.530> their

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
said for me it's how they play their

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.440 
said for me it's how they play their
dynamic<00:04:29.610> in<00:04:29.730> the<00:04:29.820> attack

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
dynamic in the attack

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.330 
dynamic in the attack
they<00:04:30.690> don't<00:04:31.020> give<00:04:31.170> much<00:04:31.410> away<00:04:31.560> they<00:04:31.890> have<00:04:32.100> such

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
they don't give much away they have such

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.610 
they don't give much away they have such
balance<00:04:32.820> in<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.060> team<00:04:33.300> they<00:04:33.840> have<00:04:34.020> so<00:04:34.320> few

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
balance in the team they have so few

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.250 
balance in the team they have so few
weaknesses<00:04:34.890> and<00:04:35.550> so<00:04:36.120> for<00:04:36.390> me<00:04:36.510> this<00:04:36.900> is<00:04:36.960> the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
weaknesses and so for me this is the

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.590 
weaknesses and so for me this is the
best<00:04:37.440> team<00:04:37.620> ever<00:04:37.770> and<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:38.490> know<00:04:38.610> III<00:04:38.910> thought

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
best team ever and you know III thought

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.450 
best team ever and you know III thought
all<00:04:39.900> year<00:04:40.200> long<00:04:40.380> that<00:04:40.710> they<00:04:40.890> would<00:04:41.070> finally

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
all year long that they would finally
