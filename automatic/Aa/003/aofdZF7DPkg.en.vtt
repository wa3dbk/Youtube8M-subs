00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.650 
here that I've put business cards in so
like<00:02:44.500> I<00:02:44.650> said<00:02:44.860> that<00:02:45.010> sir<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.820> did<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.209> job<00:02:46.239> for

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
like I said that sir it did the job for

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.740 
like I said that sir it did the job for
me<00:02:46.840> I<00:02:47.500> was<00:02:48.130> debating<00:02:48.580> whether<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.180> go<00:02:49.420> for<00:02:49.660> the

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
me I was debating whether to go for the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.900 
me I was debating whether to go for the
slightly<00:02:50.140> bigger<00:02:50.800> case<00:02:51.190> which<00:02:51.459> i<00:02:51.640> think<00:02:51.700> is

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
slightly bigger case which i think is

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.479 
slightly bigger case which i think is
called<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.630> flipside<00:02:53.200> 350<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.160> they<00:02:54.280> do<00:02:54.340> a

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
called the flipside 350 and they do a

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.960 
called the flipside 350 and they do a
flipside<00:02:54.820> 400<00:02:55.750> but<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:57.070> was<00:02:57.520> a<00:02:57.550> bit<00:02:57.760> concerned

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
flipside 400 but I was a bit concerned

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.120 
flipside 400 but I was a bit concerned
that<00:02:58.450> that<00:02:58.750> wouldn't<00:02:59.170> be<00:02:59.440> I<00:02:59.620> wouldn't<00:02:59.890> be<00:02:59.980> able

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
that that wouldn't be I wouldn't be able

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.470 
that that wouldn't be I wouldn't be able
to<00:03:00.190> take<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.550> one<00:03:00.700> as<00:03:00.880> hang<00:03:01.510> luggage

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
to take that one as hang luggage

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.680 
to take that one as hang luggage
to<00:03:02.690> be<00:03:03.010> so<00:03:04.010> this<00:03:04.190> one<00:03:04.459> certainly<00:03:04.940> went<00:03:05.239> through

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
to be so this one certainly went through

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.530
