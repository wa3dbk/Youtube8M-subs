well<00:00:01.260> I<00:00:01.290> started<00:00:01.740> my<00:00:01.949> reactor<00:00:02.700> back<00:00:02.879> up<00:00:03.149> again

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
well I started my reactor back up again

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.840 
well I started my reactor back up again
after<00:00:03.659> getting<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:04.170> bit<00:00:04.319> of<00:00:04.440> advice<00:00:04.740> from<00:00:05.250> the

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
after getting a bit of advice from the

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.709 
after getting a bit of advice from the
vortex<00:00:06.150> heat<00:00:06.720> exchanger<00:00:07.440> group<00:00:07.680> in<00:00:08.670> fact<00:00:08.940> the

vortex heat exchanger group in fact the

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.080 
vortex heat exchanger group in fact the
problem<00:00:10.170> appears<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.650> be<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.309> had<00:00:11.580> vacuum

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
problem appears to be that I had vacuum

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.690 
problem appears to be that I had vacuum
leak<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:13.110> may<00:00:13.259> also<00:00:13.469> have<00:00:13.860> been<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.280> my<00:00:14.429> fuel

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
leak it may also have been that my fuel

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.200 
leak it may also have been that my fuel
is<00:00:14.849> too<00:00:15.030> cold<00:00:15.299> it's<00:00:15.630> still<00:00:15.960> about<00:00:16.850> minus<00:00:17.850> 10

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
is too cold it's still about minus 10

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.000 
is too cold it's still about minus 10
here<00:00:18.240> which<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.199> think<00:00:21.590> 15<00:00:22.590> degrees

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
here which is I think 15 degrees

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.040 
here which is I think 15 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:00:23.670> or<00:00:23.699> something<00:00:24.119> like<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.420> anyway

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
Fahrenheit or something like that anyway

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.800 
Fahrenheit or something like that anyway
pretty<00:00:25.769> cold<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.539> I<00:00:27.539> put<00:00:28.170> my<00:00:28.410> fuel<00:00:29.810> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
pretty cold and I put my fuel the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.720 
pretty cold and I put my fuel the
bubbler<00:00:31.199> here<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:32.070> bucket<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.550> hot<00:00:32.669> water

bubbler here in a bucket of hot water
just<00:00:33.149> trying<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.899> heat<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.079> bill<00:00:34.350> up<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.620> wee

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
just trying to heat the bill up a wee

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.520 
just trying to heat the bill up a wee
bit<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.880> then<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.239> also<00:00:36.600> check<00:00:36.870> for<00:00:36.899> vacuum

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
bit and then I also check for vacuum

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.670 
bit and then I also check for vacuum
leaks<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.219> I've<00:00:38.460> had<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.030> put<00:00:39.300> pipe<00:00:39.840> straps<00:00:40.320> on

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
leaks and I've had to put pipe straps on

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.680 
leaks and I've had to put pipe straps on
these<00:00:41.040> joints<00:00:42.020> because<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.800> if<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.789> blow<00:00:45.390> into

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
these joints because the if I blow into

these joints because the if I blow into
the<00:00:45.930> blower<00:00:46.170> into<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> bubbler<00:00:47.160> hose<00:00:47.399> there

which is this fellow right here I blow
in<00:00:52.020> there<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.289> could<00:00:52.680> hear<00:00:52.860> water<00:00:53.160> or<00:00:53.520> rather

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
in there I could hear water or rather

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.110 
in there I could hear water or rather
air<00:00:54.000> leaking<00:00:54.510> out<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.890> lid<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> bubbler

which<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.570> actually<00:00:58.079> called<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.859> clean-out<00:00:59.719> for

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
which is actually called a clean-out for

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.950 
which is actually called a clean-out for
sewage<00:01:01.170> piping<00:01:02.030> both<00:01:03.030> ends<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> hose

sewage piping both ends of the hose
where<00:01:04.409> I've<00:01:04.559> not<00:01:04.799> put<00:01:05.040> pipe<00:01:05.549> straps<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.270> and

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
where I've not put pipe straps on and

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.080 
where I've not put pipe straps on and
then<00:01:07.650> only<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:08.070> two<00:01:08.280> strapping<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.909> out

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
then only have two strapping that out

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.109 
then only have two strapping that out
could<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.159> eliminate<00:01:11.159> some<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.729> vacuum

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
could I eliminate some of the vacuum

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.800 
could I eliminate some of the vacuum
problems<00:01:12.659> or<00:01:13.070> pressure<00:01:14.070> trap<00:01:15.049> now

and<00:01:25.580> shut<00:01:26.150> there's<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.509> better<00:01:26.750> resistance<00:01:27.350> now

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
and shut there's a better resistance now

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.700 
and shut there's a better resistance now
not<00:01:28.670> having<00:01:28.940> had<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.360> add<00:01:29.509> any<00:01:29.869> more<00:01:29.960> gasoline

not having had to add any more gasoline
into<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.490> bubbler<00:01:31.909> I<00:01:32.180> filled<00:01:33.049> up<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.409> vacuum

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
into the bubbler I filled up the vacuum

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.800 
into the bubbler I filled up the vacuum
a<00:01:33.920> little<00:01:34.159> better<00:01:34.340> than<00:01:34.610> before<00:01:34.759> warmed<00:01:35.630> up

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
a little better than before warmed up

the fuel event it hasn't been sitting in
that<00:01:37.670> water<00:01:38.000> long<00:01:38.560> started<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:39.680> up<00:01:39.800> and<00:01:40.009> it

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
that water long started it up and it

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.070 
that water long started it up and it
started<00:01:40.850> just<00:01:41.060> fine<00:01:41.299> and<00:01:41.570> this<00:01:41.630> is<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.840> day

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
started just fine and this is a day

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.249 
started just fine and this is a day
after<00:01:42.320> it<00:01:42.710> wouldn't<00:01:43.100> start<00:01:43.420> so<00:01:44.420> temperature

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
after it wouldn't start so temperature

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.090 
after it wouldn't start so temperature
is<00:01:45.290> no<00:01:45.470> different<00:01:45.920> I<00:01:47.380> had<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.470> stop<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:48.890> motor

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
is no different I had to stop the motor

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.700 
is no different I had to stop the motor
again<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:50.060> only<00:01:50.179> ran<00:01:50.509> well<00:01:51.020> I<00:01:51.050> stopped<00:01:51.410> it<00:01:51.590> at

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
again it only ran well I stopped it at

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.900 
again it only ran well I stopped it at
ten<00:01:51.920> minutes<00:01:52.220> I<00:01:52.310> don't<00:01:52.369> know<00:01:52.490> how<00:01:52.580> long<00:01:52.700> it

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
ten minutes I don't know how long it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.870 
ten minutes I don't know how long it
would<00:01:53.000> a<00:01:53.060> run<00:01:53.300> but<00:01:54.050> fuel<00:01:54.740> was<00:01:55.250> getting<00:01:55.580> into

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
would a run but fuel was getting into

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.580 
would a run but fuel was getting into
the<00:01:56.060> reactor<00:01:56.840> again<00:01:57.140> I<00:01:57.170> don't<00:01:57.320> know<00:01:57.409> if<00:01:57.500> you

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
the reactor again I don't know if you

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.770 
the reactor again I don't know if you
can<00:01:57.710> see<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:58.100> in<00:01:58.250> this<00:01:58.340> light<00:01:58.670> there's<00:01:59.630> sort

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
can see that in this light there's sort

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.410 
can see that in this light there's sort
of<00:01:59.869> a<00:01:59.990> milky<00:02:00.530> gray<00:02:00.979> deposit<00:02:01.789> right<00:02:01.970> there<00:02:02.240> in

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
of a milky gray deposit right there in

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.029 
of a milky gray deposit right there in
the<00:02:02.569> hose<00:02:02.810> that<00:02:03.740> is<00:02:04.149> oil<00:02:05.149> water<00:02:05.929> gasoline<00:02:06.770> mix

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
the hose that is oil water gasoline mix

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.520 
the hose that is oil water gasoline mix
it<00:02:07.550> looks<00:02:07.789> a<00:02:07.909> bit<00:02:07.940> like<00:02:08.119> a<00:02:09.160> mudslide<00:02:10.160> anyway<00:02:10.819> I

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
it looks a bit like a mudslide anyway I

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.720 
it looks a bit like a mudslide anyway I
didn't<00:02:12.530> want<00:02:12.680> that<00:02:12.769> to<00:02:12.920> get<00:02:12.980> interactor<00:02:13.610> and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
didn't want that to get interactor and

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.100 
didn't want that to get interactor and
screw<00:02:13.970> things<00:02:14.180> up<00:02:14.390> so<00:02:14.600> I<00:02:14.630> stopped

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
screw things up so I stopped

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.080 
screw things up so I stopped
however<00:02:15.500> we<00:02:15.980> are<00:02:16.190> getting<00:02:16.610> magnetic

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
however we are getting magnetic

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.850 
however we are getting magnetic
deflection<00:02:17.330> as<00:02:17.840> I'm<00:02:18.019> holding<00:02:18.350> this<00:02:18.470> composite

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
deflection as I'm holding this composite

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.420 
deflection as I'm holding this composite
is<00:02:19.130> pointing<00:02:19.489> north<00:02:19.700> now<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.620> as<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.650> hold<00:02:22.250> it

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
is pointing north now and as I hold it

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.840 
is pointing north now and as I hold it
under<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:23.480> reactor<00:02:24.079> I'm<00:02:24.260> getting<00:02:24.850> deflection

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
under the reactor I'm getting deflection

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.650 
under the reactor I'm getting deflection
which<00:02:26.510> was<00:02:26.750> not<00:02:26.900> there<00:02:27.140> yesterday<00:02:28.480> there's<00:02:29.480> a

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
which was not there yesterday there's a

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.979 
which was not there yesterday there's a
rearrangement<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.100> reactor<00:02:31.810> turn<00:02:32.810> it

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
rearrangement of the reactor turn it

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.400 
rearrangement of the reactor turn it
sort<00:02:33.380> of<00:02:33.440> more<00:02:33.590> vertical

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
sort of more vertical

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:43.120 
sort of more vertical
and<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.950> just<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.850> droll

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:50.360 

that's<00:02:43.610> regular<00:02:43.940> north

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.720 

just<00:02:50.670> like<00:02:50.879> them

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
just like them

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:04.680 
just like them
our<00:02:53.120> v

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.170 

there<00:03:04.900> we<00:03:05.050> go<00:03:05.230> it<00:03:05.980> does<00:03:06.160> work<00:03:06.460> I<00:03:06.670> still<00:03:06.970> have

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
there we go it does work I still have

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.920 
there we go it does work I still have
two<00:03:07.390> pretty<00:03:07.600> serious<00:03:09.480> problems<00:03:10.480> with<00:03:10.690> the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
two pretty serious problems with the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.440 
two pretty serious problems with the
vacuum<00:03:11.470> leak

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.089 

one<00:03:14.599> of<00:03:14.690> my<00:03:14.780> intake<00:03:15.080> hose<00:03:15.319> is<00:03:15.530> actually

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
one of my intake hose is actually

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.000 
one of my intake hose is actually
wobbling<00:03:16.880> slightly<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:17.450> has<00:03:17.630> been<00:03:17.840> taped<00:03:18.140> but

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
wobbling slightly it has been taped but

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.410 
wobbling slightly it has been taped but
as<00:03:19.160> soon<00:03:19.340> as<00:03:19.430> it<00:03:19.520> heats<00:03:19.670> up<00:03:19.880> which<00:03:20.060> is<00:03:20.209> going<00:03:20.360> to

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
as soon as it heats up which is going to

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.570 
as soon as it heats up which is going to
melt<00:03:20.660> actually<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:21.650> thing<00:03:21.830> suddenly<00:03:22.069> sounds

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
melt actually this thing suddenly sounds

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.270 
melt actually this thing suddenly sounds
better<00:03:22.790> just<00:03:23.450> what<00:03:23.630> I<00:03:23.660> was<00:03:23.840> reporting<00:03:24.140> it<00:03:24.470> it

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
better just what I was reporting it it

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.210 
better just what I was reporting it it
sounds<00:03:25.580> better<00:03:25.730> now<00:03:26.000> anyway<00:03:26.890> that's<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:27.980> sort

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
sounds better now anyway that's the sort

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.010 
sounds better now anyway that's the sort
of<00:03:28.340> again<00:03:28.610> just<00:03:28.880> a<00:03:28.970> proof-of-concept<00:03:29.330> to<00:03:29.900> make

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
of again just a proof-of-concept to make

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.020 
of again just a proof-of-concept to make
sure<00:03:30.170> that<00:03:30.349> the<00:03:30.470> thing<00:03:30.680> works<00:03:30.950> it's<00:03:31.580> running

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
sure that the thing works it's running

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.340 
sure that the thing works it's running
off<00:03:32.209> of<00:03:32.239> oil<00:03:33.140> water<00:03:34.100> gasoline<00:03:35.030> mix<00:03:35.360> same<00:03:36.140> as

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
off of oil water gasoline mix same as

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.699 
off of oil water gasoline mix same as
the<00:03:36.730> yesterday<00:03:38.110> but<00:03:39.110> it's<00:03:39.410> definitely

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
the yesterday but it's definitely

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.400 
the yesterday but it's definitely
improving<00:03:40.519> and<00:03:41.000> its<00:03:41.120> performance<00:03:41.480> the

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
improving and its performance the

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.800 
improving and its performance the
problem<00:03:42.950> I'm<00:03:43.130> having<00:03:43.310> primarily<00:03:44.180> is<00:03:44.450> still

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
problem I'm having primarily is still

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.040 
problem I'm having primarily is still
fuel<00:03:45.260> flashing<00:03:45.860> up<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.160> bubbler<00:03:46.519> line<00:03:46.750> so<00:03:47.750> I

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
fuel flashing up the bubbler line so I

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.740 
fuel flashing up the bubbler line so I
said<00:03:48.410> I'm<00:03:49.040> going<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.400> have<00:03:49.459> to<00:03:49.790> move<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.269> a

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
said I'm going to have to move to a

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.090 
said I'm going to have to move to a
carbureted<00:03:51.590> heat<00:03:52.549> reactor<00:03:53.470> try<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:54.620> fix<00:03:54.830> that

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
carbureted heat reactor try and fix that

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.300 
carbureted heat reactor try and fix that
problem<00:03:55.310> because<00:03:55.910> that<00:03:56.860> somehow<00:03:57.860> all<00:03:58.100> of<00:03:58.130> the

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
problem because that somehow all of the

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.160 
problem because that somehow all of the
splash<00:03:58.730> or<00:03:59.000> esters<00:03:59.420> that<00:03:59.630> I've<00:03:59.750> been<00:03:59.900> putting

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
splash or esters that I've been putting

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.289 
splash or esters that I've been putting
together<00:04:00.319> don't<00:04:00.680> seem<00:04:00.920> to<00:04:01.010> do<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.160> trick<00:04:01.549> and

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
together don't seem to do the trick and

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.759 
together don't seem to do the trick and
I<00:04:02.450> need<00:04:02.630> to<00:04:02.720> be<00:04:02.840> able<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:03.110> rely<00:04:03.350> on<00:04:03.380> this<00:04:03.590> in

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
I need to be able to rely on this in

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.100 
I need to be able to rely on this in
learning

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110
