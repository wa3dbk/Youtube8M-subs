00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.400 

that<00:00:02.190> way<00:00:02.429> you<00:00:02.490> have<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:03.030> lot<00:00:03.720> more<00:00:03.959> support<00:00:04.319> on

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
that way you have a lot more support on

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.170 
that way you have a lot more support on
the<00:00:04.529> bottom<00:00:04.680> than<00:00:05.100> on<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.339> top<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:05.850> it<00:00:05.970> allows

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
the bottom than on the top and it allows

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.030 
the bottom than on the top and it allows
you<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.509> bring<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.839> engine<00:00:07.379> without

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
you to bring the engine without

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.940 
you to bring the engine without
collapsing<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.880> bottom<00:00:09.500> it's<00:00:10.500> something

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
collapsing the bottom it's something

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.740 
collapsing the bottom it's something
that<00:00:11.099> happened<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.580> you'll<00:00:12.030> also<00:00:12.269> notice

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
that happened and you'll also notice

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.020 
that happened and you'll also notice
you'll<00:00:13.290> see<00:00:13.530> when<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.710> pass<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.219> around<00:00:14.340> with

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
you'll see when I pass it around with

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.050 
you'll see when I pass it around with
the<00:00:15.150> shiny<00:00:15.450> spot<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.650> sort<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.130> not<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:17.850> much

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
the shiny spot the sort of not so much

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.599 
the shiny spot the sort of not so much
in<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.330> middle<00:00:18.660> mhm<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.439> tend<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.980> support<00:00:20.400> it

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
in the middle mhm I tend to support it

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.420 
in the middle mhm I tend to support it
on<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.150> sides<00:00:21.420> very<00:00:22.350> little<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.980> milk<00:00:23.189> in

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
on the sides very little in the milk in

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.279 
on the sides very little in the milk in
the<00:00:23.490> middle<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.910> weakest<00:00:24.240> point<00:00:24.570> if<00:00:25.080> you

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
the middle of the weakest point if you

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.279 
the middle of the weakest point if you
hit<00:00:25.470> too<00:00:25.500> hard<00:00:25.920> it'll<00:00:26.910> collapse<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.810> problem

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
hit too hard it'll collapse the problem

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.359 
hit too hard it'll collapse the problem
so<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.920> also<00:00:29.519> move<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.939> not<00:00:30.150> only<00:00:30.630> light<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.619> move

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
so I also move it not only light I move

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.440 
so I also move it not only light I move
it<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.600> also<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:35.270> you<00:00:36.270> do

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
it like this but also like that you do

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.889 
it like this but also like that you do
the<00:00:36.570> two<00:00:36.719> again<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:38.040> there's<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.730> start<00:00:39.719> like

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
the two again so there's this start like

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.750 
the two again so there's this start like
this<00:00:40.170> yeah<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.920> then<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.160> move<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.610> little

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
this yeah and then I move it a little

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.750 
this yeah and then I move it a little
bit<00:00:41.969> over<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.079> every<00:00:43.530> course<00:00:43.829> is

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
bit over so that every course is

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.610 
bit over so that every course is
supported<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.539> slightly<00:00:45.960> different<00:00:46.230> point

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
supported a slightly different point

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.979 
supported a slightly different point
that<00:00:47.039> way<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.460> insurance<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.450> thing<00:00:48.809> will

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
that way of insurance the thing will

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.350 
that way of insurance the thing will
stay<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.500> round<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.340> your<00:00:50.520> brandishing

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
stay really round and your brandishing

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.090 
stay really round and your brandishing
the<00:00:51.480> bottom<00:00:51.840> at<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:51.989> same<00:00:52.079> time<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.860> comes

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the bottom at the same time so it comes

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.139 
the bottom at the same time so it comes
out<00:00:53.250> very<00:00:53.280> smoothly

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
out very smoothly

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.470 
out very smoothly
is<00:00:54.300> there<00:00:54.539> any<00:00:54.719> temperament<00:00:58.910> comfort<00:00:59.910> for<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
is there any temperament comfort for the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.780 
is there any temperament comfort for the
metal<00:01:03.229> when<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.260> start<00:01:04.650> us<00:01:04.799> up<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.729> you

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
metal when you start us up to you if you

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.080 
metal when you start us up to you if you
want<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:07.140> meal<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:08.130> easier<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.030> you

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
want to do a meal it's easier but you

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.370 
want to do a meal it's easier but you
have<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> very<00:01:09.570> inner<00:01:09.930> peace<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.650> tend<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:12.090> meal

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
have a very inner peace I tend to a meal

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.469 
have a very inner peace I tend to a meal
when<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.530> make<00:01:13.710> most<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.189> our<00:01:14.340> work<00:01:14.610> we<00:01:15.030> rarely

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
when we make most of our work we rarely

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.350 
when we make most of our work we rarely
a<00:01:15.750> meal<00:01:15.990> more<00:01:16.259> than<00:01:16.439> once<00:01:16.850> we're<00:01:17.850> trying<00:01:18.150> not

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
a meal more than once we're trying not

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.740 
a meal more than once we're trying not
to<00:01:18.420> anneal<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.860> all<00:01:20.070> if<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.729> let's<00:01:21.420> start

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
to anneal at all if we can let's start

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.170 
to anneal at all if we can let's start
with<00:01:21.990> an<00:01:22.110> annealed<00:01:22.439> sheet<00:01:23.180> sometimes

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
with an annealed sheet sometimes

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.640 
with an annealed sheet sometimes
especially<00:01:24.570> something<00:01:25.020> like<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.409> single

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
especially something like the single

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.160 
especially something like the single
loops<00:01:26.009> because<00:01:26.729> you're<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.750> far<00:01:27.990> you

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
loops because you're going so far you

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.770 
loops because you're going so far you
have<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.590> anneal<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.210> but<00:01:30.210> we<00:01:30.299> only<00:01:30.329> anneal

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
have to anneal it but we only anneal

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.510 
have to anneal it but we only anneal
those<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> couple<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.619> times<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:32.280> what

silver light to save us from the

silver light to save us from the
recession<00:02:04.540> but<00:02:05.540> if<00:02:05.690> you<00:02:05.810> do<00:02:05.990> it<00:02:06.110> very<00:02:06.140> very

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
recession but if you do it very very

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.790 
recession but if you do it very very
carefully<00:02:07.040> and<00:02:07.580> slowly<00:02:08.030> it's<00:02:09.020> amazing<00:02:09.649> how

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
carefully and slowly it's amazing how

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.560 
carefully and slowly it's amazing how
far<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.130> can<00:02:10.280> push<00:02:10.340> this<00:02:10.670> material<00:02:11.210> before<00:02:11.330> it

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
far you can push this material before it

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.039 
far you can push this material before it
work<00:02:11.780> harder<00:02:12.080> to<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.380> point
