00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 i am simon new must have done today 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.840
 it's just about hidden sugar in 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.940
 foodstuffs 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.220
 that's nothing new, though 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.809
 The industry is very sophisticated about that 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.820
 again and again, even in crystal 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.710
 to accommodate food is for 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.389
 For example, march her last often 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.910
 prison in the supermarket I wanted 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.890
 as usual after these relatively healthy 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.050
 looking cornflakes are grabbing run 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.000
 Flexen in the and my grip went 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.439
 already so high in the shelf and in the last 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.330
 But then again I have exactly 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.369
 how the packaging looked you have 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.260
 analyzed the ingredients and it fell to me 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.690
 on second or third place what 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.850
 sugar was naturally added it means 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.730
 you can already know about the design 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.980
 relatively healthy yes a relatively healthy 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.600
 miss the face, which of course is deceptive 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.829
 and here for example here with these 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.899
 I do not want now by itself out 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.270
 come that the relatively good values 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.680
 they are usually without added sugar 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.539
 stand here again if we are here 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.430
 Looking at the nutrition we see that 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.079
 of course, a certain amount of 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.300
 carbohydrates and sugar 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.699
 is just having to do with it 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.379
 Of course, that also knows itself 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.270
 already containing sugar means that has the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.010
 actually if you are very fine 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.110
 snapped taste buds too 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.490
 in natural sweetness and quite right 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.229
 just when you combine it with 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.670
 fruit and so on and so on why 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.970
 should there also crystal sugar in it 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.530
 his 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.869
 that means my tip ever here 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.460
 on the complex you buy will see 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.710
 that's just a lot better 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.360
 thing if you decide what to do 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.830
 which is simply cheap and at the end without 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.930
 Sugar I think has this dork 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.820
 a euro 9 would have cost the others 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.630
 somehow euro 50 cost and become 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.130
 been with sugar 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.930
 I'm the even cheaper here 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.770
 the rest also do that 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.780
 Here is such a thing 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.369
 you will be surprised with sugar though 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.710
 you do not expect it at all 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.479
 especially bold so that's here 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.100
 there is also still keen on it 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.780
 Of course I go out that it then on 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.340
 the end is not sharp that we know in 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.450
 germany but if we are here 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.990
 look at the ingredients 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.970
 paprika eggplant hot peppers 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.549
 vegetable oil sugar so ultimately 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.439
 The order can already be seen 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.840
 4% vegetable oil it means you can under 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.340
 four percent sugar can only be included 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.960
 but you do not know how 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.729
 Exactly maybe it is too 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.860
 four percent maybe 13 maybe 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.689
 But two percent will be sugar too 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.670
 added not quite so dramatically 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.950
 because it just as I said in one 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.850
 order of magnitude less than 4 you can do that 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.740
 from the ingredients 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.450
 derive but still expected 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.640
 not with it and I'll tell you right away 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.810
 with this are still relatively good 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.850
 further, there are a lot of other things 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.490
 where much more sugar is included 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.720
 for example here fruit cocktail so what 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.310
 maybe you have sometime 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.690
 buy I have with me in 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.980
 cabinet did not know that 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.540
 I still have something like that I would have 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.550
 half an eternity there is already 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.840
 light sugared means we know 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.580
 already here was with Chris partly even 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.010
 sweetened why should actually 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.080
 fruits relatively good or ripe fruits 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.430
 somehow be treated after 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.680
 So personally, I do not see any 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.750
 Of course, there is also an opportunity to do so 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.130
 that here beside sugar also something else 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.170
 is included and that is one too 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.850
 thing where many people keep coming back 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.500
 namely, they are very small letters 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.010
 Here I do not need to go to the camera 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.220
 hold 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.800
 glucose fructose syrup nothing else 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.930
 as a liquid sugar like will be like that 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.460
 which as worthy sugar syrup used as 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.470
 then you only see in value and at the end 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.270
 she calls the word sugar in between 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.170
 a very long word because you fall as well 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.450
 again and again 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.940
 one thinks yes is sugar free otherwise would be 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.320
 because it directly sugar never worth 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.870
 Sugar syrup is also a good camouflage 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.400
 just like glucose fructose syrup still 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.470
 a few other things so the industry 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.320
 industry's very refined, the 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.090
 just knows how to get the consumer 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.400
 when he gives him impulse buyers in the supermarket 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.560
 well outsmarting can also do just now 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.120
 the design always goes back 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.070
 assuming that must be healthy too 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.720
 that they are healthy or that here 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.250
 are unhealthy and at the frost 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.900
 you just know these searched 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.370
 I would never have thought that here 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.570
 It is actually a good product 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.670
 means I can actually only you 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.200
 recommend you look what you are buying 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.460
 really it's not just about it 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.410
 the sugar it is also about others 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.270
 additions and then there's some 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.770
 really things where you always think that 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.450
 you have to resist something like that 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.370
 example gummi bears are yes 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.680
 known to be full of sugar though 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.730
 There are also many alternatives 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.220
 sugar free gummy bears in fact 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.800
 cola ganski are also latino free 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.570
 really tasty just taste right 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.100
 I like to eat a bag in the evening 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.410
 with sarah together that's natural 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.890
 also a certain reward at the end of the 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.960
 day 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.460
 and exactly on the things right in this 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.290
 of course you always think again 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.090
 you would have to give up while there is 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.269
 no reason to renounce what 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.160
 at the end completely unproblematic 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.870
 All right, see you next 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.759
 video the link to the clock in the 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.150
 video description many greetings yours 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.150
