00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.869 
I said a significant number of walk-ons

are in this class you know guys what do
you<00:00:05.940> really<00:00:06.180> feel<00:00:06.569> about<00:00:06.600> these<00:00:07.020> walk-ons

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
you really feel about these walk-ons

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.230 
you really feel about these walk-ons
they're<00:00:07.740> one<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.040> most<00:00:08.240> underrated

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
they're one of the most underrated

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.390 
they're one of the most underrated
players<00:00:09.870> on<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.139> entire<00:00:10.410> team<00:00:10.679> what<00:00:11.250> are<00:00:11.340> they

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
players on the entire team what are they

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.799 
players on the entire team what are they
going<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.580> contribute<00:00:12.000> this<00:00:12.090> year<00:00:12.330> right<00:00:12.630> I

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
going to contribute this year right I

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.509 
going to contribute this year right I
think<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.200> biggest<00:00:13.410> walk<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.130> that's

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
think the biggest walk on that that's

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.640 
think the biggest walk on that that's
here<00:00:14.759> right<00:00:14.790> now<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.299> Fluellen<00:00:15.870> we<00:00:16.500> did

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
here right now is Fluellen we did

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.080 
here right now is Fluellen we did
talking<00:00:17.010> about<00:00:17.190> about<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.670> little<00:00:17.880> bit<00:00:17.970> earlier

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
talking about about a little bit earlier

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.000 
talking about about a little bit earlier
but<00:00:18.390> he's<00:00:18.690> six<00:00:18.930> five<00:00:19.140> he's<00:00:19.410> by<00:00:19.560> far<00:00:19.830> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
but he's six five he's by far the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.160 
but he's six five he's by far the
tallest<00:00:20.460> wide<00:00:20.640> receiver<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.630> think<00:00:21.990> he's

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
tallest wide receiver so I think he's

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.400 
tallest wide receiver so I think he's
not<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.740> fast<00:00:23.160> but<00:00:23.670> once<00:00:24.240> he<00:00:24.330> gets<00:00:24.480> downfield

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
not that fast but once he gets downfield

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.990 
not that fast but once he gets downfield
all<00:00:25.680> they<00:00:25.890> got<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.340> throw<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.670> up<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.789> him

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
all they got to do is throw it up to him

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.250 
all they got to do is throw it up to him
and<00:00:27.060> he'll<00:00:27.210> be<00:00:27.330> able<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.539> go<00:00:27.660> up<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.109> get<00:00:28.199> it

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
and he'll be able to go up and get it

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.050 
and he'll be able to go up and get it
over<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.619> cornerback<00:00:28.980> or<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> safety<00:00:29.490> well<00:00:29.880> big

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
over a cornerback or a safety well big

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.400

be trying to compete Jesse Roy also one

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.060 
be trying to compete Jesse Roy also one
of<00:00:53.910> those<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:55.079> know<00:00:55.199> maybe<00:00:55.710> not<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
of those so you know maybe not the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.619 
of those so you know maybe not the
biggest<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.699> names<00:00:56.910> didn't<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> lot

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
biggest of the names didn't have a lot

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.450 
biggest of the names didn't have a lot
of<00:00:57.660> stars<00:00:57.989> after<00:00:58.379> his<00:00:58.469> name<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.859> think<00:00:59.070> he

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
of stars after his name but I think he

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.500 
of stars after his name but I think he
could<00:00:59.609> be<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.730> guy<00:00:59.879> who<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.090> come<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.390> play

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
could be a guy who can come in and play

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.349 
could be a guy who can come in and play
