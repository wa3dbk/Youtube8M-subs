00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.199
 long live this time you thefts i 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:05.840
 continue to introduce you to the plugin 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.709
 put letters on the server riot 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:11.709
 percent in 9 ti 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.379
 Now it is a package received for CSKA 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.289
 very interesting opportunity 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:19.599
 it is indirect 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.829
 so let's see what this optimization 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.199
 such 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.720
 do not take a sign steel measures I do not 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.329
 prescribes 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:31.630
 teams 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.660
 we skip the first line 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.130
 put square brackets yo writes times 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.130
 l 0 271 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.630
 that 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.510
 Here is such a team 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.730
 so what is next 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.510
 we indicate in the third line 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.000
 the distance that it will be 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.650
 work 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.830
 the capital limit is 5 meters that is but i 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.480
 put 3 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.330
 and fourth line 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.830
 here you must specify 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.790
 subcategories however will be aes 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.180
 triggered alarm she 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.590
 can trigger players 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.320
 trigger animals 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.480
 on 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.560
 monsters that appear at night 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.350
 can simple ti work 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.260
 ordinary yanao monsters simultaneous 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
 and it can work on from all at once 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.370
 and here let's 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.710
 yet gorkom 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.640
 i.e. players 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.610
 i write player 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.540
 so what does a player mean 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.160
 and all my alarm is ready 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.670
 what is not reported system message 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.890
 i.e 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.970
 what does not say 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.900
 fucking breakage i'm talking 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.620
 well, sorry 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.530
 so that the signal 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.630
 reached our beginners who 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.280
 successfully located 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.420
 and we need a switch 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.250
 he will just give a signal 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.550
 I have already laid 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.490
 red dust track that is 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.699
 changes my signal beacons 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.839
 with 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.549
 alarms 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.269
 all connected all this together 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.519
 so let's see and also this 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.849
 will work i come closer or 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.559
 signals implementation triggered 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.509
 I will refuse it 2 st 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.509
 expert per year and all this is not so difficult 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.749
 use use maybe 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.029
 in warsaw point 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.419
 can not even go there more 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:40.249
 interesting than not 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:42.799
 thank you all, goodbye to us was 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:43.109
