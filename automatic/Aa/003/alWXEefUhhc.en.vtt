00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
bolt up which gets this thing to flap

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.320 
bolt up which gets this thing to flap
and<00:00:47.680> get<00:00:47.800> out<00:00:47.950> of<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.100> way<00:00:48.250> and<00:00:48.760> you<00:00:48.940> just<00:00:49.090> take

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
and get out of the way and you just take

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.970 
and get out of the way and you just take
your<00:00:49.480> linkage<00:00:49.810> move<00:00:50.470> it<00:00:50.620> over<00:00:50.830> real<00:00:51.010> quick<00:00:52.980> see

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
your linkage move it over real quick see

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.550 
your linkage move it over real quick see
I<00:00:54.010> think<00:00:54.310> that's<00:00:54.490> where<00:00:54.670> I<00:00:54.700> had<00:00:54.940> it<00:00:55.410> then<00:00:56.410> your

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
I think that's where I had it then your

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.770 
I think that's where I had it then your
boat<00:00:56.740> will<00:00:56.890> come<00:00:57.070> from<00:00:57.190> pump<00:00:57.490> underneath<00:00:57.940> and

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
boat will come from pump underneath and

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.479 
boat will come from pump underneath and
this<00:00:58.930> time<00:00:59.230> it's<00:00:59.410> a<00:00:59.500> good<00:00:59.530> idea<00:00:59.770> to<00:01:00.010> put<00:01:00.220> just<00:01:00.400> a

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
this time it's a good idea to put just a

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.400 
this time it's a good idea to put just a
little<00:01:00.520> bit<00:01:00.760> of<00:01:00.940> Loctite<00:01:01.060> on<00:01:01.300> it<00:01:01.540> so<00:01:02.140> that<00:01:02.290> we

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
little bit of Loctite on it so that we

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.630 
little bit of Loctite on it so that we
aren't<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:02.710> word<00:01:02.860> about<00:01:02.980> backing<00:01:03.400> out<00:01:03.489> and

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
aren't the word about backing out and

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.770 
aren't the word about backing out and
falling<00:01:04.000> while<00:01:04.180> you're<00:01:04.269> on<00:01:04.360> a<00:01:04.390> ride<00:01:04.659> because

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
falling while you're on a ride because

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.880 
falling while you're on a ride because
you<00:01:04.960> definitely<00:01:05.259> don't<00:01:05.350> want<00:01:05.530> to<00:01:05.560> have<00:01:05.679> that

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
you definitely don't want to have that

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.679 
you definitely don't want to have that
now<00:01:06.310> if<00:01:06.369> you<00:01:06.460> put<00:01:06.670> this<00:01:06.789> back<00:01:06.999> to<00:01:07.210> stock<00:01:07.450> which

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
now if you put this back to stock which

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:09.270 
now if you put this back to stock which
normally<00:01:08.140> if<00:01:08.259> the<00:01:08.409> covers<00:01:08.770> here<00:01:08.920> this<00:01:09.130> is

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
normally if the covers here this is

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.950 
normally if the covers here this is
exactly<00:01:09.429> where<00:01:09.819> it<00:01:09.880> would<00:01:09.969> line<00:01:10.149> up<00:01:10.329> so<00:01:10.869> you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
exactly where it would line up so you

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.380 
exactly where it would line up so you
can<00:01:11.079> see<00:01:11.259> it's<00:01:11.770> hitting<00:01:12.039> it's<00:01:12.909> not<00:01:13.119> going<00:01:13.329> to

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
can see it's hitting it's not going to

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.999 
can see it's hitting it's not going to
work<00:01:13.569> you're<00:01:14.049> going<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.229> have<00:01:14.289> to<00:01:14.469> shave<00:01:14.829> this

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
work you're going to have to shave this

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.370 
work you're going to have to shave this
down<00:01:15.069> or<00:01:15.850> do<00:01:16.149> what<00:01:16.299> I<00:01:16.329> did<00:01:16.450> I<00:01:16.899> kind<00:01:17.079> of<00:01:17.200> just

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.370 
anyways let me slide this back where it
belongs

I'm<00:02:04.380> not<00:02:04.619> going<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.830> tighten<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.070> up<00:02:05.250> all<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
I'm not going to tighten this up all the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.800 
I'm not going to tighten this up all the
way<00:02:05.640> just<00:02:05.850> now<00:02:06.030> because<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.450> little<00:02:06.630> piece

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
way just now because this little piece

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.300 
way just now because this little piece
because<00:02:07.049> it's<00:02:07.170> modified<00:02:07.440> moves<00:02:07.799> around<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.190> I

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
because it's modified moves around so I

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.199 
because it's modified moves around so I
have<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.459> get<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> little<00:02:08.670> pair<00:02:08.850> of<00:02:08.880> pliers<00:02:09.090> and

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
have to get a little pair of pliers and

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.490 
have to get a little pair of pliers and
hold<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.690> keep<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.929> from<00:02:10.050> turning<00:02:10.200> when<00:02:10.470> I

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
hold that to keep it from turning when I

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500 
hold that to keep it from turning when I
tighten<00:02:10.739> this<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.190> down<00:02:11.340> here<00:02:11.550> then<00:02:12.360> it's

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
tighten this up down here then it's

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.170 
tighten this up down here then it's
assuming<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.170> all<00:02:13.320> tightened<00:02:13.560> up<00:02:14.180> now

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
assuming this is all tightened up now

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.390 
assuming this is all tightened up now
you<00:02:15.239> can<00:02:15.510> see<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:16.350> gives<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.709> just<00:02:17.010> enough

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
you can see it gives you just enough

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.850 
you can see it gives you just enough
clearance<00:02:18.000> here<00:02:18.440> go<00:02:19.440> ahead<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.620> shift

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
clearance here go ahead and shift

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.470 
clearance here go ahead and shift
without<00:02:20.250> any<00:02:20.400> kind<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.730> issues<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.120> then<00:02:21.360> you

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
without any kind of issues and then you

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.410 
without any kind of issues and then you
can<00:02:21.600> just<00:02:21.750> adjust<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.170> linkage<00:02:22.970> or<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.239> peg

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
can just adjust the linkage or the peg

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.120 
can just adjust the linkage or the peg
here<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.870> whatever<00:02:25.080> your<00:02:25.350> desired<00:02:25.680> height<00:02:25.890> is

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
here to whatever your desired height is

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.940 
here to whatever your desired height is
and<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.670> gives<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.360> moto<00:02:27.900> gp<00:02:28.350> or<00:02:28.620> reverse

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
and that gives you moto gp or reverse

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.770 
and that gives you moto gp or reverse
shifting<00:02:29.400> just<00:02:29.910> make<00:02:30.060> sure<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.300> don't<00:02:30.420> put

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
shifting just make sure you don't put

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.430 
shifting just make sure you don't put
the<00:02:31.220> shift<00:02:32.220> lever<00:02:32.430> here<00:02:32.700> up<00:02:33.209> so<00:02:33.720> high<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.230> it

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
the shift lever here up so high that it

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.110 
the shift lever here up so high that it
hits<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.860> frame<00:02:35.130> I've<00:02:35.430> just<00:02:35.670> kind<00:02:35.850> of<00:02:35.880> thrown

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
hits the frame I've just kind of thrown

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.340 
hits the frame I've just kind of thrown
it<00:02:36.269> in<00:02:36.390> there<00:02:36.510> but<00:02:36.660> I<00:02:36.720> need<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.930> go<00:02:37.019> down<00:02:37.170> one
