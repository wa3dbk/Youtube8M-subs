00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.340
 Life is always full of hope, but you need to find it yourself. 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.180
 We saw hope, but going abroad is not an easy task for us. 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.780
 But if we don't take action, we will never know that it is hope! 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.260
 When we first received stem cell therapy, 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.829
 We are not sure if it is effective and whether it is thrown into the sea. 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.880
 But we know we have to seize this hope, so we get a return. 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:50.220
 I am Eddie Streck, Kaden, 11 years old, with cerebral palsy. 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.949
 At the same time suffering from optic nerve hypoplasia and speech apraxia. 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.400
 He is suffering from these diseases. His biological mother is a drug addict. 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.940
 Kaden is a very premature baby. 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.780
 Depending on individual differences, the symptoms of each person with cerebral palsy are different. 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.280
 For Kaden, this mainly affects his lower body and left arm. 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.219
 So he can't sit, 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:25.530
 You can't walk, you can't walk to the bathroom yourself. 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.969
 Also can't eat for yourself. Because he has visual impairment, of course, 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:32.229
 There are limits to doing a lot of things, and he can't walk. 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.060
 After receiving stem cell treatment, he has made great changes in all aspects. 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.270
 This is our second stem cell treatment. Kaden couldn't see anything before. 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.609
 The first time we experienced the obvious changes brought about by stem cell therapy was 48 hours after the first stem cell treatment. 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:55.139
 That day, I contacted my husband via Skype as usual. 

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:59.979
 Kaden is in the same room, listening to us, then he climbs to the front of the computer screen 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.469
 Touching the computer screen and saying "Dad" 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:10.049
 We realized that he was able to start seeing things, and this only happened 48 hours after the first stem cell injection. 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.140
 His previous vision was about 20/800, and the other eye was about 20/600, but now it is 20/40. 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.210
 He can clearly see things within 5 feet (about 1.52 meters). 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.210
 Everything has changed since his vision improved. He began to read. 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.770
 He began to describe everything he saw. 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.630
 Another great gain from treatment is his language ability. 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.220
 Three years ago, he could only say 10 words. But now, after he can say 2000 words, I stopped counting. 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.080
 He can now speak 4 to 5 words at the same time. 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.430
 He talks about things he likes all the time. The improvement of language ability is like an unexpected prize for us. 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.190
 We never expected it, it suddenly appeared, and brought us surprises. (Visitor: So is vision or communication ability changed first?) 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.280
 I am not sure whether vision or language skills will change first. But everything has changed. Kaden can now stand up and walk on his own. 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.140
 He can go to the bathroom himself or eat for himself. 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.630
 He can drink with a straw. All these changes are so amazing. 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.250
 Itâ€™s all amazing because we invested in that short time. 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.680
 I think that the treatment of Beike is very advanced. It includes a series of rehabilitation treatments. 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.710
 When we were looking for stem cell therapy, there were many institutions that did not provide rehabilitation. 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.310
 They also do not provide functional medicine. 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.180
 I believe that a large number of assisted rehabilitation treatments provided by Beike 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.660
 To do what they need to do, are promoting stem cells to their fullest effect, 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.660
 Including physical therapy, occupational therapy and spa 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.820
 I can feel it from the first time I receive stem cell treatment. 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.760
 This series of rehabilitation treatments greatly support the role of stem cells in the body. 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.540
 Although we didn't see the treatment effect right away, 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.650
 But Kaden insists on rehabilitation every day to see that stem cells work slowly every day. 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.160
 This is exciting because as long as you persist in your hopes and work hard 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.900
 You can see the possibility of hope, in addition to the fact that you accept the cerebral palsy 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.640
 In fact, there are still many choices that can change the status quo. 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.790
 Kaden: Better, better Kaden. 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.930
 Mom: Yes. Better, better Kaden. Yes.
