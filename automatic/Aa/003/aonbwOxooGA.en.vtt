hello<00:00:00.450> everyone<00:00:00.810> and<00:00:00.840> welcome<00:00:01.140> in<00:00:01.860> this<00:00:01.979> video

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
hello everyone and welcome in this video

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.500 
hello everyone and welcome in this video
I'm<00:00:02.370> going<00:00:02.460> to<00:00:02.550> be<00:00:02.610> explaining<00:00:03.090> engine

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
I'm going to be explaining engine

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.660 
I'm going to be explaining engine
balancing<00:00:04.200> now<00:00:04.440> one<00:00:04.890> of<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.040> most<00:00:05.220> important

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
balancing now one of the most important

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.540 
balancing now one of the most important
factors<00:00:06.089> in<00:00:06.120> building<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.200> reliable<00:00:07.799> engine

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
factors in building a reliable engine

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.890 
factors in building a reliable engine
that's<00:00:08.730> going<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:08.940> last<00:00:09.090> for<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.480> good<00:00:09.719> amount

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
that's going to last for a good amount

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.780 
that's going to last for a good amount
of<00:00:09.990> time<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.130> make<00:00:11.250> sure<00:00:11.280> that<00:00:11.460> all<00:00:11.610> the

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
of time is to make sure that all the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.520 
of time is to make sure that all the
forces<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.480> engine<00:00:12.630> are<00:00:12.929> balanced<00:00:13.410> out

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
forces in that engine are balanced out

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.259 
forces in that engine are balanced out
so<00:00:14.219> that's<00:00:14.580> what<00:00:14.700> I'm<00:00:14.759> going<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.910> be<00:00:15.000> talking

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
so that's what I'm going to be talking

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.000 
so that's what I'm going to be talking
about<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.630> video<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.680> then<00:00:16.800> I'm<00:00:16.920> going

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
about in this video and then I'm going

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.680 
about in this video and then I'm going
to<00:00:17.070> go<00:00:17.220> into<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.550> bit<00:00:17.699> more<00:00:17.730> detail<00:00:18.000> in<00:00:18.480> some

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
to go into a bit more detail in some

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.750 
to go into a bit more detail in some
future<00:00:18.930> videos<00:00:19.350> but<00:00:19.890> basically<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.369> forces

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
future videos but basically the forces

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.460 
future videos but basically the forces
that<00:00:20.789> you're<00:00:21.000> going<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.180> want<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.480> balance<00:00:22.109> out

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
that you're going to want to balance out

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.029 
that you're going to want to balance out
are<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.949> rotational<00:00:23.490> mass<00:00:23.750> forces<00:00:25.039> relating

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
are the rotational mass forces relating

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.710 
are the rotational mass forces relating
the<00:00:26.160> rotational<00:00:26.640> mass<00:00:26.789> forces<00:00:27.210> relating<00:00:27.570> to

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
the rotational mass forces relating to

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.109 
the rotational mass forces relating to
reciprocating<00:00:28.680> mass<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.130> then<00:00:29.640> forces

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
reciprocating mass and then forces

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.790 
reciprocating mass and then forces
relating<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.720> firing<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.320> individual

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
relating to the firing of the individual

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.729 
relating to the firing of the individual
cylinders<00:00:32.450> so<00:00:33.450> let's<00:00:34.110> get<00:00:34.260> started<00:00:34.620> with

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
cylinders so let's get started with

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.370 
cylinders so let's get started with
rotational<00:00:35.430> mass<00:00:35.780> so<00:00:36.780> basically<00:00:37.170> what<00:00:37.290> we

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
rotational mass so basically what we

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.690 
rotational mass so basically what we
want<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.770> here<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.309> want<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.550> balance

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
want to do here is we want to balance

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.150 
want to do here is we want to balance
all<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> forces<00:00:39.480> all<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.379> moments<00:00:40.800> and

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
all of the forces all of the moments and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.920 
all of the forces all of the moments and
we<00:00:41.280> want<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.610> center<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.940> gravity<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:42.690> on

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
we want the center of gravity to be on

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.010 
we want the center of gravity to be on
the<00:00:43.140> axis<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.620> rotation<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.700> means<00:00:45.020> if

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the axis of rotation so that means if

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.200 
the axis of rotation so that means if
this<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.350> your<00:00:46.620> axis<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.980> rotation<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.789> want

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
this is your axis of rotation you want

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.760 
this is your axis of rotation you want
the<00:00:48.300> center<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.600> gravity<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.960> be<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.500> so

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the center of gravity to be on this so

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.439 
the center of gravity to be on this so
that<00:00:49.920> as<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.250> rotates<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:51.149> don't<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.420> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
that as it rotates you don't have a

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.000 
that as it rotates you don't have a
force<00:00:51.780> that's<00:00:52.020> pulling<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:53.360> mass<00:00:54.360> around<00:00:55.010> so

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
force that's pulling this mass around so

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.010 
force that's pulling this mass around so
basically<00:00:56.910> what<00:00:57.090> we've<00:00:57.210> got<00:00:57.390> here<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.840> we're

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
basically what we've got here is we're

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.510 
basically what we've got here is we're
going<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.199> be<00:00:58.260> rotating<00:00:58.770> about<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.280> line

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
going to be rotating about this line

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.360 
going to be rotating about this line
here<00:01:00.090> we've<00:01:00.660> got<00:01:00.750> these<00:01:00.899> two<00:01:01.140> masses<00:01:01.590> here<00:01:01.980> so

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
here we've got these two masses here so

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.149 
here we've got these two masses here so
you<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.879> see<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.199> moment<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.650> balanced

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
you can see that the moment is balanced

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.490 
you can see that the moment is balanced
because<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:06.030> rotates<00:01:06.299> these<00:01:07.049> are<00:01:07.409> going

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
because as this rotates these are going

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.230 
because as this rotates these are going
to<00:01:07.590> want<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.830> come<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.729> that

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
to want to come in like that and that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.240 
to want to come in like that and that
force<00:01:09.540> balances<00:01:10.260> out<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.770> center<00:01:10.950> there

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
force balances out on the center there

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.990 
force balances out on the center there
now<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.240> forces<00:01:12.869> however<00:01:13.460> of<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.790> mass

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
now the forces however of that mass

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.580 
now the forces however of that mass
spinning<00:01:15.450> around<00:01:15.570> are<00:01:16.110> always<00:01:16.350> going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.530> be

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
spinning around are always going to be

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.710 
spinning around are always going to be
pointing<00:01:17.009> outward<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.150> mass<00:01:18.390> bins

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
pointing outward so as that mass bins

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.300 
pointing outward so as that mass bins
around<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.560> force<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.009> going<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.189> be

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
around that force is going to be

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.580 
around that force is going to be
pointing<00:01:20.670> out<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:21.990> you're<00:01:22.290> going<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.470> have

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
pointing out and so you're going to have

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.380 
pointing out and so you're going to have
an<00:01:22.740> unbalanced<00:01:23.220> force<00:01:23.280> there<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.240> that

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
an unbalanced force there and if that

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.359 
an unbalanced force there and if that
were<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:24.869> example<00:01:25.290> your<00:01:25.409> crankshaft<00:01:25.770> well

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
were for example your crankshaft well

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.679 
were for example your crankshaft well
your<00:01:26.580> engine<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.119> be<00:01:27.210> shaking<00:01:27.420> like

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
your engine is going to be shaking like

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.190 
your engine is going to be shaking like
crazy

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
crazy

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.960 
crazy
so<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.619> want<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.770> get<00:01:28.920> rid<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.820> okay

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
so you want to get rid of that so okay

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.810 
so you want to get rid of that so okay
let's<00:01:30.659> take<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.170> here<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.920> mass<00:01:32.189> here<00:01:32.549> and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
let's take this here this mass here and

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.030 
let's take this here this mass here and
put<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.090> down<00:01:33.240> here<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.990> way<00:01:34.140> our<00:01:34.290> forces<00:01:34.770> are

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
put it down here that way our forces are

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.350 
put it down here that way our forces are
now<00:01:35.369> balanced<00:01:35.790> down

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
now balanced down

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.469 
now balanced down
well<00:01:37.079> our<00:01:37.380> center<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.950> gravity<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.610> now<00:01:39.210> also

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
well our center of gravity is now also

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.350 
well our center of gravity is now also
on<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.829> axis<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.220> rotation<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.759> that's<00:01:42.090> good

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
on the axis of rotation so that's good

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.130 
on the axis of rotation so that's good
the<00:01:42.810> problem<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.409> with<00:01:43.920> these<00:01:44.100> two<00:01:45.110> we're<00:01:46.110> just

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the problem is with these two we're just

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.600 
the problem is with these two we're just
going<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.439> call<00:01:46.560> them<00:01:46.710> Pistons<00:01:47.100> here<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.460> just

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
going to call them Pistons here and just

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.280 
going to call them Pistons here and just
as<00:01:47.820> an<00:01:48.149> example<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:48.630> basically<00:01:49.110> these<00:01:49.229> two

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
as an example but basically these two

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.639 
as an example but basically these two
masses<00:01:50.000> rotating<00:01:51.000> around<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.200> moment

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
masses rotating around the the moment

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.030 
masses rotating around the the moment
this<00:01:53.310> force<00:01:53.700> wants<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.420> rotate<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.259> about<00:01:55.860> this

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
this force wants to rotate in about this

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.560 
this force wants to rotate in about this
center<00:01:56.280> here<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.790> force<00:01:57.060> wants<00:01:57.450> to

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
center here and this force wants to

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.899 
center here and this force wants to
rotate<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.110> about<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.979> Center<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.610> as<00:01:59.729> it

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
rotate in about this Center so as it

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.940 
rotate in about this Center so as it
does<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.119> as<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.810> were<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.079> rotate<00:02:01.259> you

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
does that as this were to rotate you

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.620 
does that as this were to rotate you
have<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.219> rocking<00:02:02.670> couple<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.180> basically<00:02:03.420> what

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
have a rocking couple and basically what

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.420 
have a rocking couple and basically what
this<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.930> going<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.140> want<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.320> do<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.890> kind<00:02:05.399> of

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
this is going to want to do is kind of

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.029 
this is going to want to do is kind of
go<00:02:05.549> like<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:06.000> as<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.630> rotates<00:02:06.780> around<00:02:07.229> kind

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
go like this as it rotates around kind

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.880 
go like this as it rotates around kind
of<00:02:08.069> make<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.340> cone<00:02:08.700> shape<00:02:09.379> so<00:02:10.379> that's<00:02:10.619> not

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
of make this cone shape so that's not

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.059 
of make this cone shape so that's not
good<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.400> what<00:02:11.879> can<00:02:12.000> we<00:02:12.060> do<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.480> counter

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
good so what can we do to counter

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.890 
good so what can we do to counter
act<00:02:13.219> that<00:02:13.549> well<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:14.269> can<00:02:14.450> stick<00:02:14.689> some

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
act that well you can stick some

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.619 
act that well you can stick some
counterweights<00:02:15.379> on<00:02:15.620> both<00:02:16.370> ends<00:02:16.819> so<00:02:17.239> once<00:02:17.480> you

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
counterweights on both ends so once you

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.539 
counterweights on both ends so once you
do<00:02:17.750> that<00:02:17.959> all<00:02:18.290> of<00:02:18.769> your<00:02:18.859> forces<00:02:19.189> are<00:02:19.400> now

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
do that all of your forces are now

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.130 
do that all of your forces are now
balanced<00:02:20.030> out<00:02:20.180> you've<00:02:20.420> got<00:02:20.540> green<00:02:20.810> here<00:02:21.079> and

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
balanced out you've got green here and

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.420 
balanced out you've got green here and
green<00:02:21.319> here<00:02:21.530> going<00:02:21.980> in<00:02:22.069> opposite<00:02:22.370> directions

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
green here going in opposite directions

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.880 
green here going in opposite directions
those<00:02:22.969> cancel<00:02:23.359> out<00:02:23.450> these<00:02:23.989> cancel<00:02:24.590> out<00:02:24.709> and

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
those cancel out these cancel out and

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.830 
those cancel out these cancel out and
then<00:02:25.340> your<00:02:25.459> moments<00:02:25.909> about<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.269> center<00:02:26.540> those

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
then your moments about the center those

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.330 
then your moments about the center those
cancel<00:02:27.290> out<00:02:27.379> moments<00:02:27.859> about<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.069> center<00:02:28.310> of

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
cancel out moments about the center of

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.849 
cancel out moments about the center of
those<00:02:28.489> cancel<00:02:28.879> out<00:02:28.969> and<00:02:29.269> your<00:02:30.140> axis<00:02:30.590> your

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:30.859 
those cancel out and your axis your

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.259 
those cancel out and your axis your
center<00:02:31.159> of<00:02:31.189> gravity<00:02:31.579> is<00:02:31.670> on<00:02:31.790> your<00:02:31.879> axis<00:02:32.150> of

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
center of gravity is on your axis of

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.630 
center of gravity is on your axis of
rotation<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:32.959> this<00:02:33.409> is<00:02:33.560> dynamically<00:02:34.159> balanced

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
rotation so this is dynamically balanced

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.640 
rotation so this is dynamically balanced
and<00:02:35.209> that'd<00:02:35.329> be<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.510> great<00:02:35.689> start<00:02:36.230> for<00:02:36.530> your

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
and that'd be a great start for your

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.309 
and that'd be a great start for your
engine<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:38.180> next<00:02:38.450> thing<00:02:38.599> we<00:02:38.720> want<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.989> look<00:02:39.079> at

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
engine the next thing we want to look at

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.129 
engine the next thing we want to look at
is<00:02:39.530> reciprocating<00:02:40.400> mass<00:02:40.579> and<00:02:41.000> this<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:42.019> going

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:42.139 
is reciprocating mass and this is going

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:43.209 
is reciprocating mass and this is going
to<00:02:42.230> be<00:02:42.290> something<00:02:42.500> that<00:02:42.859> I'm<00:02:42.950> going<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.099> have

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:43.219 
to be something that I'm going to have

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.280 
to be something that I'm going to have
to<00:02:43.280> get<00:02:43.400> into<00:02:43.609> a<00:02:43.639> bit<00:02:43.790> more<00:02:43.819> detail<00:02:44.359> in<00:02:44.599> future

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
to get into a bit more detail in future

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.710 
to get into a bit more detail in future
videos<00:02:45.739> but<00:02:45.950> basically<00:02:46.450> what<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.480> want<00:02:47.689> to

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
videos but basically what you want to

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.449 
videos but basically what you want to
balance<00:02:47.900> out<00:02:48.200> here<00:02:48.470> is<00:02:48.620> you've<00:02:49.040> got<00:02:49.189> all<00:02:49.310> these

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
balance out here is you've got all these

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.520 
balance out here is you've got all these
items<00:02:50.000> within<00:02:50.480> your<00:02:50.689> engine<00:02:50.989> that<00:02:51.409> are

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
items within your engine that are

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.559 
items within your engine that are
reciprocating<00:02:52.189> the<00:02:52.310> biggest<00:02:52.639> one<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:53.419> most

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
reciprocating the biggest one the most

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.780 
reciprocating the biggest one the most
important<00:02:54.139> is<00:02:54.230> going<00:02:54.409> to<00:02:54.470> be<00:02:54.560> your<00:02:54.680> Pistons<00:02:55.129> so

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
important is going to be your Pistons so

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.550 
important is going to be your Pistons so
your<00:02:56.030> pistons<00:02:56.359> are<00:02:56.480> pretty<00:02:56.750> large<00:02:56.900> pretty

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
your pistons are pretty large pretty

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.170 
your pistons are pretty large pretty
heavy<00:02:57.819> relative<00:02:58.819> to<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.060> other

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
heavy relative to the other

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.050 
heavy relative to the other
reciprocating<00:03:00.139> items<00:03:00.439> such<00:03:01.340> as<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:01.879> could

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
reciprocating items such as you could

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.530 
reciprocating items such as you could
have<00:03:02.180> push<00:03:02.419> rods<00:03:02.689> or<00:03:03.500> your<00:03:03.709> valves<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:05.480> are

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
have push rods or your valves that are

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.970 
have push rods or your valves that are
going<00:03:05.689> to<00:03:05.780> be<00:03:05.870> moving<00:03:06.319> up<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.650> down

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
going to be moving up and down

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.339 
going to be moving up and down
so<00:03:07.310> this<00:03:07.909> reciprocating<00:03:08.780> mess<00:03:08.930> it's<00:03:09.169> going<00:03:09.290> to

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
so this reciprocating mess it's going to

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.080 
so this reciprocating mess it's going to
go<00:03:09.470> up<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:09.889> down<00:03:10.010> you<00:03:10.400> want<00:03:10.579> to<00:03:10.609> balance<00:03:10.970> those

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
go up and down you want to balance those

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.539 
go up and down you want to balance those
forces<00:03:11.450> out<00:03:11.689> if<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:11.989> just<00:03:12.200> have<00:03:12.379> a<00:03:12.799> single

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
forces out if you just have a single

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.149 
forces out if you just have a single
cylinder<00:03:13.849> engine<00:03:14.000> you've<00:03:14.480> got<00:03:14.629> that<00:03:14.780> one

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
cylinder engine you've got that one

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.409 
cylinder engine you've got that one
piston<00:03:16.159> moving<00:03:16.340> up<00:03:16.549> and<00:03:16.669> down<00:03:16.730> you're<00:03:17.329> gonna

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:17.419 
piston moving up and down you're gonna

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:18.969 
piston moving up and down you're gonna
have<00:03:17.569> a<00:03:17.629> force<00:03:17.870> on<00:03:18.049> that<00:03:18.079> engine<00:03:18.349> going<00:03:18.620> up<00:03:18.799> and

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:18.979 
have a force on that engine going up and

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:21.009 
have a force on that engine going up and
then<00:03:19.190> down<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.549> then<00:03:19.609> up<00:03:19.699> and<00:03:20.000> then<00:03:20.090> down<00:03:20.209> so

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
then down and then up and then down so

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.330 
then down and then up and then down so
for<00:03:21.199> example<00:03:21.560> here<00:03:21.709> where<00:03:21.859> you've<00:03:21.979> got<00:03:22.129> these

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
for example here where you've got these

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.349 
for example here where you've got these
two<00:03:23.349> Pistons<00:03:24.349> moving<00:03:24.560> up<00:03:24.799> and<00:03:24.919> down<00:03:25.010> as<00:03:25.729> those

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
two Pistons moving up and down as those

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.509 
two Pistons moving up and down as those
move<00:03:26.540> up<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:26.900> down<00:03:27.079> those<00:03:27.590> forces<00:03:27.979> counteract

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
move up and down those forces counteract

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.629 
move up and down those forces counteract
each<00:03:28.669> other<00:03:28.940> so<00:03:29.629> it<00:03:29.750> balances<00:03:30.169> out<00:03:30.470> so<00:03:31.430> there's

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
each other so it balances out so there's

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.309 
each other so it balances out so there's
several<00:03:31.760> types<00:03:32.120> of<00:03:32.239> forces<00:03:32.599> basically

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
several types of forces basically

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.960 
several types of forces basically
they're<00:03:33.739> just<00:03:33.919> defined<00:03:34.250> as<00:03:34.459> primary

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
they're just defined as primary

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.879 
they're just defined as primary
secondary<00:03:35.209> tertiary<00:03:35.659> and<00:03:36.079> what<00:03:36.500> that<00:03:36.650> means

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
secondary tertiary and what that means

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.330 
secondary tertiary and what that means
is<00:03:37.099> how<00:03:37.310> often<00:03:37.699> it<00:03:37.819> occurs<00:03:37.879> per<00:03:38.629> revolution<00:03:39.340> so

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
is how often it occurs per revolution so

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.399 
is how often it occurs per revolution so
for<00:03:40.909> one<00:03:41.060> revolution<00:03:41.569> of<00:03:41.659> this<00:03:41.810> crankshaft

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
for one revolution of this crankshaft

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.979 
for one revolution of this crankshaft
the<00:03:43.099> primary<00:03:43.519> forces<00:03:43.879> are<00:03:44.209> basically<00:03:44.750> that

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
the primary forces are basically that

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.110 
the primary forces are basically that
piston<00:03:45.500> that<00:03:45.889> piston<00:03:46.220> is<00:03:46.280> going<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.459> go<00:03:46.579> up<00:03:46.790> and

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
piston that piston is going to go up and

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.050 
piston that piston is going to go up and
then<00:03:47.479> down<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:48.019> then<00:03:48.199> back<00:03:48.440> up<00:03:48.849> with<00:03:49.849> one

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
then down and then back up with one

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.449 
then down and then back up with one
rotation<00:03:50.810> of<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.379> crankshaft<00:03:51.680> so<00:03:52.220> what<00:03:52.340> that

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
rotation of the crankshaft so what that

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.129 
rotation of the crankshaft so what that
looks<00:03:52.699> like<00:03:52.849> what<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.180> force<00:03:53.449> looks<00:03:53.690> like<00:03:53.900> is

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
looks like what the force looks like is

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.439 
looks like what the force looks like is
as<00:03:54.349> it<00:03:54.739> goes<00:03:54.889> up<00:03:55.099> hits<00:03:55.609> the<00:03:55.819> top<00:03:56.000> so<00:03:56.209> you've<00:03:56.329> got

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
as it goes up hits the top so you've got

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:58.629 
as it goes up hits the top so you've got
an<00:03:56.540> upward<00:03:56.840> force<00:03:57.049> starts<00:03:57.680> coming<00:03:57.949> down<00:03:58.010> hits

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
an upward force starts coming down hits

00:03:58.639 --> 00:03:59.979 
an upward force starts coming down hits
the<00:03:58.909> bottom<00:03:59.239> so<00:03:59.329> you've<00:03:59.449> got<00:03:59.569> that<00:03:59.720> downward

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
the bottom so you've got that downward

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.800 
the bottom so you've got that downward
force<00:04:00.470> and<00:04:00.680> then<00:04:01.069> comes<00:04:01.340> back<00:04:01.459> up<00:04:01.639> and<00:04:02.000> hits

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
force and then comes back up and hits

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.270 
force and then comes back up and hits
the<00:04:02.959> top<00:04:03.139> so<00:04:03.290> you've<00:04:03.439> got<00:04:03.560> that<00:04:03.680> upward<00:04:04.010> force

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
the top so you've got that upward force

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.539 
the top so you've got that upward force
so<00:04:05.239> that's<00:04:05.389> that<00:04:05.569> primary<00:04:06.260> force<00:04:07.250> and

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
so that's that primary force and

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.339 
so that's that primary force and
basically<00:04:08.000> what<00:04:08.209> you<00:04:08.299> can<00:04:08.329> do<00:04:08.720> is<00:04:08.900> add<00:04:09.109> on<00:04:09.319> a

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
basically what you can do is add on a

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.229 
basically what you can do is add on a
counterweight<00:04:09.829> in<00:04:10.159> order<00:04:10.609> to<00:04:10.699> cancel<00:04:11.090> out

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
counterweight in order to cancel out

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.759 
counterweight in order to cancel out
that<00:04:11.680> force<00:04:12.680> that<00:04:12.919> the<00:04:13.099> piston<00:04:14.060> is<00:04:14.180> creating

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
that force that the piston is creating

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.920 
that force that the piston is creating
so<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:16.639> other<00:04:16.759> type<00:04:16.970> of<00:04:17.150> force<00:04:17.359> we've<00:04:17.539> got<00:04:17.720> is

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
so the other type of force we've got is

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.050 
so the other type of force we've got is
secondary<00:04:18.769> force<00:04:19.070> and<00:04:19.310> these<00:04:19.519> are<00:04:19.699> forces

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
secondary force and these are forces

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.450 
secondary force and these are forces
that<00:04:20.150> occur<00:04:20.269> twice<00:04:20.750> for<00:04:21.529> every<00:04:21.680> rotation<00:04:21.859> of

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
that occur twice for every rotation of

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.219 
that occur twice for every rotation of
the<00:04:22.580> crankshaft<00:04:22.849> and<00:04:23.240> basically<00:04:23.840> what<00:04:24.080> this

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
the crankshaft and basically what this

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.740 
the crankshaft and basically what this
comes<00:04:24.500> down<00:04:24.650> to<00:04:24.710> is

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
comes down to is

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.170 
comes down to is
piston<00:04:26.080> moves<00:04:26.260> faster<00:04:26.890> at<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.640> top<00:04:27.850> of<00:04:28.030> its

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
piston moves faster at the top of its

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.970 
piston moves faster at the top of its
rotation<00:04:28.660> at<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.780> top<00:04:29.020> of<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:29.200> cylinder<00:04:29.500> than

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
rotation at the top of the cylinder than

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.290 
rotation at the top of the cylinder than
it<00:04:30.130> does<00:04:30.280> at<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.520> bottom<00:04:30.910> of<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.060> cylinder

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
it does at the bottom of the cylinder

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.940 
it does at the bottom of the cylinder
and<00:04:31.660> I'll<00:04:31.900> have<00:04:32.020> a<00:04:32.050> video<00:04:32.350> going<00:04:32.560> into<00:04:32.800> more

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
and I'll have a video going into more

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.550 
and I'll have a video going into more
detail<00:04:33.370> about<00:04:33.550> secondary<00:04:34.420> forces<00:04:34.840> but<00:04:35.380> what

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
detail about secondary forces but what

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.800 
detail about secondary forces but what
that<00:04:35.680> looks<00:04:35.890> like<00:04:36.010> is<00:04:36.370> it<00:04:36.730> occurs<00:04:37.090> on<00:04:37.360> this

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
that looks like is it occurs on this

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.280 
that looks like is it occurs on this
sinusoidal<00:04:38.080> wave<00:04:38.820> twice<00:04:39.820> for<00:04:40.510> one<00:04:40.750> revolution

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
sinusoidal wave twice for one revolution

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.680 
sinusoidal wave twice for one revolution
so<00:04:41.440> this<00:04:41.590> graph<00:04:42.010> we've<00:04:42.220> got<00:04:42.400> here<00:04:42.730> is<00:04:42.850> a<00:04:42.910> single

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
so this graph we've got here is a single

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.040 
so this graph we've got here is a single
revolution<00:04:44.320> of<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.580> crankshaft<00:04:45.910> and<00:04:46.420> we're

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
revolution of the crankshaft and we're

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.570 
revolution of the crankshaft and we're
looking<00:04:47.290> at<00:04:47.380> the<00:04:47.500> different<00:04:47.800> forces<00:04:48.010> so

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
looking at the different forces so

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.010 
looking at the different forces so
here's<00:04:48.790> your<00:04:48.880> primary<00:04:49.360> here's<00:04:49.870> your

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
here's your primary here's your

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.570 
here's your primary here's your
secondary<00:04:50.440> and<00:04:50.650> then<00:04:50.950> basically<00:04:51.340> once<00:04:51.490> you

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
secondary and then basically once you

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.240 
secondary and then basically once you
get<00:04:51.700> in<00:04:51.790> tertiary<00:04:52.030> and<00:04:52.600> beyond<00:04:53.050> that<00:04:53.250> forces

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
get in tertiary and beyond that forces

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.040 
get in tertiary and beyond that forces
that<00:04:54.340> occur<00:04:54.460> more<00:04:54.760> frequently<00:04:54.820> they<00:04:55.750> get<00:04:55.900> very

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
that occur more frequently they get very

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.050 
that occur more frequently they get very
small<00:04:56.200> and<00:04:56.800> so<00:04:56.920> you<00:04:57.010> kind<00:04:57.250> of<00:04:57.310> stop<00:04:57.730> worrying

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
small and so you kind of stop worrying

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.020 
small and so you kind of stop worrying
about<00:04:58.150> them<00:04:58.450> at<00:04:58.600> that<00:04:58.720> point<00:04:59.040> now<00:05:00.040> what<00:05:00.910> you

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
about them at that point now what you

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.120 
about them at that point now what you
end<00:05:01.330> up<00:05:01.450> doing<00:05:01.510> is<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.020> look<00:05:02.440> at<00:05:02.560> this<00:05:02.710> total

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
end up doing is you look at this total

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.690 
end up doing is you look at this total
force<00:05:03.270> you<00:05:04.270> can<00:05:04.419> see<00:05:04.660> here<00:05:05.280> this<00:05:06.280> is<00:05:06.490> what

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
force you can see here this is what

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.130 
force you can see here this is what
you're<00:05:07.210> actually<00:05:07.510> going<00:05:07.630> to<00:05:07.690> have<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:07.960> balance

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
you're actually going to have to balance

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.630 
you're actually going to have to balance
out<00:05:08.560> so<00:05:09.010> you're<00:05:09.130> going<00:05:09.250> to<00:05:09.280> want<00:05:09.460> to<00:05:09.490> use

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
out so you're going to want to use

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.520 
out so you're going to want to use
counterweight<00:05:10.300> so<00:05:10.600> in<00:05:10.720> order<00:05:10.840> to<00:05:11.050> balance<00:05:11.169> out

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
counterweight so in order to balance out

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.290 
counterweight so in order to balance out
this<00:05:11.710> force<00:05:12.040> here<00:05:12.100> because<00:05:12.910> that's<00:05:13.030> going<00:05:13.240> to

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
this force here because that's going to

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.360 
this force here because that's going to
be<00:05:13.360> what<00:05:13.900> your<00:05:14.050> engine<00:05:14.169> is<00:05:14.440> going<00:05:14.560> to<00:05:14.650> this<00:05:15.220> is

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
be what your engine is going to this is

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.620 
be what your engine is going to this is
basically<00:05:15.490> showing<00:05:15.760> you<00:05:16.030> how<00:05:16.180> your<00:05:16.330> engine's

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
basically showing you how your engine's

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
basically showing you how your engine's
going<00:05:16.660> to<00:05:16.840> vibrate<00:05:16.960> it's<00:05:17.290> going<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:17.470> have<00:05:17.560> an

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
going to vibrate it's going to have an

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.620 
going to vibrate it's going to have an
upward<00:05:17.770> force<00:05:18.100> at<00:05:18.400> this<00:05:18.790> point<00:05:18.850> in<00:05:19.150> time<00:05:19.330> and

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
upward force at this point in time and

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.240 
upward force at this point in time and
then<00:05:19.990> downward<00:05:20.440> force<00:05:20.680> at<00:05:20.800> this<00:05:20.919> point<00:05:20.980> in

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
then downward force at this point in

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.100 
then downward force at this point in
time<00:05:21.370> so<00:05:21.610> by<00:05:22.000> balancing<00:05:22.510> out<00:05:22.660> each<00:05:22.870> of<00:05:23.020> these

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
time so by balancing out each of these

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.900 
time so by balancing out each of these
individual<00:05:23.680> primary<00:05:24.100> and<00:05:24.190> secondary<00:05:24.280> forces

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
individual primary and secondary forces

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.730 
individual primary and secondary forces
you<00:05:25.510> can<00:05:25.660> have<00:05:25.810> it<00:05:25.960> so<00:05:26.080> you<00:05:26.169> just<00:05:26.200> have<00:05:26.410> a<00:05:26.440> flat

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
you can have it so you just have a flat

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.450 
you can have it so you just have a flat
line<00:05:26.950> there<00:05:27.250> and<00:05:27.430> a<00:05:27.700> nice<00:05:27.880> balanced<00:05:28.570> engine

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
line there and a nice balanced engine

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.010 
line there and a nice balanced engine
finally<00:05:30.460> you<00:05:31.150> you're<00:05:31.630> going<00:05:31.720> to<00:05:31.780> want<00:05:31.900> to

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
finally you you're going to want to

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.250 
finally you you're going to want to
balance<00:05:32.380> your<00:05:32.710> firing<00:05:33.160> forces<00:05:33.690> so<00:05:34.690> all<00:05:34.990> this

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
balance your firing forces so all this

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.600 
balance your firing forces so all this
means<00:05:35.470> is<00:05:35.770> you<00:05:35.919> want<00:05:36.010> to<00:05:36.100> have<00:05:36.190> an<00:05:36.310> even

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
means is you want to have an even

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.700 
means is you want to have an even
distribution<00:05:36.880> of<00:05:37.360> how<00:05:37.750> often<00:05:38.080> you<00:05:38.169> fire<00:05:38.380> each

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
distribution of how often you fire each

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.710 
distribution of how often you fire each
cylinder<00:05:39.160> so<00:05:39.760> you<00:05:39.820> don't<00:05:40.180> want<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.390> fire<00:05:40.510> all

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
cylinder so you don't want to fire all

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.719 
cylinder so you don't want to fire all
cylinders<00:05:41.229> at<00:05:41.410> the<00:05:41.500> same<00:05:41.710> exact<00:05:42.040> time<00:05:42.280> you

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
cylinders at the same exact time you

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.969 
cylinders at the same exact time you
want<00:05:42.880> to<00:05:42.940> split<00:05:43.210> that<00:05:43.360> up<00:05:43.419> and<00:05:43.840> then<00:05:44.290> have<00:05:44.740> that

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
want to split that up and then have that

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.430 
want to split that up and then have that
each<00:05:45.790> one<00:05:46.120> occur<00:05:46.419> in<00:05:46.690> a<00:05:46.810> set<00:05:47.020> period<00:05:47.169> of<00:05:47.380> time

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
each one occur in a set period of time

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.010 
each one occur in a set period of time
so<00:05:48.400> basically<00:05:49.300> there's<00:05:49.540> a<00:05:49.600> very<00:05:49.750> simple

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
so basically there's a very simple

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.080 
so basically there's a very simple
equation<00:05:50.169> to<00:05:50.470> figure<00:05:50.560> out<00:05:50.800> this<00:05:51.040> you've<00:05:51.910> got

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
equation to figure out this you've got

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.540 
equation to figure out this you've got
to<00:05:52.180> hit<00:05:52.510> a<00:05:52.540> four<00:05:52.780> stroke<00:05:52.990> engine<00:05:53.200> but<00:05:53.950> you've

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
to hit a four stroke engine but you've

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.460 
to hit a four stroke engine but you've
got<00:05:54.760> one<00:05:54.790> stroke<00:05:55.300> occurring<00:05:55.780> every<00:05:56.020> 180

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
got one stroke occurring every 180

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.170 
got one stroke occurring every 180
degrees<00:05:56.830> and<00:05:57.100> then<00:05:57.430> you<00:05:57.550> just<00:05:57.700> divide<00:05:57.940> by<00:05:58.120> the

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
degrees and then you just divide by the

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.659 
degrees and then you just divide by the
number<00:05:58.360> of<00:05:58.510> cylinders<00:05:59.070> so<00:06:00.070> this<00:06:00.400> will<00:06:00.550> give

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
number of cylinders so this will give

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.210 
number of cylinders so this will give
you<00:06:00.790> an<00:06:00.880> even<00:06:01.210> interval<00:06:01.630> for<00:06:02.020> firing<00:06:02.260> so<00:06:02.860> our

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
you an even interval for firing so our

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.560 
you an even interval for firing so our
example<00:06:03.669> here<00:06:03.700> we're<00:06:04.030> just<00:06:04.060> going<00:06:04.270> to<00:06:04.330> have<00:06:04.540> a

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
example here we're just going to have a

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.530 
example here we're just going to have a
four<00:06:04.900> stroke<00:06:05.169> v-8<00:06:05.710> see<00:06:06.700> your<00:06:07.030> four<00:06:07.210> strokes

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
four stroke v-8 see your four strokes

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.620 
four stroke v-8 see your four strokes
multiply<00:06:08.290> that<00:06:08.470> by<00:06:08.530> 180<00:06:09.070> you've<00:06:09.669> got<00:06:09.850> 720

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
multiply that by 180 you've got 720

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.120 
multiply that by 180 you've got 720
divide<00:06:10.960> that<00:06:11.169> by<00:06:11.380> the<00:06:11.410> number<00:06:11.560> of<00:06:11.800> cylinders

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
divide that by the number of cylinders

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.430 
divide that by the number of cylinders
and<00:06:12.760> you've<00:06:12.940> got<00:06:13.090> 90<00:06:13.360> degrees<00:06:13.630> so<00:06:14.050> what<00:06:14.260> you're

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
and you've got 90 degrees so what you're

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.050 
and you've got 90 degrees so what you're
going<00:06:14.590> to<00:06:14.620> want<00:06:14.770> to<00:06:14.830> do<00:06:15.040> with<00:06:15.280> the<00:06:15.400> v8<00:06:15.669> engine

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
going to want to do with the v8 engine

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.650 
going to want to do with the v8 engine
is<00:06:16.210> fire<00:06:16.660> one<00:06:16.960> cylinder<00:06:17.380> every<00:06:17.890> 90<00:06:18.190> degree

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
is fire one cylinder every 90 degree

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.180 
is fire one cylinder every 90 degree
rotation<00:06:19.660> of<00:06:19.840> the<00:06:20.050> crankshaft<00:06:20.350> and<00:06:20.710> that<00:06:21.070> will

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
rotation of the crankshaft and that will

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.940 
rotation of the crankshaft and that will
balance<00:06:21.520> out<00:06:21.669> firing<00:06:22.030> forces<00:06:22.570> now<00:06:23.470> this<00:06:23.680> also

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
balance out firing forces now this also

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.600 
balance out firing forces now this also
dictates<00:06:24.640> the<00:06:25.419> engine<00:06:25.780> angle<00:06:26.200> so<00:06:26.620> if<00:06:27.010> it<00:06:27.310> comes

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
dictates the engine angle so if it comes

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.100 
dictates the engine angle so if it comes
out<00:06:27.790> that<00:06:28.030> you<00:06:28.150> should<00:06:28.300> fire<00:06:28.510> every<00:06:28.840> 90

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
out that you should fire every 90

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.800 
out that you should fire every 90
degrees<00:06:29.410> well<00:06:29.919> for<00:06:30.190> a<00:06:30.220> VA<00:06:30.430> a<00:06:30.820> good<00:06:31.240> angle<00:06:31.479> to

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
degrees well for a VA a good angle to

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.200 
degrees well for a VA a good angle to
use<00:06:32.020> would<00:06:32.650> be<00:06:32.680> 90<00:06:33.070> degrees<00:06:33.370> that<00:06:33.580> way<00:06:33.970> you<00:06:34.030> can

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
use would be 90 degrees that way you can

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.650 
use would be 90 degrees that way you can
have<00:06:34.330> that
