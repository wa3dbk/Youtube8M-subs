out<00:00:24.160> you<00:00:24.519> know<00:00:24.609> I<00:00:24.640> strategy<00:00:25.359> for<00:00:25.570> the<00:00:25.660> fight

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
out you know I strategy for the fight

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.990 
out you know I strategy for the fight
basically<00:00:26.380> so<00:00:26.949> we<00:00:27.070> start<00:00:27.340> off<00:00:27.550> and<00:00:27.789> we're

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
basically so we start off and we're

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.339 
basically so we start off and we're
going<00:00:28.150> to<00:00:28.180> pop<00:00:28.390> everything<00:00:28.990> and<00:00:29.140> we're<00:00:29.230> going

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
going to pop everything and we're going

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.200 
going to pop everything and we're going
to<00:00:29.380> nuke<00:00:29.679> down<00:00:29.920> for<00:00:30.189> asking<00:00:30.550> as<00:00:30.760> soon<00:00:31.060> as

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
to nuke down for asking as soon as

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.270 
to nuke down for asking as soon as
possible<00:00:31.750> there's<00:00:32.410> a<00:00:32.470> few<00:00:32.650> reasons<00:00:32.680> for<00:00:33.190> that

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
possible there's a few reasons for that

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.790 
possible there's a few reasons for that
but<00:00:33.340> the<00:00:33.640> main<00:00:33.820> is<00:00:34.090> because<00:00:34.420> of<00:00:34.449> frostbite<00:00:34.989> the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
but the main is because of frostbite the

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.470 
but the main is because of frostbite the
the<00:00:36.040> spell<00:00:36.309> was<00:00:36.519> really<00:00:37.030> really<00:00:37.239> dangerous

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
the spell was really really dangerous

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.080 
the spell was really really dangerous
and<00:00:37.989> the<00:00:38.890> main<00:00:39.070> reason<00:00:39.100> for<00:00:39.520> that<00:00:39.879> is<00:00:40.059> because

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
and the main reason for that is because

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.780 
and the main reason for that is because
it<00:00:40.570> puts<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:41.170> frostbite<00:00:41.620> on<00:00:41.649> you<00:00:42.010> and<00:00:42.219> you

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
it puts the the frostbite on you and you

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.610 
it puts the the frostbite on you and you
need<00:00:43.000> /<00:00:43.180> players<00:00:43.570> to<00:00:43.809> get<00:00:43.960> rid<00:00:44.110> of<00:00:44.170> it<00:00:44.290> so<00:00:44.559> it

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
need / players to get rid of it so it

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.860 
need / players to get rid of it so it
was<00:00:44.680> causing<00:00:45.160> a<00:00:45.250> lot<00:00:45.489> of<00:00:45.520> damage<00:00:45.850> dinner<00:00:46.270> so<00:00:46.840> I

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
was causing a lot of damage dinner so I

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.540 
was causing a lot of damage dinner so I
decided<00:00:47.289> to<00:00:47.500> pop<00:00:47.649> everything<00:00:48.100> and<00:00:48.250> get<00:00:48.370> rid<00:00:48.520> of

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
decided to pop everything and get rid of

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.400 
decided to pop everything and get rid of
him<00:00:48.730> as<00:00:48.969> soon<00:00:49.180> as<00:00:49.360> possible<00:00:49.840> because<00:00:49.870> he<00:00:50.260> was

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
him as soon as possible because he was

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.930 
him as soon as possible because he was
the<00:00:50.440> the<00:00:50.890> biggest<00:00:51.039> threat<00:00:51.489> on<00:00:51.610> the<00:00:51.730> team

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
the the biggest threat on the team

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.139 
the the biggest threat on the team
basically<00:00:53.039> next<00:00:54.039> up<00:00:54.190> I<00:00:54.340> focused<00:00:54.969> High

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
basically next up I focused High

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:56.819 
basically next up I focused High
Priestess<00:00:55.660> that's<00:00:56.289> because<00:00:56.620> when<00:00:56.800> she

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
Priestess that's because when she

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.279 
Priestess that's because when she
becomes<00:00:57.579> empowered<00:00:58.210> she<00:00:58.359> does<00:00:58.539> that<00:00:58.750> one<00:00:59.020> add

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
becomes empowered she does that one add

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.619 
becomes empowered she does that one add
the<00:00:59.680> wool<00:00:59.859> and<00:01:00.070> kill<00:01:00.340> you<00:01:00.489> instantly<00:01:00.850> and<00:01:01.180> that

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
the wool and kill you instantly and that

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.450 
the wool and kill you instantly and that
becomes<00:01:01.870> a<00:01:02.020> lot<00:01:02.170> of<00:01:02.260> a<00:01:02.649> problem<00:01:02.890> as<00:01:03.190> Mellie

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
becomes a lot of a problem as Mellie

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.880 
becomes a lot of a problem as Mellie
later<00:01:03.879> on<00:01:04.180> as<00:01:04.330> if<00:01:05.019> you're<00:01:05.170> trying<00:01:05.289> to<00:01:05.410> DPS<00:01:05.770> or

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
later on as if you're trying to DPS or

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.380 
later on as if you're trying to DPS or
it'll<00:01:06.100> pretty<00:01:06.340> much<00:01:06.430> just<00:01:06.700> one<00:01:06.940> shot<00:01:07.149> you<00:01:07.300> know

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
it'll pretty much just one shot you know

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.029 
it'll pretty much just one shot you know
if<00:01:07.570> you're<00:01:07.720> not<00:01:07.750> paying<00:01:07.990> attention<00:01:08.110> so<00:01:08.800> I

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
if you're not paying attention so I

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:10.770 
if you're not paying attention so I
thought<00:01:09.700> it'd<00:01:09.850> be<00:01:09.880> best<00:01:10.119> to<00:01:10.240> get<00:01:10.390> rid<00:01:10.509> of<00:01:10.539> her

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
thought it'd be best to get rid of her

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.389 
thought it'd be best to get rid of her
and<00:01:10.990> if<00:01:11.200> she's<00:01:11.380> left<00:01:11.649> up<00:01:11.830> she's<00:01:12.069> going<00:01:12.250> to<00:01:12.310> be

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
and if she's left up she's going to be

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.820 
and if she's left up she's going to be
putting<00:01:12.700> out<00:01:12.819> the<00:01:12.970> ads<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:13.539> heal<00:01:14.140> her<00:01:14.440> friends

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
putting out the ads to heal her friends

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.010 
putting out the ads to heal her friends
as<00:01:14.950> well<00:01:15.069> so<00:01:15.700> it<00:01:15.910> just<00:01:16.149> it's<00:01:16.420> one<00:01:16.569> less<00:01:16.750> thing

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
as well so it just it's one less thing

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.050 
as well so it just it's one less thing
for<00:01:17.050> you<00:01:17.289> to<00:01:17.380> basically<00:01:17.530> deal<00:01:18.039> with<00:01:18.250> now<00:01:19.000> the

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
for you to basically deal with now the

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.089 
for you to basically deal with now the
downside<00:01:19.330> to<00:01:19.869> this<00:01:20.020> is<00:01:20.229> you're<00:01:20.560> gonna<00:01:20.679> leave

00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:21.099 
downside to this is you're gonna leave

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:23.999 
downside to this is you're gonna leave
em<00:01:21.490> soul<00:01:22.380> completely<00:01:23.380> alone<00:01:23.590> you<00:01:23.830> know<00:01:23.890> he's

underneath<00:01:38.229> you<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:38.619> you<00:01:39.399> need<00:01:39.610> some<00:01:39.849> kind<00:01:40.149> of

em you know Cece removal to get rid of

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.029 
em you know Cece removal to get rid of
it<00:01:43.209> for<00:01:43.390> example<00:01:43.630> my<00:01:43.959> spirit<00:01:44.410> wall<00:01:44.590> gets<00:01:44.830> rid

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
it for example my spirit wall gets rid

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.249 
it for example my spirit wall gets rid
of<00:01:45.069> it<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:45.399> my<00:01:45.880> wind<00:01:46.119> walk<00:01:46.270> totem<00:01:46.720> also<00:01:47.080> gets

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
of it and my wind walk totem also gets

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.839 
of it and my wind walk totem also gets
rid<00:01:47.410> of<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:47.590> otherwise<00:01:48.459> you're<00:01:48.640> going<00:01:48.729> to<00:01:48.789> be

00:01:48.839 --> 00:01:48.849 
rid of it otherwise you're going to be

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:51.300 
rid of it otherwise you're going to be
sat<00:01:49.209> in<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.660> Sun<00:01:50.259> trap<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:50.860> it's<00:01:51.069> going<00:01:51.160> to<00:01:51.220> be

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
sat in the Sun trap and it's going to be

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.339 
sat in the Sun trap and it's going to be
doing<00:01:51.429> some<00:01:51.789> good<00:01:52.060> consistent<00:01:52.780> damage<00:01:53.080> dear

00:01:53.339 --> 00:01:53.349 
doing some good consistent damage dear

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:56.309 
doing some good consistent damage dear
so<00:01:53.979> if<00:01:54.369> soul<00:01:55.149> ends<00:01:55.390> up<00:01:55.509> being<00:01:55.660> an<00:01:55.840> issue<00:01:55.959> I

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
so if soul ends up being an issue I

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:58.290 
so if soul ends up being an issue I
would<00:01:56.649> recommend<00:01:57.160> to<00:01:57.399> look<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.789> kill<00:01:58.000> soul

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
would recommend to look to kill soul

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.300 
would recommend to look to kill soul
second<00:01:58.810> and<00:01:58.989> for<00:01:59.440> me<00:01:59.560> because<00:01:59.860> I<00:01:59.950> had<00:02:00.039> a<00:02:00.069> few

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
second and for me because I had a few

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.949 
second and for me because I had a few
ways<00:02:00.429> of<00:02:00.670> getting<00:02:00.910> out<00:02:01.000> of<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.239> quicksand<00:02:01.690> I

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
ways of getting out of the quicksand I

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.040 
ways of getting out of the quicksand I
chose<00:02:02.679> the<00:02:02.860> coastal<00:02:03.280> third<00:02:03.610> but<00:02:04.390> if<00:02:04.660> souls<00:02:04.929> an

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
chose the coastal third but if souls an

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.900 
chose the coastal third but if souls an
issue<00:02:05.229> and<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.679> damage<00:02:06.129> from<00:02:06.220> quicksand<00:02:06.819> is

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
issue and the damage from quicksand is

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.309 
issue and the damage from quicksand is
killing<00:02:07.209> it<00:02:07.270> then<00:02:07.660> just<00:02:07.869> cut<00:02:07.989> off<00:02:08.080> stole

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
killing it then just cut off stole

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.779 
killing it then just cut off stole
second<00:02:08.770> but<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.099> do<00:02:09.220> need<00:02:09.489> to<00:02:09.610> make<00:02:09.759> sure

doesn't really do anything to be honest
and<00:02:30.520> you<00:02:31.510> can<00:02:31.660> leave<00:02:31.780> him<00:02:32.020> to<00:02:32.140> last<00:02:32.320> I'd<00:02:32.560> say

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
and you can leave him to last I'd say

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.260 
and you can leave him to last I'd say
he's<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.100> least<00:02:33.310> threatening<00:02:33.670> out<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.180> the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
he's the least threatening out of the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.840 
he's the least threatening out of the
mall<00:02:34.450> he<00:02:35.080> rolls<00:02:35.350> into<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.890> know<00:02:36.100> he<00:02:36.280> an<00:02:36.340> actual

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
mall he rolls into you know he an actual

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.020 
mall he rolls into you know he an actual
p<00:02:37.150> he<00:02:37.480> does<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.720> lot<00:02:37.960> of<00:02:38.020> damage<00:02:38.350> but<00:02:38.860> out<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.670> all

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
p he does a lot of damage but out of all

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.140 
p he does a lot of damage but out of all
of<00:02:40.090> them<00:02:40.270> he's<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.990> the<00:02:41.350> least<00:02:41.620> threatening

of them he's the the least threatening

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.120 
of them he's the the least threatening
so<00:02:43.150> I<00:02:43.540> definitely<00:02:43.870> recommend<00:02:44.170> leaving<00:02:44.620> him<00:02:44.920> to

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
so I definitely recommend leaving him to

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.130 
so I definitely recommend leaving him to
last<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.760> obviously<00:02:46.210> if<00:02:46.570> you're<00:02:46.720> struggling

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
last and obviously if you're struggling

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.380 
last and obviously if you're struggling
with<00:02:47.380> DPS<00:02:48.040> then<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:48.760> will<00:02:48.910> need<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.180> make<00:02:49.360> sure

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
with DPS then you will need to make sure

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.910 
with DPS then you will need to make sure
you<00:02:49.720> getting<00:02:49.960> rid<00:02:50.110> of<00:02:50.170> all<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.470> Empowered

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
you getting rid of all the Empowered

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.250 
you getting rid of all the Empowered
phases<00:02:51.460> at<00:02:51.640> just<00:02:52.270> dps<00:02:52.510> in<00:02:52.750> them<00:02:52.900> down<00:02:53.080> by

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
phases at just dps in them down by

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.900 
phases at just dps in them down by
twenty-five<00:02:53.740> percent<00:02:53.920> but<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:54.760> definitely

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
twenty-five percent but I definitely

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.460 
twenty-five percent but I definitely
would<00:02:55.210> recommend<00:02:55.240> popping<00:02:55.930> everything<00:02:56.350> in

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
would recommend popping everything in

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.170 
would recommend popping everything in
the<00:02:56.560> beginning<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.130> just<00:02:57.160> look<00:02:57.580> to<00:02:57.610> kill<00:02:57.970> one

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
the beginning and just look to kill one

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.090 
the beginning and just look to kill one
of<00:02:58.240> them<00:02:58.480> as<00:02:58.660> soon<00:02:58.900> as<00:02:58.990> possible<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.980> have

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
of them as soon as possible you have

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.160 
of them as soon as possible you have
plenty<00:03:00.310> of<00:03:00.550> time<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.820> do<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.270> and<00:03:01.450> you<00:03:01.960> should

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
plenty of time to do it and you should

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.410 
plenty of time to do it and you should
have<00:03:02.320> like<00:03:02.680> at<00:03:02.890> least<00:03:02.920> enough<00:03:03.490> dps<00:03:03.820> especially

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
have like at least enough dps especially

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.570 
have like at least enough dps especially
if<00:03:04.480> you've<00:03:04.600> killed<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:05.020> previous<00:03:05.440> bosses<00:03:05.680> to

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
if you've killed the previous bosses to

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.660 
if you've killed the previous bosses to
kill<00:03:07.000> one<00:03:07.180> off<00:03:07.330> fairly<00:03:07.690> quickly<00:03:08.050> so<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:09.310> know

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
kill one off fairly quickly so you know

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.950 
kill one off fairly quickly so you know
even<00:03:09.850> if<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.090> need<00:03:10.240> to<00:03:10.300> pop<00:03:10.450> potion<00:03:10.870> or
