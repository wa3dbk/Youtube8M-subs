rejection which I think are three topics
which<00:04:12.630> affect<00:04:13.140> young<00:04:13.470> people<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:14.130> so<00:04:14.880> we're

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
which affect young people and so we're

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.950 
which affect young people and so we're
trying<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.300> bring<00:04:15.390> a<00:04:15.540> Christian<00:04:15.870> perspective

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
into it how Jesus approached these

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.780

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
the understanding tolerance and respect

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.490 
the understanding tolerance and respect
of<00:04:57.460> other<00:04:57.640> religions<00:04:58.060> as<00:04:58.240> well<00:04:58.420> so<00:04:59.080> we<00:04:59.230> use<00:04:59.470> a

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
of other religions as well so we use a

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.710 
of other religions as well so we use a
variety<00:04:59.830> of<00:05:00.160> religions<00:05:00.580> to<00:05:00.940> compare<00:05:01.540> and

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
variety of religions to compare and

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.890 
variety of religions to compare and
contrast<00:05:01.980> so<00:05:02.980> instead<00:05:03.310> of<00:05:03.430> looking<00:05:03.580> at<00:05:04.030> the

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
contrast so instead of looking at the

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.650 
contrast so instead of looking at the
Gospels<00:05:05.350> of<00:05:05.620> Christianity<00:05:06.430> we<00:05:07.030> then<00:05:07.270> look<00:05:07.480> at

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
Gospels of Christianity we then look at

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.320 
Gospels of Christianity we then look at
the<00:05:08.190> Gospels<00:05:09.190> in<00:05:09.430> comparison<00:05:10.030> to<00:05:10.150> what<00:05:10.240> the

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
the Gospels in comparison to what the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.390 
the Gospels in comparison to what the
Quran<00:05:10.600> says<00:05:10.870> and<00:05:11.140> the<00:05:11.560> stories<00:05:11.890> in<00:05:12.010> the<00:05:12.100> Quran

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.600 
Quran says and the stories in the Quran
overlapping<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.150> stories<00:05:14.080> in<00:05:14.200> the<00:05:14.290> Bible<00:05:14.710> we

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
overlapping the stories in the Bible we

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.890 
overlapping the stories in the Bible we
might<00:05:15.790> look<00:05:15.910> at<00:05:16.000> a<00:05:16.090> variety<00:05:16.210> of<00:05:16.510> Hindu<00:05:16.870> holy

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
might look at a variety of Hindu holy

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.830 
might look at a variety of Hindu holy
books<00:05:17.380> it<00:05:17.740> all<00:05:18.130> depends<00:05:18.700> on<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:19.240> thing<00:05:19.630> we're

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
books it all depends on the thing we're

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.970 
books it all depends on the thing we're
looking<00:05:20.110> at<00:05:20.200> instead<00:05:20.530> of<00:05:20.620> looking<00:05:20.710> at

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
looking at instead of looking at

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
and we look at it from a variety of

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.270

through<00:05:36.220> we<00:05:36.430> then<00:05:36.580> get<00:05:36.730> to<00:05:36.790> year<00:05:37.090> 9<00:05:37.390> where<00:05:37.990> we

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
through we then get to year 9 where we

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.110 
through we then get to year 9 where we
