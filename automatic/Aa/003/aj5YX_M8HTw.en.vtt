00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.430
 cut potatoes 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:50.670

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.060

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:07.410

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.150
 readiness will not be determined 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.070
 the readiness of our creaking eggs can 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.510
 lay out the bone end of cooking 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:29.920

00:05:49.690 --> 00:06:04.110
 that is, bacon and of course we remove our 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:04.110
 immediately add garlic sauce 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:14.170
 and we make a little fire and 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:18.070
 leave to languish 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.880
 until full cooking is now on very 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.220
 low heat 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.950
 we need our pot then later 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.410
 10-15 minutes and the soup will be ready 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:29.890

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.270
