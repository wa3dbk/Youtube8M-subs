in<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:11.580> video<00:00:11.820> we're<00:00:11.969> going<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.150> be<00:00:12.240> doing

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
in this video we're going to be doing

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.379 
in this video we're going to be doing
the<00:00:12.690> Color<00:00:13.500> Splash<00:00:13.710> effect<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.610> GIMP<00:00:15.120> I'm

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
the Color Splash effect in GIMP I'm

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.859 
the Color Splash effect in GIMP I'm
working<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:15.870> gimp<00:00:16.139> 2.8<00:00:16.859> too<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
working in gimp 2.8 too and this is the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.150 
working in gimp 2.8 too and this is the
fifth<00:00:19.109> time<00:00:19.199> I've<00:00:19.500> tried<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.710> record<00:00:19.980> this

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
fifth time I've tried to record this

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.179 
fifth time I've tried to record this
video<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.730> if<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.060> hear<00:00:21.960> some<00:00:22.289> desperation

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
video so if you hear some desperation

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.920 
video so if you hear some desperation
and<00:00:23.430> frustration<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:24.060> my<00:00:24.150> voice<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.480> will<00:00:24.840> be

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
and frustration in my voice that will be

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.870 
and frustration in my voice that will be
the<00:00:25.050> reason<00:00:25.199> why<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:26.310> we're<00:00:26.460> basically<00:00:26.609> going

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
the reason why so we're basically going

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.019 
the reason why so we're basically going
to<00:00:27.000> be<00:00:27.060> taking<00:00:27.420> color<00:00:27.900> image<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:29.029> draining

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
to be taking color image and draining

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.389 
to be taking color image and draining
the<00:00:30.060> color<00:00:30.300> out<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.040> leaving<00:00:32.040> one

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
the color out of it and leaving one

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.120 
the color out of it and leaving one
object<00:00:32.910> as<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.260> color<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.559> effect<00:00:34.890> can<00:00:34.980> be

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
object as a color this effect can be

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.650 
object as a color this effect can be
applied<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.430> any<00:00:35.520> photograph<00:00:35.969> but<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.329> think<00:00:36.600> it

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
applied to any photograph but I think it

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.360 
applied to any photograph but I think it
works<00:00:36.840> best<00:00:37.079> where<00:00:37.290> you've<00:00:37.410> got<00:00:37.620> some<00:00:37.649> object

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
works best where you've got some object

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.709 
works best where you've got some object
that's<00:00:38.520> really<00:00:38.850> going<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.090> stand<00:00:39.270> out<00:00:39.510> when

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
that's really going to stand out when

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.080 
that's really going to stand out when
it's<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:39.960> color<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.920> mean<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:41.489> it's

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
it's in color but I mean it's it's it's

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.389 
it's in color but I mean it's it's it's
very<00:00:42.510> effective<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:43.260> produces<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> really<00:00:44.219> nice

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
very effective it produces a really nice

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.860 
very effective it produces a really nice
looking<00:00:44.640> effecting<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.180> very<00:00:45.329> simple<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.719> do

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
looking effecting is very simple to do

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.970 
looking effecting is very simple to do
so<00:00:46.410> we're<00:00:46.559> going<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.710> get<00:00:46.829> started<00:00:47.660> we<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.989> do

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
so we're going to get started we can do

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.889 
so we're going to get started we can do
this<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.700> number<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.030> different<00:00:51.239> ways<00:00:51.570> I'm

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
this in a number of different ways I'm

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.180 
this in a number of different ways I'm
just<00:00:52.050> going<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.260> bring<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> status<00:00:52.949> bar

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
just going to bring up the status bar

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.330 
just going to bring up the status bar
there

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.300 

we<00:00:57.330> can<00:00:57.510> make<00:00:57.900> it<00:00:57.930> duplicate<00:00:58.500> off<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
we can make it duplicate off the

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.580 
we can make it duplicate off the
original<00:00:59.970> and<00:01:00.210> then<00:01:00.300> desaturate<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.260> like

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
original and then desaturate it like

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.150 
original and then desaturate it like
that<00:01:02.600> that<00:01:03.600> produces<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> fairly<00:01:04.650> dull<00:01:04.830> looking

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
that that produces a fairly dull looking

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.800 
that that produces a fairly dull looking
black-and-white<00:01:05.670> what<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.030> decided<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:06.660> this

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
black-and-white what I decided with this

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.280 
black-and-white what I decided with this
image<00:01:07.050> was<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.860> go<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.420> channels<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:10.020> grab

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
image was to go to the channels to grab

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.680 
image was to go to the channels to grab
green<00:01:10.800> and<00:01:11.070> drag<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.820> into<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.210> image<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
green and drag it into the image and

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.960 
green and drag it into the image and
make<00:01:13.260> sure<00:01:13.440> that<00:01:13.590> Yuri<00:01:14.250> select<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.729> green

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
make sure that Yuri select the green

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.200 
make sure that Yuri select the green
after<00:01:15.479> you've<00:01:15.900> dragged<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.290> into<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.650> image

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
after you've dragged it into the image

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.359 
after you've dragged it into the image
that<00:01:18.210> gives<00:01:18.510> us<00:01:18.690> a<00:01:18.960> green<00:01:19.290> copy<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.160> add

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
that gives us a green copy and add

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.859 
that gives us a green copy and add
another<00:01:20.729> channel<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.690> that's<00:01:21.810> not

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
another channel to that and that's not

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.109 
another channel to that and that's not
essential<00:01:22.260> but<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.680> just<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.160> do<00:01:23.310> that

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.310 

zoom<00:01:28.119> in<00:01:28.360> like<00:01:28.539> that<00:01:28.719> I'm<00:01:28.899> actually<00:01:29.049> going<00:01:29.259> to

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
zoom in like that I'm actually going to

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.749 
zoom in like that I'm actually going to
switch<00:01:29.619> off<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.890> black-and-white<00:01:30.399> we're

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
switch off the black-and-white we're

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.249 
switch off the black-and-white we're
going<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:30.939> work<00:01:31.090> on<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.329> color<00:01:31.539> we're<00:01:32.140> going

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
going to work on the color we're going

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.440 
going to work on the color we're going
to<00:01:32.320> use<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:32.619> intelligent<00:01:33.340> scissors<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:33.969> this

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
to use the intelligent scissors and this

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.560 
to use the intelligent scissors and this
is<00:01:34.600> a<00:01:34.630> tool<00:01:34.899> that<00:01:34.929> sometimes<00:01:35.409> works<00:01:35.679> very<00:01:35.950> well

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
is a tool that sometimes works very well

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.090 
is a tool that sometimes works very well
with<00:01:37.570> black<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.079> white<00:01:38.259> sometimes<00:01:38.649> it<00:01:38.920> works

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
with black and white sometimes it works

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.340 
with black and white sometimes it works
well<00:01:39.310> with<00:01:39.340> color<00:01:39.789> in<00:01:40.299> this<00:01:40.450> images<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:41.020> just

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
well with color in this images I just

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.649 
well with color in this images I just
prefer<00:01:41.560> to<00:01:41.590> work<00:01:41.770> with<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.009> color<00:01:42.250> layer<00:01:42.819> so

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
prefer to work with the color layer so

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.960 
prefer to work with the color layer so
we're<00:01:43.840> just<00:01:43.869> going<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.200> click<00:01:44.530> on<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:45.399> edge<00:01:45.610> of

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
we're just going to click on the edge of

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.300 
we're just going to click on the edge of
the<00:01:46.299> fruit<00:01:46.600> I'm<00:01:47.439> going<00:01:47.679> to<00:01:47.770> change<00:01:48.159> the

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
the fruit I'm going to change the

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.179 
the fruit I'm going to change the
settings<00:01:48.729> so<00:01:48.939> we've<00:01:49.119> got<00:01:49.299> feather<00:01:49.569> edges<00:01:50.189> 5

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
settings so we've got feather edges 5

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.580 
settings so we've got feather edges 5
pixels<00:01:51.670> that<00:01:52.030> will<00:01:52.360> be<00:01:52.450> fine<00:01:52.689> for<00:01:52.719> an<00:01:53.170> image<00:01:53.469> of

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
pixels that will be fine for an image of

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.649 
pixels that will be fine for an image of
this<00:01:53.740> kind<00:01:53.920> of<00:01:54.039> resolution<00:01:54.659> interactive

selected<00:01:58.470> we<00:01:59.470> can<00:01:59.580> click<00:02:00.580> somewhere<00:02:00.880> and

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
selected we can click somewhere and

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.960 
selected we can click somewhere and
we'll<00:02:01.599> get<00:02:01.720> like<00:02:01.869> a<00:02:01.929> preview<00:02:02.439> of<00:02:02.500> what<00:02:02.740> the

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
we'll get like a preview of what the

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.830 
we'll get like a preview of what the
selection<00:02:03.970> is<00:02:04.060> going<00:02:04.149> to<00:02:04.270> look<00:02:04.390> like<00:02:04.569> what<00:02:04.750> the

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
selection is going to look like what the

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.000 
selection is going to look like what the
path<00:02:05.079> is<00:02:05.259> going<00:02:05.439> to<00:02:05.530> look<00:02:05.679> like

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
path is going to look like

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.280 
path is going to look like
we<00:02:07.460> can<00:02:07.640> just<00:02:07.790> continue<00:02:08.270> you<00:02:08.660> can<00:02:08.810> move<00:02:09.020> these

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
we can just continue you can move these

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.620 
we can just continue you can move these
so<00:02:09.620> you<00:02:09.770> can<00:02:09.860> move<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.250> pointer<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:11.300> different

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
so you can move the pointer to different

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.540 
so you can move the pointer to different
places<00:02:11.860> sometimes<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:12.920> find<00:02:13.070> that<00:02:13.220> this<00:02:13.340> kind

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
places sometimes you find that this kind

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.700 
places sometimes you find that this kind
of<00:02:13.580> thing<00:02:13.730> happens<00:02:14.180> where<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.600> get<00:02:14.810> this<00:02:15.080> sort

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
of thing happens where you get this sort

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.100 
of thing happens where you get this sort
of<00:02:15.770> rough<00:02:15.980> edge<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.760> no<00:02:17.480> matter<00:02:17.630> what<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:17.930> do

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
of rough edge and no matter what you do

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.920 
of rough edge and no matter what you do
you<00:02:18.950> can't<00:02:19.190> fix<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.270> if<00:02:20.390> that<00:02:20.480> happens<00:02:20.870> just

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
you can't fix it so if that happens just

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.130 
you can't fix it so if that happens just
carry<00:02:21.620> on<00:02:21.770> until<00:02:22.100> you<00:02:22.340> get<00:02:22.490> to<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.700> end<00:02:23.140> we

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
carry on until you get to the end we

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.570 
carry on until you get to the end we
don't<00:02:24.320> need<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.500> worry<00:02:24.650> about<00:02:24.710> very<00:02:25.220> minor

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
don't need to worry about very minor

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.390 
don't need to worry about very minor
deviations<00:02:26.510> from<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:27.080> actual<00:02:27.650> surface<00:02:27.950> of

deviations from the actual surface of
the<00:02:28.610> fruit<00:02:29.450> because<00:02:30.410> this<00:02:30.680> is<00:02:30.800> going<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.040> be

the fruit because this is going to be

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.410 
the fruit because this is going to be
feathered<00:02:31.490> so<00:02:31.640> we're<00:02:31.790> really<00:02:32.030> not<00:02:32.210> going<00:02:32.360> to

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
feathered so we're really not going to

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.630 
feathered so we're really not going to
notice<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.720> once<00:02:33.500> you've<00:02:33.620> closed<00:02:33.860> it<00:02:34.070> the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
notice that once you've closed it the

click in the inside of the path and that

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.670 
click in the inside of the path and that
turns<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.730> into<00:02:37.880> a<00:02:37.970> selection<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.600> we<00:02:39.410> can<00:02:39.560> now

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
turns it into a selection and we can now

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.380 
turns it into a selection and we can now
create<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:40.040> mask<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:40.760> I'm<00:02:40.850> going<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.030> go<00:02:41.120> to<00:02:41.180> the

that creates the the mask that we need

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.110 
that creates the the mask that we need
let's<00:02:53.120> zoom<00:02:53.330> in<00:02:53.510> again<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.810> little<00:02:54.050> bit<00:02:55.120> quite

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
let's zoom in again a little bit quite

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.700 
let's zoom in again a little bit quite
old<00:02:56.330> click<00:02:56.660> on<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.900> layer<00:02:57.080> mask<00:02:57.350> you<00:02:57.500> can<00:02:57.650> see

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
old click on the layer mask you can see

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.510 
old click on the layer mask you can see
it's<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.070> very<00:02:58.370> rough<00:02:58.840> mask<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.200> that's<00:03:01.040> what

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
it's a very rough mask and that's what

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.630 
it's a very rough mask and that's what
the<00:03:01.790> intelligence<00:03:02.120> users<00:03:02.600> do<00:03:03.340> we<00:03:04.340> need<00:03:04.490> to

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
the intelligence users do we need to

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.210 
the intelligence users do we need to
refine<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.150> mask<00:03:05.360> in<00:03:05.570> a<00:03:05.840> couple<00:03:06.170> of<00:03:06.200> areas<00:03:06.470> so

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
refine the mask in a couple of areas so

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.640 
refine the mask in a couple of areas so
we're<00:03:07.400> going<00:03:07.580> to<00:03:07.670> use<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.970> path<00:03:08.270> tool<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:08.930> I'm

away<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:33.520> that<00:03:33.730> we<00:03:33.880> can<00:03:34.120> see<00:03:34.330> things<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.900> bit

just<00:03:42.459> hides<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.910> selection<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:44.620> it's<00:03:44.860> still

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
just hides the selection so it's still

the<00:03:46.810> layer<00:03:46.959> mask<00:03:46.989> a<00:03:47.530> drag<00:03:48.310> black<00:03:49.410> into<00:03:50.410> there

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
the layer mask a drag black into there

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.229 
the layer mask a drag black into there
and<00:03:50.800> you<00:03:50.890> can<00:03:51.010> see<00:03:51.160> that<00:03:51.310> fixes<00:03:51.760> that<00:03:51.880> part<00:03:52.150> of

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
and you can see that fixes that part of

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.330 
and you can see that fixes that part of
the<00:03:52.300> mask<00:03:52.540> we<00:03:53.260> need<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.500> do<00:03:53.590> that<00:03:53.769> down<00:03:54.069> here

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
the mask we need to do that down here

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:07.450

the mask if we come over here we can see
that<00:04:14.850> there<00:04:15.270> is<00:04:15.300> a<00:04:15.390> part<00:04:15.780> there<00:04:16.080> that<00:04:16.290> needs<00:04:16.500> to

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
that there is a part there that needs to

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.120 
that there is a part there that needs to
be<00:04:16.740> fixed

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
be fixed

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.670 
be fixed
it's<00:04:17.580> just<00:04:17.880> fairly<00:04:18.660> rough<00:04:18.960> part<00:04:19.230> of<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.440> mask

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
it's just fairly rough part of the mask

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:38.629 
it's just fairly rough part of the mask
and<00:04:19.980> if<00:04:20.670> we<00:04:20.880> just<00:04:21.560> draw<00:04:22.560> a<00:04:22.590> path<00:04:22.890> there

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639

path<00:04:43.500> again<00:04:44.460> drag<00:04:44.849> black<00:04:45.210> into<00:04:45.569> there<00:04:45.780> and

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
path again drag black into there and

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:48.950 
path again drag black into there and
that's<00:04:47.099> done<00:04:47.430> you<00:04:48.180> can<00:04:48.330> see<00:04:48.479> here<00:04:48.659> we've<00:04:48.810> got<00:04:48.840> a

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
that's done you can see here we've got a

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.020 
that's done you can see here we've got a
very<00:04:49.199> sharp<00:04:49.469> line<00:04:49.949> whereas<00:04:50.580> everything<00:04:50.789> else

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
very sharp line whereas everything else

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.749 
very sharp line whereas everything else
is<00:04:51.180> fairly<00:04:51.569> fairly<00:04:52.080> kind<00:04:52.469> of<00:04:52.560> soft<00:04:52.979> what<00:04:53.729> I

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
is fairly fairly kind of soft what I

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.490 
is fairly fairly kind of soft what I
want<00:04:53.939> to<00:04:54.030> do<00:04:54.120> is<00:04:54.270> just<00:04:54.449> to<00:04:54.599> correct<00:04:54.900> that<00:04:55.319> I'm

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
want to do is just to correct that I'm

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.149 
want to do is just to correct that I'm
going<00:04:55.680> to<00:04:55.710> add<00:04:55.919> a<00:04:56.750> filter<00:04:57.750> blur<00:04:58.229> Gaussian<00:04:59.129> blur

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
going to add a filter blur Gaussian blur

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.309 
going to add a filter blur Gaussian blur
effect<00:04:59.789> and<00:05:00.030> I<00:05:00.449> found<00:05:00.659> that<00:05:00.780> it's<00:05:00.960> setting<00:05:01.229> of

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319 
effect and I found that it's setting of

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:03.320 
effect and I found that it's setting of
nine<00:05:01.560> worked<00:05:01.919> very<00:05:02.159> well<00:05:02.250> you<00:05:02.939> can<00:05:03.060> see<00:05:03.150> that

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
nine worked very well you can see that

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.209 
nine worked very well you can see that
just<00:05:03.419> blends<00:05:03.870> that<00:05:04.050> little<00:05:04.469> edit<00:05:04.740> that<00:05:04.889> we<00:05:05.009> did

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:05.219 
just blends that little edit that we did

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:07.459 
just blends that little edit that we did
there<00:05:05.460> in<00:05:05.900> nicely<00:05:06.900> with<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.110> rest<00:05:07.139> of<00:05:07.379> the

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
there in nicely with the rest of the

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:11.179 
there in nicely with the rest of the
mask<00:05:07.710> and<00:05:09.020> try<00:05:10.020> to<00:05:10.080> zoom<00:05:10.349> out<00:05:10.469> now<00:05:10.680> you<00:05:10.740> can<00:05:10.949> see

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:11.189 
mask and try to zoom out now you can see

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:13.369 
mask and try to zoom out now you can see
that<00:05:11.370> we've<00:05:11.490> carried<00:05:12.060> out<00:05:12.270> the<00:05:12.509> Color<00:05:13.050> Splash

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:13.379 
that we've carried out the Color Splash

that we've carried out the Color Splash
effect<00:05:13.830> very<00:05:14.789> simple<00:05:15.150> very<00:05:15.240> straightforward

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
effect very simple very straightforward

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.920 
effect very simple very straightforward
very<00:05:16.800> effective<00:05:17.330> there<00:05:18.330> is<00:05:18.479> a<00:05:18.509> little<00:05:18.719> bit<00:05:18.810> of

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
very effective there is a little bit of

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.300 
very effective there is a little bit of
the<00:05:19.080> fruit<00:05:19.379> down<00:05:19.620> there<00:05:19.860> I<00:05:19.889> could<00:05:20.099> go<00:05:20.219> ahead

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
the fruit down there I could go ahead

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.360 
the fruit down there I could go ahead
and<00:05:20.460> mask<00:05:21.210> that<00:05:21.479> mask<00:05:21.900> that<00:05:22.110> in<00:05:22.289> as<00:05:22.439> well<00:05:22.469> but<00:05:23.069> I

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
and mask that mask that in as well but I

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.459 
and mask that mask that in as well but I
think<00:05:23.969> that<00:05:24.150> more<00:05:24.479> or<00:05:24.569> less<00:05:24.599> demonstrates<00:05:25.259> the

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
think that more or less demonstrates the

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:28.249 
think that more or less demonstrates the
the<00:05:25.830> idea<00:05:26.189> start<00:05:26.939> off<00:05:27.029> with<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:27.360> intelligent

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
the idea start off with the intelligent

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.110 
the idea start off with the intelligent
scissors<00:05:28.650> and<00:05:29.430> this<00:05:29.639> works<00:05:29.819> fairly<00:05:29.969> well

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
scissors and this works fairly well

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.059 
scissors and this works fairly well
where<00:05:30.449> you've<00:05:30.569> got<00:05:30.750> fairly<00:05:31.229> defiant

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:32.069 
where you've got fairly defiant

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:34.850 
where you've got fairly defiant
well-defined<00:05:32.490> edges<00:05:32.759> and<00:05:33.180> then<00:05:33.719> just<00:05:34.289> finish

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
well-defined edges and then just finish

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.769 
well-defined edges and then just finish
off<00:05:35.129> with<00:05:35.159> the<00:05:35.430> path<00:05:35.759> tool<00:05:36.060> just<00:05:36.300> to<00:05:36.419> make<00:05:36.750> sure

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:36.779

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:39.080 
off with the path tool just to make sure
everything<00:05:37.199> looks<00:05:37.229> really<00:05:37.590> neat<00:05:37.860> and<00:05:38.159> blur

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
everything looks really neat and blur

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.519 
everything looks really neat and blur
out<00:05:39.330> any<00:05:39.569> inconsistencies<00:05:40.500> in<00:05:41.189> the<00:05:42.090> mask<00:05:42.930> so

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:43.529 
out any inconsistencies in the mask so

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:45.170 
out any inconsistencies in the mask so
it<00:05:43.560> will<00:05:43.740> help<00:05:43.889> you<00:05:43.949> find<00:05:44.129> some<00:05:44.310> uses<00:05:44.550> for<00:05:44.940> that

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
it will help you find some uses for that

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.839 
it will help you find some uses for that
effect<00:05:45.509> that's<00:05:46.199> it<00:05:46.349> for<00:05:46.800> for<00:05:47.069> now<00:05:47.250> until<00:05:47.729> next
