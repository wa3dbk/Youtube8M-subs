gimmick<00:04:21.500> you<00:04:22.190> just<00:04:22.430> saw<00:04:22.700> it<00:04:22.850> in<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:23.060> trailer

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
gimmick you just saw it in the trailer

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.380 
gimmick you just saw it in the trailer
it's<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.110> small<00:04:24.470> little<00:04:24.980> details<00:04:25.130> that<00:04:25.940> make

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
it's the small little details that make

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.010 
it's the small little details that make
the<00:04:26.720> game<00:04:27.020> look<00:04:27.380> realistic<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:28.640> the

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
the game look realistic and the

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.650 
the game look realistic and the
animation<00:04:30.020> and<00:04:30.260> the<00:04:30.410> physics<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:32.240> motion

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
animation and the physics the motion

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.540 
animation and the physics the motion
blur<00:04:32.900> all<00:04:33.230> that<00:04:33.470> stuff<00:04:33.740> make<00:04:34.010> the<00:04:34.160> game<00:04:34.520> look

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
blur all that stuff make the game look

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.170 
blur all that stuff make the game look
realistic<00:04:35.330> so<00:04:36.080> now<00:04:36.260> I<00:04:36.290> pose<00:04:36.710> the<00:04:36.950> question<00:04:37.370> why

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
realistic so now I pose the question why

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.120 
realistic so now I pose the question why
not<00:04:39.160> Madden<00:04:40.480> why<00:04:41.480> not<00:04:41.690> matter<00:04:41.930> Madden<00:04:42.740> is<00:04:42.860> the

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
game that you can play NFL football it's

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.560 
game that you can play NFL football it's
the<00:04:50.300> only<00:04:50.630> game<00:04:50.840> why<00:04:51.440> not<00:04:51.710> put<00:04:51.980> all<00:04:52.190> your<00:04:52.430> money

that but it's the other way around it's

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.140 
that but it's the other way around it's

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
wow I wish that was in madness so it

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.280 
wow I wish that was in madness so it
could<00:05:22.520> become<00:05:22.790> better<00:05:22.970> and<00:05:23.240> not<00:05:23.990> only<00:05:24.140> just

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
could become better and not only just

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.440 
could become better and not only just
the<00:05:24.530> technology<00:05:24.980> but<00:05:25.760> it<00:05:25.790> just<00:05:26.060> seems<00:05:26.300> like

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
the technology but it just seems like
