for<00:01:51.930> black<00:01:52.170> ops<00:01:52.350> zombies<00:01:52.920> or<00:01:53.250> call<00:01:53.579> duty

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
for black ops zombies or call duty

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.450 
for black ops zombies or call duty
zombies<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.200> almost<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.530> they<00:01:56.009> put

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
zombies so it's almost like they put

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.410 
zombies so it's almost like they put
that<00:01:56.490> map<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.649> randomly<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.119> there<00:02:00.119> could

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
that map in randomly and there could

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.149 
that map in randomly and there could
have<00:02:00.509> been<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.750> different<00:02:01.170> map<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:01.740> them<00:02:01.979> went

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
have been a different map for them went

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.980 
have been a different map for them went
from<00:02:02.399> die<00:02:02.700> rise<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.540> then<00:02:03.630> they're<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
from die rise and then they're in the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.539 
from die rise and then they're in the
middle<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.469> desert<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.100> then<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.369> goes<00:02:05.490> to

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
middle of the desert and then it goes to

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.219 
middle of the desert and then it goes to
bury<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.270> doesn't<00:02:06.509> make<00:02:06.570> any<00:02:06.689> sense<00:02:06.780> so

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
bury that doesn't make any sense so

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.589 
bury that doesn't make any sense so
that's<00:02:07.799> just<00:02:07.979> my<00:02:08.069> little<00:02:08.250> theory<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.940> there

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
that's just my little theory is there

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.420 
that's just my little theory is there
could<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:09.929> been<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.110> map<00:02:10.440> between<00:02:10.649> those<00:02:11.160> two

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
could have been a map between those two

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.190 
could have been a map between those two
maps

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
maps

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.509 
maps
and<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:13.040> pyramids<00:02:13.580> would<00:02:13.849> make<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.330> wonderful

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
and the pyramids would make a wonderful

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.070 
and the pyramids would make a wonderful
placement<00:02:16.519> for<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:16.879> do<00:02:17.239> they<00:02:17.269> could<00:02:17.629> totally

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
placement for that do they could totally

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.410 
placement for that do they could totally
fit<00:02:18.319> that<00:02:18.470> in<00:02:18.560> with<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.800> storyline

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
fit that in with the storyline

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.729 
fit that in with the storyline
Richthofen<00:02:20.420> could<00:02:20.870> have<00:02:20.989> needed<00:02:21.349> something

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
Richthofen could have needed something

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.550 
Richthofen could have needed something
to<00:02:22.489> do<00:02:22.670> with<00:02:22.879> in<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.239> zombie<00:02:23.690> pyramids<00:02:24.349> or

we see on the ground it sort of looks
like<00:02:40.519> an<00:02:40.790> artifact<00:02:41.420> now<00:02:41.930> something<00:02:42.500> from

the<00:03:39.319> Eye<00:03:39.350> of<00:03:39.500> raw<00:03:39.920> now<00:03:40.670> we<00:03:40.730> can<00:03:40.970> see<00:03:41.209> that<00:03:41.720> this

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
the Eye of raw now we can see that this

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.170 
the Eye of raw now we can see that this
is<00:03:42.139> almost<00:03:42.440> identical<00:03:42.620> to<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.340> eye<00:03:43.370> of<00:03:43.700> raw<00:03:43.910> in

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
is almost identical to the eye of raw in

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.150 
is almost identical to the eye of raw in
the<00:03:44.239> cutscene<00:03:44.750> so<00:03:44.989> we<00:03:45.380> can<00:03:45.500> see<00:03:45.680> that<00:03:45.829> they

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
the cutscene so we can see that they

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.979 
the cutscene so we can see that they
have<00:03:46.400> been<00:03:46.609> indicating<00:03:47.359> that<00:03:47.510> there<00:03:47.720> has<00:03:47.959> been

have been indicating that there has been
some<00:03:48.859> kind<00:03:49.069> of<00:03:49.160> Egyptian<00:03:49.790> culture<00:03:50.090> in<00:03:50.510> call<00:03:50.780> of

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
duty zombies now the old crew why would

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.780 
duty zombies now the old crew why would
we<00:03:53.720> go<00:03:53.870> back<00:03:54.049> in<00:03:54.230> time<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.190> events<00:03:55.639> before

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
we go back in time to the events before

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.240 
we go back in time to the events before
buried<00:03:56.389> that<00:03:56.569> doesn't<00:03:56.810> make<00:03:56.870> any<00:03:57.019> sense<00:03:57.500> well

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
buried that doesn't make any sense well

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.740 
buried that doesn't make any sense well
that's<00:03:58.400> not<00:03:58.549> what<00:03:58.670> I'm<00:03:58.760> thinking<00:03:59.150> my<00:03:59.420> idea<00:03:59.690> is

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
that's not what I'm thinking my idea is

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.550 
that's not what I'm thinking my idea is
we're<00:04:00.319> actually<00:04:00.530> in<00:04:01.099> ancient<00:04:01.790> Egypt<00:04:02.750> at<00:04:02.959> the

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
we're actually in ancient Egypt at the

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.099 
we're actually in ancient Egypt at the
moment<00:04:04.010> that<00:04:04.099> it's<00:04:04.280> happening<00:04:04.790> so<00:04:05.389> 4,000

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
moment that it's happening so 4,000

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:08.470 
moment that it's happening so 4,000
years<00:04:06.290> back<00:04:06.530> now<00:04:07.220> Egyptians<00:04:07.760> are<00:04:07.849> incredibly

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
years back now Egyptians are incredibly

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.530 
years back now Egyptians are incredibly
smart<00:04:08.810> okay<00:04:09.019> we've<00:04:09.769> seen<00:04:10.190> from<00:04:10.700> hieroglyphics

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
smart okay we've seen from hieroglyphics

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.059 
smart okay we've seen from hieroglyphics
and<00:04:11.690> stuff<00:04:12.049> like<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:12.260> carvings<00:04:12.859> in<00:04:12.950> the

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
and stuff like that carvings in the

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.940 
and stuff like that carvings in the
walls<00:04:13.340> that<00:04:14.060> they<00:04:14.720> actually<00:04:15.169> perform<00:04:15.650> brain

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
walls that they actually perform brain

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.400 
walls that they actually perform brain
surgeries<00:04:16.549> heart<00:04:16.849> surgeries<00:04:17.419> they<00:04:17.840> even<00:04:18.169> have

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
surgeries heart surgeries they even have

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.759 
surgeries heart surgeries they even have
found<00:04:18.769> a<00:04:19.039> battery<00:04:19.609> used<00:04:20.359> by<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.630> Egyptians

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
found a battery used by the Egyptians

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.780 
found a battery used by the Egyptians
that<00:04:21.769> were<00:04:21.979> actually<00:04:22.270> dated

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
that were actually dated

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.550 
that were actually dated
the<00:04:23.910> years<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.510> they<00:04:24.690> have<00:04:24.810> lived<00:04:25.140> so<00:04:25.410> they

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
the years that they have lived so they

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.070 
the years that they have lived so they
actually<00:04:25.680> made<00:04:26.100> batteries<00:04:26.760> so<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:27.660> storyline

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
actually made batteries so the storyline

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.310 
actually made batteries so the storyline
can<00:04:28.230> go<00:04:28.410> that<00:04:29.190> they<00:04:29.340> found<00:04:29.610> element<00:04:30.150> 115<00:04:30.690> and

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
can go that they found element 115 and

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.590 
can go that they found element 115 and
they've<00:04:31.560> they've<00:04:32.310> studied<00:04:32.850> it<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:33.300> they

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
they've they've studied it and they

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.110 
they've they've studied it and they
figured<00:04:34.020> out<00:04:34.140> what<00:04:34.440> what<00:04:35.160> its<00:04:35.280> potential<00:04:35.940> is

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
figured out what what its potential is

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.350 
figured out what what its potential is
and<00:04:36.440> it<00:04:37.440> backfired<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:38.370> zombie<00:04:38.910> an<00:04:38.970> outbreak

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
and it backfired and zombie an outbreak

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.110 
and it backfired and zombie an outbreak
happened<00:04:39.780> and<00:04:40.290> so<00:04:41.150> we<00:04:42.290> are<00:04:43.580> Egyptians<00:04:44.580> in<00:04:44.850> the

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
happened and so we are Egyptians in the

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.550 
happened and so we are Egyptians in the
year<00:04:45.420> whatever<00:04:45.690> year<00:04:46.310> against<00:04:47.310> zombies<00:04:47.970> and

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
year whatever year against zombies and

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.110 
year whatever year against zombies and
it<00:04:49.560> would<00:04:49.830> make<00:04:50.040> it<00:04:50.070> wouldn't<00:04:50.610> make<00:04:50.670> any<00:04:50.880> sense

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
it would make it wouldn't make any sense

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.510 
it would make it wouldn't make any sense
but<00:04:51.420> because<00:04:51.720> of<00:04:51.750> 115<00:04:52.590> displayed<00:04:53.160> there's<00:04:53.370> my

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
but because of 115 displayed there's my

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.330 
but because of 115 displayed there's my
phone<00:04:53.730> because<00:04:54.210> of<00:04:54.450> 11<00:04:54.780> fine<00:04:55.340> displacement

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
phone because of 11 fine displacement

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.190 
phone because of 11 fine displacement
and<00:04:56.790> if<00:04:57.270> you<00:04:57.330> don't<00:04:57.510> know<00:04:57.600> what<00:04:57.660> 115

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
and if you don't know what 115

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.620 
and if you don't know what 115
displacement<00:04:58.860> is<00:04:59.040> the<00:04:59.520> 115<00:05:00.030> uses<00:05:00.390> its<00:05:00.570> power

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
displacement is the 115 uses its power

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.160 
displacement is the 115 uses its power
to<00:05:01.260> use<00:05:01.950> time<00:05:02.280> and<00:05:02.460> space<00:05:02.700> to<00:05:03.060> have<00:05:03.690> a<00:05:03.720> gun<00:05:04.140> in

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
to use time and space to have a gun in

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.680 
to use time and space to have a gun in
the<00:05:04.530> year<00:05:04.920> whatever<00:05:05.880> the<00:05:06.060> year<00:05:06.270> Egyptians

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
the year whatever the year Egyptians

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.070 
the year whatever the year Egyptians
live<00:05:06.960> so<00:05:07.230> 200<00:05:08.070> BC<00:05:08.490> have<00:05:09.030> a<00:05:09.060> gun<00:05:09.420> from<00:05:09.720> World<00:05:09.990> War

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
live so 200 BC have a gun from World War

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.220 
live so 200 BC have a gun from World War
two<00:05:10.410> at<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:10.770> same<00:05:11.550> time<00:05:11.910> and<00:05:12.210> that<00:05:12.240> map<00:05:12.780> so<00:05:13.020> in

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
two at the same time and that map so in

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.320 
two at the same time and that map so in
115<00:05:13.800> displacement<00:05:14.340> we<00:05:14.430> can<00:05:14.580> have<00:05:14.730> guns<00:05:15.030> all

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
115 displacement we can have guns all

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.630 
115 displacement we can have guns all
throughout<00:05:15.990> time<00:05:16.290> in<00:05:16.560> that<00:05:16.860> map<00:05:17.130> so<00:05:17.400> there's

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
throughout time in that map so there's

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.760 
throughout time in that map so there's
no<00:05:17.790> problem<00:05:18.240> there<00:05:18.270> as<00:05:18.660> well<00:05:19.170> as<00:05:19.320> stabs

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
no problem there as well as stabs

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.280 
no problem there as well as stabs
there's<00:05:20.550> eight<00:05:20.940> many<00:05:21.330> ancient<00:05:21.600> artifacts

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
there's eight many ancient artifacts

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.440 
there's eight many ancient artifacts
indicating<00:05:23.220> they<00:05:23.310> had<00:05:23.460> weapons<00:05:23.700> and<00:05:24.090> kind<00:05:24.360> of

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
indicating they had weapons and kind of

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.720 
indicating they had weapons and kind of
rocks<00:05:25.050> and<00:05:25.290> stuff<00:05:25.590> so<00:05:26.070> they<00:05:26.190> could<00:05:26.340> have<00:05:26.430> used

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
rocks and stuff so they could have used

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.990 
rocks and stuff so they could have used
the<00:05:27.120> elements<00:05:27.660> of<00:05:27.770> 115<00:05:28.770> to<00:05:29.100> create<00:05:29.430> stabs<00:05:29.820> that

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
the elements of 115 to create stabs that

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.450 
the elements of 115 to create stabs that
we<00:05:30.180> see<00:05:30.420> from<00:05:30.600> origins<00:05:31.290> oh<00:05:31.530> no<00:05:31.800> I<00:05:32.010> like<00:05:32.340> that

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
we see from origins oh no I like that

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.220 
we see from origins oh no I like that
idea<00:05:32.640> but<00:05:33.270> I<00:05:33.330> hope<00:05:33.510> you<00:05:33.600> guys<00:05:33.750> enjoy<00:05:34.020> the<00:05:34.140> video
