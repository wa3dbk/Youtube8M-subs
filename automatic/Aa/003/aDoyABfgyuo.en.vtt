definitely a dream come true I remember

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.240 
definitely a dream come true I remember

watching his first film so jonatha and

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.680 
watching his first film so jonatha and
since<00:00:11.250> then<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:11.610> was<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.790> big<00:00:11.969> fan<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.210> his<00:00:12.480> as<00:00:12.660> a

since then I was a big fan of his as a

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.179 
since then I was a big fan of his as a
director<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:14.900> remember<00:00:15.900> he<00:00:16.049> offered<00:00:16.410> love

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
director I remember he offered love

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.040 
director I remember he offered love
article<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.759> me<00:00:17.880> even<00:00:18.150> before<00:00:18.270> Om<00:00:18.630> Shanti<00:00:18.689> Om

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
article to me even before Om Shanti Om

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.720 
article to me even before Om Shanti Om
had<00:00:19.259> released<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.770> even<00:00:19.980> before<00:00:20.130> Java<00:00:20.579> met

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
had released and even before Java met

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.700 
had released and even before Java met
had<00:00:20.880> released<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.450> somewhere<00:00:22.200> I<00:00:22.230> think<00:00:22.349> that

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
had released and somewhere I think that

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.229 
had released and somewhere I think that
that's<00:00:23.009> what<00:00:23.189> makes<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.579> project<00:00:24.029> for<00:00:24.149> me

00:00:24.229 --> 00:00:24.239 
that's what makes this project for me

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:25.940 
that's what makes this project for me
more<00:00:24.480> special<00:00:24.899> the<00:00:25.050> fact<00:00:25.290> that<00:00:25.410> he<00:00:25.710> didn't

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
more special the fact that he didn't

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.409 
more special the fact that he didn't
need<00:00:26.099> anything<00:00:26.399> else<00:00:26.700> to<00:00:26.880> judge<00:00:27.090> me<00:00:27.270> as<00:00:27.390> a

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419 
need anything else to judge me as a

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.389 
need anything else to judge me as a
performer<00:00:27.930> he's<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> wonderful<00:00:28.739> human<00:00:28.890> being

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:29.399 
performer he's a wonderful human being

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:30.769 
performer he's a wonderful human being
and<00:00:29.489> I<00:00:29.610> think<00:00:29.820> somewhere<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.270> comes<00:00:30.540> across

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
and I think somewhere that comes across

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.749 
and I think somewhere that comes across
on<00:00:31.140> screen<00:00:31.559> and<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.919> comes<00:00:32.160> across<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.489> his

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
on screen and that comes across in his

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.590 
on screen and that comes across in his
direction<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:34.610> he<00:00:35.610> makes<00:00:35.790> everyone<00:00:36.150> on<00:00:36.390> set

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
direction and he makes everyone on set

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.210 
direction and he makes everyone on set
feels<00:00:36.810> really<00:00:37.050> comfortable<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.950> he's<00:00:38.190> a

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
feels really comfortable and and he's a

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.010 
feels really comfortable and and he's a
very<00:00:38.490> very<00:00:38.730> warm<00:00:39.000> person<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.630> I<00:00:39.690> think<00:00:39.870> that's

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
very very warm person and I think that's

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.080 
very very warm person and I think that's
what<00:00:40.170> makes<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.950> film<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.400> me<00:00:41.520> one<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.880> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
what makes this film for me one of the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.510 
what makes this film for me one of the
most<00:00:42.270> memorable

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.330 

safe<00:00:46.420> is<00:00:46.570> a<00:00:46.600> complete<00:00:46.989> but<00:00:47.170> Johan<00:00:47.500> set<00:00:47.770> I

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
safe is a complete but Johan set I

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.030 
safe is a complete but Johan set I
remember<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.210> first<00:00:49.559> schedule<00:00:50.559> we<00:00:50.739> had<00:00:50.890> in

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
remember the first schedule we had in

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.830 
remember the first schedule we had in
London<00:00:51.190> he<00:00:51.489> took<00:00:51.670> time<00:00:51.879> to<00:00:52.059> kind<00:00:52.329> of<00:00:52.420> open<00:00:52.719> up

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
London he took time to kind of open up

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.799 
London he took time to kind of open up
an<00:00:53.050> and<00:00:53.260> be<00:00:53.410> comfortable<00:00:54.269> but<00:00:55.269> after<00:00:55.570> a<00:00:55.600> while

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
an and be comfortable but after a while

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.560 
an and be comfortable but after a while
I<00:00:55.870> think<00:00:56.079> he<00:00:56.379> became<00:00:57.190> a<00:00:57.370> lot<00:00:57.579> more<00:00:57.610> easy<00:00:58.000> he's

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
I think he became a lot more easy he's

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.930 
I think he became a lot more easy he's
again<00:00:58.870> an<00:00:59.199> extremely<00:00:59.800> sensitive<00:01:00.040> person<00:01:00.760> a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
again an extremely sensitive person a

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.590 
again an extremely sensitive person a
gentleman<00:01:01.510> and<00:01:02.610> also<00:01:03.610> very<00:01:03.790> intelligent<00:01:04.479> I

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
gentleman and also very intelligent I

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.260 
gentleman and also very intelligent I
have<00:01:04.690> noticed<00:01:05.019> that<00:01:05.170> he<00:01:05.290> has<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:06.640> lot<00:01:07.149> of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
have noticed that he has a lot of

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.760 
have noticed that he has a lot of
knowledge<00:01:07.450> about<00:01:07.780> a<00:01:07.960> lot<00:01:08.200> of<00:01:08.320> things<00:01:08.530> in<00:01:08.740> life

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
knowledge about a lot of things in life

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.219 
knowledge about a lot of things in life
and<00:01:09.250> I<00:01:10.000> think<00:01:10.240> that's<00:01:10.600> what<00:01:10.810> makes<00:01:11.020> his

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
and I think that's what makes his

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.410 
and I think that's what makes his
personality<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:11.890> lot<00:01:12.100> more<00:01:12.310> interesting<00:01:12.820> and<00:01:12.970> I

personality a lot more interesting and I

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.639 
personality a lot more interesting and I
think<00:01:13.780> he's<00:01:13.869> one<00:01:13.899> of<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.200> most<00:01:14.470> brilliant

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
think he's one of the most brilliant

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.250 
think he's one of the most brilliant
actors<00:01:15.190> we<00:01:15.340> have

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.470 

I<00:01:18.350> think<00:01:19.130> what<00:01:19.250> differentiates<00:01:19.580> this<00:01:20.150> film

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
I think what differentiates this film

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.080 
I think what differentiates this film
from<00:01:20.720> from<00:01:21.050> the<00:01:21.170> rest<00:01:21.350> of<00:01:21.560> my<00:01:21.680> films<00:01:22.070> like<00:01:22.820> Om

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
from from the rest of my films like Om

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.260 
from from the rest of my films like Om
Shanti<00:01:23.150> Om<00:01:23.450> for<00:01:23.690> example<00:01:24.170> was<00:01:24.440> also<00:01:24.940> in<00:01:25.940> a<00:01:26.120> way

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
Shanti Om for example was also in a way

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.500 
Shanti Om for example was also in a way
a<00:01:26.300> romantic<00:01:27.020> film<00:01:27.260> but<00:01:27.500> I<00:01:27.530> think<00:01:28.150> I'd<00:01:29.150> like<00:01:29.360> to

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
a romantic film but I think I'd like to

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.210 
a romantic film but I think I'd like to
believe<00:01:29.690> that<00:01:29.750> this<00:01:29.960> is<00:01:30.110> a<00:01:30.140> very<00:01:30.350> real<00:01:30.680> film<00:01:31.070> I

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
believe that this is a very real film I

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.910 
believe that this is a very real film I
think<00:01:31.750> people<00:01:32.750> of<00:01:32.840> all<00:01:33.050> generations<00:01:33.410> will
