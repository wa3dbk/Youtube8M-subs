00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.870
 today talk about the stove on 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.269
 vase 99 I just now have this skin move 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.500
 removed the pawn which is under the hood from above 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.500
 worth thinking I 'll shoot this whole thing 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.960
 the fact that the stove was not heated nozzles like 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.039
 burning boiling water and the stove does not fianit 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.420
 blowing boiling water that is warm and here we are 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:34.110
 see what the trouble immediately awaits us here 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:36.710
 skinned motor stove stands and this 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.930
 here is foliage 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:47.360
 only the initial stage turns out this 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:49.200
 just now I will shoot a motor and 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.219
 see what's next in the process 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.410
 it turns out 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:59.219
 leaves clogged radiator whole 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:02.210
 bombarded ie from this all these 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.210
 leaf layer 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.119
 it's just a carbon copy 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.939
 I imagine how much a motor is already 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:22.140
 pumped there inside the leaves poured 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:24.650
 on the radiator right now, let's see 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.650
 what is there 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:34.040
 Here we pulled the motor stove 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:38.900
 here it is mounted on two screws 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.810
 here we mine does not know arno 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.670
 can not see nifiga 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.910
 In short, if hand to the mine soloist 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:55.030
 radiator is felt and felt 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:58.460
 so much debris and foliage just kapets 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:02.150
 just , that is, the radiator is obtained 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:06.460
 lies here and so over the mine all this 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:11.030
 covered with foliage debris on top 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.840
 so that I understand from mine now 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.840
 so simple 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:22.250
 garbage dump and mine is obtained in 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.660
 the stove of it is all autumn foliage then here 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.560
 stove motor itself 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:35.830
 inside him as you can see too 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:39.230
 leaves just already how much is there 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.180
 on the propellers wound up the idea just not 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:46.010
 here but once already removed that and a motor 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.510
 I'll take it off right away I will all be quieter 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.420
 stove work to 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.930
 we mine was going to shove a vacuum cleaner there 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.930
 maybe 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:05.460
 so I collected the stove 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.180
 motor anointed skin closed here 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.490
 checked 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.920
 Well, the effect is not that I thought because of the leaves 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:18.650
 heats badly the wrong effect 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:22.770
 there by a simple method merged antifreeze took here 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.450
 so here is one pawn that's seen pipe 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:31.560
 here she goes and 2 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:34.110
 removed the pipes here and drove there hard in 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.100
 This tube in general to ovens crane 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.790
 already dressed in the salon goes driven 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.650
 screwdriver and it turns out that I have 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.900
 the flap is half closed 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:51.510
 although the box in the cabin of the stove crane 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:55.140
 completely open i mean glasses 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:04:00.900
 it turned out the checkbox flap 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:03.380
 stuck it turned out that bad duct 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:08.490
 through heating cooler held 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:10.860
 Now here is a case here so I 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:14.370
 a screwdriver this valve opened the flap 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.630
 through this pipe taken here but in general 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:22.890
 I need to change the crane I will be a little later 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:26.210
 while you have to drive a car like this 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.210
 an incident occurred
