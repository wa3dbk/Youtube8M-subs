00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.000
 Hello, everyone! Today I will show you how we can clean our face at home. 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.600
 We often do not have time to visit a cosmetician, we have no desire or money ... 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.780
 That is why we have to deal with ourselves. First, it is necessary: 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.910
 to open the pores on our face. To do this, we put water on the hotpot to boil and add two spoons of bicarbonate soda. 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.609
 Then we have to bend and position our face over the vapors to open our pores. 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.970
 We need to stay in this position for at least 15 minutes, 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.259
 using a cloth to cover it. I know it's not easy. I also barely stand, but we need to stay in this position to open the pores. 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:47.009
 As a next step we have to remove the dead cells. To that end, we must use sorrow. We can use ready or do ourselves. 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.129
 It is enough to put 5 tablespoons of olive oil in the pan 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.590
 and 4 spoons of brown sugar. 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.970
 Stir, mix ... If you like, you can add honey that is very useful for the skin. 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.740
 You can also have a meal if you want. 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.270
 So, stirring, stirring ... and forming this pretty thick mess, especially if you add honey. 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.799
 Then we have to get a little dirty. 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.860
 We set 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.550
 that sorrow ... 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:39.189
 We take her hands, whether bought or prepared at home, and rub it in the person with massage movements. 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.099
 Be more insistent on the problem areas - for example, the chin, 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.949
 nose, forehead. 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.979
 Massage, Massage ... 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.229
 Now that you've got a good deal of grief 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.720
 we should wash the face. Rinse with warm water. 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.480
 Thus, we move on to the third step: 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:08.100
 Cleaning! To cleanse our face we need a cleansing milk or gel. 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.800
 Put it directly on your fingers and rub it in your face again with massage movements. 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.480
 Once we have massaged our face with him, we should wash it with warm water. 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.400
 So we reach a step 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.820
 4: cleansing the face 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:42.439
 To do this we have to make a mask. Today I will use the intensive nourishing mask 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.739
 of Nivea, which is for sensitive skin. 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.469
 You can also make a mask at home like these "do it yourself" 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.000
 which I have shown in my channel. You can find some, among which is the one above. This is a black-out mask, 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.779
 which is made with lemon, yoghurt, honey and protein and is really 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:11.060
 very good. You can click on the video link to include it directly if you are interested in masks that you can do yourself. 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.609
 Also in my channel you can find a mask for smooth and radiant skin. 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.659
 You will find a variety of masks. 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:27.649
 Thus, we apply the entire mask on the face. For the one I used from Nivea, I wrote about removing it with a cloth 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.780
 like this... 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.400
 Whether you clean your handkerchief depends on what mask you have made. 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.460
 They even called me over the phone. Every time I shoot a video, I'm ringing someone. 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:45.559
 So, we go again to wash our face after the mask. Here and my puppy Kamila hooks me up :) 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:53.989
 Then comes the tonic. For this purpose I will use this Garnish toner with grape extract. We apply it on the face. 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.228
 It is important to let it dip into the skin and dry in the air. 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.030
 I recommend 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.440
 whenever you use a cleansing milk, use a tonic then. 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.809
 Here it is, and Camilla next to me. 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.250
 She is a bergamot shepherd dog. 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.200
 Is there anyone? 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:23.600
 The last step is hydration. We'll put a nourishing face cream on it all over the face. 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.880
 Massage your skin 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.880
 After this step, 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.900
 that you will have beautiful skin. 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:38.000
 This face-cleaning mode should be repeated at least once every three weeks. You will notice visible results. 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:45.060
 If you like, you can also see my latest videos. On the left I painted my hair with Prodigy paint. And on the right you can see how to make a fish bone. 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.260
 I send you a big kiss 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.840
 and I wish you a nice day!
