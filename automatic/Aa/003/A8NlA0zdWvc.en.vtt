00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.170
 hi everyone today I want to show you a 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.760
 very bright makeup look perfect 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.530
 to look on any occasion I have 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.910
 added false eyelashes thinking about the 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.910
 wedding season baptisms and communions 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.260
 first of all I put a prebase of 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.180
 shadows so that they last intact 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.560
 more time although this one of him is not 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.420
 infallible and I would not dare to 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.860
 recommend someone compared with 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.860
 many folds or very fatty 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.010
 I'm going to apply a green shadow on both 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.989
 ends of the mobile eyelid its coverage 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.699
 it is modulable so press the brush 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.150
 several times until the intensity 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.150
 convince 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.440
 illuminated the center of the eye with a shadow 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.440
 Clarita with shiny finish 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.960
 with the brush that used to put the 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.940
 green color blurs the edges 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.280
 I'm going to mark the account with another shadow 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.720
 baby this is a little darker and although 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.170
 has some glitter is lost to 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.170
 blur 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.920
 with a clean brush of loose hair 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.920
 soft made the cuts 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.690
 and with a small and more compact hair 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.690
 I give depth to the external ub 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.789
 with a light brown tone I finish 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.030
 integrate the color gradient in my 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.030
 skin 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.640
 I give a point of light in the arc of the 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.650
 eyebrows with the clarita shadow of before 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.990
 in the lower eyelid he applied the first 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.520
 green shade flush with eyelashes and the most 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.520
 dark and matt in the last third 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.680
 went on to delineate the eye with black shadow 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.160
 and I'm going to mark the line of tabs with 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.160
 a thick line 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.950
 I want to tear his eyes so he took out the 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:18.230
 shade slightly outward after 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.230
 Blurred everything with a precision brush 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.570
 I follow the same steps in the eyelid 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.430
 inferior but here he only marked the last 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.030
 third of tabs to communicate with 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.030
 the superiors 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.690
 to finish with the shadows I review the 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.690
 eyelid mobile 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.129
 finally qualified the water line 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.519
 bottom with a long beige pencil 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.519
 duration 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.610
 to put the false eyelashes first 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.610
 I'm going to curl mine 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.420
 I'll cut this art model in half 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.579
 the one you are watching and I'm going to put 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.680
 glue on the edge I like 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.900
 place them with flat tweezers since 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.680
 with them he helped me to hit them right on 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.680
 the root of my eyelashes 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.190
 before putting mascara 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.430
 I want the glue to dry very 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.430
 all right 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.630
 to continue with the finish tonic 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.180
 bright in this makeup I have chosen 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.660
 my favorite base trace sant boi de mica 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.660
 forever 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.830
 the coverage is low and slightly 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.239
 modulable so I'm going to extend it with 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.700
 a flat brush of synthetic hair 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.379
 this beveled cut I love it because 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.379
 reaches any area and does not leave lines 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.470
 until the finish is completely settled 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.480
 It is quite humid to reduce this 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.130
 effect without lending him naturalness I exercise 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.880
 small pressures all over the face with 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.880
 a clean brush 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.860
 now if I put several layers of mask 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.400
 of tabs to integrate the false 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.400
 with mine 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.770
 and so that no remainder of 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.270
 glue retouched with black shadow 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.250
 this concealer is one of my favorites 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.870
 I like it a lot because it has good 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.240
 coverage but the aspect that leaves is 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.930
 very natural and luminous also does not dry out 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.930
 absolutely 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:40.489
 with the rise in temperatures I seek 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.679
 control the appearance of brightness 

00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:44.629
 maximum these compact powders would be 

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:46.869
 phenomenal the base and also prolong their 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:46.869
 duration 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.000
 to enhance the cheeks I have chosen a 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.650
 blusher in cream as you see procuro not 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.660
 drag the color and blur it with 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.010
 little touches at the end 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.280
 softened the edge with the brush of the 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.280
 base 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.539
 with a peach highlighter I give a touch 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.090
 of extra light in the higher parts of 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:26.190
 the face as are the bone of the cheekbone the 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:29.360
 center of the forehead nasal arch 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.360
 of cupid and chin 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.610
 let the preparer lip 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:38.610
 nod as I tuck my eyebrows 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.640
 with a very precise pencil fill the 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.110
 holes with special emphasis on the 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.110
 beginning of the eyebrow and in the arch 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:59.719
 then comb to blur the product 

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:59.719
 and happened to fix them with a gel with color 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.510
 I could not pass up the opportunity to 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.820
 Brand new one of the new lipsticks 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.290
 mates of speech this is dove who 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.360
 most caught my attention when I saw the 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.220
 first images its beige tone to 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.030
 peach to do I find it beautiful and 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.030
 super combinable 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.580
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.110
 who decides to implement os 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.220
 I confess that I have already worn three times 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.909
 the same look 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.909
 Thanks for seeing me
