00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
speed control but i just did serve to

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.960 
speed control but i just did serve to
the<00:01:34.770> current<00:01:35.070> temperature<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.610> your<00:01:35.670> video

hardware<00:01:36.409> you<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.560> also<00:01:37.740> set<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.100> manually

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
hardware you can also set this manually

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.279 
hardware you can also set this manually
but<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.060> not<00:01:39.210> recommended<00:01:41.720> you<00:01:42.720> also<00:01:43.140> have

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
but it's not recommended you also have

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.340 
but it's not recommended you also have
the<00:01:43.409> option<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.189> program<00:01:44.670> adjusts<00:01:45.060> your

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
the option that the program adjusts your

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.289 
the option that the program adjusts your
custom<00:01:46.350> fan<00:01:46.619> speed<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.159> overclocking<00:01:47.970> when

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
custom fan speed and overclocking when

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.660 
custom fan speed and overclocking when
in<00:01:48.509> those<00:01:48.659> starts<00:01:49.080> so<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:49.920> don't<00:01:50.159> have<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.490> run

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
in those starts so you don't have to run

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.910 
in those starts so you don't have to run
the<00:01:50.700> program<00:01:50.820> every<00:01:51.479> time<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.770> not

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the program every time this is not

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.219 
the program every time this is not
recommended<00:01:53.429> though<00:01:53.640> because<00:01:54.179> you<00:01:54.570> only<00:01:54.929> need

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
recommended though because you only need

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.350 
recommended though because you only need
to<00:01:55.350> overclock<00:01:55.710> when<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.189> want<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.399> play<00:01:56.610> so

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
to overclock when you want to play so

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.990 
to overclock when you want to play so
