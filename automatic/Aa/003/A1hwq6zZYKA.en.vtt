not really it's just a savage body that
I<00:02:21.220> had<00:02:21.430> on<00:02:21.460> here<00:02:23.640> take<00:02:24.640> this<00:02:24.820> body<00:02:25.270> off<00:02:25.480> real

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
I had on here take this body off real

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.660 
I had on here take this body off real
fast<00:02:26.310> yeah<00:02:27.310> that's<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.520> savage<00:02:28.000> body<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:29.670> the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
fast yeah that's a savage body and the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.550 
fast yeah that's a savage body and the
reason<00:02:30.970> why<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.240> exceed<00:02:31.630> RC<00:02:31.810> up<00:02:32.200> there<00:02:32.410> is<00:02:32.530> a

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
reason why that exceed RC up there is a

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.540 
reason why that exceed RC up there is a
roller<00:02:32.860> is<00:02:33.490> because<00:02:33.970> i<00:02:34.330> made<00:02:34.750> this<00:02:34.930> brushless

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
roller is because i made this brushless

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.280 
roller is because i made this brushless
as<00:02:36.550> you<00:02:36.700> know<00:02:36.850> i<00:02:36.880> had<00:02:37.240> a<00:02:37.270> ton<00:02:37.600> of<00:02:37.630> e<00:02:37.840> max's

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
as you know i had a ton of e max's

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.330 
as you know i had a ton of e max's
before<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.830> sold<00:02:39.100> them<00:02:39.190> all<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:40.350> i<00:02:41.350> did<00:02:42.310> a

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
before and sold them all and i did a

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.980 
before and sold them all and i did a
trade<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:42.850> got<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:44.940> tmaxx<00:02:45.940> roller<00:02:46.360> which<00:02:46.660> is<00:02:46.810> in

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
trade and got a tmaxx roller which is in

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.650 
trade and got a tmaxx roller which is in
that<00:02:47.260> blue<00:02:47.500> Krait<00:02:47.860> right<00:02:48.070> there<00:02:48.370> this<00:02:49.300> thing

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
that blue Krait right there this thing

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.560 
that blue Krait right there this thing
was<00:02:50.260> my<00:02:50.410> alloy<00:02:50.860> emacs<00:02:51.430> there's<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.000> chassis

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
was my alloy emacs there's the chassis

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.660 
was my alloy emacs there's the chassis
it<00:02:52.690> had<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.140> tighten<00:02:53.500> 550<00:02:54.040> motors<00:02:54.370> it<00:02:54.520> took

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
it had the to tighten 550 motors it took

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.300
