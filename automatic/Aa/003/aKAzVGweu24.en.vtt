00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.550
 with diego 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:18.180
 but I wanted to say tens of 20,000 peirÃ³ 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.010
 I could not you could 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.760
 you could not talk to me with your best 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.500
 friend 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.990
 I'm wrong 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.480
 I swear I wanted to tell you but 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.540
 I think that's not 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.730
 I never found the moment and neither 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.159
 I knew how you were going to drink you were not 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:40.039
 with diego you suffered a lot for it 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:44.170
 sorry to think that bothers me 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.170
 that you are with me 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.320
 it hurts me how good you told me 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.909
 that you have entrusted to me I am your best 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.520
 friend or at least that thought 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.289
 they are my best friend 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.020
 for nothing in the world I wanted to hurt you 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.479
 never forgiveness is so important to me 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.820
 that for a second I could not stop 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.360
 think about how to tell you how to do it 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.720
 alright so I understood I like me I do not 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.750
 I can believe that I will be thought that 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.580
 You can get angry at your happiness that 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.580
 have you thought that I am so selfish 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.160
 I thought you knew me 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.420
 but I was wrong 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.420
 and you know what 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.879
 I feel silly 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.270
 and I feel as bad as you do but 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.200
 we knew that this could 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.800
 developers 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.800
 that is 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.560
 Is right 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:54.180
