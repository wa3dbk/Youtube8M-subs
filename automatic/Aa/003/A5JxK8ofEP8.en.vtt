00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.299
 hello everyone my name is rubÃ©n 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.240
 welcome to a new video tutorial 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.939
 of the blender course we continue with the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.090
 modifiers and let's see one in 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.390
 particular is the modifier the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.509
 jet split 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.789
 we started the scene by deleting that cube 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:35.230
 now let's place 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.230
 without more 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:44.840
 to place an excel cloud 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:48.260
 and let it soften for us 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.810
 we go to the option in the hey tools to which 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.550
 go to the left shading and to the option 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:59.510
 It is very for the edges of the faces 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.220
 appear softened not sharp what 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.980
 we will achieve with this modifier 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.050
 it is precisely the opposite and 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.960
 we will be able to identify faces of the 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.900
 objects so that is so that the edges 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.380
 be sharper we go to the panel 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.480
 modifiers to change and we go to 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.420
 the split 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.910
 here we have several options 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.780
 specifically the jet angle with which 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:29.150
 will determine the angle so that the 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.100
 selected edge is sharper not 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:36.080
 we are going to work in principle with 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.530
 sap jets then we go to tab the 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.640
 elitism of and we will select 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:48.300
 master control to select in the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:53.370
 face faces we select this one 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:57.690
 that out there and alt key we keep the 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:00.440
 press the right button on the face 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:05.130
 the other side to select a ring 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:08.200
 control and to get some options 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:13.510
 related to faces 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.629
 and we go to those of marc that we click and that 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.720
 on the edges of the selected faces 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:22.900
 be that there are more sharp we are going to remove 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.319
 the jet angle we are left with sharp 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:31.209
 they are going to leave the editing mode 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:33.910
 so you see it looks like the edges of 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.230
 the selected faces are sharper 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.560
 that the rest 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:43.640
 we can also remove the effect we are going to 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.770
 the key is again control e and clear 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.190
 soup what I would do would be 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.230
 and undo the previous option we're going to 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.500
 press exit 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.310
 of the edit mode and you see since not 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.020
 We are now going to see the same thing 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.040
 faces we can also work with 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.620
 edges we go back to edit mode and 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.150
 we are going to select 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.910
 control top to go to jets and go to 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.900
 solve that edge there 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.480
 alt key pressed press with the button 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:27.780
 right mouse on the one next to 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:31.020
 and now alt + shift and click on the 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.600
 down and then 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:40.090
 let's stay with those 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:42.550
 control and marc shark you see that they have 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.850
 there are some magnificent edges 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:50.120
 we left the edit mode and there you see them 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.870
 the other option the angle simply 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.450
 what it does is make edges sharper 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:01.240
 according to a certain angle you see 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:04.240
 that according to the angle formed by 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.240
 borders 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.110
 this is also used for groups of 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.900
 softens two different 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.710
 While this is all a greeting and even the 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.710
