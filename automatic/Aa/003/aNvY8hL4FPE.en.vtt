00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.160
The hot hatch is as popular as ever, and with
the arrival of a new Vauxhall Corsa comes

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.790
a new VXR model, the most hardcore version
of the affordable supermini. And Vauxhall

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:36.040
has thrown all its tricks at it, giving the
front wheels 80% more power than the next

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.649
fastest version in the line-up.
With 202bhp, it’s also slightly ahead of

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:48.820
the Fiesta ST, Renaultsport Clio and Peugeot
208 GTI in the supermini power race, while

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.329
handily costing £1,000 less than the previous
version, and undercutting most of its rivals

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:15.110
on price.
So, what’s it like where it counts, out

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.460
on a British B-road. Well, you have an important
decision to make, and that’s whether to

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:31.369
go for the optional £2,400 performance pack,
which brings bigger brakes, a limited-slip

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.649
differential to improve cornering and stiffer
suspension. And, it’s the last modification

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.939
we’d warn you to try before you buy, because
while the chassis is no doubt mega on track,

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.100
the springs and dampers are so firm that along
a bumpy road like this we think the standard

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.340
VXR would actually be more composed, faster
and a far happier place for any passengers

00:01:51.340 --> 00:02:01.399
you have along for the ride.
So, unless you take to track regularly, we’d

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.361
recommend the comfier standard car, which
handles superbly and still has ample grip

00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:15.330
and stopping power. And what about that engine?
Well, it certainly has more than enough power,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.800
getting the Corsa to 62mph in 6.5 seconds
with a sucking sound from the air intake and

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.660
rasp from the Remus twin tailpipe exhaust
tuned within a decibel of the legal limit.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.880
Vauxhall has also really concentrated on the
gear shift, which is far better, thanks to

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:48.190
a short, precise throw and the steering, which
is very sharp. It’s still not quite as communicative

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:56.730
as a whole as the incredible Fiesta ST, but
we’d now choose the VXR over the Clio or

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:08.840
208. Sadly it does cost more to run than its
rivals, averaging just 37.7mpg and with CO2

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:18.930
emissions of 174g/km, making it quite a pricey
car to tax.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:27.019
While it might look quite similar from outside,
the new Corsa has a much better interior,

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:38.930
with a large touch-screen and intellilink
connectivity for ios and Android smartphones.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.959
It’s ahead of the Fiesta for design and
layout, but can’t touch the classier Polo

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:52.229
GTI as there are still some fairly cheap looking
plastics here and there. There’s also a

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:58.169
heated windscreen and bi-xenon headlights
for those dark and frosty mornings, as well

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:07.850
as a whole host of VXR badges and modifications.
Recaro sports seats come with cloth as standard,

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:14.280
or leather as in this car and the flat-bottomed
steering wheel is good to hold. Be careful

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.280
of the large blind-spot created by this thick
A-pillar though, especially at roundabouts

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.330
and pedestrian crossings.
The VXR is three-door only, so getting in

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.160
the back is a bit tricky. There’s a reasonable
amount of room, but the tapered windows and

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.560
wide front seats do make it a bit claustrophobic.
A hot hatch is normally someone’s only car,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.580
so it has to have a decent boot. In the case
of the Corsa, its 285-litres matches the 208

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.500
GTI and is just 5-litres shy of the Fiesta
ST. Fold the rear seats down and it grows

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.710
to 1,050 litres.
Despite the Corsa VXR only being in its second

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.389
generation, special editions like the VXR
Nurburgring and Clubsport have given Vauxhall’s

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.699
engineers a chance to really hone this supermini.
Their learnings have made it a very competitive

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:13.300
hot hatch, even if the Performance Pack might
be too firm for most drivers away from the

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.610
track.
The interior is now better to live with and

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.490
a low price and decent list of kit makes the
VXR one of the biggest performance bargains

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.400
on sale.
