00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:08.550
 hello I want to cook this today 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.429
 is there a trick I like you 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.610
 First of all, we want to give away 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.520
 a cooking pot with water the water 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.460
 should be as cold as possible otherwise 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.830
 eggs could burst then we need 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.789
 the number of eggs he cooks off 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.439
 would like and we need some iodine salt 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.179
 I now have the cooking pot on one 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.820
 Herdplatte put the stove plate 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.219
 Turn on the fullest level now 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.739
 neat for about one to two 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.280
 These are just the water 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.500
 into it and then put the eggs with one 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.480
 spoon in the pot free the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.149
 tablespoon of user for that purpose 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.140
 not all of them come together and 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.449
 could burst on one to two 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.250
 We give salt to the salt 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.050
 in addition 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.690
 this makes eggs easier 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:06.270
 let peel because this is the protein 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:10.350
 brings the whole to coagulate and will 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.729
 thereby firm and the protein can be 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.600
 thus better off the shell 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.780
 separate 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.799
 You can also make a teaspoon of baking powder 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.530
 add the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.360
 or a shot vinegar that works too 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.710
 I personally prefer salt 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.280
 because the eggs also take the taste 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.350
 on 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.400
 and yes that's my little one, my little one 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.939
 Secret recipe to make your eggs easy 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.170
 could peel better in the end 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.540
 I would like to tell you briefly in advance 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.750
 hard boiled eggs german man between 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.759
 cook for eight and twelve minutes 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.340
 From then on, where the water boils soft 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.560
 Cooked eight eggs should you have where 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.340
 The water boils for about six minutes 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.079
 let cook 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.759
 I want hard-boiled eggs now 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.070
 That's why I have them easy now 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.030
 time to cook with gold for ten minutes 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.430
 and then they should be ready so after 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.610
 I have the eggs for 10 minutes 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.030
 I have now shaken off an egg from 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.179
 caught the four eggs and become 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.100
 peel this time 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.920
 my salt trick helped and how to 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.490
 It has helped a lot 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.400
