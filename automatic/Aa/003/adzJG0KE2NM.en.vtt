00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.990 
Studios they had no intentions they just
wanted<00:01:17.200> to<00:01:17.260> add<00:01:17.440> animated<00:01:17.890> bits<00:01:18.220> to<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.850> game

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
wanted to add animated bits to the game

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.340 
wanted to add animated bits to the game
itself<00:01:19.300> and<00:01:19.570> I<00:01:19.780> think<00:01:19.960> that<00:01:20.050> would<00:01:20.170> have<00:01:20.260> been

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
itself and I think that would have been

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.320 
itself and I think that would have been
amazing<00:01:20.650> I<00:01:20.860> think<00:01:21.070> crash<00:01:21.340> lends<00:01:21.700> himself<00:01:21.909> so

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
amazing I think crash lends himself so

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.390 
amazing I think crash lends himself so
well<00:01:22.510> to<00:01:22.960> an<00:01:23.050> animated<00:01:23.470> cartoon<00:01:23.590> that<00:01:24.280> that

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
well to an animated cartoon that that

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.560 
well to an animated cartoon that that
whole<00:01:24.580> thing<00:01:24.760> would<00:01:24.909> have<00:01:25.000> worked<00:01:25.030> perfectly

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
whole thing would have worked perfectly

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.480 
whole thing would have worked perfectly
and<00:01:25.690> gave<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.140> game<00:01:26.260> even<00:01:26.500> more<00:01:26.890> charm<00:01:27.280> than

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
and gave the game even more charm than

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.860 
and gave the game even more charm than
it<00:01:27.580> already<00:01:27.790> had<00:01:28.060> but<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.330> reason<00:01:28.570> we<00:01:28.690> didn't

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
it already had but the reason we didn't

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.000 
it already had but the reason we didn't
get<00:01:28.960> to<00:01:29.049> see<00:01:29.170> this<00:01:29.320> is<00:01:29.500> really<00:01:29.740> unfortunate

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
freakazoid and stuff like that so this
