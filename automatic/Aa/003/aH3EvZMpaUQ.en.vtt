00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
the Bauer Nexus 1000 it's a radial line

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.050 
the Bauer Nexus 1000 it's a radial line
from<00:00:21.600> our<00:00:21.779> if<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.859> had<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.430> compare<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.939> to

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
from our if you had to compare it to

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.150 
from our if you had to compare it to
another<00:00:24.330> stick<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:24.990> about<00:00:25.199> our<00:00:25.380> mate<00:00:25.560> it's

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
another stick that about our mate it's

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.759 
another stick that about our mate it's
probably<00:00:26.880> closest<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.599> total<00:00:27.930> one<00:00:28.109> but

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
probably closest to the total one but

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.769 
probably closest to the total one but
still<00:00:28.949> there's<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.340> lot<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.550> differences<00:00:29.970> right

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
still there's a lot of differences right

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.959 
still there's a lot of differences right

incorporated the carbon nanotube
reinforcements<00:00:36.440> basically<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.800> is

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
reinforcements basically what that is is

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.950 
reinforcements basically what that is is
they<00:00:38.250> reinforce<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.120> entire<00:00:39.420> stick<00:00:39.750> with

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
they reinforce the entire stick with

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.700 
they reinforce the entire stick with
carbon<00:00:40.430> making<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.870> stronger<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.230> more

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
carbon making it stronger and more

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.869 
carbon making it stronger and more
abrasive<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.460> actually<00:00:44.940> slashes<00:00:45.930> and

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
abrasive for actually slashes and

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.790 
abrasive for actually slashes and
deflecting<00:00:47.879> pucks<00:00:48.170> basically<00:00:49.170> what<00:00:49.379> happens

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
deflecting pucks basically what happens

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.069 
deflecting pucks basically what happens
when<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.579> get<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.969> slash<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.750> does<00:00:51.960> it

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
when you get a slash that does it

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.740 
when you get a slash that does it
microfracture<00:00:53.149> where<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.300> gets<00:00:54.480> slashed

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
microfracture where it gets slashed

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.630 
microfracture where it gets slashed
where<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.140> deflect<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> puck<00:00:55.800> which<00:00:56.370> does

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
where you deflect the puck which does

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.880 
where you deflect the puck which does
actually<00:00:56.940> lead<00:00:57.570> up<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.780> when<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> snap<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
actually lead up to when you snap the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.029 
actually lead up to when you snap the
stick<00:00:59.129> by<00:01:00.000> introducing<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.140> carbon<00:01:01.710> inside

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
stick by introducing the carbon inside

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.039 
stick by introducing the carbon inside
the<00:01:02.219> stick<00:01:02.550> they've<00:01:03.120> actually<00:01:03.359> made<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.870> more

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
the stick they've actually made it more

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.020 
the stick they've actually made it more
braces<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.830> when<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.100> take<00:01:05.280> those<00:01:05.489> slashes

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
braces so when you take those slashes

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.789 
braces so when you take those slashes
you<00:01:06.270> get<00:01:06.450> those<00:01:06.630> deflections<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> pocket

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
you get those deflections in the pocket

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.590 
you get those deflections in the pocket
it<00:01:08.159> actually<00:01:08.520> won't<00:01:08.700> make<00:01:08.970> those<00:01:09.150> micro

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
it actually won't make those micro

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.660 
it actually won't make those micro
fractures<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.740> turn<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.400> snapping

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
fractures and in turn it up snapping

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.499 
fractures and in turn it up snapping
stick<00:01:12.090> great<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> our<00:01:13.409> Nexus<00:01:13.830> 1000<00:01:14.549> they

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
stick great with the our Nexus 1000 they

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.719 
stick great with the our Nexus 1000 they
call<00:01:16.080> they<00:01:16.500> make<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> shaft<00:01:17.100> called<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
call they make the shaft called the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.270 
call they make the shaft called the
Nexus<00:01:18.180> power<00:01:18.450> shaft<00:01:18.860> basically<00:01:19.860> all<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.220> is

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
Nexus power shaft basically all it is is

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.149 
Nexus power shaft basically all it is is
it's<00:01:20.520> concave<00:01:21.060> down<00:01:21.360> all<00:01:21.810> four<00:01:22.080> sides<00:01:22.380> what<00:01:23.070> it

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
it's concave down all four sides what it

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.730 
it's concave down all four sides what it
means<00:01:23.310> by<00:01:23.490> concave<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.659> goes<00:01:25.140> inward

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
means by concave is that it goes inward

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.600 
means by concave is that it goes inward
inward<00:01:26.580> inward<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.049> inward<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.100> your<00:01:29.310> finger

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
inward inward and inward so your finger

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.190 
inward inward and inward so your finger
is<00:01:29.729> actually<00:01:29.939> naturally<00:01:30.750> when<00:01:30.900> they<00:01:31.020> go<00:01:31.170> to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
is actually naturally when they go to

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.499 
is actually naturally when they go to
stick<00:01:31.619> if<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.310> can<00:01:32.460> see<00:01:32.640> your<00:01:32.820> fingers<00:01:33.180> pull

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
stick if you can see your fingers pull

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.600 
stick if you can see your fingers pull
in<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.290> they<00:01:34.439> naturally<00:01:34.590> are<00:01:35.159> going<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.400> want

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
in so they naturally are going to want

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.399 
in so they naturally are going to want
to<00:01:35.700> go<00:01:35.970> inside<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.570> groove<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.259> inside

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
to go inside the groove on the inside

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.590 
to go inside the groove on the inside
part<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.070> chef's<00:01:38.280> alright<00:01:39.270> with<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
part of the chef's alright with the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.399 
part of the chef's alright with the
Nexus<00:01:40.140> 1000<00:01:40.860> blade<00:01:41.130> they<00:01:41.909> have<00:01:42.290> what<00:01:43.290> they

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
Nexus 1000 blade they have what they

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.740 
Nexus 1000 blade they have what they
call<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.040> high-density<00:01:44.430> foam<00:01:45.270> on

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
call it's like a high-density foam on

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.960 
call it's like a high-density foam on
the<00:01:46.110> heel<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.619> blade<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.369> then<00:01:47.579> they<00:01:47.759> have

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
the heel of the blade and then they have

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.899 
the heel of the blade and then they have
what<00:01:48.210> they<00:01:48.329> call<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> power<00:01:48.930> three<00:01:49.409> core

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
what they call the power three core

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.550 
what they call the power three core
basically<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.060> like<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.240> bladder<00:01:51.630> that's<00:01:52.320> in

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
basically it's like a bladder that's in

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.010 
basically it's like a bladder that's in
here<00:01:52.829> all<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.570> make<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.780> more

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
here all it is is just to make it more

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.080 
here all it is is just to make it more
of<00:01:55.200> a

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
of a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.690 
of a
with<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.509> puck<00:01:56.720> when<00:01:56.930> catching<00:01:57.170> passes<00:01:57.700> so

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
with the puck when catching passes so

with the puck when catching passes so
like<00:01:58.939> if<00:01:59.119> you<00:01:59.149> have<00:01:59.270> a<00:01:59.390> teammate<00:01:59.750> that<00:01:59.810> really

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
like if you have a teammate that really

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.289 
like if you have a teammate that really
likes<00:02:00.409> to<00:02:00.530> fire<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.860> clock<00:02:01.040> out<00:02:01.220> you<00:02:01.460> will<00:02:02.180> be

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
likes to fire the clock out you will be

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.899 
likes to fire the clock out you will be
a<00:02:02.329> little<00:02:02.570> bit<00:02:02.659> easier<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.079> test<00:02:03.259> that<00:02:03.470> pass

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
a little bit easier to test that pass

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.490 
a little bit easier to test that pass
Primus<00:02:04.909> power<00:02:05.390> has<00:02:05.689> the<00:02:05.720> texturing

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
Primus power has the texturing

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.229 
Primus power has the texturing
technology<00:02:07.159> basically<00:02:07.729> what<00:02:07.909> that<00:02:07.939> is<00:02:08.090> is

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
technology basically what that is is

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.749 
technology basically what that is is
that<00:02:08.390> that's<00:02:08.750> their<00:02:09.140> form<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.619> carpet<00:02:10.099> and<00:02:10.340> it

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
that that's their form of carpet and it

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.089 
that that's their form of carpet and it
is<00:02:10.880> actually<00:02:11.150> 20%<00:02:11.720> lighter<00:02:12.170> than<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.530> conductor

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
is actually 20% lighter than a conductor

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.229 
is actually 20% lighter than a conductor
than<00:02:13.459> a<00:02:13.610> normal<00:02:14.030> part<00:02:14.709> with<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.890> Nexus<00:02:16.489> 1000

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
than a normal part with the Nexus 1000

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.820 
than a normal part with the Nexus 1000
it<00:02:17.660> is<00:02:17.720> actually<00:02:18.380> a<00:02:18.620> true<00:02:19.040> mid<00:02:19.400> flex<00:02:19.790> profile

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
it is actually a true mid flex profile

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.559 
it is actually a true mid flex profile
basically<00:02:21.830> all<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.160> is<00:02:22.220> is<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:23.269> actually

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
basically all that is is you actually

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.979 
basically all that is is you actually
get<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.140> flex<00:02:24.410> point<00:02:24.709> by<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.010> hand<00:02:25.750> so<00:02:26.750> that's

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
get the flex point by the hand so that's

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.289 
get the flex point by the hand so that's
more<00:02:27.349> targeted<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.400> guys<00:02:28.580> that<00:02:28.610> actually

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
more targeted to the guys that actually

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.590 
more targeted to the guys that actually
there's<00:02:30.260> players<00:02:31.220> out<00:02:31.519> there<00:02:31.549> that<00:02:31.940> more

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
there's players out there that more

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.180 
there's players out there that more

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
hands and I just really let the bottom

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.069 
hands and I just really let the bottom
of<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:11.959> stick<00:03:12.170> fly<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:13.600> notice<00:03:14.600> when<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:14.840> was

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
of the stick fly I notice when I was

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.190 
of the stick fly I notice when I was
shooting<00:03:15.319> actually<00:03:16.329> my<00:03:17.329> wrist<00:03:17.810> shot<00:03:17.959> was

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
shooting actually my wrist shot was

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.440 
shooting actually my wrist shot was
really<00:03:18.500> powerful<00:03:18.739> I<00:03:19.220> did<00:03:19.880> get<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.060> little<00:03:20.180> while

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
really powerful I did get a little while

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.470 
really powerful I did get a little while
I<00:03:20.750> was<00:03:21.560> actually<00:03:21.799> shocked<00:03:22.250> that<00:03:22.400> my<00:03:22.670> slap<00:03:23.120> shot

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
I was actually shocked that my slap shot

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.840 
I was actually shocked that my slap shot
was<00:03:23.750> more<00:03:23.959> accurate<00:03:24.530> than<00:03:24.889> my<00:03:25.069> wrist<00:03:25.340> shot<00:03:25.549> was

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
was more accurate than my wrist shot was

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.250 
was more accurate than my wrist shot was
it's<00:03:26.420> probably<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:26.959> other<00:03:27.049> way<00:03:27.290> around

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
it's probably the other way around

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
it's probably the other way around
I<00:03:29.120> will<00:03:30.120> say<00:03:30.420> that<00:03:30.720> it's<00:03:31.080> it<00:03:31.650> will<00:03:31.890> throw<00:03:32.160> up

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
I will say that it's it will throw up

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.780 
I will say that it's it will throw up
the<00:03:32.400> blade<00:03:33.050> the<00:03:34.050> blade<00:03:34.290> is<00:03:34.440> actually

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
the blade the blade is actually

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.580 
the blade the blade is actually
different<00:03:35.790> in<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.030> fact<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.390> when<00:03:37.260> I<00:03:37.290> was

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
different in the fact that when I was

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.460 
different in the fact that when I was
taking<00:03:37.860> my<00:03:38.069> shots<00:03:38.489> I<00:03:38.760> actually<00:03:39.200> felt<00:03:40.200> like<00:03:40.290> I

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
taking my shots I actually felt like I

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.510 
taking my shots I actually felt like I
was<00:03:41.099> really<00:03:41.970> wearing<00:03:42.959> down<00:03:43.140> on<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.470> blade<00:03:43.739> but

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
was really wearing down on the blade but

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.490 
was really wearing down on the blade but
the<00:03:44.640> blades<00:03:44.850> actually<00:03:45.150> still<00:03:45.569> fine<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:46.140> thought

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
the blades actually still fine I thought

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.500 
the blades actually still fine I thought
I<00:03:46.530> was<00:03:46.770> really<00:03:47.100> just<00:03:47.280> torquing<00:03:47.880> on<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.420> the

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
I was really just torquing on it and the

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.540 
I was really just torquing on it and the
plate<00:03:48.750> still<00:03:49.140> holding<00:03:49.440> up<00:03:49.590> really<00:03:49.709> good

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
plate still holding up really good

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.180 
plate still holding up really good
I<00:03:50.580> do<00:03:51.180> kind<00:03:52.140> of<00:03:52.260> go<00:03:52.470> through<00:03:52.500> snakes<00:03:53.040> really

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190
