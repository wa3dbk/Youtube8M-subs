00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
galaxy s used whoo

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.890 
galaxy s used whoo
which<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.700> pretty<00:00:11.910> interesting<00:00:12.179> here<00:00:12.570> because

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
which is pretty interesting here because

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.780 
which is pretty interesting here because
we've<00:00:13.170> gotten<00:00:13.440> us<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.860> -<00:00:14.070> now<00:00:14.250> we've<00:00:14.670> got

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
we've gotten us to is - now we've got

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.430 
we've gotten us to is - now we've got
two<00:00:14.910> new<00:00:15.000> galaxies<00:00:15.330> run<00:00:15.480> -<00:00:15.690> now<00:00:15.870> some<00:00:16.170> singing

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
two new galaxies run - now some singing

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.830 
two new galaxies run - now some singing
has<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:16.949> feel<00:00:17.190> them<00:00:17.520> showing<00:00:18.210> them<00:00:18.390> off<00:00:18.539> and

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
has on feel them showing them off and

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.300 
has on feel them showing them off and
they're<00:00:18.990> gonna<00:00:19.109> come<00:00:19.380> off<00:00:19.500> on<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.710> market<00:00:19.980> very

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
they're gonna come off on a market very

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.730 
they're gonna come off on a market very
soon<00:00:20.689> so<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.140> pretty<00:00:22.320> exciting<00:00:22.710> because

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
soon so this is pretty exciting because

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.830 
soon so this is pretty exciting because
the<00:00:23.100> galaxy's<00:00:23.460> used<00:00:23.850> first<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.390> ratio<00:00:24.720> was

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
the galaxy's used first in ratio was

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.320 
the galaxy's used first in ratio was
very<00:00:25.470> popular<00:00:25.920> last<00:00:26.130> year<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:27.000> one<00:00:27.240> is

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
very popular last year so this one is

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.730 
very popular last year so this one is
probably<00:00:27.449> gonna<00:00:27.689> be<00:00:27.779> super<00:00:28.140> popular<00:00:28.380> as<00:00:28.590> well

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
probably gonna be super popular as well

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.589 
probably gonna be super popular as well
because<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.820> brings<00:00:30.029> some<00:00:30.210> new<00:00:30.240> great

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
because it brings some new great

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.069 
because it brings some new great
additions<00:00:31.109> here<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.460> device<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.840> still

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
additions here to the device and I still

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.870 
additions here to the device and I still
think<00:00:34.290> I'm<00:00:34.530> comparing<00:00:34.890> our<00:00:35.160> low<00:00:35.309> range<00:00:35.550> device

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
think I'm comparing our low range device

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.360 
think I'm comparing our low range device
videos<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.809> versus<00:00:37.530> chemical<00:00:37.860> mid-range

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
videos to versus chemical mid-range

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.780 
videos to versus chemical mid-range
device<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:38.969> gaps<00:00:39.180> around<00:00:39.329> -<00:00:39.890> so<00:00:40.890> also

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
device here in the gaps around - so also

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.819 
device here in the gaps around - so also
the<00:00:42.030> galaxy's<00:00:42.390> Dios<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.110> first<00:00:43.320> generation

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
the galaxy's Dios the first generation

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.100 
the galaxy's Dios the first generation
that<00:00:43.860> came<00:00:44.219> last<00:00:44.430> year<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.940> something<00:00:45.840> kind<00:00:46.079> of

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
that came last year is something kind of

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.930 
that came last year is something kind of
like<00:00:46.260> relaunch<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.980> divides<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.670> different

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
like relaunch that divides in different

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.600 
like relaunch that divides in different
regions<00:00:48.120> with<00:00:48.930> different<00:00:48.960> names<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.770> Europe

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
regions with different names in Europe

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.639 
regions with different names in Europe
they<00:00:50.910> launched<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.390> summer<00:00:51.690> called<00:00:52.260> the

core<00:02:17.450> device<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:17.690> think<00:02:18.110> this<00:02:18.530> one<00:02:18.710> is<00:02:18.740> dual

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
core device I think this one is dual

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.550 
core device I think this one is dual
core<00:02:19.460> and<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.690> school<00:02:20.900> respects<00:02:21.350> here<00:02:21.530> a

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.140

little<00:02:21.710> bit<00:02:21.890> first<00:02:22.100> of<00:02:22.220> all<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.820> first<00:02:23.120> thing

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.600 
little bit first of all the first thing
we<00:02:23.360> can<00:02:23.480> say<00:02:23.660> about<00:02:23.750> these<00:02:24.020> devices<00:02:24.230> is<00:02:24.860> it's

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
we can say about these devices is it's

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.010 
we can say about these devices is it's
probably<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:26.090> price<00:02:26.270> difference<00:02:26.420> we<00:02:26.870> don't

you hear the name you get grants it's

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.340 
you hear the name you get grants it's
the<00:02:43.520> big<00:02:43.700> stuff<00:02:43.970> 48<00:02:44.660> comes<00:02:44.930> each<00:02:45.110> on<00:02:45.320> a

here on the galaxy's used to which is
720p<00:02:52.160> display<00:02:52.190> here<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:53.120> just<00:02:54.020> want<00:02:54.320> a

720p display here and I just want a
small<00:02:54.440> 5<00:02:54.770> 4<00:02:54.950> 3<00:02:55.100> inch<00:02:55.280> bigger<00:02:55.550> display<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:56.030> you

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
small 5 4 3 inch bigger display so you

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.270 
small 5 4 3 inch bigger display so you
kind<00:02:57.380> of<00:02:57.440> almost<00:02:57.590> get<00:02:57.830> this<00:02:57.980> thing<00:02:58.100> kind<00:02:58.250> of

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
kind of almost get this thing kind of

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.830 
kind of almost get this thing kind of
PPI<00:02:58.730> though<00:02:59.440> 2033<00:03:00.440> which<00:03:00.620> is<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.830> an<00:03:00.950> 8<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.310> 80

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
PPI though 2033 which is to an 8 to 80

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.170 
PPI though 2033 which is to an 8 to 80
so<00:03:02.840> pretty<00:03:03.560> good<00:03:03.770> PPI<00:03:04.459> there<00:03:04.760> on<00:03:04.880> both<00:03:05.030> devices

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
so pretty good PPI there on both devices

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.710 
so pretty good PPI there on both devices
the<00:03:05.959> internal<00:03:06.500> this<00:03:07.100> is<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.730> thing<00:03:07.940> that<00:03:07.970> is
