same exact move on the next string then

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.010 
same exact move on the next string then
seventh<00:01:06.070> fifth<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:07.119> seventh<00:01:07.509> on<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:07.720> fourth

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.190 
seventh fifth to seventh on the fourth
string<00:01:11.880> that's<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.210> first<00:01:13.450> octave<00:01:13.899> of<00:01:14.050> our

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
string that's the first octave of our

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.330 
string that's the first octave of our
scale<00:01:18.840> then<00:01:19.840> we<00:01:20.530> have<00:01:20.619> to<00:01:20.770> jump<00:01:21.070> out<00:01:21.250> of

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
scale then we have to jump out of

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.419 
scale then we have to jump out of
position<00:01:22.119> for<00:01:22.869> one<00:01:23.050> strings<00:01:23.500> worth<00:01:23.800> and<00:01:24.130> we<00:01:24.250> go

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429 
position for one strings worth and we go

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:27.429 
position for one strings worth and we go
for<00:01:25.300> five<00:01:25.659> seven

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
for five seven

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.250 
for five seven
on<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:28.100> third<00:01:28.340> string

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
on the third string

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.890 
on the third string
then<00:01:30.890> we<00:01:31.040> take<00:01:31.220> that<00:01:31.280> exact<00:01:32.000> same<00:01:32.240> move<00:01:32.540> and

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
then we take that exact same move and

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.380 
then we take that exact same move and
move<00:01:33.710> it<00:01:33.800> to<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.010> next<00:01:34.280> string<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:34.700> back<00:01:35.120> to

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
move it to the next string and back to

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.200 
move it to the next string and back to
our<00:01:35.680> sort<00:01:36.680> of<00:01:36.770> parent<00:01:37.100> position<00:01:37.580> at<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:38.000> 5th

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
our sort of parent position at the 5th

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.080 
our sort of parent position at the 5th
fret<00:01:38.890> so<00:01:39.890> it's<00:01:40.070> one<00:01:40.340> two<00:01:40.370> four<00:01:42.940> finger<00:01:43.940> wise

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
fret so it's one two four finger wise

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.910 
fret so it's one two four finger wise
one<00:01:44.420> two<00:01:44.600> forefinger<00:01:45.140> wise<00:01:45.320> from<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.680> fourth

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
one two forefinger wise from the fourth

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.340 
one two forefinger wise from the fourth
fret<00:01:46.130> of<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.280> third<00:01:46.580> string<00:01:47.080> and<00:01:48.080> from<00:01:48.230> the

fret of the third string and from the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.880 
fret of the third string and from the
fifth<00:01:48.560> fret<00:01:48.800> of<00:01:49.010> the<00:01:49.100> second<00:01:49.520> string<00:01:53.890> that

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
fifth fret of the second string that

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.820 
fifth fret of the second string that
last<00:01:55.130> note<00:01:55.400> is<00:01:55.940> this<00:01:56.150> a<00:01:56.360> on<00:01:56.930> top<00:01:57.290> of<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.590> first

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
last note is this a on top of the first

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:06.280 
last note is this a on top of the first
finger<00:02:02.979> then<00:02:03.979> our<00:02:04.370> fingering<00:02:04.790> differs<00:02:05.360> on<00:02:05.570> the

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
finger then our fingering differs on the

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.560 
finger then our fingering differs on the
way<00:02:06.410> back<00:02:06.680> and<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:06.979> reason<00:02:07.310> for<00:02:07.340> that<00:02:07.610> if<00:02:07.880> we

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
way back and the reason for that if we

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.910 
way back and the reason for that if we
figured<00:02:08.869> it<00:02:08.990> the<00:02:09.080> same<00:02:09.260> way<00:02:09.410> on<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.619> way<00:02:09.740> back

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
figured it the same way on the way back

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.410 
figured it the same way on the way back
it'd<00:02:10.100> be<00:02:12.190> I'd<00:02:13.190> be<00:02:13.400> going<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.700> my<00:02:13.820> fourth<00:02:14.120> finger

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
it'd be I'd be going to my fourth finger

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.180 
it'd be I'd be going to my fourth finger
on<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.690> note<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:16.340> like<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.700> stay<00:02:18.190> wherever

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
on that note and I like to stay wherever

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.800 
on that note and I like to stay wherever
it<00:02:19.370> is<00:02:19.490> I<00:02:19.520> am<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:20.030> like<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.210> stay<00:02:20.480> there<00:02:20.660> as<00:02:20.780> long

real playing when we're practicing the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.760 
real playing when we're practicing the
scale<00:02:35.150> it's<00:02:35.330> one<00:02:35.540> thing<00:02:35.750> but<00:02:36.350> I<00:02:36.380> want<00:02:36.620> us<00:02:36.650> to

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
scale it's one thing but I want us to

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.340 
scale it's one thing but I want us to
get<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.100> habit<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.730> playing<00:02:38.480> out<00:02:38.930> every

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
get in the habit of playing out every

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.010 
get in the habit of playing out every
position<00:02:40.030> before<00:02:41.030> we<00:02:41.209> make<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.390> shift<00:02:41.750> just

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
position before we make a shift just

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.940 
position before we make a shift just
like<00:02:42.170> we<00:02:42.260> did<00:02:42.410> here<00:02:42.709> I<00:02:44.320> shifted<00:02:45.320> only<00:02:45.769> when<00:02:45.920> I

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
like we did here I shifted only when I

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.370 
like we did here I shifted only when I
had<00:02:46.190> two<00:02:47.650> unshifted

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
had two unshifted

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.250 
had two unshifted
now<00:02:51.310> on<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:52.300> way<00:02:52.420> down<00:02:52.600> I'm<00:02:52.840> gonna<00:02:52.930> play<00:02:53.140> the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
now on the way down I'm gonna play the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.970 
now on the way down I'm gonna play the
first<00:02:53.500> finger<00:02:53.920> fourth<00:02:54.760> second<00:02:55.450> first<00:02:55.980> this

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980

the third string right there and the

the third string right there and the
first<00:03:01.780> finger<00:03:02.050> here<00:03:02.200> now<00:03:02.800> that's<00:03:03.730> as<00:03:03.910> far<00:03:04.150> as<00:03:04.210> I

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
first finger here now that's as far as I

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.200 
first finger here now that's as far as I
can<00:03:04.450> go<00:03:04.690> without<00:03:04.900> shifting<00:03:05.730> but<00:03:06.730> that<00:03:06.970> that

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
can go without shifting but that that

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.180 
can go without shifting but that that
keeps<00:03:07.510> me<00:03:07.690> in<00:03:07.840> one<00:03:08.050> nice<00:03:08.290> position<00:03:08.500> in<00:03:08.890> case<00:03:09.010> I

keeps me in one nice position in case I

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.610

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
direction in my actual play instead of

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.310 
direction in my actual play instead of
doing<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.680> just<00:03:20.710> tied<00:03:21.070> myself<00:03:21.370> up<00:03:22.320> just
