hello<00:00:07.390> welcome<00:00:08.320> back<00:00:08.500> to<00:00:08.800> part<00:00:09.010> two<00:00:09.250> I<00:00:10.020> was

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.020 
hello welcome back to part two I was

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.270 
hello welcome back to part two I was
going<00:00:11.200> to<00:00:11.260> start<00:00:11.470> by<00:00:11.710> doing<00:00:11.860> some<00:00:11.920> routing

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
going to start by doing some routing

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.670 
going to start by doing some routing
putting<00:00:12.820> in<00:00:12.910> the<00:00:13.000> grooves<00:00:13.270> for<00:00:13.540> this

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
putting in the grooves for this

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.100 
putting in the grooves for this
I've<00:00:15.190> just<00:00:15.400> remembered<00:00:15.910> we<00:00:16.360> need<00:00:16.570> to<00:00:16.750> get<00:00:16.930> the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
I've just remembered we need to get the

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.830 
I've just remembered we need to get the
central<00:00:17.500> door<00:00:17.680> panel<00:00:18.040> glued<00:00:18.250> up<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:19.660> is

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
central door panel glued up this is

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.200 
central door panel glued up this is
getting<00:00:20.110> made<00:00:20.260> up<00:00:20.290> from<00:00:20.590> two<00:00:20.830> pieces<00:00:21.100> of<00:00:21.460> solid

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
getting made up from two pieces of solid

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.560 
getting made up from two pieces of solid
timber<00:00:23.040> ideally<00:00:24.040> I<00:00:24.070> would<00:00:24.310> have<00:00:24.400> used<00:00:24.610> the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
timber ideally I would have used the

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.600 
timber ideally I would have used the
veneered<00:00:25.930> block<00:00:26.440> board<00:00:26.710> as<00:00:26.920> we<00:00:27.190> have<00:00:27.340> for<00:00:27.550> the

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
veneered block board as we have for the

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.250 
veneered block board as we have for the
shelves<00:00:28.029> but<00:00:28.570> it's<00:00:28.720> just<00:00:28.930> impractical

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
shelves but it's just impractical

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.170 
shelves but it's just impractical
because<00:00:29.770> we're<00:00:29.860> going<00:00:29.980> to<00:00:30.040> need<00:00:30.130> to<00:00:30.730> shape<00:00:31.000> the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
because we're going to need to shape the

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.450 
because we're going to need to shape the
edges<00:00:31.510> so<00:00:32.440> we're<00:00:32.890> gonna<00:00:33.010> have<00:00:33.160> to<00:00:33.190> live<00:00:33.430> with

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
edges so we're gonna have to live with

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.729 
edges so we're gonna have to live with
solid<00:00:34.210> timber<00:00:34.420> leave<00:00:35.080> plenty<00:00:35.500> of<00:00:35.559> room<00:00:35.710> for

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
solid timber leave plenty of room for

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.890 
solid timber leave plenty of room for
movement<00:00:36.040> and<00:00:36.340> hope<00:00:36.879> everything's<00:00:37.330> okay

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
movement and hope everything's okay

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.320 
movement and hope everything's okay
I'm<00:00:38.739> biscuiting<00:00:39.370> these<00:00:39.550> two<00:00:39.760> pieces<00:00:40.180> together

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
I'm biscuiting these two pieces together

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.939 
I'm biscuiting these two pieces together
I'll<00:00:40.750> just<00:00:40.930> put<00:00:41.080> a<00:00:41.110> couple<00:00:41.379> of<00:00:41.440> biscuits<00:00:41.770> in

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
I'll just put a couple of biscuits in

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.729 
I'll just put a couple of biscuits in
again<00:00:42.940> leave<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:43.690> biscuits<00:00:44.080> well<00:00:44.379> in<00:00:44.530> from

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
again leave the biscuits well in from

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:45.660 
again leave the biscuits well in from
the<00:00:44.860> edge<00:00:44.980> because<00:00:45.309> we're<00:00:45.430> going<00:00:45.520> to<00:00:45.610> be

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
the edge because we're going to be

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.360 
the edge because we're going to be
shaping<00:00:46.150> this<00:00:46.690> edge<00:00:46.900> later<00:00:47.230> on<00:00:47.530> I'm<00:00:48.190> just

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
shaping this edge later on I'm just

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.610 
shaping this edge later on I'm just
going<00:00:48.550> to<00:00:48.610> PVA<00:00:49.030> glue<00:00:49.120> these<00:00:49.480> together<00:00:49.750> put

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
going to PVA glue these together put

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.170 
going to PVA glue these together put
them<00:00:50.680> in<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:50.890> clamps<00:00:51.250> and<00:00:51.400> then<00:00:51.760> they<00:00:51.879> can<00:00:52.089> be

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
them in the clamps and then they can be

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.479 
them in the clamps and then they can be
drying<00:00:52.540> while<00:00:53.170> we<00:00:53.290> get<00:00:53.440> on<00:00:53.650> with<00:00:54.040> the<00:00:54.159> rest<00:00:54.339> of

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
drying while we get on with the rest of

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:10.510 
drying while we get on with the rest of
the<00:00:54.610> build

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.230 

so<00:01:11.520> that's<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.760> good<00:01:11.880> covering<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.360> glue<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
so that's a good covering of glue on the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.890 
so that's a good covering of glue on the
edges<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.540> biscuits<00:01:15.960> themselves<00:01:17.900> and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
edges and the biscuits themselves and

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:27.640 
edges and the biscuits themselves and
now<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.380> pull<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.650> together<00:01:21.230> some<00:01:22.230> cramps

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.610 

don't<00:01:28.650> overdo<00:01:29.010> the<00:01:29.370> pressure<00:01:30.090> or<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.620> crumbs

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
don't overdo the pressure or the crumbs

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.300 
don't overdo the pressure or the crumbs
otherwise<00:01:32.010> your<00:01:32.250> bow<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.860> then<00:01:35.010> I<00:01:35.130> can

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
otherwise your bow it and then I can

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.820 
otherwise your bow it and then I can
just<00:01:35.490> put<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.180> side<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:37.020> dry<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.560> get<00:01:37.740> on

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
just put that side to dry and get on

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.000 
just put that side to dry and get on
with<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.100> routing<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:40.229> first<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:40.710> need<00:01:40.860> to

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
with the routing so first we need to

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.910 
with the routing so first we need to
slop<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.460> bottom<00:01:42.090> two<00:01:42.300> shelves<00:01:42.410> to<00:01:43.410> take<00:01:43.650> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
slop the bottom two shelves to take the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.130 
slop the bottom two shelves to take the
six<00:01:44.430> millimeter<00:01:44.970> ply<00:01:45.210> back<00:01:45.540> I'm<00:01:45.840> actually

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
six millimeter ply back I'm actually

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.109 
six millimeter ply back I'm actually
putting<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.800> quarter<00:01:47.310> inch<00:01:47.460> groove<00:01:47.820> which

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
putting in a quarter inch groove which

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.180 
putting in a quarter inch groove which
is<00:01:48.270> six<00:01:48.509> point<00:01:48.750> three<00:01:48.840> millimeters<00:01:49.590> just

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
is six point three millimeters just

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.440 
is six point three millimeters just
gives<00:01:50.400> you<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> little<00:01:50.729> bit<00:01:50.940> of<00:01:50.970> clearance<00:01:51.390> to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
gives you a little bit of clearance to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.050 
gives you a little bit of clearance to
make<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> easy<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.140> fit<00:01:52.320> together<00:01:52.729> make<00:01:53.729> deep

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
make the easy to fit together make deep

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.999 
make the easy to fit together make deep
narrow<00:01:54.420> cuts<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.080> this<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> couple<00:01:55.800> of

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
narrow cuts like this and a couple of

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.580 
narrow cuts like this and a couple of
shallower<00:01:56.369> passes<00:01:56.910> to<00:01:57.570> avoid<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.290> risk<00:01:58.440> of

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
shallower passes to avoid the risk of

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.280 
shallower passes to avoid the risk of
breaking<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.009> cutter<00:01:59.930> remember<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
breaking the cutter remember that the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.390 
breaking the cutter remember that the
grooves<00:02:01.530> are<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:01.830> a<00:02:01.890> slightly<00:02:02.250> different

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
grooves are in a slightly different

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.999 
grooves are in a slightly different
place<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:03.119> each<00:02:03.690> of<00:02:03.900> the<00:02:03.990> shelves<00:02:04.410> as<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> bottom

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
place on each of the shelves as a bottom

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.890 
place on each of the shelves as a bottom

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
the two back uprights just be very

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.550 
the two back uprights just be very
careful<00:02:14.880> when<00:02:15.690> you're<00:02:15.810> making<00:02:15.989> these<00:02:16.260> routing

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
careful when you're making these routing

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.800 
careful when you're making these routing
cuts<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:17.910> make<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.120> left<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.780> right

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
cuts that you make a left and a right

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.040 
cuts that you make a left and a right
and<00:02:19.080> one<00:02:19.590> they<00:02:19.980> are<00:02:20.160> different<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.630> just<00:02:21.660> to

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
and one they are different so just to

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.600 
and one they are different so just to
save<00:02:22.260> any<00:02:22.410> confusion<00:02:23.040> before<00:02:23.130> we<00:02:23.280> go<00:02:23.430> any

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
save any confusion before we go any

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.180 
save any confusion before we go any
further<00:02:23.820> I've<00:02:24.690> laid<00:02:24.989> out<00:02:25.019> one<00:02:25.440> side<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:26.010> see

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
further I've laid out one side you see

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.460 
further I've laid out one side you see
you<00:02:26.250> got<00:02:26.400> two<00:02:26.580> cross<00:02:26.880> rails<00:02:27.209> this<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.380> the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
you got two cross rails this is the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.900 
you got two cross rails this is the
bottom<00:02:28.769> end<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.160> with<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.340> groove<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.820> the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
bottom end of it with a groove in the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.500 
bottom end of it with a groove in the
back<00:02:30.090> for<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.660> back<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.769> cabinet<00:02:32.510> one

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
back for the back of the cabinet one

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.900 
back for the back of the cabinet one
shelf<00:02:34.130> will<00:02:35.130> go<00:02:35.280> like<00:02:35.489> that

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
shelf will go like that

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.750 
shelf will go like that
you<00:02:36.750> can<00:02:36.930> see<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.410> set<00:02:37.680> back<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.459> bit

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
you can see this is set back a bit

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.570 
you can see this is set back a bit
because<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.530> op<00:02:40.530> stand<00:02:40.890> will<00:02:41.040> go<00:02:41.190> on<00:02:41.310> there

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
because the op stand will go on there

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.160 
because the op stand will go on there
like<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.810> then<00:02:43.739> there'll<00:02:44.640> be<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.959> other

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
like that and then there'll be the other

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.830 
like that and then there'll be the other
shelf<00:02:46.410> on<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:47.430> bottom<00:02:47.670> there<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.120> now<00:02:48.660> what

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
shelf on the bottom there so now what

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.990 
shelf on the bottom there so now what
I've<00:02:48.959> got<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.260> do<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.620> run<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.100> groove<00:02:50.459> all<00:02:50.970> the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
I've got to do is run a groove all the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.310 
I've got to do is run a groove all the
way<00:02:51.090> round<00:02:51.420> on<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.739> inside<00:02:53.239> to<00:02:54.239> take<00:02:54.450> side

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
way round on the inside to take side

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.610 
way round on the inside to take side
panel<00:02:55.850> much<00:02:56.850> easiest<00:02:57.299> way<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.420> do<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.660> is<00:02:58.350> to

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
panel much easiest way to do that is to

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.190 
panel much easiest way to do that is to
do<00:02:58.709> horizontally<00:02:59.430> again<00:03:00.090> with<00:03:00.299> a<00:03:00.330> router<00:03:00.660> this

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
do horizontally again with a router this

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.530 
do horizontally again with a router this
time<00:03:01.560> using<00:03:01.799> a<00:03:01.950> slotting<00:03:02.519> cutter<00:03:02.760> with<00:03:03.510> a

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
time using a slotting cutter with a

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.500 
time using a slotting cutter with a
bearing<00:03:04.080> I<00:03:04.310> can<00:03:05.310> use<00:03:05.459> this<00:03:05.640> horizontally<00:03:06.330> it's

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
bearing I can use this horizontally it's

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.170 
bearing I can use this horizontally it's
much<00:03:06.870> much<00:03:07.380> easier<00:03:07.440> than<00:03:08.190> trying<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.820> route

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
much much easier than trying to route

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.789 
much much easier than trying to route
down<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.600> edge<00:03:09.720> with<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.110> pieces<00:03:10.500> stood

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
down the edge with the pieces stood

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.330 
down the edge with the pieces stood
vertically

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
vertically

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.820 
vertically
so<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.910> cutter<00:03:14.120> set<00:03:14.420> up<00:03:14.569> in<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.780> router<00:03:15.020> it's

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
so the cutter set up in the router it's

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.650 
so the cutter set up in the router it's
just<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.069> question<00:03:16.250> of<00:03:16.610> running<00:03:16.940> all<00:03:17.180> around

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
just a question of running all around

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.199 
just a question of running all around
the<00:03:17.750> inside<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:19.220> on<00:03:19.340> this<00:03:19.520> occasion<00:03:20.000> we<00:03:20.030> could

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
the inside and on this occasion we could

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:30.009 
the inside and on this occasion we could
work<00:03:20.420> on<00:03:20.599> the<00:03:20.720> inside<00:03:20.860> we<00:03:21.860> work<00:03:22.069> clockwise<00:03:29.019> so

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
work on the inside we work clockwise so

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.500 
work on the inside we work clockwise so
that's<00:03:30.200> one<00:03:30.410> side<00:03:30.650> finished<00:03:31.130> with<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.120> groove

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
that's one side finished with a groove

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.509 
that's one side finished with a groove
all<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.870> way<00:03:33.019> around<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.470> panel<00:03:33.709> there's<00:03:34.459> a

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
all the way around the panel there's a

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.370 
all the way around the panel there's a
little<00:03:34.760> bit<00:03:34.849> of<00:03:34.940> ragging<00:03:35.330> along<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.140> edges

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
little bit of ragging along the edges

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.740 
little bit of ragging along the edges
but<00:03:36.530> we'll<00:03:36.709> soon<00:03:36.890> sand<00:03:37.250> off<00:03:37.400> just<00:03:38.390> before<00:03:38.569> we

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
but we'll soon sand off just before we

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.930 
but we'll soon sand off just before we
put<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:38.989> panel<00:03:39.260> in<00:03:39.370> so<00:03:40.370> now<00:03:40.489> I<00:03:40.519> just<00:03:40.610> need<00:03:40.819> to

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
put the panel in so now I just need to

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.420 
put the panel in so now I just need to
the<00:03:41.150> same<00:03:41.360> on<00:03:41.569> the<00:03:41.660> other<00:03:41.810> one<00:03:41.930> again<00:03:42.800> remember

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
the same on the other one again remember

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.670 
the same on the other one again remember
they<00:03:43.670> are<00:03:43.819> handed<00:03:44.269> so<00:03:44.690> always<00:03:45.110> work<00:03:45.319> from<00:03:45.590> the

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
they are handed so always work from the

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.210 
they are handed so always work from the
face<00:03:45.950> side<00:03:46.310> on<00:03:47.150> each<00:03:47.510> one<00:03:47.750> for<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.830> two<00:03:48.950> side

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
face side on each one for the two side

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.490 
face side on each one for the two side
panels<00:03:49.670> on<00:03:49.819> the<00:03:49.910> back<00:03:50.150> I'm<00:03:50.480> using<00:03:50.870> six

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
panels on the back I'm using six

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.880 
panels on the back I'm using six
millimeter<00:03:51.950> oak<00:03:52.310> face<00:03:52.730> ply<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:54.440> again<00:03:54.739> this

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
millimeter oak face ply and again this

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.940 
millimeter oak face ply and again this
comes<00:03:55.130> in<00:03:55.310> big<00:03:55.459> eight<00:03:55.700> before<00:03:55.940> sheets<00:03:56.560> so<00:03:57.560> cut

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
comes in big eight before sheets so cut

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.420 
comes in big eight before sheets so cut
it<00:03:57.980> up<00:03:58.220> with<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.849> g/kg<00:03:59.390> 55<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.680> FSM<00:04:01.130> guide

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
it up with the g/kg 55 and the FSM guide

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.729 
it up with the g/kg 55 and the FSM guide
rail<00:04:01.700> in<00:04:01.940> exactly<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:02.840> same<00:04:03.019> way<00:04:03.200> as<00:04:03.410> a<00:04:03.470> block

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
rail in exactly the same way as a block

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.350 
rail in exactly the same way as a block
board<00:04:03.950> so<00:04:04.730> this<00:04:04.910> applied<00:04:05.180> panel<00:04:05.660> now<00:04:06.530> fits

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
board so this applied panel now fits

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.729 
board so this applied panel now fits
into<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.450> frame<00:04:09.970> just<00:04:10.970> get<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.239> dowels<00:04:11.739> lined

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
into the frame just get the dowels lined

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.270 
into the frame just get the dowels lined
up<00:04:14.290> there<00:04:15.290> we<00:04:15.380> go<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:17.030> that's<00:04:17.479> one<00:04:17.690> side

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
up there we go and that's one side

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.069 
up there we go and that's one side
completed<00:04:19.280> so<00:04:19.760> now<00:04:19.970> we<00:04:20.450> can<00:04:20.660> glue<00:04:20.870> it<00:04:20.900> all

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
completed so now we can glue it all

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:21.580 
completed so now we can glue it all
together

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
together

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.279 
together
but<00:04:22.490> as<00:04:22.669> with<00:04:22.910> any<00:04:22.940> globe<00:04:23.360> job<00:04:23.720> when<00:04:24.169> you've

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289 
but as with any globe job when you've

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.290 
but as with any globe job when you've
got<00:04:24.410> quite<00:04:24.740> a<00:04:24.770> few<00:04:25.039> different<00:04:25.250> components<00:04:26.180> you

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
got quite a few different components you

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.750 
got quite a few different components you
can<00:04:26.570> have<00:04:26.780> to<00:04:26.900> work<00:04:27.080> quite<00:04:27.410> quickly<00:04:27.590> so<00:04:28.039> get

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
can have to work quite quickly so get

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.880 
can have to work quite quickly so get
everything<00:04:29.090> ready<00:04:29.330> before<00:04:29.600> you<00:04:29.870> start<00:04:30.229> so

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
everything ready before you start so

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.219 
everything ready before you start so
I've<00:04:30.950> got<00:04:31.100> my<00:04:31.250> glue<00:04:31.520> the<00:04:32.090> glue<00:04:32.330> brush<00:04:32.600> plenty

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
I've got my glue the glue brush plenty

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.830 
I've got my glue the glue brush plenty
of<00:04:33.289> dowels<00:04:33.560> plenty<00:04:34.520> of<00:04:34.610> Crump's<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:35.240> of

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
of dowels plenty of Crump's and of

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.350 
of dowels plenty of Crump's and of
course<00:04:36.110> a<00:04:36.350> decent<00:04:37.070> square<00:04:37.370> because<00:04:37.910> we<00:04:38.000> must

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
course a decent square because we must

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.940 
course a decent square because we must
make<00:04:38.600> sure<00:04:38.630> we<00:04:39.020> pull<00:04:39.320> it<00:04:39.410> all<00:04:39.530> together

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
make sure we pull it all together

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.760 
make sure we pull it all together
it<00:04:40.160> stays<00:04:40.669> perfectly<00:04:41.510> square<00:04:41.870> I<00:04:42.139> think<00:04:42.560> it's

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
it stays perfectly square I think it's

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.180 
it stays perfectly square I think it's
easier<00:04:43.100> to<00:04:43.220> do<00:04:43.370> like<00:04:43.610> this<00:04:43.789> with<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:45.010> frame<00:04:46.010> on

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
easier to do like this with the frame on

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.340 
easier to do like this with the frame on
each<00:04:46.310> side<00:04:46.639> just<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:48.020> few<00:04:48.260> little<00:04:48.710> dabs<00:04:49.100> of<00:04:49.250> glue

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
each side just a few little dabs of glue

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.750 
each side just a few little dabs of glue
around<00:04:51.350> the<00:04:51.590> panels<00:04:52.070> hold<00:04:52.340> it<00:04:52.490> in<00:04:52.580> place<00:04:54.760> this

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
around the panels hold it in place this

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.460 
around the panels hold it in place this
was<00:04:55.970> a<00:04:56.000> solid<00:04:56.270> timber<00:04:56.660> panel<00:04:57.110> who<00:04:57.200> wouldn't

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
was a solid timber panel who wouldn't

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.409 
was a solid timber panel who wouldn't
glue<00:04:57.650> it<00:04:57.800> leave<00:04:57.979> it<00:04:58.010> loose<00:04:58.340> to<00:04:58.610> allow<00:04:59.240> for

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
glue it leave it loose to allow for

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.260 
glue it leave it loose to allow for
shrinkage<00:05:00.580> should<00:05:01.580> be<00:05:01.669> no<00:05:01.789> problem<00:05:02.120> with<00:05:02.210> the

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
shrinkage should be no problem with the

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.840 
shrinkage should be no problem with the
ply<00:05:02.510> make<00:05:02.960> sure<00:05:03.139> you<00:05:03.260> get<00:05:03.380> the<00:05:03.590> good<00:05:04.550> side

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
ply make sure you get the good side

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.060 
ply make sure you get the good side
facing<00:05:05.840> the<00:05:05.930> way<00:05:06.080> we<00:05:06.229> want<00:05:06.470> which<00:05:06.889> is

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
facing the way we want which is

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.240 
facing the way we want which is
obviously<00:05:07.550> outwards<00:05:07.940> now<00:05:08.979> I'll<00:05:09.979> put<00:05:10.160> the

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
obviously outwards now I'll put the

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:16.150 
obviously outwards now I'll put the
other<00:05:10.310> dowels<00:05:10.610> in<00:05:10.910> then<00:05:11.330> we're<00:05:11.479> missing<00:05:15.160> and

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
other dowels in then we're missing and

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.070 
other dowels in then we're missing and
then<00:05:16.550> just<00:05:16.789> drop

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.290 

top<00:05:20.080> rail<00:05:20.349> in<00:05:21.039> place<00:05:23.669> right<00:05:24.669> start<00:05:25.030> to<00:05:25.180> get<00:05:25.270> a

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
top rail in place right start to get a

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.450 
top rail in place right start to get a
little<00:05:25.479> bit<00:05:25.690> more<00:05:25.810> tricky<00:05:26.159> getting<00:05:27.159> all<00:05:27.370> the

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
little bit more tricky getting all the

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:47.490 
little bit more tricky getting all the
dowels<00:05:28.590> lined<00:05:29.590> up<00:05:44.759> looks<00:05:45.759> pretty<00:05:45.970> good<00:05:46.500> and

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
dowels lined up looks pretty good and

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.129 
dowels lined up looks pretty good and
when<00:05:47.919> it's<00:05:48.069> all<00:05:48.220> pulled<00:05:48.550> up<00:05:48.759> just<00:05:48.970> do<00:05:49.750> check<00:05:50.110> it

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
when it's all pulled up just do check it

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:51.709 
when it's all pulled up just do check it
for<00:05:50.500> squareness

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719 
for squareness

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:57.709 
for squareness
she<00:05:52.719> looks<00:05:53.190> spot-on

00:05:57.709 --> 00:05:57.719 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:59.640 

yeah<00:05:58.719> let's<00:05:58.990> find<00:05:59.199> that<00:05:59.319> we'll<00:05:59.500> do<00:05:59.590> this

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
yeah let's find that we'll do this

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.249 
yeah let's find that we'll do this
nicely<00:06:00.060> so<00:06:01.060> now<00:06:01.180> put<00:06:01.389> the<00:06:01.479> rest<00:06:01.629> of<00:06:01.750> Crump's<00:06:02.110> on

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
nicely so now put the rest of Crump's on

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.219 
nicely so now put the rest of Crump's on
and<00:06:02.469> then<00:06:02.770> repeat<00:06:03.159> for<00:06:03.190> the<00:06:03.430> other<00:06:03.490> side<00:06:03.639> oh<00:06:04.229> it

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 
and then repeat for the other side oh it

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.260 
and then repeat for the other side oh it
has<00:06:05.409> the<00:06:05.530> last<00:06:05.710> one<00:06:05.949> just<00:06:06.699> for<00:06:06.789> knives<00:06:06.940> we<00:06:07.120> need

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
has the last one just for knives we need

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.770 
has the last one just for knives we need
to<00:06:07.360> run<00:06:07.629> out<00:06:07.780> of<00:06:07.810> crumbs<00:06:08.139> just<00:06:08.440> check<00:06:09.280> it's<00:06:09.460> all

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
to run out of crumbs just check it's all

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.059 
to run out of crumbs just check it's all
okay<00:06:11.099> yep<00:06:12.129> then<00:06:12.550> look<00:06:12.699> too<00:06:12.909> bad<00:06:13.740> just<00:06:14.740> to<00:06:14.889> be

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:15.069 
okay yep then look too bad just to be

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:16.950 
okay yep then look too bad just to be
careful<00:06:15.310> as<00:06:15.729> you<00:06:15.849> pull<00:06:15.879> up<00:06:16.150> these<00:06:16.419> crumbs<00:06:16.780> they

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
careful as you pull up these crumbs they

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.170 
careful as you pull up these crumbs they
doesn't<00:06:17.139> pull<00:06:17.800> it<00:06:17.919> out<00:06:18.039> of<00:06:18.190> square<00:06:18.460> that<00:06:19.000> looks

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
doesn't pull it out of square that looks

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.260 
doesn't pull it out of square that looks
fine<00:06:19.419> just<00:06:20.139> one<00:06:20.440> minor<00:06:20.979> panic<00:06:21.250> long<00:06:21.550> way<00:06:21.759> we

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
fine just one minor panic long way we

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.120 
fine just one minor panic long way we
now<00:06:22.389> realize<00:06:22.719> that<00:06:22.750> put<00:06:23.020> one<00:06:23.169> of<00:06:23.259> these<00:06:23.349> cross

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
now realize that put one of these cross

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.399 
now realize that put one of these cross
rails<00:06:24.400> in<00:06:24.639> or<00:06:25.240> upside<00:06:25.569> down<00:06:25.810> anyway<00:06:26.319> I've

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:26.409 
rails in or upside down anyway I've

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:28.709 
rails in or upside down anyway I've
sorted<00:06:26.770> that<00:06:26.889> now<00:06:27.060> so<00:06:28.060> just<00:06:28.419> put<00:06:28.569> these<00:06:28.659> two

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 
sorted that now so just put these two

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:31.019 
sorted that now so just put these two
aside<00:06:29.139> weight<00:06:29.440> from<00:06:29.590> to<00:06:29.740> dry<00:06:29.979> meanwhile<00:06:30.880> I'll

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:31.029 
aside weight from to dry meanwhile I'll

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:33.180 
aside weight from to dry meanwhile I'll
get<00:06:31.150> on<00:06:31.300> sticking<00:06:31.719> the<00:06:31.840> up<00:06:32.020> stands<00:06:32.319> onto<00:06:33.099> the

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
get on sticking the up stands onto the

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.820 
get on sticking the up stands onto the
back<00:06:33.370> of<00:06:33.580> the<00:06:33.849> shelves<00:06:34.270> so<00:06:35.259> for<00:06:35.469> this<00:06:35.560> job

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
back of the shelves so for this job

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.550 
back of the shelves so for this job
again

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
again

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.290 
again
brush<00:06:38.560> in<00:06:38.800> plenty<00:06:39.159> of<00:06:39.250> glue<00:06:39.400> tickly<00:06:39.969> on<00:06:40.150> the

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
brush in plenty of glue tickly on the

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:46.589 
brush in plenty of glue tickly on the
biscuits<00:06:40.690> locks<00:06:44.610> and<00:06:45.610> the<00:06:45.729> two<00:06:46.000> biscuits<00:06:46.449> in

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:46.599 
biscuits locks and the two biscuits in

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:58.550 
biscuits locks and the two biscuits in
each<00:06:52.590> in<00:06:53.590> plenty<00:06:54.009> glue<00:06:54.270> on<00:06:55.270> that<00:06:55.539> side<00:06:55.810> as<00:06:56.050> well

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.559 

so<00:06:59.560> here's<00:07:00.129> the<00:07:00.250> up<00:07:00.310> stand<00:07:00.669> which<00:07:01.090> I<00:07:01.330> put<00:07:01.479> on

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:01.569 
so here's the up stand which I put on

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:05.570 
so here's the up stand which I put on
the<00:07:01.720> right<00:07:01.840> way<00:07:01.990> around

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.360 

line<00:07:06.580> it<00:07:06.729> up<00:07:07.710> should<00:07:08.710> be<00:07:08.740> exactly<00:07:09.129> the<00:07:09.310> same

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.370 
line it up should be exactly the same

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.330 
line it up should be exactly the same
length<00:07:09.550> we<00:07:09.970> did<00:07:10.240> them<00:07:10.389> in<00:07:10.770> the<00:07:11.770> same<00:07:11.979> setting

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.340 
length we did them in the same setting

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.770 
length we did them in the same setting
with<00:07:12.580> a<00:07:12.610> sort<00:07:15.030> tapping<00:07:16.030> along<00:07:16.150> a<00:07:16.300> fraction

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:16.780 
with a sort tapping along a fraction

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.790 
with a sort tapping along a fraction
just<00:07:16.810> use<00:07:17.080> a<00:07:17.110> soft<00:07:17.440> malloc<00:07:19.259> it's<00:07:20.259> okay

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 
just use a soft malloc it's okay

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.600 
just use a soft malloc it's okay
and<00:07:21.220> now<00:07:21.879> you<00:07:21.940> can<00:07:22.210> put<00:07:22.889> some<00:07:23.889> crumbs<00:07:24.190> on<00:07:24.430> these

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610 
and now you can put some crumbs on these

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:32.700 
and now you can put some crumbs on these
as<00:07:24.819> well<00:07:25.000> if<00:07:25.180> you've<00:07:25.330> got<00:07:25.479> any<00:07:25.599> left<00:07:31.710> there's

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:32.710 
as well if you've got any left there's

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:37.770 
as well if you've got any left there's
another<00:07:35.639> should<00:07:36.639> pull<00:07:36.880> up<00:07:36.909> nice<00:07:37.210> and<00:07:37.240> square

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:37.780 
another should pull up nice and square

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.670 
another should pull up nice and square
let's<00:07:38.590> check<00:07:38.860> it<00:07:39.039> for<00:07:39.819> lining<00:07:40.060> up<00:07:40.560> that's<00:07:41.560> the

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 
let's check it for lining up that's the

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.050 
let's check it for lining up that's the
first<00:07:41.919> one<00:07:42.130> done<00:07:42.840> that's<00:07:43.840> the<00:07:43.960> last<00:07:44.169> one<00:07:44.409> done

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:45.060 
first one done that's the last one done

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.670 
first one done that's the last one done
and<00:07:46.060> also<00:07:46.419> the<00:07:46.659> last<00:07:46.840> time<00:07:46.990> I<00:07:47.080> krump<00:07:47.409> so<00:07:47.620> I

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 
and also the last time I krump so I

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.339 
and also the last time I krump so I
think<00:07:47.830> time<00:07:48.759> for<00:07:48.940> another<00:07:49.030> break<00:07:49.330> come<00:07:50.319> back

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:50.349 
think time for another break come back

00:07:50.349 --> 00:07:55.169 
think time for another break come back
in<00:07:50.710> part<00:07:51.099> three<00:07:51.430> we'll<00:07:52.150> make<00:07:52.360> the<00:07:52.630> panel<00:07:52.960> door
