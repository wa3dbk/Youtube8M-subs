Logitech came out the mount that works
in<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.060> similar<00:01:21.360> way<00:01:21.479> with<00:01:21.869> similar<00:01:22.229> magnets

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
in a similar way with similar magnets

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.340 
in a similar way with similar magnets
but<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.369> only<00:01:23.640> use<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> iPhone<00:01:24.659> or

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.510 
another good thing about this is that it
uses<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.430> lot<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.790> high-end<00:01:48.479> adhesive<00:01:49.409> on<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.280> it

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
uses a lot of high-end adhesive on so it

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.149 
uses a lot of high-end adhesive on so it
comes<00:01:50.759> from<00:01:50.909> 3m<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.630> really<00:01:52.110> really<00:01:52.710> strong

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
comes from 3m it's really really strong

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.100 
comes from 3m it's really really strong
to<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.579> point<00:01:53.790> where<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.119> actually<00:01:54.509> only<00:01:54.780> put

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
to the point where I actually only put

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.740 
to the point where I actually only put
one<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.649> 3m<00:01:56.250> strips<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.790> my<00:01:56.939> phone<00:01:57.240> with

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
one of the 3m strips on my phone with

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.830 
one of the 3m strips on my phone with
the<00:01:57.899> magnet<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:59.219> took<00:01:59.399> me<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.640> long<00:02:00.240> time<00:02:00.299> to

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
the magnet and it took me a long time to

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.209 
the magnet and it took me a long time to
get<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.049> off<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.380> actually<00:02:01.530> bent<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.159> the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
get it off and I actually bent in the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.270 
get it off and I actually bent in the
metal<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.640> little<00:02:02.880> bit<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:04.380> then<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.860> one<00:02:05.100> it

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
metal a little bit and then this one it

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.440 
metal a little bit and then this one it
to<00:02:05.759> like<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.240> actual<00:02:06.600> piece<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:08.220> put<00:02:09.209> on
