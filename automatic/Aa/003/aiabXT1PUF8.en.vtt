so<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.280> the<00:00:20.820> needle<00:00:21.029> thread<00:00:21.360> so<00:00:21.570> if<00:00:21.630> you

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
so this is the needle thread so if you

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.470 
so this is the needle thread so if you
wanted<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:21.990> show<00:00:22.260> as<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.850> certain<00:00:23.850> ladder<00:00:24.150> like

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
wanted to show as a certain ladder like

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.019 
wanted to show as a certain ladder like
stitch<00:00:24.869> then<00:00:25.320> put<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.830> color<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.369> thread<00:00:26.640> in

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029

your<00:00:27.180> needle<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.350> thing<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:28.890> have<00:00:29.100> a

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
your needle so the thing is we have a

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.820 
your needle so the thing is we have a
wide<00:00:29.850> three<00:00:30.359> thread<00:00:30.689> we're<00:00:31.109> using<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.590> left

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
wide three thread we're using the left

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.130 
wide three thread we're using the left
needle<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.669> we'll<00:00:32.879> take<00:00:33.120> our<00:00:33.359> tension<00:00:33.690> and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
needle and we'll take our tension and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.020 
needle and we'll take our tension and
change<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.649> all<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.040> way<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.190> zero<00:00:35.670> that's

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
change it all the way to zero that's

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.270 
change it all the way to zero that's
what's<00:00:36.239> going<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.420> make<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.809> open<00:00:37.530> up<00:00:37.739> remember

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
what's going to make it open up remember

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.770 
what's going to make it open up remember
we<00:00:38.309> don't<00:00:38.670> want<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.030> when<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.750> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
we don't want it when that is a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.150 
we don't want it when that is a
construction<00:00:40.350> scene<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:40.739> want<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:40.950> nice<00:00:41.100> and

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
construction scene we want it nice and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.400 
construction scene we want it nice and
tight<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.329> we<00:00:42.660> peel<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.290> open

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
tight but with this we peel it open

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.139 
tight but with this we peel it open
which<00:00:44.070> I'll<00:00:44.219> show<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.460> when<00:00:44.670> we're<00:00:44.820> done<00:00:44.850> and

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
which I'll show you when we're done and

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.990 
which I'll show you when we're done and
that<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:46.110> why<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.649> need<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.920> tension<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.730> zero

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
that is why we need the tension to zero

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.360 
that is why we need the tension to zero
we<00:00:48.510> also<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:49.050> kind<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.530> spare<00:00:50.010> thread

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
we also have kind of a spare thread

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.010 
we also have kind of a spare thread
that's<00:00:50.610> not<00:00:50.790> going<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.969> be<00:00:51.120> seen<00:00:51.540> and<00:00:51.780> when<00:00:51.899> we

that's not going to be seen and when we

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.020 
that's not going to be seen and when we
tighten<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.649> lower<00:00:52.890> looper<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.760> blue

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030

you're working with so we have this real
fun<00:01:10.049> edge<00:01:10.409> here

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
fun edge here

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.819 
fun edge here
that's<00:01:11.999> very<00:01:12.569> loose<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.350> back<00:01:13.529> see<00:01:13.799> how

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829 
that's very loose on the back see how

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.429 
that's very loose on the back see how
you<00:01:14.009> don't<00:01:14.249> see<00:01:14.369> any<00:01:14.759> of<00:01:15.209> the<00:01:15.840> lower<00:01:16.020> looper

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
you don't see any of the lower looper

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.989 
you don't see any of the lower looper
that<00:01:16.590> was<00:01:16.740> blue<00:01:17.039> it's<00:01:17.189> kind<00:01:17.399> of<00:01:17.429> hiding<00:01:17.729> right

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:17.999 
that was blue it's kind of hiding right

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:20.179 
that was blue it's kind of hiding right
along<00:01:18.329> the<00:01:18.479> edge<00:01:18.659> here<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.229> then<00:01:19.590> what<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:19.920> do

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
along the edge here and then what we do

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.760 
along the edge here and then what we do
it's<00:01:20.639> almost<00:01:20.789> like<00:01:21.060> magic<00:01:21.329> you<00:01:21.719> just<00:01:22.020> pull<00:01:22.409> and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
it's almost like magic you just pull and

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.519 
it's almost like magic you just pull and
it<00:01:23.159> flattens<00:01:23.579> out<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.630> seam<00:01:24.899> so<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.139> pull<00:01:25.319> all

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:25.529 
it flattens out the seam so you pull all

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:27.529 
it flattens out the seam so you pull all
the<00:01:25.649> way<00:01:25.770> down<00:01:26.039> it<00:01:26.549> looks<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:27.179> is<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.479> it

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
the way down it looks this is what it

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.269 
the way down it looks this is what it
looks<00:01:27.719> like<00:01:27.869> as<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.200> peeling<00:01:28.590> open<00:01:29.039> on<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:29.279 
looks like as it's peeling open on the

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:31.129 
looks like as it's peeling open on the
back<00:01:29.459> side<00:01:29.849> and<00:01:30.090> then<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.689> can<00:01:30.749> just<00:01:30.959> kind<00:01:31.109> of

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:31.139 
back side and then you can just kind of

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:33.349 
back side and then you can just kind of
take<00:01:31.289> your<00:01:31.409> fingers<00:01:31.859> and<00:01:31.889> flatten<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.819> out<00:01:32.969> and

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
take your fingers and flatten it out and

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.539 
take your fingers and flatten it out and
that<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.020> how<00:01:34.319> cool<00:01:34.679> this<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.919> a<00:01:34.950> great<00:01:35.310> way<00:01:35.520> to

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
that is how cool this is a great way to

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.370 
that is how cool this is a great way to
