00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.540 
improving but the basis of the scheme of
do<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.740> know<00:01:52.830> we'll<00:01:52.979> have<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.220> all<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:55.550> really

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
do you know we'll have it all in really

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.290 
do you know we'll have it all in really
it<00:01:56.970> kind<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.450> takes<00:01:57.720> four<00:01:58.259> because<00:01:59.100> we<00:01:59.310> put

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
it kind of takes four because we put

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.060 
it kind of takes four because we put
some<00:02:00.540> other<00:02:00.720> stuff<00:02:01.050> in<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.409> first<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.950> know

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
some other stuff in the first you know

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.590 
some other stuff in the first you know
did<00:02:02.280> some<00:02:02.460> other<00:02:02.610> stuff<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.060> first<00:02:03.330> day<00:02:03.540> and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
did some other stuff the first day and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.630 
did some other stuff the first day and
straight<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> little<00:02:04.320> bit<00:02:04.470> from<00:02:06.259> you<00:02:07.259> know<00:02:07.410> the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
straight a little bit from you know the

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.820 
straight a little bit from you know the
place<00:02:08.640> we<00:02:08.850> focused<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.600> so<00:02:09.780> we<00:02:09.869> did<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.709> know

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
place we focused on so we did you know

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.500 
place we focused on so we did you know
half<00:02:11.070> of<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> verdict<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.760> know<00:02:11.880> but<00:02:12.239> we<00:02:12.360> did

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
half of the verdict you know but we did

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.380 
half of the verdict you know but we did
the<00:02:12.600> vertical<00:02:13.019> game<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.500> then<00:02:13.590> we<00:02:13.709> add<00:02:13.830> us<00:02:13.950> the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
the vertical game and then we add us the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.660 
the vertical game and then we add us the
portion<00:02:15.390> place<00:02:16.040> basically<00:02:17.040> it's<00:02:17.190> more<00:02:17.430> boring

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
portion place basically it's more boring

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.350 
portion place basically it's more boring
as<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:19.080> i<00:02:19.230> can<00:02:19.440> describe<00:02:19.709> so<00:02:20.220> split<00:02:21.090> up<00:02:21.209> into

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
as that i can describe so split up into

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.570 
as that i can describe so split up into
thirds<00:02:21.720> but<00:02:22.410> has<00:02:22.530> special<00:02:22.980> emphasis<00:02:23.400> on

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
thirds but has special emphasis on

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.240 
thirds but has special emphasis on
verticals<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.180> first<00:02:24.420> day<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.100> so<00:02:26.100> after

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
verticals the first day and so after

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.880 
verticals the first day and so after
four<00:02:26.610> practices<00:02:27.330> i<00:02:27.510> think<00:02:28.019> it's<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.380> pretty

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
four practices i think it's a pretty

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.770 
four practices i think it's a pretty
complete<00:02:29.310> once<00:02:29.670> over<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.300> then<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.510> course

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
complete once over and then of course

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.210 
complete once over and then of course
there's<00:02:31.050> going<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.290> be<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.440> lot<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.650> holes<00:02:31.950> and

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
there's going to be a lot of holes and

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.390 
there's going to be a lot of holes and
we'll<00:02:32.370> plug<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.700> holes<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:34.280> couple<00:02:35.280> your

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
we'll plug the holes a couple your

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.430 
we'll plug the holes a couple your
receivers<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.910> talk<00:02:36.120> about<00:02:36.300> dropping<00:02:37.290> later

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
receivers to talk about dropping later

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.780 
receivers to talk about dropping later
in<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.769> offseason<00:02:37.890> trustee<00:02:38.549> and<00:02:38.640> lighter

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
in the offseason trustee and lighter

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.759 
in the offseason trustee and lighter
play<00:02:39.209> pastors<00:02:39.690> was<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:39.989> a<00:02:40.019> priority<00:02:40.260> for<00:02:40.500> you

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
play pastors was that a priority for you

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.580 
play pastors was that a priority for you
to<00:02:41.310> get<00:02:41.670> some<00:02:41.880> guys<00:02:42.060> smaller<00:02:42.870> body<00:02:43.140> ties<00:02:43.410> to

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
to get some guys smaller body ties to

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.560 
to get some guys smaller body ties to
play<00:02:44.130> faster<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:44.910> never<00:02:45.150> really<00:02:45.390> pay

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
play faster and so I never really pay

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.970 
play faster and so I never really pay
attention<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.350> just<00:02:46.620> wanted<00:02:46.860> most

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
attention to that I just wanted most

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.180 
attention to that I just wanted most
fast<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.730> agile<00:02:48.090> as<00:02:48.420> possible<00:02:49.079> you<00:02:49.739> know<00:02:49.890> if

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
fast and agile as possible you know if

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.280 
fast and agile as possible you know if
you<00:02:50.340> can<00:02:50.519> do<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.760> big<00:02:51.000> do<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.239> big<00:02:51.540> but<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:52.170> know

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
you can do it big do it big but you know

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.160 
you can do it big do it big but you know
issue<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.519> run<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.120> do<00:02:54.239> agility<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.959> a

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
issue is you run and do agility is a

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.450 
issue is you run and do agility is a
weight<00:02:56.010> tends<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.579> come<00:02:56.790> off<00:02:57.120> but

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
weight tends to come off but

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.820 
weight tends to come off but
you<00:02:58.640> know<00:02:58.880> it's<00:02:59.210> like<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.630> his<00:02:59.870> begging<00:03:00.710> as

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
you know it's like to his begging as

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.730 
you know it's like to his begging as
fast<00:03:01.160> but<00:03:01.400> fast<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.450> first<00:03:02.690> priority<00:03:03.350> but<00:03:03.500> did

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
fast but fast the first priority but did

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.590 
fast but fast the first priority but did
the<00:03:04.220> one<00:03:04.400> thing<00:03:04.430> we<00:03:04.760> do<00:03:04.910> have<00:03:04.970> some<00:03:05.210> big<00:03:05.390> body

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
the one thing we do have some big body

and the better we get it using our
bodies<00:03:14.930> it's<00:03:15.170> like<00:03:15.520> you<00:03:16.520> know<00:03:16.610> those<00:03:16.790> plays
