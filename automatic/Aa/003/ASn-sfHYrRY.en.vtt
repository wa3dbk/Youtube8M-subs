00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 as soon as you are done in sports car 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.080
 germany speaks all worldwide only 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.690
 a brand in the head porsche the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.380
 racing cars from Zuffenhausen are the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.469
 scale 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.360
 at the throne shake useless in the free state 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.240
 bavaria is a bit different 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.900
 from munich is a powerhouse direction 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.539
 crown 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.760
 no lesser than the cayman r becomes 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.269
 challenged by bmw and that with 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:31.710
 a 1er coupe an unequal fight 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:33.780
 you could think of it but both 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.739
 have almost identical performance in the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.380
 at the 6 cylinder 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.879
 the one she has front either in the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.200
 business 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.890
 but both of course to the rear wheels 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.079
 clearly 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.879
 and both are great fun 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.120
 really fun and still go right 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.489
 Thing 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.190
 the porsche cayman is a real one 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.199
 Kraftmeier although it was his turn 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.969
 not at all does not look right 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.000
 single millimeter track increase 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.739
 to the cayman s he has it 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.359
 Fist thick behind the ears is one 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.960
 real sports equipment that starts with the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.730
 great seat shells 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.909
 this is far from the case with the engine 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.890
 the boxer engine and 60 liter boxer engine 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.770
 in the back is like the fire department 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.909
 turns completely honest and on 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.360
 the race track for properly the sow 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.940
 just get out there can just pure joy 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.130
 The chassis was also rock hard 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.190
 is called gullydeckel crafts with us 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.060
 negotiated 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.619
 Vienna 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.990
 run over or the coach can 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:35.060
 just arrive one-to-one in Luton 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:37.310
 but really fast on the race track 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.909
 is called in numbers then from zero 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.270
 one hundred in crisp 4.6 seconds 280 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.240
 peak 370 newton meters and 330 hp 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.770
 drive the 3.4 liter machine and 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.560
 provide the right porsche sound 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.689
 but only if you put the cayman r on 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.789
 speeds over 4000 hunt tours 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.280
 under it one misses the blessing of 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.899
 motors with politically correct driving style 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.270
 is the sound of the boxer in the back 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.490
 disappointing the mileage against 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.100
 are always on the razor-sharp 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.000
 Steering fast 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.310
 double clutch transversely lock in 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.750
 tail make the impression best times 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.299
 on the round course belong to the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.340
 consistent equipment then too 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.239
 that in favor of performance on comfort 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.349
 is waived 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:24.500
 radio or climate in series failed 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:27.140
 Nevertheless, you have to proudly 76 1357 euro 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.760
 for the cayman r shell quite differently 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.850
 the bmw 1er m coupe 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.799
 you come here to expect 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.049
 generous alcantara meadow and comfortable 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.510
 Sportitze red decorative seams and am 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.670
 sport steering wheel complete the feel-good picture 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.799
 but the functional and impeccable 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.290
 designed interior of the MÃ¼nchner is 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.109
 also far less spectacular than at 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.450
 the use of the comb can be different 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:53.209
 cozy front apron four times word 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.160
 diffuser tail to whopping 19-inch monitor the 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.639
 under the powerful fenders square 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.680
 Find 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.639
 Almost discreetly famous 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.620
 notorious m 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:03.230
 that everyone knows this bayer 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.970
 spares no muscle group use 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.579
 can be a whole lot I would be times 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.560
 that starts with the beautiful interior that 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.420
 maybe a bit too little 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.980
 lifted off the normal one but looked very 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.829
 beautifully made alcantara red stitching 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.359
 that's really tasty over otherwise 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.519
 Of course, the engine is the absolute 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.620
 whats the thing turns and goes and 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.359
 has power everywhere is always in the feed 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.350
 This is really just pure joy 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.620
 or you do not want to go down anymore 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.080
 from the track 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.390
 bmw in format has with its three liters 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.310
 series sexton a true power machine 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.310
 under the bonnet like everyone else 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.040
 speed a performance cure celebrated with 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.080
 340 has the 1er even ten ps more than 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.670
 his competitor and also the 450th 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.129
 Newton meters surpass the 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:48.000
 Zuffenhausen clearly in 4.8 seconds 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.799
 to 100 and 250 km h tip indeed rich 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.829
 so many standards would come into the 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.690
 not to sweat but to bring that 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.209
 the Bavarian simply has too much prosperity 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.120
 bacon more comfort equal weight again 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.180
 among others klima radio altogether 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.900
 whopping 128 kilos in addition to the 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.180
 cayman r 50,500 euro costs that 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.590
 bavarian heavyweight clearly 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.120
 less a bit thought of it okay 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.889
 who buys the car that's yes then 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.840
 mostly people who have the corresponding 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.280
 have money and no rock hard 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.479
 sports cars want to have the same 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.180
 want to have a bit of comfort the 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.320
 climate control sensible seats and 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.539
 just a little rest comfort 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.150
 Porsche has that relatively consistently 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.950
 just omitted and that makes it 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.990
 At the end of the difference the m coupe 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.940
 lands just before the cayman r 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.910
 but only because of the hot 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.940
 use is around 25,000 euros cheaper 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.900
 even more comfortable and 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.520
 suitable for everyday use but on the 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.190
 race track still dominates 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.560
 porsche with his head 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.710
 sequently designed as an athlete cayman 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.710
