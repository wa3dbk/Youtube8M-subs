in this is a unit this is a wig and I've

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.500 
in this is a unit this is a wig and I've
been<00:03:09.739> wearing<00:03:10.040> this<00:03:10.310> way<00:03:10.610> for<00:03:10.940> about<00:03:11.180> two

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
been wearing this way for about two

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.150 
been wearing this way for about two
weeks<00:03:11.870> now<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.500> only<00:03:12.680> thing<00:03:12.890> that<00:03:13.010> I<00:03:13.100> would

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
weeks now the only thing that I would

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.130 
weeks now the only thing that I would
say<00:03:13.489> about<00:03:13.730> this<00:03:13.910> hair<00:03:14.180> is<00:03:14.300> that<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:14.570> does<00:03:14.750> shed

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
say about this hair is that it does shed

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.930 
say about this hair is that it does shed
just<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.620> little<00:03:15.890> bit<00:03:16.040> it<00:03:16.160> doesn't<00:03:16.340> shed<00:03:16.730> like<00:03:16.910> a

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
just a little bit it doesn't shed like a

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.000 
just a little bit it doesn't shed like a
whole<00:03:17.180> lot<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.900> reason<00:03:18.200> why<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.350> hair<00:03:18.620> sheds

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
whole lot the reason why the hair sheds

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.130 
whole lot the reason why the hair sheds
is<00:03:19.250> because<00:03:19.580> I<00:03:19.610> did<00:03:19.880> not<00:03:20.030> cut<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.780> ends

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
is because I did not cut the ends

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.800 
is because I did not cut the ends
usually<00:03:21.500> I<00:03:21.530> do<00:03:21.770> cut<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.459> ends<00:03:22.850> but<00:03:23.060> when<00:03:23.690> the

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
usually I do cut the ends but when the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.979 
usually I do cut the ends but when the
hair<00:03:24.080> came<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.830> me<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.940> ends<00:03:26.299> was<00:03:26.480> already

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
hair came to me the ends was already

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.500 
hair came to me the ends was already
perfect<00:03:27.320> and<00:03:28.310> so<00:03:28.430> I<00:03:28.459> really<00:03:28.790> didn't<00:03:29.060> have<00:03:29.360> to

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
perfect and so I really didn't have to

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.360 
perfect and so I really didn't have to
do<00:03:29.690> much<00:03:30.080> of<00:03:30.230> anything<00:03:30.470> I<00:03:30.769> wish<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.070> had<00:03:31.250> the
