 follow the top 17 south tricks and apps and 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.059
 I even want you three today 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.030
 introduce apps 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.280
 a total of five new cydia apps and 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.900
 Tricks and start directly with the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.440
 First I wish you much fun 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.440
 this video 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.960
 I want you as a first photo bus 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.210
 imagine photo bus before ios seven this 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.040
 is available for free in cydia for 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.079
 the iphone and the ipod touch 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.100
 there is already one for the ipad 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.930
 official version 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.790
 maybe you also know about mc 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.860
 this by default on the ipad 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.660
 installed and now also here about one 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.890
 source in cydia available source 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.050
 her as I said and in the video 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.820
 description for free and we open 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.280
 all this now and see her 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.660
 then directly here that opens and 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.210
 we have the possibility over one here 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.680
 thermal imaging camera for example here the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.660
 watch've laid you there easily 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.609
 Abototografieren we only sounds like it 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.019
 or the whole opens here 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.180
 then I have the possibility of the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.610
 camera to switch between front 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.010
 and rear camera we can take a photo 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.240
 and this will be here 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.060
 We can then display this 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.220
 click and then delete share or 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.509
 just back to the filters and 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.240
 when we go back to the filters 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.850
 we have three others here 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.740
 once this double filter like here 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.950
 I think I can see quite well then 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.280
 also another filter where 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.110
 this is further mirrored and 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.460
 Lastly, we have none here 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.770
 real filter i think thats that 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.600
 normal picture and usually has photos 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.369
 many more filters but I think 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.979
 that in this version first time 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.450
 these four are and I do not have any yet 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.560
 others found there is one 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.970
 setting possibility in the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.560
 However, these settings changed 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.470
 currently in the version unfortunately 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.530
 nothing next I want you 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.299
 she prefers to introduce flash lite level 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.310
 This trick is also free 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.590
 available requires no additional 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.350
 source and we go here once in the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.049
 control center and then we see ours 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.849
 light our lamps off we make 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.560
 can and next you see here 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.100
 maybe this little regulator too 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.990
 me one 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.670
 you can get a little closer to that 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.540
 recognize very well and these we come 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.310
 just pull now 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.720
 and if we do that after he has the 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.610
 have activated camera 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.320
 We can easily do that here now 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.880
 Change strength means that now it is 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.650
 set extremely high 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.910
 So I do not know that you can 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.440
 maybe difficult in the camera 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.850
 know the difference and we can 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.860
 reduce that here now 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.180
 and now we do not have one anymore 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.830
 strong light I think that one 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.630
 that can see very well if he was 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.360
 pretty cool around here then 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.280
 not to differentiate this 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.330
 I think actually quite funny knew 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.210
 I did not know that before 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.010
 it is possible that this led lightning this 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.720
 possibility has that you change that 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.310
 can and you can still set 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.950
 in addition to the settings to 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.290
 Just click on it and find it 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.210
 Here is this entry you can then the 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.400
 were changing this time 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.620
 unfortunately opens and then here's the 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.180
 sliders time and that's actually one 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.130
 quite practical type for free 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.020
 available is the next apps 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.780
 Bettett Saver wants to introduce himself 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.210
 for 17 and you'll see this app below 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.310
 There you can click on what and overall 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.010
 this app should make sure that ours 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.130
 Battery is a lot of fun and we should 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.760
 get double battery capacity and we 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.200
 have several now 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.000
 Settings options as the first 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.710
 battery info there will be everything possible 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.200
 to our battery we indicated ours 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.400
 Condition is our capacity etc then 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.040
 Here is a diagram of what we are 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.590
 will be displayed as our loading cycle was 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.180
 how much have consumed like here now 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.320
 and then here again my charge 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.860
 actually quite handy if I am 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.110
 very cool 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.850
 and then I have extra here 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.860
 the possibility of the settings 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.470
 and we can do that 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.060
 adjust like our battery itself 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.980
 should behave so stream as a pair 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.780
 we can use energy-saving strategies 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.180
 select between disabled little 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.200
 normal aggressive ultimate or 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.790
 custom and there you can 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.340
 Just look what you set 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.780
 would like to additionally coffee still mobile 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.300
 select data blocked we can 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.220
 your mobile data for certain apps 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.050
 Activate deactivation then prevent 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.420
 disable car function or 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.710
 turn off 3g and 4g and turn off 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.420
 much more around it 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.740
 accordingly to spare your battery 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.020
 and I actually think so 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.480
 In practice, however, I find the price 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.669
 three dollars 99 pretty expensive i have 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.740
 now, although improvements noticed 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.760
 not so extreme so I do not have any 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.530
 double battery capacity 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.150
 notice the battery lasts a bit 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.430
 longer but I do not know if that whole 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.000
 you have to pay three dollars for yourself 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.700
 decide 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.870
 or maybe just try it out 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.080
 next i want to give you the app 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.090
 terminal for 17 here also in the 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.040
 design and we have this console here 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.620
 actually already known or mc 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.050
 also for example on the windows 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.640
 Computer, there is something similar 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.290
 cmd for example and you have now 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.850
 possibility over this console on 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.930
 certain things to access certain 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.130
 to execute commands 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.110
 and I do not think I need it now 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.370
 Here's how great everyone explains how 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.750
 they should handle it 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.370
 they will install themselves and 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.980
 they will be happy too that it is here now 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.510
 there is a 17 customized version and all 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.530
 who should not know it 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.330
 inform yourself in advance 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.370
 otherwise it makes no sense the whole 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.200
 to install but for some tricks 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.060
 you need that or for 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.500
 some applications and therefore is the 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.970
 quite handy the source animal 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.380
 you'll find below in the video 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.140
 description around the whole then 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.520
 Add now you have more 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.930
 commands that you can do directly 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.670
 you already know from the previous one 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.200
 version pretty handy 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.780
 Definitely pretty cool that way 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.710
 now updated for 17 in the used look 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:35.140
 was the last thing I want to tell you - 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.070
 introduce these tickets for free and 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.960
 first you have to go to the 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.970
 Activate settings here and chemistry 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.700
 and then you just go here 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.230
 under spoke memo and now you can if 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.330
 her any new language nemo 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.370
 pick up or have an old one then 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.980
 Let's just take this and click on it 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.030
 on finished and save this and now 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.860
 Do you usually always have the 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.170
 possibility to share the whole here and 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.850
 that's standard in ios too 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.220
 integrated you still have the 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.930
 possibility to click on the top 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.400
 and opens when we click above 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.920
 still here that we all in 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.060
 eifa whatsapp or other apps then 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.290
 can open and that it actually 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.200
 pretty handy if we have a language 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.970
 can be sent directly by post 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.070
 i pretty cool and it's free in 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.880
 cydia available 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.020
 that 's it again from 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.730
 this video i hope it has you 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.130
 liked this time was more free 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.600
 there and once there were three apps I 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.190
 Hope you liked it anyway 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.570

 which app and if liked the best 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.170
 her more ios incompatible apps 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.070
 just develop into it 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.760
