Hobby King this is my beat-up original
one<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.609> got<00:00:17.880> another<00:00:18.090> one<00:00:18.330> on<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.660> way<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.230> get

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
one I got another one on the way I get

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.630 
one I got another one on the way I get
my<00:00:19.859> hand<00:00:20.039> out<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.340> there

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.220 

let's<00:00:23.640> see<00:00:23.880> here<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.180> learned<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.720> flower<00:00:24.930> this

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
let's see here I learned the flower this

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
let's see here I learned the flower this
one<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.529> pretty<00:00:25.710> tricky<00:00:26.220> off<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.609> backs<00:00:28.250> but

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
one is pretty tricky off the backs but

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.460 
one is pretty tricky off the backs but
it's<00:00:29.580> real<00:00:29.760> tough<00:00:29.939> real<00:00:30.210> forgiving<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:30.929> you

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
it's real tough real forgiving and you

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.260 
it's real tough real forgiving and you
can<00:00:31.590> figure<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.920> out<00:00:32.009> after<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.340> while<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.759> didn't

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
can figure it out after a while I didn't

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.360 
can figure it out after a while I didn't
have<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.450> set<00:00:33.630> much<00:00:33.809> trim<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.469> don't<00:00:35.130> know<00:00:35.219> if

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
have to set much trim I don't know if

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.630 
have to set much trim I don't know if
that's<00:00:35.579> my<00:00:35.700> fault<00:00:36.180> or<00:00:36.450> what<00:00:36.780> but<00:00:37.190> you<00:00:38.190> don't

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
that's my fault or what but you don't

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.220 
that's my fault or what but you don't
really<00:00:38.760> fly<00:00:39.000> straight<00:00:39.420> much<00:00:39.629> anyway<00:00:40.050> it's

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
really fly straight much anyway it's

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.420 
really fly straight much anyway it's
usually<00:00:40.379> just<00:00:40.620> kind<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.190> circles<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.210> whatnot

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
usually just kind of circles and whatnot

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.160 
usually just kind of circles and whatnot
the<00:00:44.430> remote<00:00:44.700> takes<00:00:45.000> six<00:00:45.329> double-a<00:00:45.719> batteries

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the remote takes six double-a batteries

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.930 
the remote takes six double-a batteries
in<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.399> charge<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.760> plane

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
in here and you charge the plane

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.360 
in here and you charge the plane
straight<00:00:48.390> from<00:00:48.660> ends<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.170> micro<00:00:49.680> jst

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
straight from ends in this micro jst

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.479 
straight from ends in this micro jst
plug<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.760> believe<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.149> called<00:00:52.280> it's<00:00:53.280> got<00:00:53.460> a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
plug I believe it's called it's got a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.889 
plug I believe it's called it's got a
one<00:00:53.730> cell<00:00:53.940> lipo<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.510> here

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
one cell lipo in here

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.600 
one cell lipo in here
I'll<00:00:55.020> get<00:00:55.260> more<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> little<00:00:55.949> later<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
I'll get more on that a little later and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.750 
I'll get more on that a little later and
the<00:00:57.000> remote<00:00:57.239> does<00:00:57.480> have<00:00:57.660> spring<00:00:58.020> return<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.530> it

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
the remote does have spring return on it

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.290 
the remote does have spring return on it
that's<00:00:59.760> nice

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
that's nice

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.119 
that's nice
school<00:01:01.109> thing<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.590> don't<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.980> worry

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
school thing is you don't have to worry

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.770 
school thing is you don't have to worry
about<00:01:02.250> frequencies<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.480> plane

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
about frequencies on this the plane

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.719 
about frequencies on this the plane
automatically<00:01:04.680> binds<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.250> frequency

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
automatically binds to the frequency

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.240 
automatically binds to the frequency
you're<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.240> B<00:01:06.390> or<00:01:06.540> C<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:07.380> if<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.560> go<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.860> I

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
you're on a B or C so if I go to a I

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.429 
you're on a B or C so if I go to a I
turn<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.909> remote<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.930> turn<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
turn on the remote and I turn on the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.870 
turn on the remote and I turn on the
plane<00:01:11.780> it's<00:01:12.780> bound<00:01:13.220> so<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.250> turn<00:01:14.549> off<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
plane it's bound so I turn off the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.940 
plane it's bound so I turn off the
remote<00:01:15.180> turn<00:01:15.570> off<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.840> plane<00:01:16.080> change<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.740> to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
remote turn off the plane change it to

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.740 
remote turn off the plane change it to
see<00:01:17.780> turn<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.080> remote<00:01:19.409> turn<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> plane

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
see turn on the remote turn on the plane

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.020 
see turn on the remote turn on the plane
and<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.960> works<00:01:22.170> turn<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.580> without

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
and it works turn it just a without

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.630 
and it works turn it just a without
changing<00:01:24.420> anything<00:01:24.570> nor<00:01:25.409> spot<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.520> that's

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
changing anything nor spot so that's

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.140 
changing anything nor spot so that's
cool<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.909> don't<00:01:27.090> worry<00:01:27.330> about<00:01:27.540> frequencies

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
cool you don't worry about frequencies

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.950 
cool you don't worry about frequencies
it's<00:01:30.150> very<00:01:30.360> tough

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
it's very tough

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.160 
it's very tough
EPO<00:01:31.619> foam<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.189> think<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.729> real<00:01:32.880> flexible<00:01:33.390> it's

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
EPO foam I think it's real flexible it's

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.859 
EPO foam I think it's real flexible it's
got<00:01:34.320> these<00:01:34.409> nice<00:01:34.619> struts<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.490> give<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.420> main

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
got these nice struts to give the main

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.530 
got these nice struts to give the main

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610

in<00:01:59.700> here<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.570> would<00:02:00.719> suppose<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.170> haven't<00:02:01.290> taken

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
in here I would suppose I haven't taken

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.730 
in here I would suppose I haven't taken
it<00:02:01.649> apart<00:02:01.860> yet<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:03.840> did<00:02:04.020> come<00:02:04.229> with<00:02:04.350> landing

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
it apart yet it did come with landing

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.029 
it apart yet it did come with landing
gear<00:02:04.850> my<00:02:05.850> mount<00:02:06.329> has<00:02:06.540> come<00:02:06.780> out<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.799> don't

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
gear my mount has come out and I don't

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.900 
gear my mount has come out and I don't
have<00:02:08.190> any<00:02:08.399> foam<00:02:08.640> safe<00:02:08.940> CA<00:02:09.270> yet<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.550> fly

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
have any foam safe CA yet so I just fly

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.559 
have any foam safe CA yet so I just fly
without<00:02:12.120> any<00:02:12.300> gear<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.900> flies<00:02:13.080> fine

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
without any gear it flies fine

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.289 
without any gear it flies fine
without<00:02:14.019> I<00:02:14.319> have<00:02:15.219> been<00:02:15.400> noticing<00:02:15.549> a<00:02:15.909> loss<00:02:16.120> of

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
without I have been noticing a loss of

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.360 
without I have been noticing a loss of
power<00:02:16.540> like<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.620> lot<00:02:18.010> of<00:02:18.129> the<00:02:18.219> reviews

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
power like a lot of the reviews

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.050 
power like a lot of the reviews
explained<00:02:18.999> I<00:02:19.889> think<00:02:20.889> it's<00:02:21.249> probably<00:02:21.489> because

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
explained I think it's probably because

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.110 
explained I think it's probably because
of<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:23.230> abuse<00:02:23.560> lipo<00:02:24.069> is<00:02:24.129> taking<00:02:24.519> inside<00:02:24.819> there

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
of the abuse lipo is taking inside there

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.300 
of the abuse lipo is taking inside there
I<00:02:25.150> would<00:02:25.420> assume<00:02:25.689> it<00:02:26.409> also<00:02:26.560> could<00:02:26.920> be<00:02:26.950> from<00:02:27.069> the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
I would assume it also could be from the

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.979 
I would assume it also could be from the
brushed<00:02:27.549> motors<00:02:27.969> I<00:02:28.209> don't<00:02:28.389> know<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.659> lifespan

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
brushed motors I don't know the lifespan

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:29.610 
brushed motors I don't know the lifespan
though

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
though

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.129 
though
but<00:02:30.519> I'll<00:02:30.939> be<00:02:31.090> experimenting<00:02:31.719> with<00:02:31.840> it<00:02:31.959> later

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:32.139 
but I'll be experimenting with it later

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:34.949 
but I'll be experimenting with it later
I've<00:02:32.409> got<00:02:32.439> some<00:02:32.859> 50<00:02:33.700> milli<00:02:33.939> amp<00:02:34.120> our<00:02:34.359> one<00:02:34.719> cell

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
I've got some 50 milli amp our one cell

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.990 
I've got some 50 milli amp our one cell
lipo<00:02:35.109> is<00:02:35.319> coming<00:02:35.680> in<00:02:35.799> that<00:02:36.340> I'll<00:02:36.459> be<00:02:36.579> swapping

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
lipo is coming in that I'll be swapping

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.649 
lipo is coming in that I'll be swapping
in<00:02:37.329> see<00:02:37.659> what<00:02:37.840> happens<00:02:38.639> so<00:02:39.639> that's<00:02:40.120> probably

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
in see what happens so that's probably

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.300 
in see what happens so that's probably
enough<00:02:40.930> me<00:02:41.109> blabbering<00:02:41.590> let's<00:02:41.829> get<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.159> some

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
enough me blabbering let's get to some

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.459 
enough me blabbering let's get to some
of<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.489> action<00:02:42.819> shots<00:02:43.120> this<00:02:43.689> whole<00:02:43.989> all<00:02:44.409> the

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:44.469 
of the action shots this whole all the

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.550 
of the action shots this whole all the
videos<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:45.579> this<00:02:45.700> video<00:02:45.969> were<00:02:46.659> filmed<00:02:47.109> on<00:02:47.260> one

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
videos in this video were filmed on one

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.890 
videos in this video were filmed on one
charge<00:02:48.329> there<00:02:49.329> might<00:02:49.480> have<00:02:49.510> been<00:02:49.629> a<00:02:49.750> little

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
charge there might have been a little

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.170 
charge there might have been a little
bit<00:02:50.139> of<00:02:50.260> booster<00:02:50.709> in<00:02:50.980> between<00:02:51.609> there<00:02:51.849> at<00:02:51.939> some

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
bit of booster in between there at some

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.759 
bit of booster in between there at some
point<00:02:52.530> but<00:02:53.530> for<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.370> most<00:02:54.549> part<00:02:54.699> they're<00:02:55.239> all

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
point but for the most part they're all

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.199 
point but for the most part they're all
once<00:02:56.769> all<00:02:57.040> charged<00:02:57.400> just<00:02:57.639> kind<00:02:57.939> of<00:02:58.000> give<00:02:58.120> you

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
once all charged just kind of give you

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.909 
once all charged just kind of give you
an<00:02:58.269> idea<00:02:58.389> you<00:02:58.689> can<00:02:58.719> see<00:02:59.199> that<00:02:59.349> a<00:02:59.379> loss<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.769> power

00:02:59.909 --> 00:02:59.919 
an idea you can see that a loss of power

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:05.550 
an idea you can see that a loss of power
as<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.370> video<00:03:00.639> goes<00:03:00.849> on<00:03:01.199> so<00:03:04.260> enough<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.409> me

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
as the video goes on so enough of me

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:49.059 
as the video goes on so enough of me
let's<00:03:06.040> get<00:03:06.430> on<00:03:06.579> to<00:03:06.609> the<00:03:06.790> fun<00:03:07.000> stuff

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:04:12.880 

how's<00:03:50.069> it<00:03:50.099> going

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:05:49.870 

whoa

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880
