strike the orange ones you have to smash

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.380 
strike the orange ones you have to smash

faster the green ones you have a little

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.049 
faster the green ones you have a little
bit<00:00:48.570> more<00:00:48.780> time<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.170> smash<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:50.309> not<00:00:50.489> smash<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
bit more time to smash do not smash the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.830 
bit more time to smash do not smash the
pockets<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.629> mean<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> polka-dotted<00:00:52.500> ones

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
pockets I mean the polka-dotted ones

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.540 
pockets I mean the polka-dotted ones
like<00:00:54.840> those<00:00:55.110> because<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.890> automatically<00:00:56.370> get

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
like those because you automatically get

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:10.310 
like those because you automatically get
a<00:00:56.610> strike<00:00:58.129> you<00:00:59.129> got<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> double<00:00:59.609> tap<00:00:59.940> those<00:01:09.320> and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
a strike you got a double tap those and

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.679 
a strike you got a double tap those and
trust<00:01:10.590> me<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.830> does<00:01:11.040> get<00:01:11.310> harder<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.510> move

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
trust me it does get harder as you move

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.600 
trust me it does get harder as you move
wrong<00:01:14.930> be<00:01:15.930> split<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.409> two<00:01:16.650> whenever<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.460> hear

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
wrong be split in two whenever you hear
