00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
vitamins or something that our body does

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.600 
vitamins or something that our body does
not<00:00:33.750> produce<00:00:34.010> so<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.130> want<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> make<00:00:35.579> sure

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
not produce so you want to make sure

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.430 
not produce so you want to make sure
that<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:35.969> take<00:00:36.210> those<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> regular<00:00:36.719> basis

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
that you take those on a regular basis

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.319 
that you take those on a regular basis
so<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.980> way<00:00:38.280> it'll<00:00:38.460> help<00:00:38.700> promote<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> hair

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
so that way it'll help promote the hair

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.690 
so that way it'll help promote the hair

growth biotin is great biotin has been

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.670 
growth biotin is great biotin has been
proven<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.600> increase<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.110> growth<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.290> nails

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
proven to increase the growth of nails

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.650 
proven to increase the growth of nails
but<00:00:44.280> they<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.610> not<00:00:44.820> transferred<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.450> over

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
but they have not transferred that over

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.819 
but they have not transferred that over
to<00:00:45.750> hair<00:00:45.930> yet<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.320> they<00:00:46.379> haven't<00:00:46.620> checked

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
to hair yet and they haven't checked

to hair yet and they haven't checked
that<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.489> hair<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.390> would<00:00:48.570> assume<00:00:48.660> if

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
that with hair but I would assume if

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.600 
that with hair but I would assume if
it's<00:00:49.170> making<00:00:49.469> nails<00:00:49.680> grow<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.370> going<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
it's making nails grow it's going to

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.250 
it's making nails grow it's going to
make<00:00:50.760> your<00:00:51.120> hair<00:00:51.480> grow<00:00:51.510> because<00:00:51.960> they're<00:00:52.140> made

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
make your hair grow because they're made

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.729 
make your hair grow because they're made
out<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.620> same<00:00:52.649> basic<00:00:53.399> building<00:00:53.820> blocks

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
out of the same basic building blocks

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.000 
out of the same basic building blocks
also<00:00:55.739> something<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:57.079> nioxin<00:00:58.079> even<00:00:58.920> if

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
also something like nioxin even if

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.459 
also something like nioxin even if
you're<00:00:59.070> not<00:00:59.129> thinning<00:01:00.109> nioxin<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.260> help

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
you're not thinning nioxin can help

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.110 
you're not thinning nioxin can help
because<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.890> actually<00:01:02.039> helps<00:01:02.579> stimulate<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
because it actually helps stimulate the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.660 
because it actually helps stimulate the
follicle<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.750> feeds<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.260> if<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.530> will<00:01:04.739> causing

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
follicle it feeds it if you will causing

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.120 
follicle it feeds it if you will causing
hair<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.939> grow<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.090> little<00:01:06.360> bit<00:01:06.450> faster

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
hair to grow a little bit faster

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.490 
hair to grow a little bit faster
possibly<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:09.060> lot<00:01:09.330> healthier<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:10.200> also

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
possibly and a lot healthier you also

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.500 
possibly and a lot healthier you also
