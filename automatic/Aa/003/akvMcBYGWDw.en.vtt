are we getting close yeah we're gonna
add<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.370> milk<00:03:03.580> now

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.500 

then<00:03:13.800> you<00:03:13.890> say<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.220> that's<00:03:14.400> fairly<00:03:15.150> fatty

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.230 
then you say that that's fairly fatty
yeah<00:03:16.110> okay<00:03:16.710> that<00:03:17.460> is<00:03:17.640> one<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:17.970> reasons

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
yeah okay that is one of the reasons

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.660 
yeah okay that is one of the reasons
that<00:03:18.330> you<00:03:18.510> use<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.780> goat's<00:03:18.990> milk<00:03:19.110> is<00:03:19.350> just<00:03:19.670> has

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
that you use the goat's milk is just has

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.150 
that you use the goat's milk is just has
a<00:03:20.700> higher<00:03:21.510> fat<00:03:21.840> content<00:03:22.080> so<00:03:22.740> that's<00:03:23.010> just

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
a higher fat content so that's just

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.860 
a higher fat content so that's just
equals<00:03:23.640> more<00:03:23.910> moisturizing

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870

him dry out we'll give away samples give
people<00:05:19.680> with<00:05:19.800> this<00:05:20.099> is<00:05:20.490> yeah<00:05:20.909> so<00:05:21.810> anyway<00:05:22.289> this

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
people with this is yeah so anyway this

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.980 
people with this is yeah so anyway this

in there's two cuts so next step you cut
it<00:05:27.479> sideways<00:05:28.110> then<00:05:28.710> boom<00:05:28.949> you've<00:05:29.189> got<00:05:29.219> bars

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
it sideways then boom you've got bars

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.629 
it sideways then boom you've got bars
yep<00:05:30.449> we<00:05:31.080> just<00:05:31.110> carefully<00:05:31.590> place<00:05:32.219> them<00:05:32.460> on<00:05:32.610> here

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
yep we just carefully place them on here

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.420 
yep we just carefully place them on here
um<00:05:33.120> a<00:05:33.840> little<00:05:34.169> bit<00:05:34.379> apart<00:05:34.650> so<00:05:34.919> they<00:05:35.039> get<00:05:35.159> plenty

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
um a little bit apart so they get plenty

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.730 
um a little bit apart so they get plenty
of<00:05:35.550> air<00:05:35.759> in<00:05:36.210> between<00:05:36.360> them<00:05:36.810> and<00:05:36.990> that<00:05:37.530> goes

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
of air in between them and that goes

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.589 
of air in between them and that goes
into<00:05:37.949> our<00:05:38.099> drug<00:05:38.370> to<00:05:38.639> the<00:05:38.789> drying<00:05:39.060> regionals

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
into our drug to the drying regionals

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.260 
into our drug to the drying regionals
it's<00:05:40.199> 30<00:05:40.530> to<00:05:40.650> 45<00:05:41.219> days<00:05:41.250> we'd<00:05:41.729> like<00:05:41.939> to<00:05:42.120> leave

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
it's 30 to 45 days we'd like to leave

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.820 
it's 30 to 45 days we'd like to leave
them<00:05:42.479> you<00:05:42.719> can<00:05:43.080> definitely<00:05:43.259> leave<00:05:43.650> it<00:05:43.740> in

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
them you can definitely leave it in

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.010 
them you can definitely leave it in
there<00:05:43.949> longer<00:05:44.219> there's<00:05:44.639> no<00:05:44.909> expiration<00:05:45.719> on

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
there longer there's no expiration on

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.080 
there longer there's no expiration on
soap<00:05:46.349> so<00:05:46.710> the<00:05:46.889> longest<00:05:47.159> party<00:05:47.400> process<00:05:47.610> is<00:05:47.969> the

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
soap so the longest party process is the

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.029 
soap so the longest party process is the
drying<00:05:48.330> process<00:05:48.389> then<00:05:49.379> once<00:05:49.590> it's<00:05:49.800> done<00:05:49.860> and

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
drying process then once it's done and

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.559 
drying process then once it's done and
out<00:05:50.340> and<00:05:50.460> ready<00:05:50.610> it<00:05:50.819> goes<00:05:51.000> over<00:05:51.210> to<00:05:51.449> the

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569 
out and ready it goes over to the

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.409 
out and ready it goes over to the
