00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
a feeling that for spring and like

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.459 
a feeling that for spring and like
summer<00:00:09.059> coral<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.599> really<00:00:09.960> going<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.110> be<00:00:10.260> in

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
summer coral is really going to be in

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.160 
summer coral is really going to be in
but<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.759> only<00:00:11.880> corals<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.450> have<00:00:12.630> really<00:00:12.870> seen

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
but the only corals I have really seen

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.340 
but the only corals I have really seen
are<00:00:13.620> like<00:00:14.240> kind<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.330> expensive<00:00:15.809> because<00:00:16.080> like

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
are like kind of expensive because like

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.609

I think that brands like china glaze and
SC<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.039> OPI<00:00:20.460> are<00:00:20.670> like<00:00:20.850> kind<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.480> expensive<00:00:22.020> if
