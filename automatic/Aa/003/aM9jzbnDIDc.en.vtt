00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:12.599
 Hello everyone and today we will not 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:17.450
 bintang we will make a mechanism and so in this 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.450
 significant moment ia solemnly 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:31.109
 I declare a section of lego mechanisms open 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:32.360
 today we will make a mechanism and not 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.950
 tank 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:42.390
 but this mechanism is well ender tank is it 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:46.530
 us stabilizer guns to shoot at 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.350
 the move is not really needed 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.140
 but maybe you will come in handy before 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.969
 did not know how ludens 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.480
 there is no instruction anywhere like you 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:02.930
 do in general Andrei hydraulic 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:10.530
 I must have taken it so you don't have me 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:12.510
 the dressmakers are quiet and left like this for 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.590
 what does this stabilizer need 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:23.340
 I need to take shooting on the move here 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:27.960
 for example you are not traveling of course you are 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.909
 straining tank rides but a gun and there are all sorts 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.040
 knolls 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.619
 she rides the gun in my place 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:41.100
 rises, that is, if she were 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:44.950
 fixed to us like that 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.620
 stork from the dak gun sheet then she was 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:53.470
 would be at one point and to shoot on the go 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:56.530
 Well, here's how to make Michael I 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:01.990
 tried to make as compact as possible 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:04.270
 I kind of got it like this 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.880
 everything looks like a gun you can 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:13.710
 Handling There is no longer the cannon 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:15.570
 you will increase the weight like this all terem 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.970
 demonstrate the mechanism 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:23.080
 did for this type of training 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.630
 the tower tower at least should 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:34.120
 be this size that's this minus 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:38.260
 big 1 this is 2 sat down for the day so 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:45.030
 I hope you put like that I try 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.030
 I am making a video now before you wait for 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:56.550
 Now I attach normally they 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:03:03.630
 represent treacherous coval on the tower 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.630
 so now we attach the tower 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:20.480
 But what exactly does a tank ride mean? 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.990
 Well, for example, this is a small mound , no 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.860
 see how the fly he is looking there now 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:32.320
 on almost there did not go very well 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:35.330
 working here is looking at one point 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.080
 moving down on another tank the gun would have lowered 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.820
 deadlines for 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:43.760
 and here the gun looks at 1 meter that is 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.700
 shoot on the go is comfortable you have it 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.610
 will modern tank do there you 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:55.670
 can use gun stabilizer 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:04:03.440
 and maybe he will come in handy here 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:13.610
 actually these guns at one point 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:16.700
 watching flu tanks see gun 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:22.130
 rises when he shines a cannon there 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:28.100
 watching what we're doing here is not a gun 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:33.110
 moves in general, well, you can of course m 2 mid 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:39.040
 but it is uncomfortable inside the driver that is 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:44.390
 not a gunner uncomfortable shorter like this 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:49.580
 the mechanism looks again show how he 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:53.180
 it looks them they and it is more on me already 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:58.490
 I do not need your most detailed 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:00.880
 there tried to leave the corners to make 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.760
 to make it look like a tower 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:08.919
 she's not very much cooler like this 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:13.310
 looks like a stabilizer here you rate 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:16.250
 the mechanism maybe there will be more videos from you 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.590
 liked of course if you liked 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.650
 tell me that it is better I did not sell where 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.449
 better to do there 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:30.500
 and if after all you liked it and you 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:35.009
 put a like and then i made the mechanism to 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:38.310
 you know on the ships back there 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:41.630
 knuckle thing as I call it shorter 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:46.080
 did once the ship there was a helm and 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:49.830
 gum is attached and there to twist 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:53.370
 back here is this thing 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:57.690
 turned this thing you need to 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:01.320
 turn the ship and shorter enough 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:06.630
 a useful tool, and made it possible 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:10.919
 there is not so difficult on this on 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:14.690
 all subscribe vote put 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.690
 likes everyone bye
