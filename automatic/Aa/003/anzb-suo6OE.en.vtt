so<00:00:17.789> one<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.060> things<00:00:18.210> we<00:00:18.330> took<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.480> look<00:00:18.720> at

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
so one of the things we took a look at

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.330 
so one of the things we took a look at
with<00:00:18.990> Knab<00:00:19.170> net<00:00:19.380> easy<00:00:19.619> touch<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.980> how<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.160> make

with Knab net easy touch is how to make

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.340 
with Knab net easy touch is how to make
that<00:00:20.520> process<00:00:20.939> simple<00:00:21.300> let's<00:00:21.960> take<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> look

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
that process simple let's take a look

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.800 
that process simple let's take a look
and<00:00:22.470> see<00:00:22.619> how<00:00:22.740> we<00:00:22.800> achieve<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.720> there's<00:00:24.720> a

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
and see how we achieve this there's a

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
and see how we achieve this there's a
couple<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.080> different<00:00:25.350> ways<00:00:25.410> for<00:00:25.650> us<00:00:25.710> to

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
couple of different ways for us to

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.250 
couple of different ways for us to
create<00:00:26.010> routes<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:27.210> first<00:00:27.449> way<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.869> find

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
create routes the first way is to find

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.839 
create routes the first way is to find
the<00:00:28.349> spot<00:00:28.529> where<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:28.769> want<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:28.980> start<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.400> tap

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
the spot where we want to start and tap

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.240 
the spot where we want to start and tap
on<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.090> screen<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.830> select<00:00:31.830> new<00:00:32.040> route

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
from that point that I selected one

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.760 
from that point that I selected one
thing<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.780> note<00:02:12.930> here<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.349> that<00:02:13.379> the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
thing to note here is that the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.340 
thing to note here is that the
points<00:02:14.310> are<00:02:14.700> temporary<00:02:15.210> points<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:16.080> if<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.290> do

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
points are temporary points so if I do

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.500 
points are temporary points so if I do
delete<00:02:16.740> this<00:02:16.890> route<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.430> will<00:02:17.940> delete<00:02:18.330> the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
delete this route it will delete the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.720 
delete this route it will delete the
points<00:02:18.900> along<00:02:19.200> with<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.650> another<00:02:20.490> way<00:02:20.670> to

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
points along with it another way to

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.010 
points along with it another way to
create<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> route<00:02:21.210> is<00:02:21.480> using<00:02:21.810> existing

waypoints<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:23.220> start<00:02:23.460> a<00:02:23.520> route<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.700> simply<00:02:24.150> tap

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
waypoints to start a route I simply tap

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.080 
waypoints to start a route I simply tap
on<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.600> Waypoint<00:02:25.020> I<00:02:25.110> want<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.320> start<00:02:25.500> at<00:02:25.740> and

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
process I tap on the next Waypoint that

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.230 
process I tap on the next Waypoint that
I<00:02:31.380> want<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.620> go<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:32.550> automatically

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
I want to go to it automatically

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.860 
I want to go to it automatically
advances<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.870> route<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.980> I'm<00:02:35.370> able<00:02:35.520> to

route we can move delete edit and do the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.060 
route we can move delete edit and do the
same<00:02:42.840> things<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:43.080> we<00:02:43.200> did<00:02:43.350> earlier<00:02:43.830> with

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
same things that we did earlier with

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.800 
same things that we did earlier with
this<00:02:44.280> route<00:02:44.520> but<00:02:45.060> one<00:02:45.240> thing<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.660> you'll

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
this route but one thing that you'll

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.690 
this route but one thing that you'll
notice<00:02:45.990> is<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.410> if<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.800> do<00:02:46.860> delete<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:47.460> route

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
notice is that if I do delete this route

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.150 
notice is that if I do delete this route
the<00:02:48.570> waypoints<00:02:49.080> stay<00:02:49.260> here<00:02:49.500> because<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.860> have

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
the waypoints stay here because I have

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.920 
the waypoints stay here because I have
had<00:02:50.730> those<00:02:50.850> waypoints<00:02:51.270> on<00:02:51.390> here<00:02:51.570> prior<00:02:51.900> to

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
had those waypoints on here prior to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.350 
had those waypoints on here prior to
creating<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.500> route<00:02:52.730> if<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.850> want<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.090> insert<00:02:54.300> a

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
creating the route if I want to insert a

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.970 
creating the route if I want to insert a
new<00:02:54.600> point<00:02:54.870> into<00:02:55.080> this<00:02:55.230> route<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.620> can<00:02:55.800> do<00:02:55.950> a

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
new point into this route I can do a

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.980 
new point into this route I can do a
temporary<00:02:56.400> point<00:02:56.850> by<00:02:57.090> tapping<00:02:57.330> on<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.810> route

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
temporary point by tapping on the route

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.950 
temporary point by tapping on the route
I<00:02:58.260> can<00:02:58.710> say<00:02:58.920> insert<00:02:59.400> move<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.480> point<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.870> where

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
I can say insert move the point to where

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.140 
I can say insert move the point to where
I<00:03:01.020> want<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.440> go<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.830> select<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:02.970> move

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
I want it to go and select and move

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.000 
I want it to go and select and move
there's<00:03:03.780> now<00:03:03.960> a<00:03:03.990> new<00:03:04.230> point<00:03:04.500> there<00:03:04.680> again

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
there's now a new point there again

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.530 
there's now a new point there again
that's<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.250> temporary<00:03:05.520> point<00:03:05.910> so<00:03:06.120> if<00:03:06.240> I<00:03:06.300> delete

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
that's a temporary point so if I delete

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.090 
that's a temporary point so if I delete
the<00:03:06.690> route<00:03:06.840> then<00:03:07.140> that<00:03:07.350> temporary<00:03:07.740> point<00:03:07.980> will

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
the route then that temporary point will

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.640 
the route then that temporary point will
disappear<00:03:08.580> if<00:03:09.150> ever<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.480> want<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.870> add<00:03:10.170> on<00:03:10.470> to

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
disappear if ever I want to add on to

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.070 
disappear if ever I want to add on to
the<00:03:10.770> route<00:03:10.920> all<00:03:11.550> I<00:03:11.640> have<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.880> do<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.300> tap<00:03:12.750> on<00:03:12.960> the

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
the route all I have to do is tap on the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.220 
the route all I have to do is tap on the
leg<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.550> select<00:03:14.550> extend<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.360> now<00:03:16.080> it'll

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
leg and select extend and now it'll

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.140
