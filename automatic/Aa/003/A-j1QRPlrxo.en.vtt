 calculate that it is now said this we are going to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.140
 watch 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.660
 we live the regulation of the world a 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.990
 costa rica team worthy of a very 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.680
 good match making a great match 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.690
 a level monster football 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.610
 of worlds let's say with many 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.610
 better experiences than how many leagues 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:16.299
 experienced players and with 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.180
 trajectory and the team of costa rica and 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.630
 his great role a little supported follow the 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.630
 goalkeeper 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.220
 we are key ball 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.350
 and then the cube comes to the ejido 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.700
 Colombian the style of account also 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.700
 as the year 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:50.620
 luis acosta gonzález or what was a 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:54.520
 party somehow this even and a 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:57.100
 very inaccurate equipment the big video e 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.590
 important that here I believe that no less 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:04.380
 of 16 or 17 times in offside that 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.380
 practically he had it as sons 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.290
 replaced today the technician told us not to 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.770
 replaced I imagine he managed to 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.770
 the finals 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.870
 do not 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.870
 about late 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.460
 others and running and enjoying 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.800
 the comrades because we are going to beat the 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.830
 world of the cogote let's say that when 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:41.650
 finished the first part of the time 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:44.720
 minutes robben because he was quiet a 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.590
 little more in the lengthening had its 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:59.300
 possibility is a great save from the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:03:01.760
 line of a costa rica and after 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.680
 then where the criminals 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.690
 unusually the first time you see 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:12.990
 the story changes the archer 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:19.740
 Vargas puts governments really 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:22.520
 us when the question happened to 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.520
 solve with Argentina 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.810
 that of the asset 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:38.189
 practically all of us that we want to be 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:40.579
 honest with ourselves for the 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.579
 side where 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.600
 it's immense and evidently through 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:04:02.140
 criminal because it's rare that the five 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:04:04.470
 three criminal penalties but very little if 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:14.850
 to know where the ball takes us 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:17.280
 then why do not you say so 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.870
 that's how the game was not much more for 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.600
 say holland is going to have 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:27.270
 Argentina a Dutchman who does not eat 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:33.200
 nobody is a team quite enough the 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.200
 Argentines and Argentines 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.850
 we'll see what will help us messi 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.640

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.620
 but in some of the city and we go the 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.880
 time in the place of di maria and how it goes 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.120
 forming the braids 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.289
 Basically Robert also gives him kisses 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.930
