00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.070 
window air conditioner was a 220 air
conditioner<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:29.090> created<00:04:30.090> too<00:04:30.240> many<00:04:30.419> hassles

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
conditioner and created too many hassles

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.409 
conditioner and created too many hassles
I<00:04:31.350> got<00:04:32.010> to<00:04:32.130> get<00:04:32.220> another<00:04:32.370> air<00:04:32.760> conditioner

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
I got to get another air conditioner

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.980 
I got to get another air conditioner
that's<00:04:33.630> only<00:04:34.050> 110<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.180> can<00:04:36.360> make<00:04:36.570> this<00:04:36.750> all

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
that's only 110 and I can make this all

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.060 
that's only 110 and I can make this all
look<00:04:37.290> a<00:04:37.410> lot<00:04:37.590> nicer<00:04:38.660> put<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.780> pump<00:04:40.080> inside<00:04:40.350> the

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
look a lot nicer put the pump inside the

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.990 
look a lot nicer put the pump inside the
unit<00:04:41.550> and<00:04:41.760> just<00:04:41.850> have<00:04:42.300> two<00:04:43.040> hoses<00:04:44.040> coming<00:04:44.610> to

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
unit and just have two hoses coming to

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.280 
unit and just have two hoses coming to
it<00:04:45.150> it'll<00:04:46.050> be<00:04:46.200> a<00:04:46.229> clean<00:04:47.510> nice<00:04:48.510> looking<00:04:48.960> unit

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
it it'll be a clean nice looking unit

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.570 
it it'll be a clean nice looking unit
that<00:04:49.530> way<00:04:51.260> there's<00:04:52.260> a<00:04:52.320> digital<00:04:52.580> thermometer

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
that way there's a digital thermometer

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.510 
that way there's a digital thermometer
the<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:55.680> white

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
the the white

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.310 
the the white
electrical<00:04:58.520> cord<00:04:59.920> coming<00:05:00.920> up<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:02.690> the<00:05:02.840> digital

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
electrical cord coming up to the digital

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.600 
electrical cord coming up to the digital
readout

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.300 

then<00:05:08.360> it's<00:05:08.599> blown<00:05:08.960> a<00:05:08.990> hundred<00:05:09.650> and<00:05:09.830> fourteen

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
then it's blown a hundred and fourteen

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.839 
then it's blown a hundred and fourteen
118<00:05:14.169> somewhere<00:05:15.169> around<00:05:15.379> there<00:05:15.849> temperature

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
118 somewhere around there temperature

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.760 
118 somewhere around there temperature
air

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.390 

and<00:05:21.280> it's<00:05:21.430> been<00:05:21.669> burning<00:05:22.060> for<00:05:23.069> about<00:05:24.069> one<00:05:24.460> hour

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
and it's been burning for about one hour

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.210 
and it's been burning for about one hour
now<00:05:27.400> I<00:05:27.460> could<00:05:28.289> adjust<00:05:29.289> the<00:05:29.440> fire<00:05:29.770> on<00:05:30.069> the

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
now I could adjust the fire on the

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.900 
now I could adjust the fire on the
burner<00:05:30.460> the<00:05:31.590> speed<00:05:32.590> of<00:05:32.800> the<00:05:32.919> circulation<00:05:33.789> of

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
burner the speed of the circulation of

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.430 
burner the speed of the circulation of
the<00:05:33.970> water<00:05:35.190> and<00:05:36.190> probably<00:05:36.460> do<00:05:36.970> plenty<00:05:37.900> warmer

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
the water and probably do plenty warmer

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.890 
the water and probably do plenty warmer
than<00:05:38.620> this<00:05:38.800> too<00:05:39.160> but<00:05:39.389> I'll<00:05:40.389> tell<00:05:40.569> you<00:05:40.720> what

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
than this too but I'll tell you what

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.070 
than this too but I'll tell you what
this<00:05:41.080> is<00:05:41.139> not<00:05:41.500> the<00:05:41.770> temperature<00:05:42.370> of<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.759> water

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
this is not the temperature of the water

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.779 
this is not the temperature of the water
it's<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:44.169> temperature<00:05:44.530> of<00:05:44.889> the<00:05:45.009> air<00:05:45.250> blowing

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
it's the temperature of the air blowing

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:52.770 
it's the temperature of the air blowing
right<00:05:46.539> outside<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:49.500> radiator<00:05:51.539> so<00:05:52.539> when

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
right outside the radiator so when

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
right outside the radiator so when
you're<00:05:52.930> blowing<00:05:53.460> 115<00:05:54.460> degree<00:05:54.789> air<00:05:55.800> that's

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
you're blowing 115 degree air that's

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.170 
you're blowing 115 degree air that's
pretty<00:05:57.130> good<00:05:57.250> it's<00:05:57.430> warm<00:05:57.669> in<00:05:57.819> the<00:05:57.909> garage

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
pretty good it's warm in the garage

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.750 
pretty good it's warm in the garage
right<00:05:58.569> up
