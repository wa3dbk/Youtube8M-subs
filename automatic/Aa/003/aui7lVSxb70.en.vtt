00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.170
 Hello friends, I'm MartÃ­n, director of proyectodearquitectura.com and here we are 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.109
 again to share design solutions, and today we are going to see kitchens. 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:17.769
 How should a kitchen be arranged? How should the furniture be arranged? 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:18.490
 And, what measures 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.999
 have to have to make it a comfortable space 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:25.539
 a kitchen? What are the minimum measures? Remember that we 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:26.789
 we do not do housing 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.859
 sumptuous, we make practical homes, 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.559
 With the minimum measures, from here you can gradually increase the measures. 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.910
 If you want 10 centimeters, 20 centimeters more, that handles it to your liking. 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.900
 The information we give you is of minimum measures ... Let's see it, 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.730
 come with me to the computer ... 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.250
 Here we have the first example 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.200
 of a kitchen in the shape of "U". 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.310
 Here you can see clearly. 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.970
 It is entered from the garage 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.890
 and if it goes to the other side towards the dining room. 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.410
 It circulates through this sector, and the kitchen sector is left clean. 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.960
 They are not disturbed 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.700
 the activities of the kitchen by circulation. 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.810
 A properly armed kitchen would follow the following sequence: 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.930
 from the refrigerator, 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.650
 or the fridge, 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.370
 take out the food prepares them 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.300
 the lava, 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.110
 he prepares them to cook the kitchen and serves it. 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.500
 Come out here and serve it at the table. 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.850
 Okay, there's the logical sequence of a 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.320
 kitchen. 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.150
 There are kitchens where you can incorporate the washing machine or washing machine, 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.460
 in this case it is not incorporated, 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.390
 but we have it on this side the washing machine inside garage. 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.590
 See how 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.740
 We always put emphasis on taking advantage of all the square meters, look where 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.350
 the washing machine is located 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.580
 that is taking advantage of the meters 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.880
 squares 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.640
 that throws away the ladder. 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.040
 The high-rise staircase always loses square meters below it. 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.629
 In this case, everything is taken advantage of. 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.759
 Okay, we continue with the second example. 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.239
 This kitchen follows the same 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.429
 structure in "U". 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:25.239
 Here you can see perfectly, the same structure in "U". 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.159
 It circulates on the side and you see that the circulation does not disturb any 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.059
 moment the activity of the kitchen 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:35.179
 and here 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:37.849
 back to the same in the refrigerator 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.189
 always for the food is washed, 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:44.249
 It is prepared for cooking, it is cooked and served. 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:46.779
 Here we could put perfectly 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:48.949
 a table 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:52.449
 Here I wanted to comment on a little secret, 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:57.029
 that so that this person does not stoop when washing 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:02.389
 the dishes, you need to do 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.809
 this, which is a zocalo 10 centimeters at least 10 centimeters towards 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:09.639
 inside so that this person can put the foot 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.929
 inside and not have to stoop when washing dishes. 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.699
 Another secret is that the window, 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:20.179
 the window should be at eye level, 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:22.549
 at the height of the eyes. 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.290
 No more went down ... That is, the middle of the window should be at the height of 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.359
 the eyes of the person who is going to wash. 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.469
 Very well. 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.819
 Let's go now to see the minimum measures 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.319
 with which you can organize a kitchen. 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.799
 The minimum measures, you know that the width of the counter 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.689
 They are 60 centimeters. 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:48.219
 A measure 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:52.359
 good good, could be two meters 20. 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.619
 The space for 

00:03:54.619 --> 00:04:00.099
 refrigerator should be, or refrigerator, 65 centimeters 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.519
 depending on the refrigerator you buy. 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.499
 This space could be 60 centimeters, like the kitchen 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:10.869
 60 centimeters 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:12.330
 And here the chest of drawers 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.699
 Should carry 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.499
 40 centimeters at least, 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:20.569
 at least 40 centimeters. 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:24.569
 All right, these are the minimum steps with which you can organize a 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:28.569
 kitchen. They can be made of course bigger but these spaces are the 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:31.199
 necessary for 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.490
 be able to organize it correctly. 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.189
 Of course there are many ways to organize kitchens. 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:44.330
 We saw two kitchens in "U" but you can put the kitchen in "L", 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.169
 the kitchen in strip ... That is to say, there are many ways of being able to organize a kitchen well and 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.289
 you already have enough information to see if the kitchen complies with the 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:54.669
 sequence that we have seen, 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.479
 complies with the measures we have seen. 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.259
 I only have to tell you that 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:01.759
 we have ten ideas available 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:06.349
 of kitchens already solved, of course with the whole house, all the design of 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.339
 the whole house 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:11.799
 of technical designs already well resolved. This means that you are going to 

00:05:11.799 --> 00:05:13.059
 provide 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:15.870
 of technical design, circulations, 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.089
 ventilations, etcetera. All technical package resolved 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:23.069
 and you focus only on the aesthetic changes. 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:29.339
 Colors, coatings, choose the countertop, the furniture of the kitchen, etcetera. 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:35.049
 So, I have nothing left to say hello and if you are interested in knowing 

00:05:35.049 --> 00:05:40.099
 how to get the ten ideas, follow the link below or you can simply 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.049
 contact in the form that is here below as soon as possible I will contact you.
