 creates the optical illusion

 michael's flight time this time of zero, 92 seconds he could 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.970
 seem a long time not too long 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.940
 but it is very close to the maximum time in which any human being 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.120
 could stand in the air indeed no one can jump in the air to fall into 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.760
