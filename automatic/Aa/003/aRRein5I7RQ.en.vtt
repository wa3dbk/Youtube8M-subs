00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
basic box to be the top and then i use

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.830 
basic box to be the top and then i use
the<00:00:51.539> PVC<00:00:52.050> connectors<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.739> build<00:00:52.949> these<00:00:53.160> legs

the PVC comes with all the all the
connectors<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.280> need<00:01:12.229> t-connectors<00:01:13.760> corner

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
connectors you need t-connectors corner

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.649 
connectors you need t-connectors corner
connectors<00:01:15.680> even<00:01:16.680> little<00:01:16.860> feet<00:01:17.340> if<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.479> need

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
connectors even little feet if you need

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.920 
connectors even little feet if you need
to<00:01:18.869> give<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.009> use<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.880> pretty<00:01:21.479> much<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:21.869> a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
to give it I use this pretty much as a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.320 
to give it I use this pretty much as a
spacer<00:01:22.530> because<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.070> needed<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.400> little<00:01:23.549> extra<00:01:23.820> I

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
spacer because I needed a little extra I

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.170 
spacer because I needed a little extra I
cut<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> pbc<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> little<00:01:25.650> too<00:01:25.740> short<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.909> also

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
cut the pbc a little too short so I also

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.069 
cut the pbc a little too short so I also
put<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.810> shelf<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:29.490> corner<00:01:29.939> with<00:01:30.900> some

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
put up a shelf in the corner with some

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.620 
put up a shelf in the corner with some
scrap<00:01:31.380> wood<00:01:31.549> so<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.700> critters<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.210> sit<00:01:33.600> up

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
scrap wood so the critters can sit up

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.030 
scrap wood so the critters can sit up
there<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.140> look<00:01:35.100> out<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:37.040> coincidentally

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
there and look out and coincidentally

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
there and look out and coincidentally
I've<00:01:38.159> got<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.490> book<00:01:38.880> out<00:01:39.619> here<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.790> kind

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
I've got this book out here that is kind

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.319 
I've got this book out here that is kind
of<00:01:42.150> helping<00:01:42.540> mask<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.229> now<00:01:44.100> one<00:01:44.369> key<00:01:44.640> component

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
of helping mask it now one key component

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.980 
of helping mask it now one key component
here<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.140> umbrella<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:48.090> does<00:01:48.390> help<00:01:48.600> cover

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
here is the umbrella it does help cover

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.200 
here is the umbrella it does help cover
up<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.350> coop<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.490> also<00:01:50.640> gave<00:01:50.939> me<00:01:51.000> an

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
up the coop but it also gave me an

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.749 
up the coop but it also gave me an
ability<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.810> support<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.530> coop<00:01:52.829> at<00:01:53.100> its

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
ability to support the coop at its

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.660 
ability to support the coop at its
midpoint<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.990> see<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:56.189> I've<00:01:56.280> used<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
midpoint you see that so I've used a

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.209 
midpoint you see that so I've used a
bungee<00:01:57.030> cord<00:01:57.060> too<00:01:57.420> kind<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.899> loop<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:59.009> in

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
bungee cord too kind of loop it in

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.550 
bungee cord too kind of loop it in
through<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:01.320> coop<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.310> umbrella<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:04.200> and

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
through the coop and the umbrella so and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.310 
through the coop and the umbrella so and
then<00:02:04.829> over<00:02:04.950> here<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.460> wall<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:06.140> have<00:02:07.140> it

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
then over here on the wall I have it

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.450 
then over here on the wall I have it
hooked<00:02:07.670> quite<00:02:08.670> ghetto<00:02:08.970> style

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
hooked quite ghetto style

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.620 
hooked quite ghetto style
with<00:02:11.120> some<00:02:11.390> hooks<00:02:12.010> because<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.430> don't<00:02:13.700> drill

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
with some hooks because I don't drill

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.790 
with some hooks because I don't drill
very<00:02:14.900> well<00:02:15.140> into<00:02:15.440> stucco<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:17.020> so<00:02:18.020> because<00:02:18.620> the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
very well into stucco and so because the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.560 
very well into stucco and so because the
cats<00:02:19.010> have<00:02:19.250> now<00:02:19.400> taken<00:02:19.460> to<00:02:19.940> sleeping<00:02:20.360> on<00:02:20.510> it

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
cats have now taken to sleeping on it

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.830 
cats have now taken to sleeping on it
outside<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.560> coop<00:02:21.770> I<00:02:22.130> put<00:02:23.030> an<00:02:23.150> extra<00:02:23.450> board

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
outside the coop I put an extra board

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.700 
outside the coop I put an extra board
here<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:25.010> support<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.870> for<00:02:26.870> when<00:02:26.990> they<00:02:27.110> lay<00:02:27.470> on

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
here to support it for when they lay on

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.140 
here to support it for when they lay on
it<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:28.640> it's<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:28.970> big<00:02:29.150> square<00:02:29.570> with<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.650> cross

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
it so it's a big square with the cross

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.960 
it so it's a big square with the cross
beam<00:02:32.150> in<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.720> for<00:02:33.050> support<00:02:33.710> and<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.640> black

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
beam in it for support and the black

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.790 
beam in it for support and the black
mesh<00:02:35.360> I<00:02:35.720> use<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.920> plastic<00:02:37.850> ties<00:02:38.620> which<00:02:39.620> you
