down<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:53.989> guess<00:00:54.829> what<00:00:54.859> see<00:00:55.339> has<00:00:55.519> an<00:00:55.639> orb<00:00:55.909> of

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
down and guess what see has an orb of

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:59.049 
down and guess what see has an orb of
fire<00:00:56.629> and<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:57.049> orb<00:00:57.260> shoots<00:00:57.620> lasers<00:00:58.399> of<00:00:58.699> fire

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
fire and the orb shoots lasers of fire

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.779 
fire and the orb shoots lasers of fire
at<00:00:59.379> monsters<00:01:00.379> and<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.829> range<00:01:01.190> is<00:01:01.309> huge<00:01:01.519> check

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
at monsters and the range is huge check

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:03.549 
at monsters and the range is huge check
it<00:01:01.909> out<00:01:02.030> it<00:01:02.269> hits<00:01:02.449> like<00:01:02.659> a<00:01:02.690> top<00:01:03.019> of<00:01:03.109> the<00:01:03.229> map<00:01:03.379> as

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
it out it hits like a top of the map as

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.530 
it out it hits like a top of the map as
well<00:01:03.589> and<00:01:04.040> this<00:01:04.910> one<00:01:05.090> is<00:01:05.180> pretty<00:01:05.300> interesting
