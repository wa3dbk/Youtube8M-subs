so far pretty comfortable battery life
isn't<00:00:55.410> too<00:00:55.530> bad<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.309> controls<00:00:56.760> could<00:00:57.000> be<00:00:57.149> a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
isn't too bad the controls could be a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.049 
isn't too bad the controls could be a
little<00:00:57.390> bit<00:00:57.570> better<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.930> think<00:00:58.109> but<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.250> am

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
little bit better I think but I am

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.569 
little bit better I think but I am
getting<00:01:00.359> used<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.870> them<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.289> they<00:01:02.039> they<00:01:02.489> were

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
getting used to them and they they were

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.100 
getting used to them and they they were
pretty<00:01:02.820> bad<00:01:02.969> at<00:01:03.120> first<00:01:03.270> now<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.780> I'm<00:01:03.870> used<00:01:04.049> to

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
pretty bad at first now that I'm used to

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.050 
pretty bad at first now that I'm used to
them<00:01:04.260> they're<00:01:04.439> not<00:01:04.619> as<00:01:04.739> bad<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.700> noticed

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
them they're not as bad and I noticed

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.330 
them they're not as bad and I noticed
that<00:01:06.119> my<00:01:06.299> ears<00:01:06.600> hurt<00:01:06.900> if<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.320> wear<00:01:07.619> these<00:01:07.830> for

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
that my ears hurt if I wear these for

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.580 
that my ears hurt if I wear these for
longer<00:01:08.760> than<00:01:08.790> two<00:01:09.060> hours<00:01:09.090> at<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> time<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.380> after

longer than two hours at a time so after

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.289 
longer than two hours at a time so after
about<00:01:10.619> two<00:01:10.979> hours<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.460> had<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.790> take<00:01:11.970> them<00:01:12.150> off

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
about two hours I had to take them off

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.350 
about two hours I had to take them off
and<00:01:13.010> take<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> break<00:01:14.280> for<00:01:14.460> about<00:01:14.670> five<00:01:14.939> or<00:01:15.180> ten

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
and take a break for about five or ten

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.330 
and take a break for about five or ten
minutes<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:16.200> my<00:01:16.350> ears<00:01:16.560> don't<00:01:16.740> hurt<00:01:16.860> because

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
minutes so my ears don't hurt because

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.010 
minutes so my ears don't hurt because
the<00:01:17.909> ear<00:01:18.270> cushions<00:01:18.780> are<00:01:19.820> not<00:01:20.820> completely<00:01:21.570> over

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020

the ear cushions are not completely over
ear<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.070> they're<00:01:23.220> not<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.670> your<00:01:24.030> exactly

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
ear and they're not on your exactly

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.899 
ear and they're not on your exactly
there<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:25.590> between<00:01:25.830> them<00:01:26.250> sighs<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.729> can

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
there in between them sighs and you can

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.340 
there in between them sighs and you can
see<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> first<00:01:27.750> look<00:01:27.900> video<00:01:28.020> which

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
see that in the first look video which

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.740 
see that in the first look video which
will<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.770> an<00:01:28.860> annotation<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.549> hear<00:01:29.880> but<00:01:30.450> they

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
will have an annotation to hear but they

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.530 
will have an annotation to hear but they
do<00:01:30.810> fold<00:01:31.409> nicely<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.180> took<00:01:33.180> them<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.509> school

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
do fold nicely I took them to school

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.780 
do fold nicely I took them to school
they<00:01:33.990> fit<00:01:34.200> nice<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.590> my<00:01:34.619> backpack<00:01:34.920> but

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
they fit nice in my backpack but

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.330 
they fit nice in my backpack but
hopefully<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.390> hear<00:01:36.860> that<00:01:37.860> these<00:01:38.159> are

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
hopefully you can hear that these are

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.770 
hopefully you can hear that these are
really<00:01:38.549> squeaky<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.299> I'm<00:01:39.360> going<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.570> put<00:01:39.689> them

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
really squeaky so I'm going to put them

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.800 
really squeaky so I'm going to put them
up<00:01:39.869> next<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.259> mic<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:44.570> hopefully<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.689> can

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
up next to the mic and hopefully you can

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.270 
up next to the mic and hopefully you can
hear<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.229> right<00:01:46.380> there<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.070> gets

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
hear that right there so that gets

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.249 
hear that right there so that gets
really<00:01:47.759> annoying<00:01:48.060> when<00:01:48.600> I'm<00:01:48.990> wearing

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
really annoying when I'm wearing

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.870 
really annoying when I'm wearing
headphones<00:01:49.619> or<00:01:50.009> when<00:01:50.159> they're<00:01:50.310> adjusting<00:01:50.759> I

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
headphones or when they're adjusting I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.230 
headphones or when they're adjusting I
can<00:01:51.060> hear<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.770> gets<00:01:52.950> obnoxious<00:01:53.280> and

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
can hear that and it gets obnoxious and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.149 
can hear that and it gets obnoxious and
I<00:01:54.299> feel<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:55.110> could<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.740> little<00:01:55.979> bit

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
I feel like it could be a little bit

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.580 
I feel like it could be a little bit
better<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:56.969> they're<00:01:57.390> pretty<00:01:57.750> comfortable<00:01:58.350> if
