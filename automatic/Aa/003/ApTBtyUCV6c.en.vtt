00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.730 
weight threads to learn on and then this
thread<00:01:56.090> this<00:01:56.329> red<00:01:56.539> one<00:01:56.719> this<00:01:57.140> is<00:01:57.289> a<00:01:57.320> really

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
thread this red one this is a really

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.499 
thread this red one this is a really
ultra<00:01:58.130> lightweight<00:01:58.369> thread<00:01:58.969> it's<00:01:59.210> about<00:01:59.450> a

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
ultra lightweight thread it's about a

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.410 
ultra lightweight thread it's about a
100<00:02:00.170> weight<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:01.369> can<00:02:01.670> see<00:02:02.000> I'm<00:02:02.210> going<00:02:02.299> to

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
100 weight so you can see I'm going to

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.889 
100 weight so you can see I'm going to
put<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:02.719> in<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.520> with<00:02:04.520> up<00:02:04.880> without<00:02:05.479> hardly

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
put it in and with up without hardly

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.350 
put it in and with up without hardly
moving<00:02:06.229> pulling<00:02:07.219> the<00:02:07.310> thread<00:02:07.549> at<00:02:07.700> all<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:08.090> just

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
moving pulling the thread at all it just

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.440 
moving pulling the thread at all it just
pulls<00:02:08.899> off<00:02:09.380> so<00:02:10.280> what<00:02:10.490> there's<00:02:10.820> two<00:02:11.000> things<00:02:11.270> you

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
pulls off so what there's two things you

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.480 
pulls off so what there's two things you
can<00:02:11.600> do<00:02:11.810> with<00:02:11.990> this<00:02:12.170> one<00:02:12.680> is<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:12.920> tighten<00:02:13.400> your

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
can do with this one is to tighten your

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.940 
can do with this one is to tighten your
bobbin<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:15.620> other

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
bobbin the other

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.510 
bobbin the other
to<00:02:17.340> use<00:02:17.520> this<00:02:17.730> little<00:02:18.000> pigtail<00:02:18.739> and<00:02:19.739> usually

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
to use this little pigtail and usually

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.190 
to use this little pigtail and usually
with<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.760> hundredweight<00:02:21.269> threads<00:02:21.660> using<00:02:22.080> the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
with the hundredweight threads using the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.750 
with the hundredweight threads using the
pigtail<00:02:22.620> is<00:02:22.769> not<00:02:23.010> enough<00:02:23.310> but<00:02:23.550> if<00:02:23.610> you're

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
pigtail is not enough but if you're

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.119 
pigtail is not enough but if you're
using<00:02:23.970> some<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.569> 70<00:02:25.110> weight<00:02:25.319> threads<00:02:25.830> and

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
using some of the 70 weight threads and

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.610 
using some of the 70 weight threads and
60<00:02:26.580> weight<00:02:26.730> threads<00:02:27.090> that's<00:02:27.330> works<00:02:28.140> well<00:02:28.379> so

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
60 weight threads that's works well so

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.650 
60 weight threads that's works well so
putting<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.489> through<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.730> pigtail<00:02:30.209> helps<00:02:30.540> to

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
putting it through the pigtail helps to

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.220 
putting it through the pigtail helps to
give<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:30.930> just<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:31.230> little<00:02:31.260> extra<00:02:31.860> tension<00:02:32.099> and

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
give it just a little extra tension and

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
give it just a little extra tension and
but<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.319> other<00:02:34.440> thing<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.739> can<00:02:34.860> do<00:02:35.040> is

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
but the other thing you can do is

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.850 
but the other thing you can do is
tighten<00:02:35.489> it<00:02:35.700> up<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.930> can<00:02:37.080> see<00:02:37.260> on<00:02:37.380> my<00:02:37.530> bobbin

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
tighten it up you can see on my bobbin

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.940 
tighten it up you can see on my bobbin
case<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.220> have<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> little<00:02:38.760> bit<00:02:38.880> of<00:02:38.910> red<00:02:39.300> on<00:02:39.950> the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
case I have a little bit of red on the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.100 
case I have a little bit of red on the
screw<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.819> on<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.330> outside<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.900> case

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
screw and on the outside of the case

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.600 
screw and on the outside of the case
it's<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.470> little<00:02:43.650> bit<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.860> nail<00:02:44.040> polish<00:02:44.430> and

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
it's a little bit of nail polish and

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.509 
it's a little bit of nail polish and
that<00:02:44.670> sort<00:02:45.569> of<00:02:45.690> as<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> guide<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.140> help<00:02:46.410> me<00:02:46.799> know

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
that sort of as a guide to help me know

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.910 
that sort of as a guide to help me know
where<00:02:47.849> I<00:02:47.879> started<00:02:48.450> from<00:02:48.590> because<00:02:49.590> once<00:02:49.769> you

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
where I started from because once you

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.400 
where I started from because once you
adjust<00:02:50.099> your<00:02:50.430> bobbin<00:02:50.819> case<00:02:51.140> tension<00:02:52.140> you

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
adjust your bobbin case tension you

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.100 
adjust your bobbin case tension you
can't<00:02:52.769> ever<00:02:53.610> get<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.060> back<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.510> exact<00:02:54.870> spot

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
can't ever get it back to the exact spot

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.400 
can't ever get it back to the exact spot
that's<00:02:55.440> just<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:56.040> nature<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:57.420> metal<00:02:58.230> but

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
that's just the nature of a metal but

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.720 
that's just the nature of a metal but
you<00:02:58.860> don't<00:02:59.010> need<00:02:59.099> to<00:02:59.160> worry<00:02:59.370> about<00:02:59.549> that

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
you don't need to worry about that

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.100 
you don't need to worry about that
because<00:02:59.880> you're<00:03:00.120> going<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.299> know<00:03:00.510> how<00:03:00.750> it

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
because you're going to know how it

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.080 
because you're going to know how it
feels<00:03:01.349> how<00:03:01.769> it's<00:03:01.980> supposed<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.549> feel<00:03:02.730> coming

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
feels how it's supposed to feel coming

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.870 
feels how it's supposed to feel coming
out<00:03:03.239> so<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.290> rule<00:03:04.530> is<00:03:04.799> righty<00:03:05.400> tighty<00:03:05.700> lefty

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
out so the rule is righty tighty lefty

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.080 
out so the rule is righty tighty lefty
loosey<00:03:06.599> so<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.170> want<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.590> tighten<00:03:08.069> this<00:03:08.220> just<00:03:09.000> a

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
loosey so I want to tighten this just a

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.110 
loosey so I want to tighten this just a
little<00:03:09.209> bit<00:03:09.329> so<00:03:09.930> I'm<00:03:10.049> going<00:03:10.079> to<00:03:10.290> turn<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:10.920> about

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
little bit so I'm going to turn it about

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.370 
little bit so I'm going to turn it about
15<00:03:12.120> minutes<00:03:12.540> if<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.810> think<00:03:12.989> about<00:03:13.200> the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
15 minutes if you think about the

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.120 
15 minutes if you think about the
minutes<00:03:13.680> on<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:13.890> clock

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
minutes on the clock

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.729 
minutes on the clock
I<00:03:14.459> turn<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.450> about<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:15.870> quarter<00:03:16.319> of<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.530> turn

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
I turn it about a quarter of the turn

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.850 
I turn it about a quarter of the turn
and<00:03:16.980> that's<00:03:17.579> going<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.120> give<00:03:18.299> me<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.660> nice<00:03:19.140> pull

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
and that's going to give me a nice pull

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.039 
and that's going to give me a nice pull
on<00:03:20.160> there<00:03:20.370> it's<00:03:20.579> just<00:03:21.150> coming<00:03:21.450> out<00:03:21.690> nicely

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
on there it's just coming out nicely

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.160 
on there it's just coming out nicely
with<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.380> little<00:03:22.739> bit<00:03:22.859> of<00:03:22.950> tension<00:03:24.109> now<00:03:25.109> the

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
with a little bit of tension now the

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.710 
with a little bit of tension now the
next<00:03:25.620> thread<00:03:25.889> I<00:03:25.920> want<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.250> show<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.489> is<00:03:26.819> this

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
next thread I want to show you is this

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.750 
next thread I want to show you is this
heavyweight<00:03:28.290> thread<00:03:28.829> this<00:03:29.130> is<00:03:29.340> about<00:03:29.579> an

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
heavyweight thread this is about an

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.849 
heavyweight thread this is about an
eighth<00:03:29.940> weight<00:03:30.389> crochet<00:03:31.049> thread<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.680> it's

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
eighth weight crochet thread and it's

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.220 
eighth weight crochet thread and it's
made<00:03:32.040> out<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.250> rayon<00:03:32.579> it<00:03:32.819> stitches<00:03:33.359> up<00:03:33.630> really

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
made out of rayon it stitches up really

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.559 
made out of rayon it stitches up really
nicely<00:03:34.440> but<00:03:35.250> only<00:03:35.579> works<00:03:35.970> in<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.209> bobbin

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
nicely but only works in the bobbin

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.390 
nicely but only works in the bobbin
cannot<00:03:37.049> use<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.440> in<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.709> copier<00:03:38.700> machine<00:03:40.400> I'm

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
cannot use it in the copier machine I'm

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.830 
cannot use it in the copier machine I'm
going<00:03:41.579> to<00:03:41.670> put<00:03:41.850> it<00:03:41.970> in<00:03:42.090> here<00:03:42.269> now<00:03:42.510> I've<00:03:42.630> already

going to put it in here now I've already

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.420 
going to put it in here now I've already
tightened<00:03:43.350> this<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:43.739> I<00:03:43.769> know<00:03:43.889> I<00:03:44.010> have<00:03:44.100> to

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
that it's I have to really tug on it to

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.030 
that it's I have to really tug on it to
get<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.600> to<00:03:54.780> move<00:03:54.930> it's<00:03:55.290> really<00:03:55.680> kind<00:03:55.950> of

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
get it to move it's really kind of

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.479 
get it to move it's really kind of
draggy<00:03:56.880> so<00:03:57.810> I<00:03:57.840> want<00:03:58.139> to<00:03:58.200> loosen<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.799> and<00:03:59.160> I'll

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
draggy so I want to loosen it and I'll

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.379 
draggy so I want to loosen it and I'll
loosen<00:03:59.880> it<00:04:00.030> about<00:04:00.359> the<00:04:00.840> same<00:04:00.989> 15<00:04:01.500> degrees<00:04:01.859> and

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
loosen it about the same 15 degrees and

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.089 
loosen it about the same 15 degrees and
it's<00:04:03.389> better<00:04:03.660> but<00:04:04.109> I<00:04:04.200> can<00:04:04.410> I'm<00:04:04.620> still<00:04:04.920> having

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
to tug on it a bit and I know I use

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.900 
to tug on it a bit and I know I use
these<00:04:07.410> threads<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:07.859> lot<00:04:08.040> so<00:04:08.250> I<00:04:08.310> know<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.730> actually

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
these threads a lot so I know I actually

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.670 
these threads a lot so I know I actually
have<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.359> go<00:04:09.540> almost<00:04:10.370> 180<00:04:11.370> degrees<00:04:11.880> and<00:04:12.680> they

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
have to go almost 180 degrees and they

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.349 
have to go almost 180 degrees and they
are<00:04:13.769> seeing<00:04:14.069> how<00:04:14.220> its<00:04:14.370> nicely<00:04:14.639> coming<00:04:15.209> off

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
are seeing how its nicely coming off

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.680 
are seeing how its nicely coming off
with<00:04:15.569> just<00:04:15.810> a<00:04:15.930> nice<00:04:16.139> little<00:04:16.410> pull<00:04:16.739> so<00:04:17.669> once<00:04:18.510> you
