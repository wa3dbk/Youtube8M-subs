going<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:26.030> do<00:04:26.210> that<00:04:26.240> today<00:04:26.389> so<00:04:27.199> let<00:04:27.530> me<00:04:27.620> be<00:04:27.740> down

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
going to do that today so let me be down

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:38.219 
going to do that today so let me be down
for<00:04:28.160> a<00:04:28.220> second<00:04:28.460> let<00:04:28.639> me<00:04:28.669> get<00:04:28.880> this<00:04:29.030> turned<00:04:29.660> 1

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:51.129 

i'm<00:04:39.229> back<00:04:39.530> so<00:04:42.010> everything's<00:04:43.010> in<00:04:43.190> there

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:05:33.719 

my<00:04:51.949> things<00:04:52.219> are<00:04:52.370> like<00:04:52.520> to<00:04:52.759> play

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:40.529 

I<00:05:35.789> think<00:05:36.789> it's<00:05:36.969> blended<00:05:37.569> up<00:05:37.689> I<00:05:37.990> hope<00:05:38.379> I<00:05:39.539> think

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
I think it's blended up I hope I think

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.619 
I think it's blended up I hope I think
when<00:05:40.719> I<00:05:40.749> had<00:05:40.900> to<00:05:40.990> remake<00:05:41.379> the<00:05:41.680> video<00:05:42.629> try

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:43.629 
when I had to remake the video try

00:05:43.629 --> 00:06:04.580 
when I had to remake the video try
something<00:05:43.930> put<00:05:44.080> you<00:05:44.139> down<00:05:44.229> one<00:05:44.409> more<00:05:44.529> second

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:10.950 

so<00:06:05.590> that's<00:06:06.490> what<00:06:06.669> it<00:06:07.050> looks<00:06:08.050> like<00:06:09.599> and<00:06:10.599> I<00:06:10.750> don't

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
so that's what it looks like and I don't

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.719 
so that's what it looks like and I don't
know<00:06:11.080> if<00:06:11.229> some<00:06:11.440> of<00:06:11.560> you<00:06:11.680> guys<00:06:11.830> put<00:06:12.190> ice<00:06:12.370> cubes

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
know if some of you guys put ice cubes

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.559 
know if some of you guys put ice cubes
in<00:06:13.330> your<00:06:14.110> herbalife<00:06:14.860> shake<00:06:15.190> but<00:06:15.550> I<00:06:15.759> do<00:06:16.060> I<00:06:16.270> like

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:16.569 
in your herbalife shake but I do I like

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:19.379 
in your herbalife shake but I do I like
it<00:06:16.690> a<00:06:16.750> lot<00:06:16.780> better<00:06:17.020> and<00:06:17.979> it<00:06:18.370> stays<00:06:18.580> colder<00:06:19.090> and

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
it a lot better and it stays colder and

things<00:06:20.169> like<00:06:20.319> that<00:06:20.379> and<00:06:21.000> then<00:06:22.000> you<00:06:22.120> put<00:06:22.330> it<00:06:22.360> in

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
things like that and then you put it in

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:26.969 
things like that and then you put it in
and<00:06:23.050> it<00:06:23.560> makes<00:06:23.770> it<00:06:23.919> actually<00:06:24.610> a<00:06:24.639> lot<00:06:25.530> bigger<00:06:26.530> so
