it's<00:03:19.760> called<00:03:20.090> coccidiosis<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.530> that<00:03:21.980> spots

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
it's called coccidiosis and that spots

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.720 
it's called coccidiosis and that spots
on<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.850> liver<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.450> all<00:03:24.380> our<00:03:24.620> rabbits<00:03:25.130> go<00:03:25.370> with

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
on the liver and all our rabbits go with

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.210 
on the liver and all our rabbits go with
the<00:03:26.060> livers<00:03:26.420> in<00:03:26.630> them<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.650> need<00:03:27.829> to<00:03:28.100> have

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
the livers in them and you need to have

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.550 
the livers in them and you need to have
nice<00:03:28.579> clean<00:03:28.910> livers<00:03:29.329> and<00:03:29.569> that's<00:03:29.780> why<00:03:29.989> you

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
nice clean livers and that's why you

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.410 
nice clean livers and that's why you
know<00:03:30.680> we'll<00:03:30.889> keep<00:03:31.100> them<00:03:31.280> no<00:03:31.549> hay<00:03:31.819> in<00:03:32.060> here

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
know we'll keep them no hay in here

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.210 
know we'll keep them no hay in here
because<00:03:32.630> hay<00:03:32.900> would<00:03:33.109> cause<00:03:33.380> their<00:03:33.650> manure<00:03:34.010> to

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
because hay would cause their manure to

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.789 
because hay would cause their manure to
build<00:03:34.459> off<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:35.139> you<00:03:36.139> know<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.380> rabbit<00:03:36.680> would

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
build off and you know the rabbit would

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:45.699 
build off and you know the rabbit would
be<00:03:36.950> dirty<00:03:37.359> the<00:03:38.359> red<00:03:38.630> on<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.959> back<00:03:39.170> is<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.620> buck

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.770 

she<00:03:46.709> not<00:03:46.950> ready<00:03:47.159> well<00:03:48.060> put<00:03:48.329> this<00:03:48.450> on<00:03:48.659> the

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
she not ready well put this on the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.170 
she not ready well put this on the
computer<00:03:49.349> after<00:03:49.530> she's<00:03:49.889> bred<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.700> we<00:03:50.969> know

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
computer after she's bred and we know

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.599 
computer after she's bred and we know
exactly<00:03:51.510> how<00:03:51.780> many<00:03:51.930> days<00:03:52.349> to<00:03:52.560> put<00:03:52.739> an<00:03:52.859> S<00:03:53.010> box<00:03:53.310> in

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
exactly how many days to put an S box in

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.640 
exactly how many days to put an S box in
or<00:03:53.760> when<00:03:53.969> she's<00:03:54.420> due<00:03:55.549> but<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.999> could<00:03:57.269> tell<00:03:57.650> if

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
or when she's due but you could tell if

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.979 
or when she's due but you could tell if
you<00:03:58.950> watched<00:03:59.249> him<00:03:59.549> and<00:03:59.700> he<00:03:59.849> bred<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.749> male

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
you watched him and he bred the male

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.869 
you watched him and he bred the male
would<00:04:01.230> actually<00:04:01.620> fall<00:04:01.920> off<00:04:02.129> off<00:04:02.609> her

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
would actually fall off off her

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.800 
would actually fall off off her
backwards<00:04:03.180> so<00:04:04.170> you<00:04:04.230> know<00:04:04.560> they<00:04:04.739> they<00:04:05.040> bred<00:04:05.810> in

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
backwards so you know they they bred in

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.990 
backwards so you know they they bred in
this<00:04:07.049> one<00:04:08.150> no<00:04:09.150> hay<00:04:09.989> gonna<00:04:10.170> have<00:04:10.349> to<00:04:10.819> go<00:04:11.819> get<00:04:11.939> a

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
this one no hay gonna have to go get a

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.559 
this one no hay gonna have to go get a
bottle<00:04:12.209> of<00:04:12.450> wine<00:04:12.599> enough<00:04:13.049> like<00:04:13.290> that<00:04:13.500> I<00:04:14.569> think

large this setup here is the best you're
gonna<00:04:24.060> get<00:04:24.419> you<00:04:24.690> wouldn't<00:04:25.080> even<00:04:25.169> find<00:04:25.770> another

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
gonna get you wouldn't even find another

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.610 
gonna get you wouldn't even find another
I<00:04:26.460> set<00:04:27.360> up<00:04:27.389> probably<00:04:27.780> like<00:04:27.960> this<00:04:28.380> in<00:04:28.530> the

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
I set up probably like this in the

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.290 
I set up probably like this in the
country<00:04:28.800> all<00:04:29.099> this<00:04:29.250> equipment<00:04:29.580> comes<00:04:30.060> from

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
country all this equipment comes from

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.360 
country all this equipment comes from
Italy<00:04:30.449> we<00:04:31.320> probably<00:04:31.650> have<00:04:31.979> about<00:04:32.160> I<00:04:34.250> would<00:04:35.250> say

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
Italy we probably have about I would say

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.550 
Italy we probably have about I would say
about<00:04:35.669> 2,000<00:04:36.449> rabbits<00:04:36.900> in<00:04:37.050> here

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
about 2,000 rabbits in here
