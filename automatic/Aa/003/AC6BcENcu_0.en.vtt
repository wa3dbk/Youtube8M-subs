00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
because at that point that's not going

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.839 
because at that point that's not going
to<00:03:34.870> do<00:03:34.930> very<00:03:35.109> much<00:03:35.170> for<00:03:35.530> me<00:03:35.709> switch<00:03:36.639> to<00:03:36.670> my

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.210 
to do very much for me switch to my
spatula<00:03:37.540> now<00:03:37.720> you're<00:03:37.900> thinking<00:03:38.349> that<00:03:39.010> is<00:03:39.190> not

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
spatula now you're thinking that is not

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.089 
spatula now you're thinking that is not
enough<00:03:40.120> Mayo<00:03:40.420> for<00:03:40.900> all<00:03:41.049> that<00:03:41.260> tuna<00:03:41.680> but<00:03:41.859> that's

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
enough Mayo for all that tuna but that's

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.979 
enough Mayo for all that tuna but that's
just<00:03:42.459> what<00:03:42.579> I<00:03:42.609> like<00:03:42.910> I<00:03:43.150> don't<00:03:43.209> really<00:03:43.720> love

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
just what I like I don't really love

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.949 
just what I like I don't really love
when<00:03:44.560> my<00:03:44.739> tuna<00:03:45.130> is<00:03:45.280> swimming<00:03:45.730> in<00:03:45.910> Mayo<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.540> like

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
when my tuna is swimming in Mayo I like

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.050 
when my tuna is swimming in Mayo I like
when<00:03:47.139> it's<00:03:47.260> got<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.440> nice<00:03:47.680> coating<00:03:48.069> just<00:03:48.639> enough

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
when it's got a nice coating just enough

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.490 
when it's got a nice coating just enough
to<00:03:49.239> hold<00:03:49.389> it<00:03:49.569> together<00:03:49.750> if<00:03:50.079> you<00:03:50.200> know<00:03:50.319> what<00:03:50.470> I

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
to hold it together if you know what I

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.589 
to hold it together if you know what I
mean<00:03:50.739> it's<00:03:51.160> just<00:03:51.519> enough<00:03:51.819> to<00:03:51.849> almost<00:03:52.239> act<00:03:52.480> like

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
mean it's just enough to almost act like

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.020 
mean it's just enough to almost act like
edible<00:03:53.019> glue<00:03:53.380> but<00:03:53.889> not<00:03:54.160> so<00:03:54.430> much<00:03:54.639> that<00:03:54.700> you

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
edible glue but not so much that you

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.150 
edible glue but not so much that you
lose<00:03:55.359> the<00:03:55.389> tuna<00:03:55.959> completely<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:56.769> now<00:03:56.859> all<00:03:57.040> you

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
lose the tuna completely and now all you

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.050 
lose the tuna completely and now all you
taste<00:03:57.370> is<00:03:57.549> Mayo

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
taste is Mayo

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.909 
taste is Mayo
that's<00:03:58.359> not<00:03:58.630> how<00:03:58.750> I<00:03:58.780> roll<00:03:59.079> I'm<00:03:59.590> going<00:03:59.739> to<00:03:59.799> add<00:03:59.889> a

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
that's not how I roll I'm going to add a

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.819 
that's not how I roll I'm going to add a
good<00:04:00.160> pinch<00:04:00.220> of<00:04:00.760> salt<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:02.200> now<00:04:02.290> I'm<00:04:02.470> gonna<00:04:02.680> do

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
good pinch of salt and now I'm gonna do

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.069 
good pinch of salt and now I'm gonna do
I'd<00:04:03.220> like<00:04:03.549> to<00:04:03.730> think<00:04:03.910> that<00:04:04.090> it<00:04:04.180> works<00:04:04.389> best

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
I'd like to think that it works best

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.050 
I'd like to think that it works best
using<00:04:05.560> a<00:04:05.650> spatula<00:04:05.889> because<00:04:06.519> this<00:04:06.669> way<00:04:06.819> I<00:04:06.849> can

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
using a spatula because this way I can

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.240 
using a spatula because this way I can
kind<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.299> fold<00:04:07.630> everything<00:04:07.989> together<00:04:08.290> rather

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
kind of fold everything together rather

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.180 
kind of fold everything together rather
than<00:04:09.400> just<00:04:09.609> mess<00:04:10.120> up<00:04:10.359> those<00:04:10.810> flakes<00:04:11.500> of<00:04:11.739> tuna

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
than just mess up those flakes of tuna

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.309 
than just mess up those flakes of tuna
you<00:04:12.790> see<00:04:13.030> it's<00:04:13.180> not<00:04:13.329> swimming<00:04:13.959> it's<00:04:14.139> just

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
you see it's not swimming it's just

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.509 
you see it's not swimming it's just
perfect<00:04:14.980> its<00:04:15.340> coating<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.419> tuna<00:04:16.780> perfectly

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
perfect its coating the tuna perfectly

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.959 
perfect its coating the tuna perfectly
you<00:04:18.519> give<00:04:18.700> that<00:04:19.000> a<00:04:19.389> good<00:04:20.139> mix<00:04:20.500> like<00:04:21.099> so<00:04:21.489> and

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:21.969 
you give that a good mix like so and

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:24.750 
you give that a good mix like so and
give<00:04:22.810> it<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:22.990> taste<00:04:23.289> along<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.219> way<00:04:24.370> you<00:04:24.430> want

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
a splash of red wine vinegar I like a

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.360 
a splash of red wine vinegar I like a
little<00:04:33.880> acid<00:04:34.330> in<00:04:34.420> there<00:04:34.720> red<00:04:35.650> wine<00:04:35.890> white<00:04:36.340> wine

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.400 
little acid in there red wine white wine
vinegar<00:04:36.640> would<00:04:37.090> be<00:04:37.210> great<00:04:37.480> or<00:04:37.930> you<00:04:38.170> could<00:04:38.290> use

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
vinegar would be great or you could use

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.080 
vinegar would be great or you could use
lemon<00:04:38.560> juice<00:04:38.710> but<00:04:39.100> just<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.340> little<00:04:39.730> tiny<00:04:39.880> bit

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
lemon juice but just a little tiny bit

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.240 
lemon juice but just a little tiny bit
of<00:04:40.150> red<00:04:40.270> wine<00:04:40.450> vinegar<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.230> me<00:04:41.740> makes<00:04:41.980> a<00:04:42.070> big

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
of red wine vinegar to me makes a big

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.710 
of red wine vinegar to me makes a big
difference<00:04:42.670> so<00:04:42.790> I'm<00:04:42.880> going<00:04:43.060> to<00:04:43.090> mix<00:04:43.240> that<00:04:43.450> in

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
difference so I'm going to mix that in

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.880 
difference so I'm going to mix that in
and<00:04:43.960> then<00:04:44.050> I'm<00:04:44.140> just<00:04:44.290> going<00:04:44.440> to<00:04:44.470> cover<00:04:44.680> this

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
and then I'm just going to cover this

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.860 
and then I'm just going to cover this
with<00:04:44.950> plastic<00:04:45.220> wrap<00:04:45.490> and<00:04:45.910> pop<00:04:46.420> it<00:04:46.660> in<00:04:46.750> the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
with plastic wrap and pop it in the
