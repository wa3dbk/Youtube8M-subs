into<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.439> tree<00:00:19.710> as<00:00:19.859> well<00:00:20.539> so<00:00:21.769> it's<00:00:22.769> not<00:00:23.130> a

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
into that tree as well so it's not a

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.550 
into that tree as well so it's not a
condition<00:00:23.490> build<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.210> know<00:00:24.330> condition<00:00:25.080> builds

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
condition build I know condition builds

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.439 
condition build I know condition builds
are<00:00:25.680> quite<00:00:26.369> okey<00:00:26.699> now<00:00:26.730> but<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.090> like<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.330> go<00:00:27.420> i

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
are quite okey now but I like to go i

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.300 
are quite okey now but I like to go i
guess<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.810> grain<00:00:28.050> here<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.529> like<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:29.010> short

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
guess the grain here I like the short

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.890 
guess the grain here I like the short
bow<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.730> sword<00:00:30.029> how<00:00:30.240> fast<00:00:30.539> they<00:00:30.720> are<00:00:30.869> I

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
bow and the sword how fast they are I

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.770 
bow and the sword how fast they are I
want<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.380> get<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> most<00:00:32.000> crit<00:00:33.000> output<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.480> code

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
want to get the most crit output I code

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.459 
want to get the most crit output I code
out<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.230> speed<00:00:34.770> as<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.250> see<00:00:36.469> almost

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
out of that speed as you can see almost

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.430 
out of that speed as you can see almost
every<00:00:38.250> hits<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.579> crit<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.079> these<00:00:40.079> are<00:00:40.260> high

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
every hits a crit and these are high

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.139 
every hits a crit and these are high
numbers<00:00:40.829> for<00:00:41.129> these<00:00:41.190> type<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.520> weapons<00:00:41.940> and

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
numbers for these type of weapons and

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.389 
numbers for these type of weapons and
they're<00:00:42.570> not<00:00:42.719> huge<00:00:43.170> numbers<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:43.920> how<00:00:44.040> fast

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
they're not huge numbers but how fast

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.760 
they're not huge numbers but how fast
these<00:00:44.610> weapons<00:00:44.969> go<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.620> melts<00:00:46.620> through

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
these weapons go it just melts through

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.990 
these weapons go it just melts through
people<00:00:48.020> with<00:00:49.020> condition<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.920> can't<00:00:50.460> really<00:00:50.670> I

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
people with condition you can't really I

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.540 
people with condition you can't really I
mean<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.840> go<00:00:51.870> glass<00:00:52.260> cannon<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:53.399> not

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
mean you can go glass cannon it's not

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.220 
mean you can go glass cannon it's not
ideal<00:00:53.670> because<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:55.050> have<00:00:55.079> to

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
ideal because you have to you have to

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.900 
ideal because you have to you have to
apply<00:00:55.500> them<00:00:55.770> all<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.219> then<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.670> wait

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
apply them all and then you have to wait

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.430 
apply them all and then you have to wait
for<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.539> conditions<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> do<00:00:58.260> damage

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
for the conditions to do damage

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.880 
for the conditions to do damage
especially<00:00:59.340> if<00:00:59.940> they're<00:01:00.180> going<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.890> they're

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
especially if they're going to they're

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.170 
especially if they're going to they're
going<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.100> wipe<00:01:02.280> those<00:01:02.489> conditions<00:01:02.820> often

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
going to wipe those conditions often

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.030 
going to wipe those conditions often
have<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.570> reapply<00:01:03.899> them<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.710> can<00:01:04.830> see<00:01:05.010> I

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
have to reapply them so as you can see I

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.580 
have to reapply them so as you can see I
go<00:01:05.250> through<00:01:05.430> about<00:01:05.600> 17<00:01:06.600> k<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.260> elemental

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
go through about 17 k of this elemental

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.890 
go through about 17 k of this elemental
as<00:01:07.860> health<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.580> matter<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.180> three<00:01:09.600> seconds

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
as health in a matter of three seconds

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.360 
as health in a matter of three seconds
and<00:01:12.260> we'll<00:01:12.410> watch<00:01:12.500> that<00:01:12.710> again<00:01:12.950> just<00:01:13.220> so<00:01:13.250> we

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
and we'll watch that again just so we

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.890 
and we'll watch that again just so we
can<00:01:13.460> see<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.700> combo<00:01:14.030> that<00:01:14.060> I<00:01:14.210> use<00:01:14.420> you'll<00:01:14.720> see

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
can see the combo that I use you'll see

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.990 
can see the combo that I use you'll see
this<00:01:15.020> throughout<00:01:15.260> the<00:01:15.410> video<00:01:15.620> is<00:01:16.280> I<00:01:16.580> use<00:01:16.820> the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
this throughout the video is I use the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.330 
this throughout the video is I use the
boar<00:01:17.420> horn<00:01:17.630> buff<00:01:17.900> to<00:01:18.260> get<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.500> fury<00:01:18.800> and<00:01:19.070> the

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
boar horn buff to get the fury and the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.790 
boar horn buff to get the fury and the
quickness<00:01:19.550> are<00:01:20.120> the<00:01:20.330> swiftness<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:21.170> I<00:01:21.680> use

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
quickness are the swiftness and I use

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.040 
quickness are the swiftness and I use
birds<00:01:22.070> switch<00:01:22.970> immediately<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:23.750> short

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
birds switch immediately to the short

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.920 
birds switch immediately to the short
bow<00:01:24.260> and<00:01:24.820> then<00:01:25.820> i<00:01:25.940> use<00:01:26.090> quickening<00:01:26.510> zephyr

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
bow and then i use quickening zephyr

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.530 
bow and then i use quickening zephyr
which<00:01:27.530> is<00:01:27.830> a<00:01:28.220> four-second<00:01:29.030> buff<00:01:29.240> of

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
which is a four-second buff of

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.200 
which is a four-second buff of
increasing<00:01:30.380> your<00:01:30.500> attack<00:01:30.800> speed<00:01:31.160> or<00:01:31.430> reducing

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
increasing your attack speed or reducing

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.660 
increasing your attack speed or reducing
the<00:01:32.300> cast<00:01:32.540> time<00:01:32.840> of<00:01:33.050> what<00:01:33.260> you're<00:01:33.410> using<00:01:33.670> that

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
the cast time of what you're using that

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.530 
the cast time of what you're using that
also<00:01:35.240> reduces<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.080> cast<00:01:36.290> time<00:01:36.500> on<00:01:37.540> executing

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
also reduces the cast time on executing

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.390 
also reduces the cast time on executing
people<00:01:38.720> so<00:01:39.200> you<00:01:39.260> can<00:01:39.470> kill<00:01:40.070> them<00:01:40.220> almost

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
people so you can kill them almost

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.090 
people so you can kill them almost
immediately<00:01:41.170> but<00:01:42.170> it's<00:01:42.350> an<00:01:42.470> absolute<00:01:42.920> beast

immediately but it's an absolute beast
when<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:43.550> look<00:01:43.730> in<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.910> utility<00:01:44.210> true<00:01:44.540> you

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
when you look in the utility true you

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.480 
when you look in the utility true you
say<00:01:44.930> oh<00:01:45.140> it's<00:01:45.170> a<00:01:45.470> four-second<00:01:46.010> buff<00:01:46.220> it's

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.760 
terror as you can see this guy saw his
health<00:01:53.060> go<00:01:53.240> down<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:53.660> fast<00:01:53.900> that<00:01:54.140> he<00:01:54.440> started

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
health go down so fast that he started

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.620 
health go down so fast that he started
running<00:01:54.979> away<00:01:55.100> which<00:01:55.400> should<00:01:55.550> let<00:01:55.670> me<00:01:55.820> even

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
running away which should let me even

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.180 
running away which should let me even
after<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.990> buff<00:01:57.170> just<00:01:57.440> chase<00:01:57.680> him<00:01:57.800> down<00:01:57.920> and

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
after the buff just chase him down and

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.370 
after the buff just chase him down and
shoot<00:01:58.880> him<00:01:58.910> away<00:02:00.220> here<00:02:01.220> we<00:02:01.310> have<00:02:01.400> goes<00:02:02.350> into<00:02:03.350> a

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
shoot him away here we have goes into a

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.910 
shoot him away here we have goes into a
shield<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:04.160> we<00:02:04.640> have<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.790> shield<00:02:05.060> Guardian<00:02:05.540> and

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
shield so we have a shield Guardian and

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.400 
shield so we have a shield Guardian and
the<00:02:06.920> crits<00:02:07.160> aren't<00:02:07.460> as<00:02:07.580> big<00:02:07.840> as<00:02:08.840> we<00:02:09.020> saw<00:02:09.229> on

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
the crits aren't as big as we saw on

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.590 
the crits aren't as big as we saw on
that<00:02:09.880> elementalist<00:02:10.880> that<00:02:11.120> was<00:02:11.209> obviously

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
that elementalist that was obviously

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.050 
that elementalist that was obviously
another<00:02:12.080> glass<00:02:12.380> can<00:02:12.650> inspect<00:02:13.060> elementalist

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
another glass can inspect elementalist

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.470 
another glass can inspect elementalist
but<00:02:14.840> um<00:02:15.020> it<00:02:15.350> does<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.680> job<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:16.190> it's<00:02:17.120> just

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
but um it does the job it it's just

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.540 
but um it does the job it it's just
consistent<00:02:18.110> crets<00:02:18.350> will<00:02:18.950> see<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.220> numbers

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
consistent crets will see the numbers

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.960 
consistent crets will see the numbers
coming<00:02:19.940> off<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.750> chieftain<00:02:21.530> here<00:02:21.970> the

coming off of the chieftain here the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.130 
coming off of the chieftain here the
health<00:02:23.150> doesn't<00:02:23.360> really<00:02:23.660> mean<00:02:23.900> much<00:02:23.930> since

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
health doesn't really mean much since

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.380 
health doesn't really mean much since
all<00:02:24.830> these<00:02:25.070> people<00:02:25.340> are<00:02:25.580> on<00:02:25.730> them<00:02:25.880> but<00:02:26.239> we'll

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
all these people are on them but we'll

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.479 
all these people are on them but we'll
get<00:02:26.480> some<00:02:26.660> 1v<00:02:26.810> one's<00:02:27.170> going<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:27.980> show<00:02:28.100> you<00:02:28.160> what

get some 1v one's going to show you what

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.979 
get some 1v one's going to show you what
it's<00:02:28.610> capable<00:02:28.790> of<00:02:29.350> it's<00:02:30.350> it's<00:02:30.650> not<00:02:31.660> it's<00:02:32.660> like

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
it's capable of it's it's not it's like

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.570 
it's capable of it's it's not it's like
I<00:02:33.350> said<00:02:33.530> there's<00:02:33.739> no<00:02:33.860> toughness<00:02:34.250> there's<00:02:34.459> no

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
I said there's no toughness there's no

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.449 
I said there's no toughness there's no
vitality<00:02:35.030> it's<00:02:35.209> not<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.540> build<00:02:35.959> where<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.280> can

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
vitality it's not a build where you can

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.990 
vitality it's not a build where you can
just<00:02:37.489> stand<00:02:38.030> around<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:38.780> take<00:02:39.470> hits<00:02:39.739> and<00:02:40.550> a

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
just stand around and take hits and a

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000 
just stand around and take hits and a
lot<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.230> condition<00:02:42.620> builds<00:02:42.890> our

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
lot of the condition builds our

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.250 
lot of the condition builds our
toughness<00:02:43.250> condition<00:02:43.760> builds<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:44.870> if<00:02:45.110> you're

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
toughness condition builds so if you're

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.960 
toughness condition builds so if you're
going<00:02:45.500> from<00:02:45.739> that<00:02:45.920> building<00:02:46.130> trying<00:02:46.610> this<00:02:46.790> one
