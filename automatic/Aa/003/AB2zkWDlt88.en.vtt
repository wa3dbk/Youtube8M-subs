00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
hello blender lovers today we're going

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.530 
hello blender lovers today we're going
to<00:00:04.230> look<00:00:04.650> at<00:00:04.859> how<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.220> create<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:06.029> quick<00:00:06.299> and

to look at how to create a quick and

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.520 
to look at how to create a quick and
dirty<00:00:06.720> missed<00:00:07.710> effect<00:00:08.870> and<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:09.960> missed<00:00:10.170> effect

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
dirty missed effect and I missed effect

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.669 
dirty missed effect and I missed effect
like<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:12.210> extremely<00:00:12.690> useful<00:00:13.139> for

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
like this it is extremely useful for

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.560 
like this it is extremely useful for

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
when you want to convey a sense of

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.630 
when you want to convey a sense of
distance<00:00:16.289> or<00:00:16.710> size<00:00:18.109> like<00:00:19.109> in<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:19.380> real<00:00:20.369> world

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
picture of a long street you can see

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.580 
picture of a long street you can see
that<00:00:22.920> further<00:00:23.430> away<00:00:23.699> objects<00:00:24.390> have<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> bluish

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
that further away objects have a bluish

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.269 
that further away objects have a bluish
kind<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.010> tint<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:27.230> that's<00:00:28.230> due<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.130> way

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
kind of tint and that's due to the way

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.659 
kind of tint and that's due to the way
that<00:00:29.519> air<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.840> light<00:00:31.610> interacts<00:00:32.610> with

that air in that light interacts with

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.510 
that air in that light interacts with
the<00:00:32.910> air<00:00:34.219> and<00:00:35.219> all<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.550> particles<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.660> are

the air and all the particles that are

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.110 
the air and all the particles that are
in<00:00:38.520> error<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.579> same<00:00:41.760> with<00:00:41.940> this

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
in error and the same with this

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.420 
in error and the same with this
spaceship<00:00:42.840> render<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.469> do<00:00:43.739> believe<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.280> this

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
spaceship render I do believe that this

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.190 
spaceship render I do believe that this
is<00:00:44.610> from<00:00:44.820> district<00:00:45.329> nine<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.570> could<00:00:45.930> be<00:00:46.050> wrong

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
is from district nine I could be wrong

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.950 
is from district nine I could be wrong
and<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.550> see<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.030> applied<00:00:48.660> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and you can see that they have applied a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.959 
and you can see that they have applied a
sort<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.469> missed<00:00:49.710> effect<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.520> make<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.850> appear

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
sort of missed effect to make it appear

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.790 
sort of missed effect to make it appear
huge<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.530> also<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.949> fit<00:00:53.610> into<00:00:53.910> this

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
huge and also to fit into this

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.610 
huge and also to fit into this
environment<00:00:55.910> here<00:00:56.910> there's<00:00:57.149> very<00:00:58.109> dirty

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
environment here there's very dirty

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.899 
environment here there's very dirty
indeed<00:01:00.350> okay<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.410> let's<00:01:01.770> get<00:01:02.190> started<00:01:04.729> here<00:01:05.729> we

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
indeed okay so let's get started here we

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.480 
indeed okay so let's get started here we
have<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.330> pre<00:01:06.930> rendered<00:01:07.170> image<00:01:07.680> it's<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
have a pre rendered image it's just a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.850 
have a pre rendered image it's just a
bunch<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.909> balls<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.049> white<00:01:10.260> room<00:01:10.500> with<00:01:10.830> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
bunch of balls in a white room with a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.840 
bunch of balls in a white room with a
slight<00:01:11.250> depth<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:12.060> field<00:01:13.430> it's<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.670> for

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
slight depth of field it's just for

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.020 
slight depth of field it's just for
instructional<00:01:15.570> purposes<00:01:15.680> so<00:01:16.680> when<00:01:17.030> don't

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
instructional purposes so when don't

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.830 
instructional purposes so when don't
mind<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.990> image<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:20.790> when<00:01:21.420> you're<00:01:21.540> going<00:01:21.689> to

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
mind the image and when you're going to

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.440 
mind the image and when you're going to
add<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.170> mist<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.920> very<00:01:23.759> important<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.330> you

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
add a mist it's very important that you

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.249 
add a mist it's very important that you
check<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.350> air<00:01:25.680> as<00:01:26.490> said<00:01:27.090> depth<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
check in the air as said depth in the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.390 
check in the air as said depth in the
passes<00:01:29.900> and<00:01:30.900> render<00:01:31.229> passes<00:01:31.470> because<00:01:31.860> that's

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
passes and render passes because that's

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.640 
passes and render passes because that's
the<00:01:33.180> data<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.780> we're<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.259> use<00:01:34.350> to

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
the data that we're going to use to

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.789 
the data that we're going to use to
create<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.280> mist<00:01:36.079> so<00:01:37.079> we'll<00:01:37.290> go<00:01:37.439> into<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
create this mist so we'll go into the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.640 
create this mist so we'll go into the
node<00:01:37.979> editor<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.850> click<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.259> composite<00:01:40.259> icon

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
node editor and click the composite icon

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.730 
node editor and click the composite icon
and<00:01:40.920> then<00:01:41.040> check<00:01:41.820> use<00:01:42.150> nodes<00:01:42.479> backdrop<00:01:43.439> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
and then check use nodes backdrop and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.480 
and then check use nodes backdrop and
auto<00:01:44.220> render<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:46.560> now<00:01:46.680> if<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.070> go<00:01:47.220> ahead<00:01:47.340> and

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
auto render so now if you go ahead and

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.370 
auto render so now if you go ahead and
add<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:48.149> viewer<00:01:48.720> node<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:51.350> disconnect<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
add a viewer node and disconnect the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.160 
add a viewer node and disconnect the
composite<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:54.119> lets<00:01:54.420> us<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:56.479> preview<00:01:57.479> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
composite and this lets us a preview the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.639 
composite and this lets us a preview the
results<00:01:59.070> as<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.729> backdrop<00:02:00.149> within<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.290> node

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
results as a backdrop within the node

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.510 
results as a backdrop within the node
editor<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.310> that's<00:02:02.490> extremely<00:02:03.450> useful<00:02:04.520> but

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
editor and that's extremely useful but

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.730 
editor and that's extremely useful but
we<00:02:05.670> are<00:02:05.729> not<00:02:05.820> interested<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.960> image<00:02:07.350> at

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
we are not interested in the image at

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.309 
we are not interested in the image at
this<00:02:08.039> point<00:02:08.369> we<00:02:08.700> are<00:02:08.729> much<00:02:09.360> more<00:02:09.629> interested

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
this point we are much more interested

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.040 
this point we are much more interested
in<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.849> set

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
in the set

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.700 
in the set
depth<00:02:12.440> value<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:14.260> right<00:02:15.260> now<00:02:15.440> that's

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
depth value and right now that's

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.490 
depth value and right now that's
completely<00:02:16.340> white<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.660> let's<00:02:17.840> go<00:02:18.050> ahead<00:02:18.080> and

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
completely white so let's go ahead and

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.470 
completely white so let's go ahead and
add<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:20.920> map<00:02:21.940> value<00:02:22.940> node<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:25.580> it's<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:26.000> size

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
add a map value node and it's the size

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.830 
add a map value node and it's the size
that<00:02:26.840> we<00:02:27.020> want<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.290> change<00:02:27.710> here<00:02:28.460> and<00:02:28.840> point

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
that we want to change here and point

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.260 
that we want to change here and point
one<00:02:30.440> actually<00:02:31.160> works<00:02:31.510> quite<00:02:32.510> well<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:34.400> so

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
one actually works quite well and so

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.420 
one actually works quite well and so
basically<00:02:35.390> just<00:02:35.930> fiddle<00:02:36.440> with<00:02:36.710> the<00:02:36.920> values

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
basically just fiddle with the values

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.880 
basically just fiddle with the values
until<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.150> actually<00:02:38.750> see<00:02:39.140> anything<00:02:39.950> and

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
until you actually see anything and

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.430 
until you actually see anything and
right<00:02:42.890> now<00:02:43.250> if<00:02:43.550> it's<00:02:43.850> far<00:02:44.360> away<00:02:44.600> it<00:02:45.020> appears

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
right now if it's far away it appears

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.800 
right now if it's far away it appears
much<00:02:45.950> brighter<00:02:46.670> that's<00:02:47.180> what<00:02:47.450> looks<00:02:47.660> so

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
much brighter that's what looks so

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.250 
much brighter that's what looks so
strange<00:02:48.140> so<00:02:48.920> when<00:02:49.570> objects<00:02:50.570> closer<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.140> the

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
strange so when objects closer to the

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.560 
strange so when objects closer to the
camera<00:02:51.410> appear<00:02:51.950> darker<00:02:54.490> and<00:02:55.490> then<00:02:55.670> we<00:02:55.970> want<00:02:56.180> to

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
camera appear darker and then we want to

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.600 
camera appear darker and then we want to
add<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:57.110> color<00:02:57.710> ramp<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:59.150> gain<00:02:59.690> further<00:03:00.230> control

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
add a color ramp to gain further control

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:08.710 
add a color ramp to gain further control
over<00:03:01.610> this<00:03:02.020> image<00:03:04.300> let's<00:03:05.300> make<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:07.360> I'm<00:03:08.360> just

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
over this image let's make the I'm just

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.790 
over this image let's make the I'm just
dragging<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:10.870> sort<00:03:11.870> of<00:03:11.900> handles<00:03:12.440> at<00:03:12.680> the

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
dragging the sort of handles at the

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.630 
dragging the sort of handles at the
sides<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.660> linear<00:03:14.660> editor<00:03:15.110> here<00:03:15.320> I<00:03:15.640> want

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
sides of the linear editor here I want

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.710 
sides of the linear editor here I want
these<00:03:17.090> foreground<00:03:17.959> objects<00:03:18.620> appear<00:03:19.010> darker

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
these foreground objects appear darker

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.750 
these foreground objects appear darker
because<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:20.930> don't<00:03:21.110> want<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.650> mist<00:03:21.890> effect<00:03:22.340> to

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
because I don't want the mist effect to

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.979 
because I don't want the mist effect to
apply<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.510> them<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:25.239> we<00:03:26.239> don't<00:03:26.420> actually<00:03:26.600> want

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
apply to them and we don't actually want

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.500 
apply to them and we don't actually want

and<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:59.690> bottom<00:03:59.959> one<00:03:59.989> I'm<00:04:00.230> just<00:04:00.410> going<00:04:00.620> to

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
and the bottom one I'm just going to

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.610 
and the bottom one I'm just going to
give<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.370> green<00:04:02.330> color<00:04:03.640> now<00:04:04.640> you<00:04:04.700> can<00:04:04.940> use<00:04:05.620> just

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
give a green color now you can use just

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.699 
give a green color now you can use just
a<00:04:06.890> separate<00:04:07.340> image<00:04:07.700> for<00:04:08.000> for<00:04:08.420> this<00:04:08.600> and<00:04:09.170> but

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
a separate image for for this and but

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.220 
a separate image for for this and but
i'm<00:04:09.800> just<00:04:09.980> going<00:04:10.160> to<00:04:10.220> use<00:04:10.310> a<00:04:10.400> n<00:04:10.820> green<00:04:11.180> image<00:04:11.989> to

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
i'm just going to use a n green image to

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.280 
i'm just going to use a n green image to
show<00:04:12.260> you<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.739> actual<00:04:12.890> effect<00:04:14.170> and<00:04:15.170> then

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
show you the actual effect and then

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.460 
show you the actual effect and then
thank<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.560> output<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.400> view<00:04:17.180> no<00:04:18.019> damn

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
thank the output to the view no damn

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.409 
thank the output to the view no damn
sorry<00:04:20.470> ok<00:04:21.470> and<00:04:21.739> now<00:04:22.100> let's<00:04:22.400> connect<00:04:22.880> the

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
sorry ok and now let's connect the

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.820 
sorry ok and now let's connect the
output<00:04:23.450> from<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.770> color<00:04:25.039> ramp

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
output from the color ramp

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.230 
output from the color ramp
had<00:04:26.520> to<00:04:26.759> take<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.000> set<00:04:27.629> depth<00:04:28.669> data<00:04:29.669> and<00:04:30.120> then

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
had to take the set depth data and then

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.369 
had to take the set depth data and then
put<00:04:30.479> that<00:04:30.509> to<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.020> fact<00:04:31.439> value<00:04:32.129> and<00:04:33.199> as<00:04:34.199> you

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:34.379 
put that to the fact value and as you

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.610 
put that to the fact value and as you
can<00:04:34.560> see<00:04:34.590> we<00:04:34.979> already<00:04:35.250> have<00:04:35.759> a<00:04:36.229> greenish<00:04:37.229> tint

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
can see we already have a greenish tint

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.580 
can see we already have a greenish tint
to<00:04:38.219> the<00:04:38.430> objects<00:04:39.030> that<00:04:39.180> are<00:04:39.509> further<00:04:39.780> away<00:04:40.169> and

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
to the objects that are further away and

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.260 
to the objects that are further away and
this<00:04:40.800> creates<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.460> mist<00:04:42.090> like<00:04:42.419> effect<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:45.120> if

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
this creates the mist like effect so if

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.980 
this creates the mist like effect so if
you<00:04:45.419> change<00:04:45.750> this<00:04:46.310> color<00:04:47.310> that<00:04:47.669> we<00:04:47.990> darkened

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
you change this color that we darkened

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.659 
you change this color that we darkened
if<00:04:49.319> you<00:04:49.439> brighten<00:04:49.860> it<00:04:49.919> again<00:04:50.189> you<00:04:50.310> will<00:04:50.460> see

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
if you brighten it again you will see

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.080 
if you brighten it again you will see
that<00:04:50.849> things<00:04:51.949> start<00:04:52.949> repairing<00:04:53.340> way<00:04:53.819> more

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
that things start repairing way more

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.270 
that things start repairing way more
green<00:04:54.360> you<00:04:54.569> can't<00:04:54.840> actually<00:04:55.080> see<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.919> the

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
green you can't actually see the the

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.070 
green you can't actually see the the
bottom<00:04:56.520> balls<00:04:58.400> so<00:04:59.400> let's<00:04:59.580> go<00:04:59.819> ahead<00:04:59.849> and<00:05:00.120> give

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
bottom balls so let's go ahead and give

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.219 
bottom balls so let's go ahead and give
that<00:05:01.110> darker<00:05:01.680> value<00:05:02.069> again<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:03.900> you<00:05:03.990> can<00:05:04.110> see

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
that darker value again and you can see

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:05.959 
that darker value again and you can see
when<00:05:04.379> you<00:05:04.409> start<00:05:04.710> to<00:05:04.830> adjust<00:05:05.280> is<00:05:05.520> you<00:05:05.789> can

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:05.969 
when you start to adjust is you can

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:10.580 
when you start to adjust is you can
create<00:05:06.240> all<00:05:06.599> kinds<00:05:06.990> of<00:05:07.530> effects<00:05:09.349> like<00:05:10.349> this

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
create all kinds of effects like this

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
create all kinds of effects like this
not<00:05:10.889> only<00:05:10.919> the<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:12.440> the<00:05:13.440> closest<00:05:13.979> objects<00:05:14.490> are

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
not only the the the closest objects are

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.309 
not only the the the closest objects are
up<00:05:14.759> here<00:05:14.909> in<00:05:15.090> green<00:05:15.330> that's<00:05:15.659> that's<00:05:16.080> quite

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
up here in green that's that's quite

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:21.709 
up here in green that's that's quite
wild<00:05:16.590> we<00:05:17.099> just<00:05:17.340> inverted<00:05:17.909> the<00:05:17.940> colors<00:05:18.060> here<00:05:20.719> so

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:21.719 
wild we just inverted the colors here so

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:23.809 
wild we just inverted the colors here so
you<00:05:22.169> can<00:05:22.319> just<00:05:22.349> play<00:05:22.710> around<00:05:22.860> with<00:05:23.219> this<00:05:23.340> until

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:23.819 
you can just play around with this until

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:26.570 
you can just play around with this until
you<00:05:24.240> find<00:05:24.840> a<00:05:24.990> result<00:05:25.139> that<00:05:25.830> you<00:05:26.039> are<00:05:26.279> happy

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
you find a result that you are happy

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.379 
you find a result that you are happy
with<00:05:26.729> them<00:05:27.439> and<00:05:28.439> again<00:05:29.250> it's<00:05:29.460> just<00:05:29.610> the<00:05:30.000> set

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
with them and again it's just the set

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.680 
with them and again it's just the set
depth<00:05:30.810> value<00:05:31.289> into<00:05:31.529> a<00:05:31.710> map<00:05:32.310> value<00:05:32.849> into<00:05:33.509> a

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
depth value into a map value into a

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.559 
depth value into a map value into a
color<00:05:33.960> ramp<00:05:34.229> and<00:05:34.529> then<00:05:34.830> use<00:05:35.129> that<00:05:35.430> as<00:05:35.729> the<00:05:36.090> fact

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:36.569 
color ramp and then use that as the fact

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:41.589 
color ramp and then use that as the fact
to<00:05:37.050> control<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:39.810> blending<00:05:40.349> of<00:05:40.500> two<00:05:40.740> images

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599 
to control the blending of two images

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:46.730 
to control the blending of two images
and<00:05:43.279> that's<00:05:44.279> basically<00:05:44.969> it<00:05:45.330> so<00:05:45.900> this<00:05:46.259> is<00:05:46.289> Oscar

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
and that's basically it so this is Oscar

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.409 
and that's basically it so this is Oscar
from<00:05:46.889> blender<00:05:47.250> sweet<00:05:47.490> signing<00:05:47.969> outs<00:05:48.089> and

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
from blender sweet signing outs and

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.770 
from blender sweet signing outs and
happy<00:05:49.319> blundering
