00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
with these two little pieces which are I

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.010 
with these two little pieces which are I
guess<00:02:30.100> what<00:02:30.400> you're<00:02:30.580> supposed<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:30.940> do<00:02:31.180> is<00:02:31.420> put

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
guess what you're supposed to do is put

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.900 
guess what you're supposed to do is put
some<00:02:32.170> kind<00:02:32.350> of<00:02:32.470> creamer<00:02:32.890> in<00:02:33.190> here<00:02:33.550> maybe<00:02:33.790> a

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
some kind of creamer in here maybe a

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.570 
some kind of creamer in here maybe a
little<00:02:34.060> portable<00:02:34.360> creamer<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:36.400> then

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
little portable creamer and and then

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.020 
little portable creamer and and then
you've<00:02:36.760> got<00:02:36.940> coffee<00:02:37.780> but<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:38.680> personally<00:02:39.489> think

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
you've got coffee but I personally think

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.760 
you've got coffee but I personally think
I'm<00:02:40.209> going<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.420> probably<00:02:40.570> just<00:02:40.750> put<00:02:41.650> these

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
I'm going to probably just put these

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.310 
I'm going to probably just put these
both<00:02:42.160> with<00:02:42.550> cream<00:02:42.880> inside<00:02:43.300> of<00:02:43.480> them<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:44.110> can

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
both with cream inside of them so I can

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.960 
both with cream inside of them so I can
have<00:02:44.470> double<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:44.830> power<00:02:45.100> inside<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.850> they

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
have double the power inside and they

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.240 
have double the power inside and they
fit<00:02:46.209> right<00:02:46.600> inside<00:02:46.900> here<00:02:47.170> when<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:47.950> put<00:02:48.160> all

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.040 
fit right inside here when you put all
of<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.459> together<00:02:48.580> so<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:49.630> get<00:02:49.750> these<00:02:49.870> two

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
of it together so you get these two

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.640 
of it together so you get these two
little<00:02:50.080> guys<00:02:50.790> now<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:52.600> is<00:02:52.780> pretty<00:02:52.989> cool<00:02:53.200> it's
