00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.370
 The third winner does not even want to give up from a completely different perspective 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.410
 offer did not say but mine 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.699
 with the screen 

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.989
 because i want to introduce an internet site to introduce some of 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:13.629
 probably already know you 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.859
 That's because of the fact that they have been chosen especially recently 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.220
 Requests get from writing friends who just started writing 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.840
 and want to make Project history now so far and whether 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.009
 and always yes for advice like to wear, of course, not natural Dr 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.329
 but on the one hand lies 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.329
 my very first writer women back a very long time 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.350
 and I'm also very limited as I said and I'm myself 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.760
 no problem 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.800
 calculate today is so much effort 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.670
 Ladies came their car already learned so had the German writer 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.880
 Surface probably one 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.120
 percent 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.239
 Blum plays the best the movements PS 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.450
 the reverse looks the same 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.790
 in the top 100 percent 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.500
 you can find on the left side 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.509
 We are different banks among other things a very big Bakken 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.590
 I do not have Georg Schreibwerkstatt 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.580
 then the Republic of Iran will rise 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.570
 the childlike crime scene 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.560
 APA 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.859
 we combine some kind of Wikipedia from the German writer coup 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.780
 as soon as a site feels so cool, there are not many 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.250
 subjects 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.460
 but I will be like that 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.430
 most inquired subject of a very wonderful deal and I can too 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.430
 only a lot of Bernhard Dietrich on the left side 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.170
 May on the torso 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.170
 again such a small quake through the categories 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.560
 also classified by categories in asthma allergies Percent Norilsk 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.560
 Media find criticism and so on and so forth 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.270
 or indirectly to less money 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.480
 It also has to be dedicated to all topics 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.900
 on basket hunt 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.810
 he answers if I am not 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.900
 Sulgen couple very nice speech are, for example, a general 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.809
 write discouraged 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:11.389
 Take as an example a woman 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.859
 submit to the blog 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:18.540
 in principle because how can I write to the Commerzbank research 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:21.229
 Plate developments bring characters to life 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:22.319
 do the same 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.090
 Revised marketing so generally what you do what everything 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.889
 to do is 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:30.029
 This makes you the true one 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:31.239
 give it now 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.569
 or a nice German word for it starts after the way, of course 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.589
 and that was not always the case 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:41.379
 look at the general writes guide from Schumann schools 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.029
 After that there is also the search for that I have ever had three videos 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:45.839
 turned 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:49.899
 as well as zoo character development, too, I've done videos 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.849
 which certainly also good that the article to the perspective 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:57.869
 and 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.829
 that's something special for me personally Bandes 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.840
 the title to the arc of suspense 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.000
 and involved in the conflict, Eckhard Teepe needs well 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.319
 Thanks to this article, he was able to fix it right around me 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.829
 actually the conflict in my first novel 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.950
 So the 2 that is even nowhere to read 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.470
 I have planned completely differently from the beginning because I do not have me either 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.449
 from the outset thank the conflict on the 8th 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.109
 Who is in conflict with whom? 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.610
 and tape 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.930
 At the time I just played without any arguments 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.579
 I also had illnesses there 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:35.909
 until the 8th 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.149
 this 

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:39.090
 virtually publish calls to me 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.140
 not really made a report yet Member of the ice is mine 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.239
 itself very difficult 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.239
 Overall, almost only politicians are considered as possible candidates 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.159
 and here we have different conflicts for example the 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.019
 settle military conflict in parties that fight against all or 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.969
 in there but clearly that the government survive 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.499
 as a rival then the persecution 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:05.829
 Task or the plans of interpersonal conflict the inner 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:06.719
 conflict 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:07.480
 around 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.489
 Munich are still sitting 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.319
 how to mix it all together 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.489
 yes this violent criminal fly case times show 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.199
 then of course it was already before the writing you actually do 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.259
 If it is the art that can think quite well now I realize 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.479
 So why are you? 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.289
 and if I write the first band again, which will happen at some point 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.229
 the case will be 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.150
 because maybe 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.699
 one if I implement the whole thing quite differently 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.969
 why go back to the overview 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:39.279
 Also here are the tips for the behavior normal for all those too 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.849
 just started 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:43.849
 So a bit summarized you just fine 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:46.789
 Procedure can 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.069
 someone else on the subway 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:53.999
 and now the EBIT i was a head cinema how to trigger the whole thing on the reader like that 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.639
 can 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.150
 says construction 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.060
 and what I once was chalked but expanded as assets and acquisitions 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.559
 and reporters 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:05.189
 that's all very well there background information and waiting for that 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:06.340
 both of course always with 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.340
 Prices - Writer per 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.139
 and a church and secular minute a year's work known at the 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.319
 Competition very enthusiastic 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:18.610
 the work 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.629
 she had the so-called Fleet Flake method which was pretty cool when I looked at it 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:26.089
 myself not quite read through when I still do it here is so give 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:28.479
 next to steps 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.440
 Riemann sued 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.150
 for his book 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.910
 Constructions to the individual sentences with which the first step is into that one 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.559
 Sentence writes 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:40.809
 the Dante story is summarized in one sentence 

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:43.709
 November, the team will make even stronger but also the mac-computer 

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:46.950
 Scattered among the top ten and afraid 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.930
 the problem is just 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.199
 somehow missing here 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.240
 the eighth and ninth Schramberger city centers are not quite 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.580
 Maybe he is something to read somewhere 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.889
 num but there is no special article for the Artland Dragons at BC 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:04.820
 better simply respectable what you should do or not or why the 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:05.939
 IBM 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:08.869
 if the gang in the comments write the very cool 

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:13.409
 Euro so that hardly a small page recommendation for today especially for 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:17.179
 all of you who start writing but also the 4 no August thats just fine 

00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:20.469
 and have a lot of experience and would like to participate with 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:23.120
 Of course, other people can object that 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.120
 Writer that gives here a bit more 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.669
 around TM 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:32.589
 and articles enrich that he is quite cool 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:33.729
 Well 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:35.629
 so much for it 

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:39.300
 Have fun with the free avoid writing he had experience with it 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.709
 that could make me wonder more about the matchday with Le van Bo 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.520
 keep everyone involved 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.240
 the desert
