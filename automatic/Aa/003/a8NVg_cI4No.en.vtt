that<00:01:30.479> for<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.750> most<00:01:30.869> part<00:01:30.960> even<00:01:31.290> though<00:01:31.380> I've

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
that for the most part even though I've

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.780 
that for the most part even though I've
been<00:01:31.530> coming<00:01:31.860> up<00:01:32.040> against<00:01:32.369> players<00:01:32.549> like

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:30.909 
on the left rather than on the right a

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:32.760 
on the left rather than on the right a
lot<00:04:31.300> of<00:04:31.330> people<00:04:31.719> are<00:04:31.900> doing<00:04:32.139> that<00:04:32.289> as<00:04:32.620> I've

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
lot of people are doing that as I've

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.409

mentioned in my previous episodes I

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.179 
mentioned in my previous episodes I
think<00:04:34.659> it's<00:04:34.779> because<00:04:34.930> near<00:04:35.259> post<00:04:35.469> is<00:04:35.680> so<00:04:35.860> good

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:36.189 
think it's because near post is so good

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:39.029 
think it's because near post is so good
