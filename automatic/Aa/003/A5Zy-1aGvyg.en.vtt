antagonist and I love this shield it has

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.600 
antagonist and I love this shield it has
a<00:01:42.990> chance<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.409> deflect<00:01:43.740> enemy<00:01:44.100> bullets<00:01:44.430> with

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
a chance to deflect enemy bullets with

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.160 
a chance to deflect enemy bullets with
increased<00:01:45.000> damage<00:01:45.180> toward<00:01:45.570> nearby<00:01:45.840> enemies

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
increased damage toward nearby enemies

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.620 
increased damage toward nearby enemies
and<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.890> offers<00:01:47.189> high<00:01:47.460> damage<00:01:48.030> reduction<00:01:48.270> and

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
and it offers high damage reduction and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.200 
and it offers high damage reduction and
very<00:01:49.229> high<00:01:49.439> capacity<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:50.610> also<00:01:50.850> launches

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
very high capacity it also launches

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.969 
very high capacity it also launches
homing<00:01:51.540> balls<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.930> slag<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.200> its<00:01:52.500> attackers

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
homing balls of slag of its attackers

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.069 
homing balls of slag of its attackers
making<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.430> especially<00:01:53.729> useful<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.450> ultimate

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
making it especially useful for ultimate

vault hunter and beyond now the problem
with<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.149> shield<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:57.960> mainly

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
with this shield is that it's mainly

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.249 
with this shield is that it's mainly
useful<00:01:58.469> versus<00:01:58.979> bullet<00:01:59.310> based<00:01:59.490> enemies<00:01:59.909> and

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
useful versus bullet based enemies and

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.170 
useful versus bullet based enemies and
for<00:02:01.259> them<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.740> Sham<00:02:01.950> works<00:02:02.219> better<00:02:02.460> however

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
for them the Sham works better however

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.940 
for them the Sham works better however
this<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.930> those<00:02:04.079> Jack<00:02:04.409> ball<00:02:04.649> trade

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
this is one of those Jack ball trade

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.800 
this is one of those Jack ball trade
shields<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:06.060> could<00:02:06.210> essentially<00:02:06.540> wear

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
shields and you could essentially wear

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.630 
shields and you could essentially wear
this<00:02:06.960> for<00:02:07.200> pretty<00:02:07.409> much<00:02:07.500> any<00:02:07.799> situation<00:02:08.520> in

this for pretty much any situation in

this for pretty much any situation in

the game and survive pretty successfully

damage reduction this shield is supposed

damage reduction this shield is supposed
to<00:02:18.230> provide<00:02:18.560> massive<00:02:18.920> damage<00:02:19.460> reduction<00:02:19.730> when

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
to provide massive damage reduction when

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.900 
to provide massive damage reduction when
charged<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:20.870> less<00:02:21.230> when<00:02:21.470> damaged<00:02:21.920> but<00:02:22.610> in<00:02:22.760> its

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
charged and less when damaged but in its

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.520 
charged and less when damaged but in its
current<00:02:23.150> state<00:02:23.480> which<00:02:23.780> apparently<00:02:24.230> is<00:02:24.470> a

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
current state which apparently is a

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.280 
current state which apparently is a
glitch<00:02:24.770> somewhat<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.850> gives<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.180> flap<00:02:26.450> 38%

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
glitch somewhat it gives a flap 38%

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.500 
glitch somewhat it gives a flap 38%
damage<00:02:27.590> reduction<00:02:27.860> whether<00:02:28.550> it's<00:02:28.850> charged<00:02:29.270> or

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
damage reduction whether it's charged or

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.600 
damage reduction whether it's charged or
damaged<00:02:29.930> now<00:02:30.350> that's<00:02:30.560> nothing<00:02:30.770> to<00:02:31.100> scoff<00:02:31.340> at

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
damaged now that's nothing to scoff at

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.300 
damaged now that's nothing to scoff at
since<00:02:32.000> that<00:02:32.570> much<00:02:32.810> damage<00:02:33.140> reduction<00:02:33.890> can

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
since that much damage reduction can

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.130 
since that much damage reduction can
actually<00:02:34.730> keep<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.150> from<00:02:35.360> being<00:02:35.630> too<00:02:35.840> hit<00:02:35.990> in

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
actually keep you from being too hit in

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.930 
actually keep you from being too hit in
to<00:02:36.410> death<00:02:36.620> by<00:02:36.860> most<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.370> enemies<00:02:37.700> in<00:02:37.730> this

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
to death by most of the enemies in this

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.270 
to death by most of the enemies in this
game<00:02:38.210> which<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:38.870> kind<00:02:39.170> of<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.320> big<00:02:39.500> deal<00:02:39.680> in<00:02:39.830> op8

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
game which is kind of a big deal in op8

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.180 
game which is kind of a big deal in op8
so<00:02:41.110> this<00:02:42.110> is<00:02:42.320> another<00:02:42.560> one<00:02:42.770> of<00:02:42.800> those<00:02:42.920> shields

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
so this is another one of those shields

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.830 
so this is another one of those shields
that<00:02:43.370> can<00:02:43.610> be<00:02:43.730> useful<00:02:44.060> in<00:02:44.210> pretty<00:02:44.450> much<00:02:44.510> any

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
that can be useful in pretty much any

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.500 
that can be useful in pretty much any
given<00:02:45.170> situation<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:46.010> it's<00:02:46.790> my<00:02:47.030> default

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
given situation and it's my default

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.320 
given situation and it's my default
shield<00:02:47.870> when<00:02:48.080> I'm<00:02:48.170> using<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.590> gun<00:02:48.770> Zurcher

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.300 

number<00:02:53.330> one<00:02:53.570> is<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.410> B<00:02:54.710> shield<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.220> I'm

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
number one is the B shield and I'm

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.650 
number one is the B shield and I'm
probably<00:02:55.580> going<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:55.880> take<00:02:56.090> some<00:02:56.270> flack<00:02:56.480> for

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
probably going to take some flack for

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.300 
probably going to take some flack for
this<00:02:56.720> but<00:02:56.870> bear<00:02:57.290> in<00:02:57.380> mind<00:02:57.530> that<00:02:57.620> this<00:02:57.860> is<00:02:58.040> my

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
this but bear in mind that this is my

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.700 
this but bear in mind that this is my
top<00:02:58.670> five<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.150> not<00:02:59.270> indicative<00:02:59.600> if<00:03:00.020> any<00:03:00.410> kind

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
top five and not indicative if any kind

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.770 
top five and not indicative if any kind
of<00:03:00.830> math<00:03:01.070> or<00:03:01.340> any<00:03:01.640> sort<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.000> thorough<00:03:02.240> testing

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
of math or any sort of thorough testing

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.070 
of math or any sort of thorough testing
but<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:04.100> why<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.400> B<00:03:04.730> well<00:03:05.360> if<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:05.600> play<00:03:05.810> any

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
but so why the B well if you play any

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.380 
but so why the B well if you play any
other<00:03:06.320> FPS<00:03:07.010> games<00:03:07.310> in<00:03:07.520> your<00:03:07.640> life<00:03:07.940> then<00:03:08.240> you've

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
other FPS games in your life then you've

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.420 
other FPS games in your life then you've
probably<00:03:08.630> already<00:03:08.930> known<00:03:09.230> how<00:03:09.800> to<00:03:09.860> take<00:03:10.160> cover

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
probably already known how to take cover

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.010 
probably already known how to take cover
and<00:03:10.670> shoot<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.150> bad<00:03:11.330> guys<00:03:11.600> and<00:03:11.870> that's

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
and shoot a bad guys and that's

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.170 
and shoot a bad guys and that's
essentially<00:03:12.560> what<00:03:12.710> the<00:03:12.830> B<00:03:12.950> does<00:03:13.190> best<00:03:13.550> if<00:03:13.970> you

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
essentially what the B does best if you

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.300 
essentially what the B does best if you
can<00:03:14.300> avoid<00:03:14.420> taking<00:03:14.840> damage<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.800> this<00:03:15.980> shield

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
can avoid taking damage to this shield

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.250 
can avoid taking damage to this shield
then<00:03:16.850> it<00:03:17.000> will<00:03:17.120> give<00:03:17.270> you<00:03:17.420> a<00:03:17.450> massive<00:03:17.930> damage

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
then it will give you a massive damage

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.080 
then it will give you a massive damage
boost<00:03:18.500> on<00:03:18.710> all<00:03:18.890> of<00:03:19.160> your<00:03:19.250> shots<00:03:19.460> fired<00:03:19.820> and

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
boost on all of your shots fired and

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.300 
boost on all of your shots fired and
there<00:03:20.660> is<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.810> reason<00:03:21.380> that<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:21.680> shield<00:03:21.980> is<00:03:22.130> in

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
there is a reason that this shield is in

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.730 
there is a reason that this shield is in
everyone's<00:03:23.150> inventory<00:03:23.690> even<00:03:24.110> people<00:03:24.590> who

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
everyone's inventory even people who
