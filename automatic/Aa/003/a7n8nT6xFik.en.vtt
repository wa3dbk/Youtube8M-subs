your roll left to right that's the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.299 
your roll left to right that's the
relative<00:01:03.510> speeds<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> two<00:01:04.439> helicopter

it just won't go you actually need to

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.859 
it just won't go you actually need to

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
the RC Falcon takes a little bit of

the RC Falcon takes a little bit of
practice<00:01:54.840> at<00:01:55.200> first<00:01:55.470> actually<00:01:56.070> very<00:01:56.610> first

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
thing that it takes is trimming it out

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.190 
thing that it takes is trimming it out
you<00:01:59.430> first<00:01:59.700> take<00:01:59.909> off<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.329> probably<00:02:00.930> going

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
you first take off it's probably going

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.170 
you first take off it's probably going
to<00:02:01.380> spin<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.649> little<00:02:01.829> bit<00:02:02.009> it'll<00:02:02.430> probably<00:02:02.640> lean

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
to spin a little bit it'll probably lean

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.149 
to spin a little bit it'll probably lean
to<00:02:03.420> one<00:02:03.450> side<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.469> need<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.710> focus<00:02:04.860> on

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
to one side and you need to focus on

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.520 
to one side and you need to focus on
trimming<00:02:05.579> just<00:02:05.880> one<00:02:06.210> thing<00:02:06.570> at<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.899> time<00:02:06.990> if

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
trimming just one thing at a time if

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.139 
trimming just one thing at a time if
it's<00:02:08.129> leaning<00:02:08.729> off<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.360> one<00:02:09.539> side

it's leaning off to one side

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.940 
it's leaning off to one side
need<00:02:10.299> to<00:02:10.390> focus<00:02:10.689> on<00:02:10.810> that<00:02:10.959> rotor<00:02:11.290> trim<00:02:11.709> and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
need to focus on that rotor trim and

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.610 
need to focus on that rotor trim and
once<00:02:12.849> you've<00:02:13.000> got<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:13.959> that<00:02:14.110> it's<00:02:14.260> just

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
once you've got that so that it's just

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.190 
once you've got that so that it's just
pretty<00:02:15.370> much<00:02:15.519> hovering<00:02:16.299> in<00:02:16.450> one<00:02:16.659> place<00:02:16.959> and

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
pretty much hovering in one place and

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.740 
pretty much hovering in one place and
not<00:02:17.260> traveling<00:02:17.890> away<00:02:18.010> from<00:02:18.489> you<00:02:18.640> then<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.599> can

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
not traveling away from you then you can

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.470 
not traveling away from you then you can
adjust<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.610> steering<00:02:21.610> trim<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.209> make<00:02:22.329> sure

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
adjust the steering trim to make sure

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.449 
adjust the steering trim to make sure
that<00:02:22.659> it's<00:02:22.840> not<00:02:23.049> spinning<00:02:23.560> in<00:02:23.980> one<00:02:24.159> place

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
that it's not spinning in one place

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.089 
that it's not spinning in one place
after<00:02:25.420> that<00:02:25.689> the<00:02:26.049> next<00:02:26.170> thing<00:02:26.409> to<00:02:26.530> get<00:02:26.620> used<00:02:26.859> to

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
after that the next thing to get used to

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.220 
after that the next thing to get used to
is<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.609> throttle<00:02:27.939> control<00:02:28.209> it's<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:28.989> little

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
is the throttle control it's a little

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.690 
is the throttle control it's a little
bit<00:02:29.349> twitchy<00:02:29.739> it's<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.099> little<00:02:30.310> bit<00:02:30.430> sensitive

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
bit twitchy it's a little bit sensitive

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.910 
bit twitchy it's a little bit sensitive
they're<00:02:31.569> seeing<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:32.049> little<00:02:32.319> bit<00:02:32.439> of<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.650> dead

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
they're seeing a little bit of a dead

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.550 
they're seeing a little bit of a dead
area<00:02:33.370> towards<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:34.030> bottom<00:02:34.269> and<00:02:34.599> then<00:02:35.349> all<00:02:35.530> of

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
area towards the bottom and then all of

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.259 
area towards the bottom and then all of
a<00:02:35.680> sudden<00:02:35.709> it'll<00:02:36.099> just<00:02:36.400> kick<00:02:36.609> in<00:02:36.819> and<00:02:37.030> give<00:02:37.150> you

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
a sudden it'll just kick in and give you

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.699 
a sudden it'll just kick in and give you
a<00:02:37.299> ton<00:02:37.659> of<00:02:37.689> throttle<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.319> want<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.590> go

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
a ton of throttle and want to go

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.800 
a ton of throttle and want to go
straight<00:02:39.010> up<00:02:39.189> to<00:02:39.220> this<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:39.939> ceiling<00:02:40.329> so

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
straight up to this to the ceiling so

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.020 
straight up to this to the ceiling so
your<00:02:41.260> first<00:02:41.530> few<00:02:41.859> flights<00:02:42.099> you<00:02:42.430> will<00:02:42.639> want<00:02:42.940> to

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
your first few flights you will want to

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.750 
your first few flights you will want to
focus<00:02:43.540> on<00:02:43.720> not<00:02:44.680> steering<00:02:45.250> it<00:02:45.370> too<00:02:45.519> much<00:02:45.700> just

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
focus on not steering it too much just

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.199 
focus on not steering it too much just
get<00:02:46.599> that<00:02:46.810> up<00:02:47.079> and<00:02:47.230> down<00:02:47.500> control<00:02:48.069> to<00:02:49.060> be

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
get that up and down control to be

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.059 
get that up and down control to be
comfortable<00:02:49.720> for<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.170> make<00:02:50.500> sure<00:02:50.530> that<00:02:50.680> you

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
comfortable for you make sure that you

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.280 
comfortable for you make sure that you
find<00:02:51.310> that<00:02:51.609> range<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.239> it<00:02:52.629> really<00:02:52.810> likes<00:02:53.079> to

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
find that range that it really likes to

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.170 
find that range that it really likes to
be<00:02:53.319> flown<00:02:53.709> in<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.400> then<00:02:54.519> once<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:54.819> get<00:02:54.939> that

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
be flown in and then once you get that

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.129 
be flown in and then once you get that
focus<00:02:55.510> on<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.109> steering<00:02:56.709> steering<00:02:57.489> also<00:02:58.209> is<00:02:58.629> a

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
focus on the steering steering also is a

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.640 
focus on the steering steering also is a
little<00:02:59.439> bit<00:02:59.560> wonky<00:02:59.739> it<00:03:00.400> has<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:01.720> much<00:03:02.109> of<00:03:02.470> a

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
little bit wonky it has so much of a

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.099 
little bit wonky it has so much of a
tendency<00:03:02.889> to<00:03:03.280> try<00:03:03.579> to<00:03:03.609> stabilize<00:03:04.420> itself<00:03:04.840> and

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
tendency to try to stabilize itself and

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.610 
tendency to try to stabilize itself and
keep<00:03:05.739> it<00:03:05.980> itself<00:03:06.430> from<00:03:06.970> from<00:03:07.930> turning<00:03:08.349> or<00:03:08.439> from

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
keep it itself from from turning or from

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.890 
keep it itself from from turning or from

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
moving in any direction that if you try

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.229

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
to steer too hard or too or too quickly

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.240 
to steer too hard or too or too quickly
it'll<00:03:13.900> start<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.260> fight<00:03:14.500> itself<00:03:14.769> it'll<00:03:15.040> start

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
it'll start to fight itself it'll start

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.300 
it'll start to fight itself it'll start
to<00:03:15.280> wave<00:03:15.669> back<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.239> forth<00:03:16.540> as<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.310> multiple

bars on those rotors are actually trying

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.470 
bars on those rotors are actually trying

to keep you going straight and keep you

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.979 
to keep you going straight and keep you
completely<00:03:26.290> stable<00:03:26.980> so<00:03:27.609> you<00:03:27.909> have<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.329> steer

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
completely stable so you have to steer

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.379 
completely stable so you have to steer
very<00:03:29.440> slowly<00:03:29.859> but<00:03:30.159> once<00:03:30.489> you<00:03:30.639> get<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.909> all<00:03:31.120> down

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
very slowly but once you get it all down

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.270 
very slowly but once you get it all down
once<00:03:31.690> you<00:03:31.750> get<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:31.959> all<00:03:32.019> figured<00:03:32.260> out<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.949> flies

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
once you get it all figured out it flies

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.909 
once you get it all figured out it flies
very<00:03:33.489> very<00:03:34.299> nice<00:03:34.629> and<00:03:34.930> smoothly<00:03:35.260> you<00:03:35.620> can

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 
very very nice and smoothly you can

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.430 
very very nice and smoothly you can
actually<00:03:36.069> fly<00:03:37.000> it<00:03:37.060> without<00:03:37.449> having<00:03:37.690> your

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
actually fly it without having your

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.699 
actually fly it without having your
hands<00:03:39.069> on<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.459> controller<00:03:39.819> for<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.150> little<00:03:40.359> bit

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
hands on the controller for a little bit

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.050 
hands on the controller for a little bit
just<00:03:41.709> to<00:03:41.769> just<00:03:42.280> kind<00:03:42.489> of<00:03:42.549> balance<00:03:42.790> the

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
just to just kind of balance the

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.000 
just to just kind of balance the
throttle<00:03:43.540> where<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:43.780> needs<00:03:43.959> to<00:03:44.079> be<00:03:44.169> and<00:03:44.769> just

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
throttle where it needs to be and just

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.830 
throttle where it needs to be and just
follow<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:45.430> around<00:03:45.549> it's<00:03:46.239> always<00:03:46.569> going<00:03:46.750> to

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
follow it around it's always going to

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.349 
follow it around it's always going to
move<00:03:47.049> forward<00:03:47.560> very<00:03:48.040> slowly<00:03:48.489> just<00:03:48.669> a<00:03:49.090> little

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
move forward very slowly just a little

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:50.969 
move forward very slowly just a little
bit<00:03:49.569> that's<00:03:49.810> just<00:03:49.930> built<00:03:50.319> in<00:03:50.530> because<00:03:50.859> it

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:50.979 
bit that's just built in because it

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.789 
bit that's just built in because it
doesn't<00:03:51.280> have<00:03:51.959> controls<00:03:52.959> on<00:03:53.199> the<00:03:53.470> controller

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
doesn't have controls on the controller

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.800 
doesn't have controls on the controller
to<00:03:54.040> go<00:03:54.159> forward<00:03:54.669> or<00:03:54.819> reverse<00:03:54.970> what<00:03:55.540> I'm<00:03:55.629> doing

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
to go forward or reverse what I'm doing

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.210 
to go forward or reverse what I'm doing
right<00:03:55.930> here<00:03:55.989> is<00:03:56.139> just<00:03:56.349> showing<00:03:56.530> you<00:03:56.680> how<00:03:56.859> fast

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
right here is just showing you how fast

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.000 
right here is just showing you how fast
it<00:03:57.940> will<00:03:58.060> spin<00:03:58.419> in<00:03:58.569> one<00:03:58.720> place<00:03:58.989> you<00:03:59.500> saw<00:03:59.650> one

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
it will spin in one place you saw one

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.219 
it will spin in one place you saw one
point<00:04:00.340> where<00:04:00.549> it<00:04:00.639> actually<00:04:00.970> kind<00:04:01.150> of<00:04:01.180> fell<00:04:01.930> out

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:02.229 
point where it actually kind of fell out

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:04.080 
point where it actually kind of fell out
of<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.530> sky<00:04:02.739> that's<00:04:03.400> because<00:04:03.669> this<00:04:03.790> is<00:04:03.940> an

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
of the sky that's because this is an

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.330 
of the sky that's because this is an
infrared<00:04:04.629> controller<00:04:05.530> you<00:04:05.769> actually<00:04:06.099> have<00:04:06.220> to

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
infrared controller you actually have to

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.839 
infrared controller you actually have to
point<00:04:06.579> directly<00:04:07.030> at<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:08.019> craft<00:04:08.349> also<00:04:09.280> you<00:04:09.519> do

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
point directly at the craft also you do

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.409 
point directly at the craft also you do
have<00:04:09.879> to<00:04:10.209> fly<00:04:10.449> it<00:04:10.510> indoors<00:04:11.139> because<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.829> Sun

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
have to fly it indoors because the Sun

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:16.500 
have to fly it indoors because the Sun
tosses<00:04:13.419> around<00:04:13.690> too<00:04:13.930> many<00:04:14.079> infrared<00:04:14.829> rays<00:04:15.370> and

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
tosses around too many infrared rays and

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.870 
tosses around too many infrared rays and
just<00:04:16.780> confuse<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.950> poor<00:04:18.160> little<00:04:18.490> controller

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
just confuse the poor little controller

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.210 
just confuse the poor little controller
on<00:04:19.120> there<00:04:19.360> but<00:04:20.110> once<00:04:20.590> you<00:04:20.680> get<00:04:20.800> it<00:04:20.980> trimmed

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
on there but once you get it trimmed

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.760 
on there but once you get it trimmed
once<00:04:21.820> you<00:04:21.970> get<00:04:22.240> gotten<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.840> controls<00:04:23.350> figured

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
once you get gotten the controls figured

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.290 
once you get gotten the controls figured
out<00:04:23.860> you're<00:04:24.070> comfortable<00:04:24.520> with<00:04:24.850> them<00:04:25.060> and

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
out you're comfortable with them and

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.260 
out you're comfortable with them and
you're<00:04:25.900> patient<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:26.680> slow<00:04:27.550> moving<00:04:27.790> with<00:04:28.150> the

you're patient and slow moving with the
