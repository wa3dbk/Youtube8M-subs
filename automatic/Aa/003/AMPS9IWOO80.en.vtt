gets<00:01:32.820> deactivated<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:34.020> guys<00:01:34.200> I'd<00:01:34.439> say<00:01:34.590> this

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
gets deactivated so guys I'd say this

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.380 
gets deactivated so guys I'd say this
one's<00:01:35.009> plausible<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.759> you'll<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
one's plausible and you'll see it in the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.420 
one's plausible and you'll see it in the
video<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.960> hit<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> building<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.979> after<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.369> I

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
video I hit a building and after that I

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.870 
video I hit a building and after that I
keep<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.000> Skyfall<00:01:39.810> motion<00:01:40.530> thing<00:01:41.070> formation

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
keep the Skyfall motion thing formation

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.090 
keep the Skyfall motion thing formation
and<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.229> open<00:01:43.470> your<00:01:43.560> parachute<00:01:43.770> and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
and you can just open your parachute and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.249 
and you can just open your parachute and
it<00:01:44.220> comes<00:01:44.460> out<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.640> nowhere<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.180> i<00:01:46.020> actually

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
it comes out of nowhere and i actually

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.410 
it comes out of nowhere and i actually
do<00:01:46.890> open<00:01:47.250> my<00:01:47.369> parachute<00:01:47.549> while<00:01:47.880> sky<00:01:48.149> falling

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
do open my parachute while sky falling

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.679 
do open my parachute while sky falling
but<00:01:48.750> i<00:01:48.899> actually<00:01:49.259> also<00:01:49.829> use<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.700> right<00:01:51.060> after<00:01:51.420> I

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
but i actually also use it right after I

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.330 
but i actually also use it right after I
Skyfall<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.470> that's<00:01:52.649> why<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> want<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.189> make

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
Skyfall so that's why I want to make

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.100 
Skyfall so that's why I want to make
this<00:01:53.490> one<00:01:53.700> applause<00:01:53.939> well<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.329> think<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.899> is

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
this one applause well I think this is

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.719 
this one applause well I think this is
the<00:01:55.259> first<00:01:55.290> plausible<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> midwestern

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the first plausible in the midwestern

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.969 
the first plausible in the midwestern
f-series<00:01:57.119> Adam<00:01:57.719> always<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.140> second<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
f-series Adam always a second and the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.100 
f-series Adam always a second and the
last<00:01:59.189> myth<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.790> can<00:02:00.000> use<00:02:00.149> special<00:02:00.600> abilities

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
last myth you can use special abilities

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.050 
last myth you can use special abilities
while<00:02:01.290> sky<00:02:01.649> falling<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.369> tried<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.909> with

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
while sky falling so I tried this with

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.030 
while sky falling so I tried this with
all<00:02:03.299> three<00:02:03.600> characters<00:02:04.200> there's<00:02:04.649> one<00:02:04.860> thing

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
all three characters there's one thing

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.679 
all three characters there's one thing
with<00:02:05.280> Franklin<00:02:05.820> though<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.270> only<00:02:06.420> use<00:02:06.659> a

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
with Franklin though you can only use a

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.719 
with Franklin though you can only use a
special<00:02:07.229> ability<00:02:07.680> while<00:02:07.860> being<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.429> vehicle

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
special ability while being in a vehicle

special ability while being in a vehicle
in<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.119> bike<00:02:09.390> or

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
bike or in a car but you cannot use this

bike or in a car but you cannot use this
guy<00:02:12.530> felt<00:02:12.830> cheap<00:02:13.040> well<00:02:13.400> being<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.910> car<00:02:14.150> or<00:02:14.300> on

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
a bite so Franklin's one's busted then

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.550 
a bite so Franklin's one's busted then
you<00:02:16.940> have<00:02:17.030> my<00:02:17.269> clone<00:02:17.540> Trevor<00:02:17.930> lift<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:18.379> what<00:02:18.530> I

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
you have my clone Trevor lift so what I

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.699 
you have my clone Trevor lift so what I
did<00:02:18.680> was<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.519> use<00:02:20.209> Michael<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.989> then<00:02:21.110> use<00:02:21.680> your

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
special ability and then after that I

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.350 
special ability and then after that I
used<00:02:23.989> to<00:02:24.080> cheat<00:02:24.379> but<00:02:25.010> welding<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.879> scaffold

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
used to cheat but welding the scaffold

used to cheat but welding the scaffold
chief<00:02:26.569> is<00:02:26.750> special<00:02:27.140> ability<00:02:27.590> just

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
chief is special ability just

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.559 
chief is special ability just
disappeared<00:02:28.310> it<00:02:28.459> went<00:02:28.610> away<00:02:28.760> so<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:29.299> one's

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
disappeared it went away so this one's

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.420 
disappeared it went away so this one's
busted<00:02:29.660> too<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.590> last<00:02:30.709> one<00:02:31.040> trevor

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
busted too and the last one trevor

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.150 
busted too and the last one trevor
turner<00:02:31.610> this<00:02:32.269> is<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.450> bit<00:02:32.720> weird<00:02:32.959> because<00:02:33.470> you

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
turner this is a bit weird because you

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.520 
turner this is a bit weird because you
cannot<00:02:34.459> use<00:02:34.849> the<00:02:35.030> sky<00:02:35.239> feel<00:02:35.450> cheated<00:02:35.690> having

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
cannot use the sky feel cheated having

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.259 
cannot use the sky feel cheated having
the<00:02:36.650> exact<00:02:36.950> same<00:02:37.160> thing<00:02:37.459> as<00:02:37.640> with<00:02:37.819> michael

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
the exact same thing as with michael

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.330 
the exact same thing as with michael
your<00:02:38.510> special<00:02:39.230> ability<00:02:39.290> will<00:02:39.739> disappear<00:02:40.190> as

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
your special ability will disappear as

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.880 
your special ability will disappear as
soon<00:02:40.370> as<00:02:40.879> the<00:02:41.000> Skyfall<00:02:41.480> cheat<00:02:41.690> starts<00:02:42.260> but

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
soon as the Skyfall cheat starts but

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.610 
soon as the Skyfall cheat starts but
let's<00:02:43.340> say<00:02:43.579> you<00:02:43.610> hit<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.239> building<00:02:44.569> and<00:02:45.290> you

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
let's say you hit a building and you

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.380 
let's say you hit a building and you
accidentally<00:02:46.160> fall<00:02:46.190> off<00:02:46.579> or<00:02:46.790> you<00:02:46.880> have<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.209> get

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
accidentally fall off or you have to get

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.610 
accidentally fall off or you have to get
off<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.870> don't<00:02:48.049> want<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.319> use<00:02:48.470> the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
off and you don't want to use the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.140 
off and you don't want to use the
cheating<00:02:49.040> or<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.250> don't<00:02:49.519> have<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.700> parachute

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
cheating or you don't have a parachute

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.750 
cheating or you don't have a parachute
then<00:02:50.989> you<00:02:51.170> should<00:02:51.530> be<00:02:51.709> able<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:52.190> use<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.430> sky

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
then you should be able to use a sky

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.490 
then you should be able to use a sky
full<00:02:52.940> cheat<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.360> you'll<00:02:53.480> see<00:02:53.630> that<00:02:53.660> too<00:02:54.110> so

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
full cheat and you'll see that too so

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.860 
full cheat and you'll see that too so
I'd<00:02:54.680> say<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:55.129> one's<00:02:55.370> plausible<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:56.299> in<00:02:56.599> some

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
I'd say this one's plausible to in some

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.690 
I'd say this one's plausible to in some
circumstances<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:57.709> can<00:02:57.980> use<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:58.220> bitch<00:02:58.519> you

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
circumstances you can use it bitch you

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.089 
circumstances you can use it bitch you
cannot<00:02:59.269> use<00:02:59.629> it<00:02:59.810> while<00:03:00.049> doing<00:03:00.349> this<00:03:00.620> guy<00:03:00.860> phone

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
cannot use it while doing this guy phone

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.009 
cannot use it while doing this guy phone
cheap<00:03:01.340> it's<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.730> plausible<00:03:02.000> going<00:03:02.660> towards

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
cheap it's a plausible going towards

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.559 
cheap it's a plausible going towards
busted<00:03:03.739> but<00:03:03.980> we<00:03:04.129> already<00:03:04.310> two<00:03:04.730> buses<00:03:05.120> I'd<00:03:05.360> say

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
busted but we already two buses I'd say

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.509 
busted but we already two buses I'd say
this<00:03:05.720> once<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.319> we<00:03:06.530> have<00:03:06.680> two<00:03:06.829> Possible's<00:03:07.370> in
