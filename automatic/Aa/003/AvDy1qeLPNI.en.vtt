00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
looks like this this one's pretty bright

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.550 
looks like this this one's pretty bright
and<00:01:40.939> I<00:01:41.000> probably<00:01:41.209> would<00:01:41.720> wear<00:01:41.929> lips<00:01:42.200> liner

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
and I probably would wear lips liner

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.460 
and I probably would wear lips liner
with<00:01:42.799> this<00:01:42.950> one<00:01:43.130> there's<00:01:43.369> touchable<00:01:43.729> taupe

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.410 

the<00:01:48.470> next<00:01:48.890> is<00:01:49.009> from<00:01:49.310> this<00:01:49.549> brown<00:01:49.849> line<00:01:49.880> so<00:01:50.390> I

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
the next is from this brown line so I

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.300 
the next is from this brown line so I
think<00:01:50.599> this<00:01:50.869> discontinued<00:01:51.649> but<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:52.039> dig

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
think this discontinued but you dig

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.620 
think this discontinued but you dig
through<00:01:52.459> your<00:01:52.490> stash<00:01:52.849> and<00:01:53.119> see<00:01:53.270> if<00:01:53.330> you<00:01:53.420> have

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
through your stash and see if you have

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.589 
through your stash and see if you have
it<00:01:53.770> but<00:01:54.770> this<00:01:54.920> one's<00:01:55.189> called<00:01:55.459> toffee<00:01:56.060> Tango

00:01:58.589 --> 00:01:58.599 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:04.100 

looks<00:01:59.599> like<00:01:59.780> that

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.020 

this<00:02:04.620> is<00:02:04.740> happy<00:02:05.010> tango<00:02:05.370> it<00:02:05.490> does<00:02:05.700> have

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
this is happy tango it does have

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.820 
this is happy tango it does have
somewhat<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.600> shimmer<00:02:06.870> to<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.560> not

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
somewhat of a shimmer to it it's not

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.609 
somewhat of a shimmer to it it's not
glittery<00:02:08.340> but<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.910> shimmery<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:10.080> typically

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
glittery but it is shimmery so typically

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.880 
glittery but it is shimmery so typically
I<00:02:10.710> don't<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:12.180> shimmer<00:02:13.020> lips<00:02:13.290> but<00:02:13.830> I

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
I don't like the shimmer lips but I

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.740 
I don't like the shimmer lips but I
think<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.280> actually<00:02:14.490> is<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.880> nice<00:02:15.120> summer

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
think this actually is a nice summer

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.510 
think this actually is a nice summer
shimmer<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.320> you<00:02:16.410> can<00:02:16.530> actually<00:02:16.680> use<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.220> gloss

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
shimmer and you can actually use a gloss
