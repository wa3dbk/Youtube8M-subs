this is quite believable that you could

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.359 
this is quite believable that you could
have<00:01:18.969> people<00:01:19.600> like<00:01:19.719> who<00:01:20.409> we<00:01:20.560> were<00:01:20.770> coming<00:01:21.250> in

have people like who we were coming in

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.109 
have people like who we were coming in
and<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.990> Malloys<00:01:23.229> taken<00:01:23.799> over<00:01:24.159> this<00:01:24.520> fat<00:01:24.880> from

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
and the Malloys taken over this fat from

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.940 
and the Malloys taken over this fat from
this<00:01:25.270> family<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:26.439> know<00:01:26.469> we<00:01:26.649> weren't<00:01:26.799> the

this family and you know we weren't the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.920 
this family and you know we weren't the
same<00:01:27.070> family<00:01:27.460> so<00:01:27.579> some<00:01:28.539> people<00:01:28.750> find<00:01:28.840> that

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:46.109 
matter our story was a little better we
only<00:01:43.509> killed<00:01:43.810> people<00:01:44.140> who<00:01:44.619> were<00:01:45.520> already<00:01:45.700> dead

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
only killed people who were already dead

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.090 
only killed people who were already dead
I<00:01:46.359> think<00:01:47.109> so<00:01:47.499> we<00:01:47.590> didn't<00:01:47.740> actually<00:01:47.829> kill<00:01:48.039> me

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
I think so we didn't actually kill me

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.800 
I think so we didn't actually kill me
