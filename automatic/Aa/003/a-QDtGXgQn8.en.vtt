gamer<00:01:56.570> glam<00:01:56.930> here<00:01:57.229> at<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.439> end<00:01:57.619> and<00:01:58.240> then

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
gamer glam here at the end and then

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.270 
gamer glam here at the end and then
turning<00:01:59.570> it<00:01:59.750> so<00:01:59.930> that<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.170> gamer<00:02:00.350> glam<00:02:00.649> is<00:02:00.890> at

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
turning it so that the gamer glam is at

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.840 
turning it so that the gamer glam is at
the<00:02:01.670> bottom<00:02:02.119> I<00:02:02.659> just<00:02:03.380> go<00:02:03.560> ahead<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:03.829> tap<00:02:04.490> over

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
the bottom I just go ahead and tap over

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:13.230 
the bottom I just go ahead and tap over
it<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:06.770> get<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:07.159> good<00:02:09.369> gradient

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.120 

okay<00:02:14.290> then<00:02:15.290> I'm<00:02:15.410> going<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.620> do<00:02:15.709> that<00:02:15.860> with<00:02:16.010> the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
okay then I'm going to do that with the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.460 
okay then I'm going to do that with the
rest<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.490> my<00:02:16.640> nails<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.090> I'll<00:02:17.690> come<00:02:17.900> back<00:02:17.930> and

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
rest of my nails and I'll come back and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.580 
rest of my nails and I'll come back and
we'll<00:02:18.830> do<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.069> next<00:02:19.220> step<00:02:19.959> ok<00:02:20.959> so<00:02:21.020> here<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:21.560> is

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
we'll do the next step ok so here it is

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.850 
we'll do the next step ok so here it is
with<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.100> gradient<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:23.110> we<00:02:24.110> are<00:02:24.290> ready<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.650> do

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
with the gradient and we are ready to do

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.010 
with the gradient and we are ready to do
stamping<00:02:25.370> so<00:02:25.730> we<00:02:25.910> are<00:02:26.060> going<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.270> use<00:02:26.300> bundle

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
stamping so we are going to use bundle

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.040 
stamping so we are going to use bundle
monster<00:02:27.140> plate<00:02:27.770> number<00:02:28.070> five<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:29.050> we're

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
monster plate number five and we're

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.210 
monster plate number five and we're
going<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.200> use<00:02:30.380> this<00:02:31.240> design<00:02:32.240> right<00:02:32.480> here<00:02:32.540> and

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
going to use this design right here and

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.260 
going to use this design right here and
we're<00:02:34.220> going<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.400> use<00:02:34.520> Sally<00:02:34.790> Hansen

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
we're going to use Sally Hansen

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.310 
we're going to use Sally Hansen
insta-dry<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:36.200> whirlwind<00:02:36.680> white<00:02:38.170> so<00:02:39.170> I'm

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
insta-dry and whirlwind white so I'm

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.860 
insta-dry and whirlwind white so I'm
going<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.530> add<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.890> white<00:02:41.319> scrape<00:02:42.319> it<00:02:42.500> off<00:02:42.620> I

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
going to add the white scrape it off I

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.270 
going to add the white scrape it off I
guess<00:02:44.870> I<00:02:44.959> can<00:02:45.110> pick<00:02:45.320> this<00:02:45.440> one<00:02:45.620> up<00:02:45.680> up<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:46.040> small

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
guess I can pick this one up up a small

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.570 
guess I can pick this one up up a small
under<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.610> Stamper<00:02:47.150> get<00:02:48.080> out<00:02:48.230> there<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:48.920> then

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
under the Stamper get out there and then

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.690 
under the Stamper get out there and then
that<00:02:49.700> way<00:02:49.880> I<00:02:49.910> can<00:02:50.150> have<00:02:50.390> better<00:02:51.400> ease<00:02:52.400> of

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
that way I can have better ease of

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.520 
that way I can have better ease of
placement<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:53.630> what<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:53.810> want<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.110> do<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.410> I<00:02:54.500> want

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
placement so what I want to do is I want

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.560 
placement so what I want to do is I want
to<00:02:54.739> put<00:02:55.160> this<00:02:55.370> so<00:02:55.640> that<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:56.090> base<00:02:56.540> of<00:02:56.920> this

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
to put this so that the base of this

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.930 
to put this so that the base of this
flower<00:02:59.570> or<00:02:59.870> leafy<00:03:00.260> pattern<00:03:00.680> goes<00:03:00.920> on<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.640> very

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
flower or leafy pattern goes on the very

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.449 
flower or leafy pattern goes on the very
base<00:03:02.390> of<00:03:02.420> my<00:03:02.870> nail<00:03:03.080> so<00:03:03.769> I'm<00:03:03.830> going<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:04.010> press<00:03:04.250> it

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
is clean up a little bit around the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.800 
is clean up a little bit around the
cuticle<00:03:20.200> just<00:03:21.200> see<00:03:21.350> you<00:03:21.410> better<00:03:22.390> look<00:03:23.390> at<00:03:23.600> what

they're okay and then i'm going to go

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.449 
they're okay and then i'm going to go
ahead<00:03:29.600> and<00:03:30.079> stamp<00:03:30.350> that<00:03:30.560> over<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:30.950> rest<00:03:31.160> of<00:03:31.310> my

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
ahead and stamp that over the rest of my

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.610 
ahead and stamp that over the rest of my
nails<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:32.000> I'll<00:03:32.269> be<00:03:32.390> right<00:03:32.570> back<00:03:34.720> ok<00:03:35.720> so<00:03:36.170> here

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
nails and I'll be right back ok so here

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.370 
nails and I'll be right back ok so here
it<00:03:36.739> is<00:03:36.890> with<00:03:37.579> all<00:03:37.940> of<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.299> stamping<00:03:38.780> on<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:39.140> and

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
it is with all of the stamping on it and

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.870 
it is with all of the stamping on it and
I've<00:03:39.470> cleaned<00:03:39.709> up<00:03:39.799> around<00:03:39.950> my<00:03:40.190> cuticles<00:03:40.700> and

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
I've cleaned up around my cuticles and

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.580 
I've cleaned up around my cuticles and
actually<00:03:41.780> I<00:03:41.810> think<00:03:41.900> it's<00:03:42.110> going<00:03:42.320> to<00:03:42.380> look

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
actually I think it's going to look

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.920 
actually I think it's going to look
better<00:03:42.799> even<00:03:43.400> because<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.209> white<00:03:44.510> almost

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
better even because the white almost

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.870 
better even because the white almost
looks<00:03:45.200> really<00:03:45.500> flat<00:03:45.860> but<00:03:45.890> I<00:03:46.280> think<00:03:46.549> once<00:03:46.760> we

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
looks really flat but I think once we

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.460 
looks really flat but I think once we
get<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.180> top<00:03:47.390> go<00:03:47.570> down<00:03:47.600> there<00:03:47.959> it's<00:03:48.170> going<00:03:48.350> to

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
get the top go down there it's going to

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.100 
get the top go down there it's going to
just<00:03:48.650> really<00:03:49.400> really<00:03:50.030> add<00:03:50.299> something<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:50.900> it

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
just really really add something to it

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.979 
just really really add something to it
so<00:03:51.980> let's<00:03:52.190> go<00:03:52.370> ahead<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.610> put<00:03:53.030> some<00:03:53.269> such<00:03:53.750> beat

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
so let's go ahead and put some such beat

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.890 
so let's go ahead and put some such beat
over<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:55.030> images<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:56.420> see<00:03:56.660> how<00:03:57.200> it<00:03:57.410> goes<00:03:57.440> oh

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
over the images and see how it goes oh

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.110 
over the images and see how it goes oh
yeah<00:03:59.900> see<00:04:00.410> that's<00:04:00.560> such<00:04:00.860> a<00:04:00.890> huge<00:04:01.190> it<00:04:01.370> I<00:04:01.820> don't

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
yeah see that's such a huge it I don't

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.220 
yeah see that's such a huge it I don't
know<00:04:02.239> if<00:04:02.329> you<00:04:02.420> can<00:04:02.570> tell<00:04:02.690> on<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:02.900> camera<00:04:03.200> but

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
know if you can tell on the camera but

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.850
