00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the wind-up thing I don't know why these

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.299 
the wind-up thing I don't know why these
numbers<00:00:29.220> say<00:00:29.550> 1<00:00:30.230> through<00:00:31.230> 16<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:32.099> really

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
numbers say 1 through 16 that really

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.340 
numbers say 1 through 16 that really
makes<00:00:32.520> nothing<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.940> old<00:00:33.120> TV<00:00:33.809> channels<00:00:34.200> of

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
makes nothing to old TV channels of

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.150 
makes nothing to old TV channels of
course<00:00:34.530> but<00:00:35.340> um<00:00:36.350> it<00:00:37.350> would<00:00:37.440> only<00:00:37.530> go<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.770> 13<00:00:38.129> I

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
course but um it would only go to 13 I

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.720 
course but um it would only go to 13 I
think<00:00:38.280> 16<00:00:39.180> most<00:00:39.840> channels<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.550> UHF<00:00:41.550> and

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
think 16 most channels you have UHF and

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.569 
think 16 most channels you have UHF and
VHF<00:00:41.760> UHF<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.719> 2<00:00:43.500> through<00:00:44.010> 13<00:00:44.270> and<00:00:46.280> UHF<00:00:47.280> would<00:00:47.460> be

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
VHF UHF is 2 through 13 and UHF would be

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.520 
VHF UHF is 2 through 13 and UHF would be
14<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.360> 125<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.590> believe<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:51.170> yeah<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.350> is

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
14 to 125 I believe so but yeah this is

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.709 
14 to 125 I believe so but yeah this is
a<00:00:52.559> really<00:00:52.980> cool<00:00:53.100> toy<00:00:53.309> missing<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> handle<00:00:54.629> but

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
a really cool toy missing the handle but

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.250
