unfortunately<00:01:01.800> there's<00:01:02.219> no<00:01:02.309> easy<00:01:02.579> way<00:01:02.699> within

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
unfortunately there's no easy way within

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.719 
unfortunately there's no easy way within
PowerPoint<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.530> allows<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.369> save

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
PowerPoint and that allows you to save

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.940 
PowerPoint and that allows you to save
that<00:01:06.000> video<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.600> separate<00:01:07.200> file<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> movie

can<00:01:10.170> do<00:01:10.979> some<00:01:11.189> formatting<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:11.909> you

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
can do some formatting with it but you

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.539 
can do some formatting with it but you
cannot<00:01:12.330> save<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:13.159> however<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.280> there<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.520> a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
cannot save it however if there is a

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.520 
cannot save it however if there is a
simple<00:01:14.790> way<00:01:15.030> using<00:01:15.630> zip<00:01:15.900> files<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.290> allows

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
simple way using zip files that allows

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.870 
simple way using zip files that allows
you<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> first<00:01:17.460> thing<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.729> need

a<00:01:28.020> presentation<00:01:28.590> extract<00:01:29.060> pptx<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.530> I<00:01:31.530> want

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
a presentation extract pptx and I want

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.620 
a presentation extract pptx and I want
to<00:01:32.009> change<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.460> file<00:01:32.640> name<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.150> zip<00:01:33.420> file

to change the file name to a zip file

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.940 
to change the file name to a zip file
and<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.079> trick<00:01:34.320> should<00:01:34.470> work<00:01:34.650> by<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.860> way

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
and this trick should work by the way

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.999 
and this trick should work by the way
with<00:01:35.310> older<00:01:36.000> versions<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.650> PowerPoint<00:01:37.650> as

name<00:01:51.290> extension<00:01:51.830> might<00:01:52.010> cause<00:01:52.580> it<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.760> be

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
name extension might cause it to be

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.190 
name extension might cause it to be
unusable<00:01:53.330> but<00:01:53.450> we<00:01:53.660> know<00:01:53.780> what<00:01:53.900> we're<00:01:54.020> doing

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
unusable but we know what we're doing

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.770 
unusable but we know what we're doing
here<00:01:54.320> so<00:01:54.470> I'll<00:01:54.530> click<00:01:54.680> on<00:01:54.770> yes<00:01:55.040> and<00:01:55.570> we<00:01:56.570> can<00:01:56.690> now

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
here so I'll click on yes and we can now

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.930

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
changed to a zip file so now we if we

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.030 
changed to a zip file so now we if we
double<00:02:01.910> take<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.180> open<00:02:02.330> up<00:02:02.600> that<00:02:02.780> zip<00:02:02.990> file<00:02:03.200> we

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
double take and open up that zip file we

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.950 
double take and open up that zip file we
can<00:02:04.160> see<00:02:04.430> that<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:07.820> presentation<00:02:08.810> has
