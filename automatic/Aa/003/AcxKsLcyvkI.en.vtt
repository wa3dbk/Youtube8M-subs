strange<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:51.140> cool<00:00:51.860> to<00:00:52.580> be<00:00:52.700> part<00:00:52.730> of<00:00:52.970> the

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
strange and cool to be part of the

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.860 
strange and cool to be part of the
Marvel<00:00:53.360> Universe<00:00:53.739> but<00:00:55.000> to<00:00:56.000> put<00:00:56.210> on<00:00:56.329> that<00:00:56.540> suit

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
which by the way I think it's the

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.250 
which by the way I think it's the
coolest<00:00:58.250> looking<00:00:58.579> suit<00:00:58.970> of<00:00:59.090> all<00:00:59.270> of<00:00:59.480> them<00:00:59.630> it's

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
coolest looking suit of all of them it's

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.380 
coolest looking suit of all of them it's

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
impossible not to feel a little bit like

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.719 
impossible not to feel a little bit like

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.670 
and seeing this seeing you know familiar
areas<00:01:25.009> look<00:01:25.369> like<00:01:25.610> alien<00:01:26.119> landscapes<00:01:26.720> is<00:01:26.960> you

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
areas look like alien landscapes is you

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.469 
areas look like alien landscapes is you
know<00:01:27.770> a<00:01:27.800> huge<00:01:28.159> part<00:01:28.490> of<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.640> draw<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.180> it's<00:01:29.390> a

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
know a huge part of the draw and it's a

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.020 
know a huge part of the draw and it's a
lot<00:01:29.570> of<00:01:29.630> fun<00:01:29.780> but<00:01:30.229> in<00:01:30.500> addition<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.670> crazy

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
lot of fun but in addition to the crazy

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.719 
lot of fun but in addition to the crazy
visuals<00:01:32.420> I<00:01:32.810> think<00:01:33.080> that<00:01:33.260> it's<00:01:33.799> funny<00:01:34.070> it's

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
visuals I think that it's funny it's

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.880 
visuals I think that it's funny it's
heartfelt<00:01:35.150> I<00:01:35.780> think<00:01:36.260> the<00:01:36.380> characters<00:01:36.620> are

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
heartfelt I think the characters are

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.280 
heartfelt I think the characters are
easy<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:37.909> get<00:01:38.060> kind<00:01:38.330> of<00:01:38.360> caught<00:01:38.570> up<00:01:38.780> with<00:01:39.020> and

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
easy to get kind of caught up with and

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.200 
easy to get kind of caught up with and
caught<00:01:39.650> it<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:40.159> get<00:01:40.369> into<00:01:40.520> their<00:01:40.729> storyline

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
caught it and get into their storyline

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.870 
caught it and get into their storyline
so<00:01:41.540> hopefully<00:01:42.290> it<00:01:42.409> works<00:01:42.560> on<00:01:42.830> every<00:01:43.070> level<00:01:43.250> but

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
so hopefully it works on every level but

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.210 
so hopefully it works on every level but
they<00:01:44.000> make<00:01:44.180> such<00:01:44.540> good<00:01:44.680> films<00:01:45.680> and<00:01:45.920> my
