00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
rolling up and cutting it very very

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.580 
rolling up and cutting it very very
finely<00:02:43.160> into<00:02:43.640> relief<00:02:43.970> threads<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:45.200> reason<00:02:45.500> we

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
finely into relief threads the reason we

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.680 
finely into relief threads the reason we
do<00:02:45.800> this<00:02:45.830> is<00:02:46.280> because<00:02:46.489> basil<00:02:47.120> leaves<00:02:47.300> a<00:02:47.510> very

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
do this is because basil leaves a very

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.640 
do this is because basil leaves a very
delicate<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.410> they<00:02:48.640> bruise<00:02:49.640> fairly<00:02:50.180> easily

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
delicate and they bruise fairly easily

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.470 
delicate and they bruise fairly easily
and<00:02:51.650> this<00:02:51.890> way<00:02:52.070> it<00:02:52.100> prevents<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.030> bruising

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
and this way it prevents the bruising

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.380 
and this way it prevents the bruising
and<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:54.050> also<00:02:54.200> makes<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:54.890> look<00:02:55.430> pretty<00:02:55.910> which

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
and it also makes it look pretty which
