if probably our second biggest sport to

if probably our second biggest sport to
some<00:00:04.319> of<00:00:04.410> you<00:00:04.470> this<00:00:04.620> may<00:00:04.799> look<00:00:04.980> familiar<00:00:05.720> and

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
some of you this may look familiar and

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.600 
some of you this may look familiar and
that's<00:00:07.350> because<00:00:07.529> I've<00:00:07.770> done<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:07.980> lot<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.220> videos

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
that's because I've done a lot of videos

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.580 
that's because I've done a lot of videos
on<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:08.940> one<00:00:09.120> already<00:00:09.420> mainly<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.290> building

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
on this one already mainly the building

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.230 
on this one already mainly the building
process<00:00:10.769> but<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.219> looked<00:00:11.429> back<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.820> realized<00:00:11.940> I

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
process but I looked back and realized I

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.530 
process but I looked back and realized I
hadn't<00:00:12.570> done<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:13.250> comprehensive<00:00:14.250> overview<00:00:15.210> of

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
hadn't done a comprehensive overview of

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.140 
hadn't done a comprehensive overview of
it<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:16.340> I'm<00:00:17.340> pretty<00:00:17.520> sure<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:17.910> our

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
it and I'm pretty sure this is our

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.900 
it and I'm pretty sure this is our
second<00:00:18.600> biggest<00:00:18.750> sport<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.199> terms<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.910> the

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
second biggest sport in terms of the

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.120 
second biggest sport in terms of the
length<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.390> barrier<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.289> front<00:00:22.590> I'll

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
length of the barrier in the front I'll

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.279 
length of the barrier in the front I'll
put<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> link<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.240> description<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.050> an

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
put a link in the description and an

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.279 
put a link in the description and an

with this barrier I'll go around back to
explain<00:00:45.570> more<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.079> I'll<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.200> walk

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.600 
there start with the tower we started
off<00:01:53.820> with<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:55.080> tower<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.500> nothing<00:01:56.010> above<00:01:56.400> it

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
off with the tower and nothing above it

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.750 
off with the tower and nothing above it
no<00:01:57.560> barriers<00:01:58.560> or<00:01:58.680> anything<00:01:59.010> we<00:01:59.280> just<00:01:59.310> had<00:01:59.640> this

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
no barriers or anything we just had this

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.700 
no barriers or anything we just had this
bottom<00:02:00.180> part<00:02:00.330> with<00:02:00.510> a<00:02:00.540> roof<00:02:00.810> basically<00:02:01.470> and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
bottom part with a roof basically and

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.930 
bottom part with a roof basically and
then<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:02.010> became<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.340> floor<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
then that became the floor for the

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.710 
then that became the floor for the
second<00:02:03.300> level<00:02:04.520> this<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:06.090> wood<00:02:06.330> is<00:02:06.450> from

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
second level this is this wood is from

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.680 
second level this is this wood is from
wire<00:02:07.560> spools<00:02:08.010> that<00:02:08.820> we<00:02:08.910> destroyed<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.600> then

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
wire spools that we destroyed and then

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.020 
wire spools that we destroyed and then
took<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.140> inner<00:02:10.860> ring<00:02:11.250> out<00:02:11.460> and<00:02:11.730> then<00:02:11.850> use

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
took the inner ring out and then use

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.140 
took the inner ring out and then use
those<00:02:12.240> panels<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.500> make<00:02:13.830> this<00:02:13.980> wall<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.490> this

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
those panels to make this wall and this

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.630 
those panels to make this wall and this
wall<00:02:15.540> is<00:02:15.810> just<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.380> piece<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.590> plywood<00:02:16.890> with<00:02:17.610> a

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
wall is just a piece of plywood with a

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.850 
wall is just a piece of plywood with a
two-by-four<00:02:18.450> nailed<00:02:18.959> over<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.290> for<00:02:19.470> support

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
two-by-four nailed over it for support

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.949 
two-by-four nailed over it for support
we<00:02:20.670> used<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.850> have<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:20.970> metal<00:02:21.209> ladder<00:02:21.510> here<00:02:21.780> but

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
we used to have a metal ladder here but

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.110 
we used to have a metal ladder here but
we<00:02:22.020> ended<00:02:22.110> up<00:02:22.320> using<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.830> on<00:02:23.070> our<00:02:23.910> newest

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
we ended up using it on our newest

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.000 
we ended up using it on our newest
before<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.810> was<00:02:24.930> harder<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.290> attach<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.830> rope

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
before it was harder to attach a rope

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.250 
before it was harder to attach a rope
ladder<00:02:26.220> there<00:02:26.580> than<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.880> was<00:02:27.060> here<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.990> we<00:02:28.080> ended

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
ladder there than I was here so we ended

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.680 
ladder there than I was here so we ended
up<00:02:28.380> using<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:29.280> rope<00:02:29.430> ladder<00:02:29.640> here<00:02:30.060> sometimes

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
up using the rope ladder here sometimes

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.330 
up using the rope ladder here sometimes
it<00:02:30.840> can<00:02:30.959> be<00:02:30.989> a<00:02:31.080> bit<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.470> hassle<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:32.040> clamp

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
it can be a bit of a hassle to clamp

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.680 
it can be a bit of a hassle to clamp
there<00:02:32.550> especially<00:02:32.760> if<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.209> larger

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
there especially if you have a larger

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.260 
there especially if you have a larger
airsoft<00:02:34.170> gun<00:02:34.380> but<00:02:34.650> otherwise<00:02:35.310> it's<00:02:35.640> not<00:02:36.060> too

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
airsoft gun but otherwise it's not too

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.470 
airsoft gun but otherwise it's not too
bad<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.840> we<00:02:36.959> just<00:02:37.430> anchored<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:39.090> rope<00:02:39.270> ladder

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
bad and we just anchored the rope ladder

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.020 
bad and we just anchored the rope ladder
up<00:02:39.660> there<00:02:39.900> which<00:02:40.410> will<00:02:40.500> show<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.130> down

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
up there which will show you and down

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.690 
up there which will show you and down
here<00:02:42.360> we<00:02:42.390> just<00:02:42.660> wrapped<00:02:42.930> around<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.410> tree<00:02:43.700> in

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
here we just wrapped around the tree in

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.699 
here we just wrapped around the tree in
here<00:02:45.090> on<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.600> bottom<00:02:45.870> level<00:02:46.019> you<00:02:46.230> can<00:02:46.380> get<00:02:46.560> in

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
here on the bottom level you can get in

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.070 
here on the bottom level you can get in
and<00:02:47.280> look<00:02:47.519> out<00:02:47.670> pretty<00:02:48.239> well<00:02:48.360> protected<00:02:48.630> you

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
and look out pretty well protected you

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.110 
and look out pretty well protected you
still<00:02:49.290> have<00:02:49.380> some<00:02:49.500> room<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.709> duck<00:02:50.070> all<00:02:51.000> those

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
still have some room to duck all those

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.820 
still have some room to duck all those
pop<00:02:51.390> cans<00:02:51.630> are<00:02:51.810> there<00:02:51.930> just<00:02:52.170> because<00:02:52.290> we<00:02:52.680> use

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
pop cans are there just because we use

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.890 
pop cans are there just because we use
this<00:02:53.190> target<00:02:53.550> practice<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.090> just<00:02:54.269> threw

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
this target practice and I just threw

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.930 
this target practice and I just threw
them<00:02:54.959> in<00:02:55.080> there<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:55.950> calling<00:02:56.519> up<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.640> tower

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
them in there so calling up the tower

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.180 
them in there so calling up the tower
I'd<00:02:57.690> turned<00:02:58.500> off<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.739> counter<00:02:58.950> for<00:02:58.980> that

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
I'd turned off the counter for that

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.650 
I'd turned off the counter for that
because<00:02:59.519> there's<00:02:59.820> no<00:03:00.000> way<00:03:00.150> I'm<00:03:00.209> climbing

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
because there's no way I'm climbing

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.920 
because there's no way I'm climbing
one-handed<00:03:01.350> up<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.560> rope<00:03:01.709> ladder<00:03:02.690> but<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.780> can

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
one-handed up a rope ladder but you can

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.990 
one-handed up a rope ladder but you can
see<00:03:04.110> we<00:03:04.290> have<00:03:04.320> this<00:03:04.709> window<00:03:05.040> here<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.880> was

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
see we have this window here and it was

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.690 
see we have this window here and it was
pretty<00:03:06.239> open<00:03:06.690> for<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.959> while<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.519> didn't<00:03:08.519> like

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
pretty open for a while I didn't like

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.850 
pretty open for a while I didn't like
that<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:09.180> brought<00:03:09.600> this<00:03:10.110> board<00:03:10.440> up<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:10.769> you

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
that so I brought this board up so you

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.390 
that so I brought this board up so you
still<00:03:11.070> have<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.250> view<00:03:12.239> out<00:03:12.950> but<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.250> can

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
still have a view out but you can

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.720 
still have a view out but you can
retract<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:15.060> so<00:03:15.660> they<00:03:15.780> can<00:03:15.989> fit<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:16.860> gun<00:03:17.160> through

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
retract it so they can fit a gun through

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.790 
retract it so they can fit a gun through
the<00:03:18.090> bigger<00:03:18.300> opening<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:19.019> close<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.260> up<00:03:19.530> when

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
the bigger opening and close it up when

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.860 
the bigger opening and close it up when
you<00:03:19.890> get<00:03:19.980> shot<00:03:20.250> up<00:03:20.459> on<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.300> other<00:03:21.420> side<00:03:21.690> i'm

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
you get shot up on the other side i'm

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.990 
you get shot up on the other side i'm
thinking<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.320> leaving<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.739> just<00:03:22.920> open<00:03:23.340> because

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
thinking of leaving it just open because

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.670 
thinking of leaving it just open because
every<00:03:24.510> fort<00:03:24.810> i<00:03:24.959> think<00:03:25.170> should<00:03:25.290> have<00:03:25.500> its

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
every fort i think should have its

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.130 
every fort i think should have its
weakness<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:27.030> know<00:03:27.209> I<00:03:27.239> know<00:03:27.360> that<00:03:27.480> seems<00:03:27.780> kind

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
weakness you know I know that seems kind

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.979 
weakness you know I know that seems kind
of<00:03:28.200> stupid<00:03:28.800> I<00:03:29.220> don't<00:03:29.670> want<00:03:29.850> anyone<00:03:30.150> for<00:03:30.900> to

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
of stupid I don't want anyone for to

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.900 
of stupid I don't want anyone for to
have<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.140> particularly<00:03:31.830> unfair<00:03:32.430> advantage

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
have a particularly unfair advantage

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.300 
have a particularly unfair advantage
over<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.330> others<00:03:33.570> so<00:03:33.900> everyone<00:03:34.739> has<00:03:34.950> its<00:03:35.130> weak

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
over the others so everyone has its weak

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.350 
over the others so everyone has its weak
spot<00:03:35.579> and<00:03:35.609> then<00:03:35.850> this<00:03:36.510> one

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
spot and then this one

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.820 
spot and then this one
you<00:03:37.540> could<00:03:37.690> still<00:03:37.930> have<00:03:38.080> attackers<00:03:38.530> on<00:03:38.680> that

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
you could still have attackers on that

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.770 
you could still have attackers on that
side<00:03:39.070> and<00:03:39.100> you'd<00:03:39.310> be<00:03:39.430> open<00:03:39.610> you<00:03:40.150> can<00:03:40.480> still

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
side and you'd be open you can still

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.780 
side and you'd be open you can still
duck<00:03:40.960> down<00:03:41.200> easily<00:03:41.500> it's<00:03:41.800> just<00:03:42.040> you<00:03:42.670> would

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
duck down easily it's just you would

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.360 
duck down easily it's just you would
have<00:03:42.910> to<00:03:42.970> be<00:03:43.300> more<00:03:43.510> careful<00:03:44.100> standing<00:03:45.100> up<00:03:45.220> if

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
have to be more careful standing up if

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.710 
have to be more careful standing up if
someone<00:03:45.640> was<00:03:45.760> on<00:03:45.880> that<00:03:46.030> side<00:03:46.270> so<00:03:46.480> you're<00:03:46.600> not

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
someone was on that side so you're not

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.220 
someone was on that side so you're not
just<00:03:47.310> invincible<00:03:48.310> up<00:03:48.460> here<00:03:49.020> for<00:03:50.020> the<00:03:50.080> rope

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
just invincible up here for the rope

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.110 
just invincible up here for the rope
ladder<00:03:50.490> if<00:03:51.490> you<00:03:51.580> ever<00:03:51.700> think<00:03:51.910> of<00:03:52.090> doing

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
ladder if you ever think of doing

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.360 
ladder if you ever think of doing
something<00:03:52.630> like<00:03:52.780> this<00:03:52.900> it's<00:03:53.530> an<00:03:53.650> old<00:03:53.770> a<00:03:53.950> fire

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
something like this it's an old a fire

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.040 
something like this it's an old a fire
escape<00:03:54.520> ladder<00:03:54.970> we<00:03:55.150> got<00:03:55.300> anyone<00:03:55.660> that's<00:03:55.840> metal

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
escape ladder we got anyone that's metal

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.290 
escape ladder we got anyone that's metal
so<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:56.680> brought<00:03:57.640> this<00:03:57.760> one<00:03:57.880> up<00:03:58.030> and<00:03:58.180> it's

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
so I brought this one up and it's

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.580 
so I brought this one up and it's
starting<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.600> fall<00:03:58.990> apart<00:03:59.020> so<00:03:59.380> I'm<00:03:59.440> not<00:03:59.530> sure

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
starting to fall apart so I'm not sure

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.200 
starting to fall apart so I'm not sure
how<00:03:59.830> long<00:03:59.980> it's<00:04:00.160> going<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.340> last<00:04:00.400> you<00:04:00.820> can<00:04:00.970> see

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
how long it's going to last you can see

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.140 
how long it's going to last you can see
pieces<00:04:01.960> are<00:04:02.080> coming<00:04:02.230> off<00:04:02.500> but<00:04:02.890> we<00:04:03.640> took<00:04:03.910> out<00:04:04.090> a

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
pieces are coming off but we took out a

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.640 
pieces are coming off but we took out a
two-by-four<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:04.780> yield<00:04:04.959> it<00:04:05.110> into<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.440> tree

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
two-by-four and yield it into the tree

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.150 
two-by-four and yield it into the tree
and<00:04:05.950> then<00:04:06.990> basically<00:04:07.990> slid<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.740> rope<00:04:08.920> ladder

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
and then basically slid the rope ladder

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.550 
and then basically slid the rope ladder
over<00:04:09.430> it<00:04:09.850> and<00:04:10.300> then<00:04:10.600> secured<00:04:11.080> it<00:04:11.200> with<00:04:11.230> another

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
over it and then secured it with another

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.880 
over it and then secured it with another
just<00:04:12.370> scrap<00:04:12.790> piece<00:04:12.970> of<00:04:13.150> wood<00:04:13.390> and<00:04:14.020> we<00:04:14.140> also<00:04:14.290> had

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
just scrap piece of wood and we also had

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.500 
just scrap piece of wood and we also had
this<00:04:15.040> rope<00:04:15.310> tied<00:04:15.550> around<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.880> rope<00:04:16.000> ladder<00:04:16.239> so

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
this rope tied around the rope ladder so

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.590 
this rope tied around the rope ladder so
we<00:04:16.570> just<00:04:17.459> secured<00:04:18.459> that<00:04:18.669> as<00:04:18.820> well<00:04:19.030> around<00:04:19.450> the

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
we just secured that as well around the

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.470 
we just secured that as well around the
rest<00:04:19.750> of<00:04:19.930> this<00:04:20.280> most<00:04:21.280> of<00:04:21.400> this<00:04:21.459> was<00:04:21.640> just<00:04:21.910> scrap

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
rest of this most of this was just scrap

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.060 
rest of this most of this was just scrap
wood<00:04:22.690> i<00:04:22.750> got<00:04:22.990> from<00:04:23.200> either<00:04:23.350> free<00:04:23.650> wood<00:04:23.800> piles

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
wood i got from either free wood piles

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.159 
wood i got from either free wood piles
are<00:04:24.370> lying<00:04:24.880> around<00:04:25.090> or<00:04:25.330> stuff<00:04:25.660> from<00:04:25.870> our

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
are lying around or stuff from our

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.640 
are lying around or stuff from our
neighbors<00:04:27.070> work<00:04:27.310> that<00:04:27.550> he<00:04:27.700> gets<00:04:27.880> her<00:04:28.030> free

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
neighbors work that he gets her free

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.010 
neighbors work that he gets her free
this<00:04:29.650> piece<00:04:29.950> i<00:04:30.250> realized<00:04:30.730> after<00:04:31.480> putting<00:04:31.870> it

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
this piece i realized after putting it

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.350 
this piece i realized after putting it
up<00:04:32.140> was<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.950> incorrect<00:04:33.340> type<00:04:33.580> of<00:04:33.760> wood<00:04:34.000> to<00:04:34.240> be

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
up was the incorrect type of wood to be

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.760 
up was the incorrect type of wood to be
using<00:04:34.690> we're<00:04:34.840> probably<00:04:34.990> going<00:04:35.169> to<00:04:35.230> replace<00:04:35.530> it

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
using we're probably going to replace it

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.490 
using we're probably going to replace it
it's<00:04:36.700> just<00:04:36.910> kind<00:04:37.210> of<00:04:37.270> I<00:04:37.540> know<00:04:38.050> it's<00:04:38.200> not<00:04:38.290> the

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
it's just kind of I know it's not the

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.020 
it's just kind of I know it's not the
technical<00:04:38.860> term<00:04:39.130> but<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.430> melts<00:04:39.760> in<00:04:39.910> the<00:04:40.000> rain

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
technical term but it melts in the rain

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.890 
technical term but it melts in the rain
just<00:04:40.900> droops<00:04:41.830> is<00:04:42.040> not<00:04:42.970> very<00:04:43.180> good<00:04:43.330> but<00:04:43.570> the

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
just droops is not very good but the

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.860 
just droops is not very good but the
other<00:04:43.990> pieces<00:04:44.290> are<00:04:44.530> holding<00:04:44.830> up<00:04:45.419> and<00:04:46.419> they

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
other pieces are holding up and they

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.530 
other pieces are holding up and they
serve<00:04:47.110> more<00:04:47.410> or<00:04:47.530> less<00:04:47.680> just<00:04:47.710> as<00:04:48.250> cover<00:04:49.180> from

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
serve more or less just as cover from

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.350 
serve more or less just as cover from
the<00:04:49.570> rain<00:04:49.870> so<00:04:50.500> that<00:04:50.740> this<00:04:51.610> stuff<00:04:51.850> doesn't<00:04:52.060> rot

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
the rain so that this stuff doesn't rot

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.300 
the rain so that this stuff doesn't rot
but<00:04:52.600> I<00:04:53.050> guess<00:04:53.410> if<00:04:53.620> someone<00:04:53.979> threw<00:04:54.160> a<00:04:54.190> grenade

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
but I guess if someone threw a grenade

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.250 
but I guess if someone threw a grenade
you'd<00:04:54.669> be<00:04:54.790> ok<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.090> stepping<00:04:55.840> down<00:04:55.960> from<00:04:56.020> the

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
you'd be ok to stepping down from the

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.320 
you'd be ok to stepping down from the
tower<00:04:56.440> I'll<00:04:56.650> come<00:04:56.890> back<00:04:57.070> over<00:04:57.370> here<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.940> where

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
tower I'll come back over here to where

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.330 
tower I'll come back over here to where
we<00:04:58.479> started<00:04:58.510> but<00:04:58.990> on<00:04:59.110> the<00:04:59.200> opposite<00:04:59.530> side<00:04:59.710> this

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
we started but on the opposite side this

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.310 
we started but on the opposite side this
is<00:05:00.400> more<00:05:01.120> or<00:05:01.150> less<00:05:01.270> just<00:05:01.360> a<00:05:01.660> barrier<00:05:02.020> right<00:05:02.140> now

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
is more or less just a barrier right now

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.409 
is more or less just a barrier right now
doesn't<00:05:02.590> serve<00:05:02.950> any<00:05:03.210> protection<00:05:04.210> for

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
doesn't serve any protection for

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.330 
doesn't serve any protection for
shooting<00:05:05.080> you<00:05:05.200> can<00:05:05.350> see<00:05:05.500> it's<00:05:05.650> very<00:05:05.800> open

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
shooting you can see it's very open

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.040 
shooting you can see it's very open
there's<00:05:07.000> something<00:05:07.240> we<00:05:07.479> might<00:05:07.660> work<00:05:07.870> on

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
there's something we might work on

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.100 
there's something we might work on
putting<00:05:08.200> some<00:05:08.470> more<00:05:08.620> sticks<00:05:08.919> up<00:05:09.419> and<00:05:10.419> then

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
putting some more sticks up and then

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.980 
putting some more sticks up and then
over<00:05:11.350> here<00:05:11.380> we<00:05:12.479> started<00:05:13.479> with<00:05:13.570> just<00:05:13.750> this

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
over here we started with just this

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.580 
over here we started with just this
plywood<00:05:14.350> sheet<00:05:15.510> and<00:05:16.510> then<00:05:16.630> piled<00:05:17.169> up<00:05:17.350> sticks

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
plywood sheet and then piled up sticks

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.839 
plywood sheet and then piled up sticks
underneath<00:05:17.740> it<00:05:18.190> which<00:05:18.340> is

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
underneath it which is

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.149 
underneath it which is
one<00:05:20.479> way<00:05:20.629> of<00:05:20.719> making<00:05:21.050> it<00:05:21.169> really<00:05:21.709> easy<00:05:21.800> in

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
one way of making it really easy in

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:24.429 
one way of making it really easy in
Temple<00:05:22.490> barrier<00:05:22.819> but<00:05:23.599> I<00:05:23.659> think<00:05:23.959> that's<00:05:24.110> about

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:24.439 
Temple barrier but I think that's about
