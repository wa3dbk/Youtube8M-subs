00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the other thing about them in autumn

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.149 
the other thing about them in autumn
all's<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.049> consider<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.589> really<00:01:04.799> cool<00:01:05.040> is

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
all's and I consider it really cool is

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.910 
all's and I consider it really cool is
not<00:01:05.610> only<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.180> open<00:01:06.510> content<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
not only the like open content and the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.969 
not only the like open content and the
fact<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> highest<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:09.119> any<00:01:09.299> food<00:01:09.979> since

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
fact it's the highest of any food since

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.700 
fact it's the highest of any food since
it<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.310> used<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.729> heart<00:01:12.119> disease

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
it can be used in heart disease

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.570 
it can be used in heart disease
prevention<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.189> cancers<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.500> is<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
prevention and cancers and is that the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.350 
prevention and cancers and is that the
fruit<00:01:17.970> increases<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.470> iment<00:01:20.360> content

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
fruit increases the like iment content

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.890 
fruit increases the like iment content
by<00:01:21.600> cooking<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:23.270> what<00:01:24.270> we've<00:01:24.420> got<00:01:24.450> is

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
by cooking it so what we've got is

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.050 
by cooking it so what we've got is
fruits<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.409> seeds<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.920> are<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> really<00:01:26.880> good

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
fruits and seeds that are a really good

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.300 
fruits and seeds that are a really good
source<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.509> essential<00:01:27.810> fatty<00:01:28.259> acids<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:29.040> well

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
source of essential fatty acids as well

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.390 
source of essential fatty acids as well
as<00:01:29.640> which<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.479> very<00:01:30.930> unusual<00:01:31.140> for<00:01:31.680> any<00:01:32.070> type<00:01:32.369> of

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
as which is very unusual for any type of

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.999 
as which is very unusual for any type of
fruit<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.420> seeds<00:01:33.689> are<00:01:33.840> also<00:01:34.020> extremely

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
fruit the seeds are also extremely

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.420 
fruit the seeds are also extremely
edible<00:01:35.700> although<00:01:35.909> somewhat<00:01:36.630> fibrous<00:01:37.430> but

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
edible although somewhat fibrous but

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.160 
edible although somewhat fibrous but
they<00:01:38.579> does<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.970> say<00:01:39.180> again<00:01:39.509> they<00:01:39.659> contain<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> lot

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
they does I say again they contain a lot

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.510 
they does I say again they contain a lot
of<00:01:40.380> protein<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.159> fats<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.770> this<00:01:43.770> happens<00:01:44.340> to

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
of protein and fats and this happens to

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.270 
of protein and fats and this happens to
be<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:46.439> peak<00:01:46.920> time<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.369> picking

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.880 

spring<00:01:53.570> right<00:01:54.570> about<00:01:54.840> April<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.560> when<00:01:55.590> they

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
spring right about April is when they

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.300 
spring right about April is when they
start<00:01:56.160> flowering<00:01:56.930> they're<00:01:57.930> also<00:01:58.290> again<00:01:59.040> like

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
start flowering they're also again like

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.290 
start flowering they're also again like
the<00:01:59.760> autumn<00:02:00.060> olive<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.660> nitrogen<00:02:01.290> fixer<00:02:01.860> and

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
the autumn olive a nitrogen fixer and

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.430 
the autumn olive a nitrogen fixer and
really<00:02:03.300> what<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.510> means<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.110> they<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.410> take

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
really what that means is they can take

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.770 
really what that means is they can take
nitrogen<00:02:05.130> out<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:05.640> air<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.180> put<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.690> in

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
nitrogen out of the air and put it in

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.480 
nitrogen out of the air and put it in
the<00:02:06.900> ground<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.710> we're<00:02:07.890> talking<00:02:08.070> about<00:02:08.369> a

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
the ground so we're talking about a

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.609 
the ground so we're talking about a
symbiotic<00:02:08.910> relationship<00:02:09.179> with<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:09.990> bacteria

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
symbiotic relationship with the bacteria

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.130 
symbiotic relationship with the bacteria
that<00:02:10.770> lives<00:02:11.070> in<00:02:11.280> their<00:02:11.430> roots<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.660> improves

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
that lives in their roots so it improves

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.460 
that lives in their roots so it improves
the<00:02:13.320> fertility<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:13.950> soils<00:02:14.459> nearby<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:16.140> I'll

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
the fertility of soils nearby and I'll

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.720 
the fertility of soils nearby and I'll
just<00:02:16.680> come<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:17.850> real<00:02:18.090> close<00:02:19.220> underneath<00:02:20.220> as<00:02:20.610> I

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
just come in real close underneath as I

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.830 
just come in real close underneath as I
pan<00:02:21.000> out<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.570> have<00:02:22.410> some<00:02:22.680> sorrel<00:02:23.840> some

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
pan out I have some sorrel some

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.140 
pan out I have some sorrel some
raspberries<00:02:26.390> go<00:02:27.390> back<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:28.970> look<00:02:29.970> at<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.239> gomey

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
raspberries go back in look at the gomey

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.510 
raspberries go back in look at the gomey
now<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:33.330> Gomi<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:34.020> about<00:02:35.270> 15<00:02:36.270> feet<00:02:36.570> tall<00:02:37.520> plan
