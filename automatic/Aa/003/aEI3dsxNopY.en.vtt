00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:03.050
 so hello everyone 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.000
 will deal 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.550
 there are eight people on them 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.729
 so lived 

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:11.719
 I'm losing now 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.529
 cry of the legendary classic school 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.169
 their school 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:18.710
 we have rights 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.710
 its not trying them 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.039
 This game has already been released 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.060
 in the early 90s 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.609
 first appeared in it other 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.200
 classes it would be six years ago 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.760
 in which was still a teenager 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.000
 random access memory 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.190
 July 15 in my head only 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.900
 his mistress 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.780
 so 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.720
 I warn you in advance that 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.680
 I could not cope with 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.540
 microphone so the plot 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.670
 I can not very bad that why 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.090
 Ltd 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.930
 sounds 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.510
 turn it up 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.960
 itar tass 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.440
 let's start 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.930
 a blow to the search and all 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.350
 new drama 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.810
 hot difficulty level 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.320
 mostly offline 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.720
 five levels 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.990
 newbie 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.250
 experienced veteran 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.530
 not excluded 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.090
 in the future besides that was 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.080
 but the problem is exactly what he was 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.070
 invited to recall 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.180
 I have already 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.730
 recently arrived for the first time therefore 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.300
 whole 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.230
 Simon is also the State Duma Committee on Affairs 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.130
 veterans 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.310
 g performance 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.310
 lukash 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.800
 First you need to choose a place for our new 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.800
 bases we see somewhere 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.469
 we want and please don't ask what 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.970
 it is so what they see 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.360
 what are the usage preferences 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.340
 Gennady Korban 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.290
 further and pskov and great days I do not know 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.489
 as a rule by impurities 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.019
 which 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.519
 rebuild the initial starting 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.519
 sculpted plaza smog a little longer 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:29.389
 trust balance 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.419
 decided to cycle a bit 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.460
 but nothing through in the gusts of wind 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.059
 from now on it will be noticeable 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:40.239
 yes here we will see what we have planes on 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.009
 Akihito base 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:45.789
 rather a pity that the percentage of transport 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:48.849
 MP noted that this is ours 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.119
 fighters 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:55.759
 tula to perform on the bases so here you are 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:56.769
 if you are familiar with 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.040
 for this game you remember that the teachings 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.989
 stupid east would be original 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.199
 version 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.979
 Someone else and aliens. 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.979
 stayed on all sides 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:10.739
 right 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.510
 I will be very comfortable to defend if 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.929
 believe that he is from this room 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:20.889
 Well, what we have here 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.839
 did not have 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:26.319
 output and here you can build a new database 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.259
 but this is because there was no 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:33.389
 I'm afraid of information prices while bows all sorts of data 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.389
 memorial service subscribers drop in 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.989
 m nightingale soldier 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.709
 who do we have here 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.529
 let's say about led individually 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:46.509
 unique personality 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.639
 it does not have and non-partisan 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.639
 unicredit so in March 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.639
 each has its own name 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.819
 think of a birthday this does not have 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.810
 excellent bravery 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.830
 explain throwing grenades host 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.719
 span is useless 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:07.429
 is it enough in kiev though not too much 

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:10.439
 the power of craspy the weather is good he can 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.439
 carry heavy weapons 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:18.079
 and the rest ie we expect this one too 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.079
 weak dries quickly 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.689
 and this one 

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:26.689
 q so we still have 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:28.979
 this question 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.979
 he could quickly 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:35.559
 0 so we are from the future 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.270
 I am not right I can rather stomach 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.659
 b 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.659
 the colonies 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.439
 but about this help 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:53.059
 about this itar tass 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:56.059
 equips service 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:00.259
 but total fighter by other weapons 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.330
 m 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.479
 so 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.479
 big money laid 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.409
 build new modules in which st 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.639
 as a duty in turkey 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.509
 for example on residential units this year 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:22.860
 when 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.129
 for pedestrians 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:26.279
 hangar 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:29.279
 as a person will need 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:32.800
 school 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.460
 fine 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.659
 So 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.270
 otherwise 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.270
 here we have a 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.139
 chumak which is designed for us 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:45.360
 technology is important 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.750
 believes however if you believe that it is very 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.860
 sips that are very weak 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.969
 consolation 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:54.969
 aliens have 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:55.710
 he 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.129
 which newcomers this year 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:00.919
 usually 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.009
 and we see write further so this 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:03.500
 a game 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.499
 neatly 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.719
 Well, what is there to be 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:11.219
 produce celebrating things 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:14.219
 but while we are still very open 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:19.369
 this course and useless 

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:22.509
 here you can transfer with the bases of the soldiers 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.039
 equipment or different goods 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:28.639
 that is, we can buy something 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.270
 I want to 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.729
 sell fire here 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.309
 cancellation of unnecessary two won money to them 

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:38.189
 do not use 

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:40.969
 stock 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:43.969
 Alas, not very clear 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.020
 ancient greek torch 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.599
 this is all that I can valuable so far so abruptly 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:54.619
 slowed down 

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:57.319
 Astana 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:59.309
 should not immediately 

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:01.459
 I hope in the next series but there is no longer 

00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:03.289
 first year will be more culture
