this opportunity we you know really

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.980 
this opportunity we you know really
starting<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.820> learn<00:00:17.940> about<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.449> species<00:00:18.900> of

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
starting to learn about this species of

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.359 
starting to learn about this species of
the<00:00:19.080> first<00:00:19.320> time<00:00:19.529> why<00:00:19.949> are<00:00:20.010> they<00:00:20.160> breeding

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
the first time why are they breeding

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.470 
the first time why are they breeding
where<00:00:20.580> are<00:00:20.640> they<00:00:20.760> feeding<00:00:20.970> where<00:00:21.300> are<00:00:21.359> they

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
where are they feeding where are they

where are they feeding where are they
giving<00:00:21.750> birth<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.170> we<00:00:22.289> think<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:22.920> a

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
giving birth and we think that this is a

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:43.450 
giving birth and we think that this is a
critical<00:00:23.430> part<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.730> puzzle<00:00:25.849> here's<00:00:26.849> on
