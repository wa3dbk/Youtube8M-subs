because<00:01:54.390> there<00:01:54.570> are<00:01:54.689> typically<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.200> number<00:01:55.619> of

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
because there are typically a number of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.950 
because there are typically a number of
pieces<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.070> go<00:01:56.219> within<00:01:57.060> each<00:01:57.270> invitation

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
pieces that go within each invitation

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.249 
pieces that go within each invitation
suite<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.880> really<00:02:00.180> recommend<00:02:00.540> doing<00:02:00.960> this

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
suite and I really recommend doing this

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.870 
suite and I really recommend doing this
that<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> great<00:02:02.070> way<00:02:02.189> even<00:02:02.430> if<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.610> hire<00:02:02.850> a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that is a great way even if you hire a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.730 
that is a great way even if you hire a
station<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.509> do<00:02:03.630> all<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.079> elements<00:02:04.170> for

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
you by doing your own fulfillment you

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.330 
you by doing your own fulfillment you
can<00:02:07.140> save<00:02:07.320> quite<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.619> bit<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.890> money<00:02:07.920> just

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
can save quite a bit of money just

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.469 
can save quite a bit of money just
because<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.819> very<00:02:09.179> time-consuming

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
because that is a very time-consuming

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.440 
because that is a very time-consuming
process

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
process

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.390
