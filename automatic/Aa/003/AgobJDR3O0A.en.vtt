okay<00:00:00.659> um<00:00:00.930> this<00:00:01.230> is<00:00:01.410> going<00:00:01.589> to<00:00:01.650> be<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:01.800> tutorial

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
okay um this is going to be a tutorial

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.950 
okay um this is going to be a tutorial
on<00:00:02.850> PLO<00:00:03.870> all<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:05.069> PLO<00:00:05.400> cases<00:00:06.029> so<00:00:06.450> it<00:00:06.660> would<00:00:06.810> be

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
on PLO all the PLO cases so it would be

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.730 
on PLO all the PLO cases so it would be
full<00:00:07.200> PLL<00:00:07.680> there's<00:00:08.519> 21<00:00:09.150> cases<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:10.050> I'll<00:00:10.500> go

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
full PLL there's 21 cases and I'll go

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.779 
full PLL there's 21 cases and I'll go
over<00:00:11.010> each<00:00:11.250> one<00:00:12.200> show<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.380> algorithm<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:16.789> all

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
over each one show the algorithm and all

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.490 
over each one show the algorithm and all
that<00:00:18.060> stuff

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.920 

okay<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:25.060> first<00:00:25.769> pl<00:00:26.769> case<00:00:27.189> is<00:00:27.550> the<00:00:28.150> a<00:00:28.650> perm<00:00:29.650> and

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
okay the first pl case is the a perm and

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.560 
okay the first pl case is the a perm and
I'll<00:00:31.930> just<00:00:32.290> give<00:00:32.559> you<00:00:32.590> a<00:00:32.739> full<00:00:33.430> area<00:00:33.879> view<00:00:34.390> of

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
I'll just give you a full area view of

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.830 
I'll just give you a full area view of
it<00:00:34.780> oh<00:00:35.519> how<00:00:36.519> you<00:00:36.579> can<00:00:36.850> tell<00:00:37.120> that<00:00:37.149> it's<00:00:37.629> the<00:00:37.809> a

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
it oh how you can tell that it's the a

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.610 
it oh how you can tell that it's the a
perm<00:00:38.350> is<00:00:38.590> that<00:00:39.280> it<00:00:39.519> would<00:00:39.640> have<00:00:39.850> like<00:00:40.530> kind<00:00:41.530> of

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
perm is that it would have like kind of

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.060 
perm is that it would have like kind of
like<00:00:41.710> a<00:00:41.769> 1<00:00:42.010> by<00:00:42.129> 2<00:00:42.190> block<00:00:42.579> here<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:44.530> all<00:00:44.800> the

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
like a 1 by 2 block here like all the

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.579 
like a 1 by 2 block here like all the
edges<00:00:45.670> are<00:00:46.059> already<00:00:46.750> finished

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
edges are already finished

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.280 
edges are already finished
there's<00:00:48.280> just<00:00:48.640> three<00:00:49.360> corners<00:00:49.780> that<00:00:49.960> need<00:00:50.140> to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
there's just three corners that need to

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.119 
there's just three corners that need to
be<00:00:50.350> swapped<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.690> then<00:00:52.930> you<00:00:53.140> put<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:53.559> 1<00:00:53.920> by<00:00:54.100> 2

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
be swapped so then you put the 1 by 2

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.160 
be swapped so then you put the 1 by 2
block<00:00:54.579> on<00:00:55.080> the<00:00:56.080> front<00:00:56.379> left<00:00:57.100> slide<00:00:57.580> and<00:00:58.170> then

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
block on the front left slide and then

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.420 
block on the front left slide and then
the<00:01:00.089> 2<00:01:01.089> there's<00:01:01.900> 2<00:01:02.320> colors<00:01:02.710> in<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:02.979> back<00:01:03.159> that

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
the 2 there's 2 colors in the back that

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.700 
the 2 there's 2 colors in the back that
are<00:01:03.580> the<00:01:03.729> same<00:01:03.909> color<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:05.049> in<00:01:05.140> this<00:01:05.229> case<00:01:05.470> it's

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
are the same color so in this case it's

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.350 
are the same color so in this case it's
screen<00:01:05.950> and<00:01:06.130> drink<00:01:06.369> so<00:01:06.670> you<00:01:06.729> put<00:01:06.970> on<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.210> back

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
screen and drink so you put on the back

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.289 
screen and drink so you put on the back
side<00:01:07.600> and<00:01:07.930> do<00:01:08.530> this<00:01:08.740> algorithm<00:01:09.299> right

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
side and do this algorithm right

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.200 
side and do this algorithm right
inverted<00:01:10.950> front

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
inverted front

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.060 
inverted front
Ryan<00:01:13.210> verted<00:01:13.600> back<00:01:14.320> twice<00:01:15.390> right<00:01:17.070> front

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
Ryan verted back twice right front

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.480 
Ryan verted back twice right front
inverted<00:01:18.549> right<00:01:19.390> inverted<00:01:19.990> back<00:01:20.409> twice<00:01:20.799> right

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
inverted right inverted back twice right

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.030 
inverted right inverted back twice right
twice

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.080 

okay<00:01:28.040> now<00:01:28.250> let's<00:01:28.460> get<00:01:28.640> on<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:29.060> next

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
okay now let's get on to the next

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.180 
okay now let's get on to the next
algorithm<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:29.900> that<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.229> next<00:01:30.530> algorithm<00:01:30.950> is

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
algorithm and that the next algorithm is

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.030 
algorithm and that the next algorithm is
really<00:01:31.520> similar<00:01:31.760> it's<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:32.990> inverse<00:01:33.380> of<00:01:33.770> that

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
really similar it's the inverse of that

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.990 
really similar it's the inverse of that
algorithm<00:01:34.960> or<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.380> perm<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.310> this<00:01:37.490> is<00:01:37.729> a

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
algorithm or the a perm so this is a

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.690 
algorithm or the a perm so this is a
perm<00:01:38.690> B<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:41.270> it<00:01:41.780> looks<00:01:42.110> very<00:01:42.259> similar<00:01:42.890> you<00:01:43.490> put

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
perm B so it looks very similar you put

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.290 
perm B so it looks very similar you put
in<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:43.909> same<00:01:44.149> position<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:45.350> front<00:01:45.560> left<00:01:45.860> side

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
in the same position the front left side

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.170 
in the same position the front left side
like<00:01:47.300> the<00:01:47.540> 1<00:01:47.720> by<00:01:47.840> 2<00:01:47.899> pair<00:01:48.259> but<00:01:49.250> this<00:01:49.460> time<00:01:49.759> the

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
like the 1 by 2 pair but this time the

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.990 
like the 1 by 2 pair but this time the
two<00:01:50.450> colors<00:01:50.860> two<00:01:51.860> corner<00:01:52.220> colors<00:01:52.520> that<00:01:52.670> match

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
two colors two corner colors that match

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.320 
two colors two corner colors that match
or<00:01:53.330> on<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.750> right<00:01:53.930> side<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:54.790> then<00:01:55.790> you<00:01:56.149> do

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
or on the right side and then you do

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.740 
or on the right side and then you do
this<00:01:56.509> algorithm<00:01:57.039> right<00:01:58.039> twice<00:01:58.420> back<00:01:59.420> twice

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
this algorithm right twice back twice

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.969 
this algorithm right twice back twice
right<00:02:00.850> front<00:02:01.850> right<00:02:02.570> inverted<00:02:02.990> back<00:02:03.710> twice

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
right front right inverted back twice

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.240 
right front right inverted back twice
right<00:02:04.960> front<00:02:05.960> inverted<00:02:06.380> right

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.660 

okay<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.720> e<00:02:12.750> pump<00:02:13.319> let's<00:02:13.980> get<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.370> full

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
okay this is the e pump let's get a full

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.990 
okay this is the e pump let's get a full
area<00:02:15.090> view<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:16.430> how<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.489> can<00:02:17.670> tell<00:02:17.879> that

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
area view of it how you can tell that

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.990 
area view of it how you can tell that
it's<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.299> EEPROM<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.440> every<00:02:20.040> like<00:02:20.790> all

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
it's the EEPROM is that every like all

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.970 
it's the EEPROM is that every like all
the<00:02:21.150> edges<00:02:21.569> aren't<00:02:22.140> spot<00:02:23.010> proper<00:02:23.549> spot<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.980> if

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
the edges aren't spot proper spot and if

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.059 
the edges aren't spot proper spot and if
you<00:02:26.430> look<00:02:26.640> on<00:02:26.819> each<00:02:27.120> side

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
you look on each side

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.800 
you look on each side
the<00:02:29.069> colors<00:02:29.430> are<00:02:29.610> opposite<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.269> there's<00:02:30.450> green

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
the colors are opposite so there's green

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.030 
the colors are opposite so there's green
and<00:02:31.220> green<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.400> blue<00:02:32.780> orange<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.989> red<00:02:34.200> green

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
and green and blue orange and red green

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.289 
and green and blue orange and red green
and<00:02:35.220> blue<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.400> ours<00:02:35.819> in<00:02:35.970> red<00:02:37.849> like<00:02:38.849> the

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
and blue and ours in red like the

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.770 
and blue and ours in red like the
corners<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:40.319> then<00:02:40.560> what<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.549> do<00:02:41.790> X<00:02:42.239> inverted

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
corners so then what you do X inverted

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.170 
corners so then what you do X inverted
and<00:02:43.640> now<00:02:44.640> what<00:02:44.879> you're<00:02:45.120> looking<00:02:45.329> for<00:02:46.019> is<00:02:47.180> you

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
and now what you're looking for is you

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.369 
and now what you're looking for is you
look<00:02:48.390> at<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:49.200> spot<00:02:50.129> on<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.640> top<00:02:50.879> left<00:02:51.569> that's

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
look at the spot on the top left that's

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.270 
look at the spot on the top left that's
a<00:02:52.500> blue<00:02:52.769> and<00:02:54.019> you<00:02:55.019> look<00:02:55.290> right<00:02:55.500> next<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.069> and

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
a blue and you look right next to it and

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.780 
a blue and you look right next to it and
if<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.750> green<00:02:58.319> since<00:02:58.829> the<00:02:59.010> Greens<00:02:59.250> opposite

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
if the green since the Greens opposite

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.809 
if the green since the Greens opposite
to<00:02:59.970> blue<00:03:00.590> you're<00:03:01.590> you're<00:03:02.040> at<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.340> wrong<00:03:02.489> side

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
to blue you're you're at the wrong side

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.089 
to blue you're you're at the wrong side
so<00:03:02.849> turn<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.780> 90<00:03:04.349> degrees<00:03:04.940> so<00:03:05.940> then<00:03:06.090> red<00:03:06.540> and

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
so turn it 90 degrees so then red and

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.780 
so turn it 90 degrees so then red and
red<00:03:08.150> if<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.959> don't<00:03:10.230> do<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:10.769> you'll<00:03:11.280> end<00:03:11.489> up

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
red if you don't do this you'll end up

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.170 
red if you don't do this you'll end up
with<00:03:12.450> an<00:03:12.870> H<00:03:13.440> perm<00:03:13.889> and<00:03:14.220> you've<00:03:14.669> got<00:03:14.849> to<00:03:14.970> fix

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
with an H perm and you've got to fix

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.610 
with an H perm and you've got to fix
that<00:03:15.829> so<00:03:17.060> then<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.299> do<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:18.690> algorithm<00:03:19.109> you

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
that so then you do this algorithm you

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.589 
that so then you do this algorithm you
do<00:03:19.739> right<00:03:21.230> up<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.500> verted<00:03:22.940> right<00:03:23.940> inverted

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
do right up and verted right inverted

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.610 
do right up and verted right inverted
down<00:03:25.290> right<00:03:26.129> up<00:03:26.669> right<00:03:27.139> inverted<00:03:28.139> down

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
down right up right inverted down

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.920 
down right up right inverted down
inverted<00:03:28.680> right<00:03:29.579> up<00:03:30.389> by<00:03:31.319> inverted<00:03:31.769> down<00:03:32.190> right

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
inverted right up by inverted down right

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:42.570 
inverted right up by inverted down right
up<00:03:34.819> inverted<00:03:35.819> right<00:03:36.660> inverted<00:03:37.280> down<00:03:38.280> inverted

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.390 

okay<00:03:43.580> this<00:03:43.850> next<00:03:43.880> pl<00:03:44.660> case<00:03:45.670> looks<00:03:46.670> like<00:03:46.910> this

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
okay this next pl case looks like this

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.850 
okay this next pl case looks like this
get<00:03:49.400> a<00:03:49.460> full<00:03:49.700> area<00:03:50.030> view<00:03:50.420> of<00:03:50.570> it<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:53.590> this<00:03:54.590> is

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
get a full area view of it and this is

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.820 
get a full area view of it and this is
called<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.970> U<00:03:56.210> perm<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:59.320> how<00:04:00.320> you<00:04:00.380> can<00:04:00.620> tell

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
called the U perm and how you can tell

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.400 
called the U perm and how you can tell
that<00:04:01.010> it's<00:04:01.190> EU<00:04:01.490> perm<00:04:01.760> is<00:04:02.060> one<00:04:02.540> side<00:04:02.810> it's

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
that it's EU perm is one side it's

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.460 
that it's EU perm is one side it's
completely<00:04:03.980> solved<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:05.020> then<00:04:06.020> all<00:04:06.290> the

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
completely solved and then all the

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.380 
completely solved and then all the
corners<00:04:06.890> are<00:04:07.100> solved<00:04:09.340> so<00:04:10.340> what<00:04:10.610> you<00:04:10.730> do<00:04:10.910> is<00:04:11.180> you

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
corners are solved so what you do is you

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.210 
corners are solved so what you do is you
put<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:12.260> solved<00:04:12.830> side<00:04:13.190> on<00:04:13.490> the<00:04:13.910> back<00:04:15.160> now<00:04:16.160> you

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
put the solved side on the back now you

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.130 
put the solved side on the back now you
look<00:04:16.549> at<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:16.790> front<00:04:16.970> side<00:04:17.239> at<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:18.519> sticker

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
look at the front side at the sticker

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.890 
look at the front side at the sticker
from<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.230> edge<00:04:21.470> piece<00:04:21.829> that<00:04:22.340> needs<00:04:22.580> to<00:04:22.730> be

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
from the edge piece that needs to be

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.220 
from the edge piece that needs to be
turn<00:04:23.900> so<00:04:24.230> it's<00:04:24.380> orange<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:26.240> look<00:04:26.570> for<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:26.990> arm

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
turn so it's orange you look for the arm

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.230 
turn so it's orange you look for the arm
side<00:04:27.530> which<00:04:27.890> is<00:04:28.070> to<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.280> right<00:04:28.430> so<00:04:28.910> it's<00:04:29.090> gonna

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
side which is to the right so it's gonna

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.650 
side which is to the right so it's gonna
be<00:04:29.480> the<00:04:29.600> right<00:04:29.780> algorithm<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:32.120> then<00:04:32.330> you<00:04:32.480> do

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
be the right algorithm so then you do

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.650 
be the right algorithm so then you do
this<00:04:32.960> algorithm<00:04:33.350> right<00:04:34.100> up<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:35.419> read<00:04:35.630> it

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
this algorithm right up and read it

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.610 
this algorithm right up and read it
right<00:04:36.560> up<00:04:37.130> right<00:04:37.700> up<00:04:38.360> right<00:04:39.820> up<00:04:40.820> inverted

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
right up right up right up inverted

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.950 
right up right up right up inverted
right<00:04:42.620> inverted<00:04:43.100> up<00:04:43.820> inverted<00:04:44.450> right<00:04:44.990> twice

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.830 

now<00:04:49.740> on<00:04:49.919> to<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.160> next<00:04:50.400> algorithm<00:04:50.880> this<00:04:51.570> one's

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
now on to the next algorithm this one's

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.270 
now on to the next algorithm this one's
very<00:04:52.020> similar<00:04:52.830> it<00:04:53.759> looks<00:04:53.790> the<00:04:54.240> same<00:04:54.540> exact<00:04:54.960> way

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
very similar it looks the same exact way

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.580 
very similar it looks the same exact way
the<00:04:56.280> only<00:04:56.699> you<00:04:57.180> do<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:57.720> same<00:04:57.900> thing<00:04:58.169> you<00:04:58.350> put

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
the only you do the same thing you put

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.290 
the only you do the same thing you put
the<00:04:58.770> soft<00:04:59.009> side<00:04:59.220> on<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.430> back<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.970> only

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
the soft side on the back the only

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.540 
the soft side on the back the only
difference<00:05:00.780> is<00:05:00.930> you<00:05:01.139> look<00:05:01.350> at<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.620> red<00:05:01.800> or<00:05:02.100> the

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
difference is you look at the red or the

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.590 
difference is you look at the red or the
front<00:05:02.759> side<00:05:03.000> red<00:05:03.990> is<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.340> left<00:05:06.440> red<00:05:07.440> left

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
front side red is to the left red left

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.070 
front side red is to the left red left
so<00:05:09.600> we're<00:05:10.259> gonna<00:05:10.410> do<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.770> left<00:05:11.039> algorithm<00:05:12.080> so

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
so we're gonna do the left algorithm so

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.249 
so we're gonna do the left algorithm so
do<00:05:14.009> this<00:05:14.220> algorithm<00:05:14.870> left<00:05:15.870> inverted<00:05:16.350> up<00:05:18.259> left

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
do this algorithm left inverted up left

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.070 
do this algorithm left inverted up left
inverted<00:05:19.740> up<00:05:20.100> inverted<00:05:20.669> left<00:05:21.389> inverted<00:05:21.840> up

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
inverted up inverted left inverted up

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.770 
inverted up inverted left inverted up
and<00:05:22.380> bridge<00:05:22.590> left<00:05:23.400> inverted<00:05:23.850> up<00:05:24.260> left<00:05:25.260> up<00:05:25.590> left

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
and bridge left inverted up left up left

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
and bridge left inverted up left up left
twice<00:05:28.729> and<00:05:29.729> that<00:05:29.880> solves<00:05:30.300> it<00:05:33.080> okay<00:05:34.080> now<00:05:34.590> on<00:05:34.770> to

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
twice and that solves it okay now on to

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.790 
twice and that solves it okay now on to
the<00:05:35.010> next<00:05:35.220> one

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:46.490 

okay<00:05:40.880> this<00:05:41.880> next<00:05:41.910> one<00:05:42.270> is<00:05:42.510> the<00:05:42.690> Z<00:05:42.990> perm<00:05:43.380> and<00:05:45.500> it

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
okay this next one is the Z perm and it

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.370 
okay this next one is the Z perm and it
looks<00:05:46.770> like<00:05:46.860> this<00:05:47.810> how<00:05:48.810> you<00:05:48.870> can<00:05:49.080> tell<00:05:49.350> that

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
looks like this how you can tell that

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.970 
looks like this how you can tell that
it's<00:05:49.680> a<00:05:49.800> Z<00:05:50.010> prom<00:05:50.280> is<00:05:50.870> all<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:52.050> corners<00:05:52.470> are

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
it's a Z prom is all the corners are

00:05:52.980 --> 00:06:00.140 
it's a Z prom is all the corners are
solved<00:05:55.910> there<00:05:56.910> is<00:05:57.360> no<00:05:57.870> X<00:05:58.560> no<00:05:59.040> third<00:05:59.760> side

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
solved there is no X no third side

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.909 
solved there is no X no third side
that's<00:06:00.389> salt<00:06:00.690> and<00:06:01.760> if<00:06:02.760> you<00:06:03.480> look<00:06:03.780> at<00:06:04.500> the<00:06:04.680> front

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
that's salt and if you look at the front

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.740 
that's salt and if you look at the front
side<00:06:05.480> there's<00:06:06.480> an<00:06:06.750> orange<00:06:07.200> and<00:06:07.470> then<00:06:08.240> this<00:06:09.240> to

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
side there's an orange and then this to

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.659 
side there's an orange and then this to
the<00:06:09.870> right<00:06:10.050> it's<00:06:10.260> green<00:06:10.560> so<00:06:10.590> orange<00:06:11.280> and<00:06:11.400> green

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
the right it's green so orange and green

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.020 
the right it's green so orange and green
and<00:06:11.910> then<00:06:12.510> red<00:06:12.540> and<00:06:13.200> blue<00:06:13.410> so<00:06:14.220> it's<00:06:14.400> these<00:06:14.700> two

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
and then red and blue so it's these two

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.090 
and then red and blue so it's these two
needs<00:06:15.240> we<00:06:15.419> switch<00:06:15.780> and<00:06:16.290> these<00:06:16.530> two<00:06:16.800> needs<00:06:17.010> to

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
needs we switch and these two needs to

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.100 
needs we switch and these two needs to
be<00:06:17.160> switched<00:06:19.040> so<00:06:20.040> what<00:06:20.220> you<00:06:20.340> do<00:06:20.660> is<00:06:21.660> you<00:06:21.900> put

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
be switched so what you do is you put

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.850 
be switched so what you do is you put
the<00:06:22.229> keep<00:06:22.410> in<00:06:22.560> the<00:06:23.040> position<00:06:23.580> so<00:06:24.510> that's<00:06:24.860> the

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
the keep in the position so that's the

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.159 
the keep in the position so that's the
two<00:06:26.160> edges<00:06:26.400> that<00:06:26.580> need<00:06:26.729> to<00:06:27.060> be<00:06:27.090> flipped<00:06:27.450> or

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
two edges that need to be flipped or

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.960 
two edges that need to be flipped or
switch<00:06:28.500> are<00:06:28.770> on<00:06:29.070> the<00:06:29.220> front<00:06:29.639> and<00:06:29.910> right<00:06:30.330> side

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
switch are on the front and right side

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.690 
switch are on the front and right side
or<00:06:32.970> I'll<00:06:33.360> still<00:06:33.690> end<00:06:33.720> up<00:06:34.050> with<00:06:34.110> a<00:06:34.350> parity<00:06:34.830> so

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700 
or I'll still end up with a parity so

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:45.460 
or I'll still end up with a parity so
then<00:06:35.910> you<00:06:36.060> do<00:06:36.240> this<00:06:36.389> algorithm<00:06:36.810> M<00:06:37.820> 2<00:06:39.290> u<00:06:40.290> M<00:06:41.510> 2<00:06:42.510> u<00:06:44.210> M

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
then you do this algorithm M 2 u M 2 u M

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:59.870 
then you do this algorithm M 2 u M 2 u M
inverted<00:06:46.470> u<00:06:47.160> 2<00:06:48.410> m2<00:06:50.570> u<00:06:51.740> 2m<00:06:52.740> inverted<00:06:53.669> u<00:06:54.419> 2

00:06:59.870 --> 00:06:59.880 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.570 

okay<00:07:00.880> this<00:07:01.300> next<00:07:01.330> one<00:07:01.810> it's<00:07:02.050> the<00:07:02.320> H<00:07:02.500> perm<00:07:02.889> it

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
okay this next one it's the H perm it

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.370 
okay this next one it's the H perm it
looks<00:07:03.790> like<00:07:03.970> this<00:07:04.919> and<00:07:06.840> how<00:07:07.840> you<00:07:07.900> can<00:07:08.169> tell

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:08.380 
looks like this and how you can tell

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.680 
looks like this and how you can tell
it's<00:07:08.530> the<00:07:08.590> H<00:07:08.830> perm<00:07:09.220> is<00:07:09.520> that<00:07:09.970> all<00:07:10.210> the<00:07:10.419> corners

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:10.690 
it's the H perm is that all the corners

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:16.590 
it's the H perm is that all the corners
are<00:07:11.250> solved<00:07:12.250> and<00:07:14.100> the<00:07:15.100> edges<00:07:15.850> need<00:07:16.240> to<00:07:16.449> be

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:16.600 
are solved and the edges need to be

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.610 
are solved and the edges need to be
switched<00:07:17.370> like<00:07:18.370> the<00:07:19.150> each<00:07:19.930> side

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620 
switched like the each side

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.070 
switched like the each side
the<00:07:20.979> colors<00:07:21.280> are<00:07:21.430> opposite<00:07:21.850> the<00:07:22.090> blue<00:07:22.479> green

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 
the colors are opposite the blue green

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:29.909 
the colors are opposite the blue green
red<00:07:23.520> orange<00:07:24.520> green<00:07:25.139> blue<00:07:26.139> orange<00:07:26.889> red<00:07:27.190> and<00:07:28.919> you

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 
red orange green blue orange red and you

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:33.120 
red orange green blue orange red and you
get<00:07:30.130> this<00:07:30.280> case<00:07:30.630> randomly<00:07:31.630> and<00:07:31.960> also<00:07:32.560> if<00:07:32.860> you

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.130 
get this case randomly and also if you

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:40.050 
get this case randomly and also if you
do<00:07:33.430> the<00:07:33.639> e<00:07:33.960> or<00:07:35.280> z<00:07:36.280> perm<00:07:36.699> incorrectly<00:07:38.760> so<00:07:39.760> then

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:40.060 
do the e or z perm incorrectly so then

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.830 
do the e or z perm incorrectly so then
this<00:07:40.990> is<00:07:41.260> very<00:07:41.530> easy<00:07:41.860> to<00:07:42.039> solve<00:07:42.550> so<00:07:43.479> the

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 
this is very easy to solve so the

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:54.090 
this is very easy to solve so the
algorithm<00:07:44.289> is<00:07:44.320> m2<00:07:45.360> u<00:07:46.360> m2<00:07:47.789> u<00:07:48.789> 2<00:07:49.150> m2<00:07:50.310> u<00:07:51.310> m2
