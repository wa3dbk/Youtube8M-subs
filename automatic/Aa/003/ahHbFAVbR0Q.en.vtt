00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
called it a contour blending brush I

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.119 
called it a contour blending brush I
mean<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.059> think<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.360> blend<00:00:48.840> colors<00:00:49.559> with<00:00:49.920> this

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
mean you think a blend colors with this

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.029 
mean you think a blend colors with this
but<00:00:50.940> it's<00:00:51.270> not<00:00:51.480> like<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:52.079> blending<00:00:53.010> brush

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
but it's not like a blending brush

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.529 
but it's not like a blending brush
because<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.550> blending<00:00:53.940> brush<00:00:53.969> will<00:00:54.300> really

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
because a blending brush will really

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.840 
because a blending brush will really
give<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.840> nice<00:00:55.110> blended<00:00:55.620> look<00:00:55.829> but<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.550> can

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
give you a nice blended look but you can

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.880 
give you a nice blended look but you can
definitely<00:00:57.300> control<00:00:57.809> with<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:58.739> your
