00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.160
 they are probably the most economical beetle 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.540
 at all the former slide cars 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.940
 be only by the engine of a 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.769
 battery drill developed and operated 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.769
 they were built as part of the project 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.839
 title car race total 48 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.160
 Apprentices from Volkswagen dabbled 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.180
 in six teams at the remote 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.580
 runabouts 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.619
 the project already takes place for the second 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.720
 Let's say this year instead of this year 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.580
 that just a little bit bigger 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.680
 As of last year, this time everyone is 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.529
 six locations are from vw ag in 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.399
 Germany and we will be here at three 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.380
 days on the expanding warstein in 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.149
 the apprentices built ten weeks 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.640
 the children's toy with the help of a 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.719
 Cordless drums and the results can 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.579
 be seen 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.289
 but the car is not only good 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.750
 they also have to look certain 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.579
 Guidelines meet at the Ideas Expo 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.649
 the products are made of kassel 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.230
 Salzgitter Brunswick Emden Hanover 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.719
 and wolfsburg currently on the test bench 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.359
 a jury evaluates the results of the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.280
 Teams in different exams in the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.470
 so-called parc fermÃ© will be the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.140
 checking compliance of the rule katalogs 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.030
 these include weight apart from ground clearance 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.520
 and materials but also the steering wheel 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.430
 radius and the time needed for one 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.020
 Battery change very satisfied the teams 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.430
 have implemented a lot of the program 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.890
 Of course there is one or the other 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.299
 other things where the rules 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.740
 maybe not 100 percent voted 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.479
 or where the team a little something 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.830
 has reinterpreted other but in the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.000
 On the whole, you can take care of it 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.220
 the ten weeks the teams spend 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.259
 they have been very much for the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.509
 ideas expo in hannover offers for the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.590
 Presentation of the converted cars 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.390
 ideal frame 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.520
 Thousands of people turn up at the fair every day 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.369
 students and teens for technical 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.259
 Professions enthusiastically with the beetle karl 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.420
 ace club volkswagen fun with 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.399
 technical can among other things 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.770
 while johanna bauer from the high 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.930
 performance engineering racing team 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.740
 salt grid she is aspiring 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.700
 electronic engineer for 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.799
 automation technology really good 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.149
 is that what we really do for the first time ? 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.350
 have really learned theoretically 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.840
 practically implement 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.119
 and as we have so much in the group and in the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.350
 team had to work together 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.910
 whole come also really much with 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.990
 nation and really 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.060
 interesting so the different 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.670
 opinions on everything to hear and beautiful 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.200
 to incorporate all this 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.060
 the remote controlled beetle need 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.560
 Of course, not only look good and the 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.600
 comply with the catalog 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.709
 in a parcours are the cars 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.110
 show what you can 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.880
 Here it comes in addition to speed too 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.340
 on precision and teamwork 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.400
 despite some difficulties that 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.630
 project inspires the trainees 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.970
 i would go that cool the times 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.910
 other works to compete 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.800
 such a project that is really fun and 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.819
 is something new in any case, we 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.290
 have friendship now 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.940
 closed also with salt concrete is 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.530
 actually interesting as well as how that 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.180
 have implemented the project one says 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.100
 we have also learned a lot 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.569
 So many people know new people 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.300
 I actually have a lot of fun with it 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.890
 the challenge of course all 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.810
 to master and I just have a lot 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.030
 have fun 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.370
 the highlights of the day the speed race 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.709
 and the so-called crawling come here 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.630
 the cars up to their limit 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.130
 to 100 kilograms last can 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.019
 pull remote controlled beetle 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.850
 it depends mainly on the 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.070
 different coloring of the individual 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.630
 materials 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.890
 like every formula 1 race it is like this 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.180
 that here at this speed race 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.950
 Of course, very driven on material 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.380
 be noticed already the one or 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.489
 other car already has the first one 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.540
 but two races won though 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.799
 then it could not work anymore 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.280
 compete because the material is easy 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.239
 Tired is an e bike car race 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.579
 not just about winning 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.400
 What counts is teamwork and 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.590
 the fun in the training at the end are 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.000
 Everyone agrees this is not that 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.000
 last race of the little whiz
