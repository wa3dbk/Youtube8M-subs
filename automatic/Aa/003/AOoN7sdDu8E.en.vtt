00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.630
 hello everyone how are you good at 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.350
 this video 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:14.130
 I'm going to show you how you can make a pc 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.920
 to pieces for the year 2013 of what 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.550
 better you can have for the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.410
 amount of 300 euros worth as I 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.079
 imagine you will not be a high-end PC 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.450
 but it is going to be a pc that is going to 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.849
 come very well for this year and the two or 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.990
 next three years as we will be able to 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.120
 do with everything 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.829
 well let's start a little comment 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.859
 what pieces are we going to put 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.170
 so you can see a little bit, which ones are going to 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.870
 be the features of this this pc 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.699
 it's worth first of all the motherboard what 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.939
 most importantly I have chosen a 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:55.710
 motherboard asus rog 960 gm things to have 

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:58.469
 in account of this good motherboard then 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.119
 has an am3 socket that will help us 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.600
 the thinker that we are going to use 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:06.630
 they have solid capacitors that is a 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.429
 very good trick since the plate we 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.490
 will last longer than having 

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:14.789
 normal capacitors is worth another 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.149
 Side supports ram ddr3 up to 1800 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:20.780
 megahertz 11 dual channel is worth this 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.570
 Then what do you mean 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.770
 for what is this plate the truth is 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.740
 that holds a big enough pretty 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.990
 decent ale and 8 gb of maximum of marc 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.450
 ram we can now put our 8 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.759
 gigas at the most that for us 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.090
 I will come Sobrado on the other hand leads 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.740
 an integrated radeon 3000 graphic with the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.690
 that we will be able to see for example videos 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:51.380
 1080p no problem in it and play 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.660
 some games already by itself then now 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.979
 we have an integrated audio card 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:01.909
 5.1 access a pc back and wait for 2.0 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.130
 by 16 for the graphics card one by 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.500
 one 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.569
 and we will use it for other small 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.810
 cards that we can incorporate and two 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.410
 ports pci then for 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.349
 pci cards voucher then comes with two 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.900
 sata cables a software that incorporates 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.300
 quite useful with various applications 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.710
 that we can come very well and four 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.570
 sata ports 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.910
 and a port and this is very important 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.130
 because if we have old hard drives 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.200
 we will be able to use them without any 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.820
 problem is worth this is one of the things 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.400
 why I chose this plate for 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.370
 I can use my thousand old hard drives 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.700
 on the other hand we move to the processor 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.100
 well I have chosen an md but in 2 965 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.250
 quad core is well known this 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.790
 processor is valid at a frequency of 3.4 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.440
 gigahertz is the black edition version 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.070
 good as things to highlight good a 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.850
 level 3 to 6 cache of 6 megs that does not 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.440
 is not bad includes a color that is not 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.660
 bad though if we want to make it 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.780
 overclock since this processor supports 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.430
 quite pretty overclock 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.010
 will be a bit short I would advise 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.650
 change it's worth then have a consumption of 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.180
 125 watts that compared to the 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.430
 thinkers that there are now new is a 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.680
 little elevated but 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.510
 the performance of this processor is 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.180
 for the price you have is very very 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.250
 well it is worth advising and even competes 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.420
 with some and 5 for you to make a 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:36.139
 idea is worth the good ram on the other hand 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:39.889
 rame chosen one thing and vengance ddr3 a 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:41.599
 1600 worth 4 gigs a module of 4 gb with 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.840
 our motherboard we could expand it 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:48.770
 up to 8 but I have chosen 4 gb since 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:52.580
 for our pc we will be fine 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:55.480
 it's quite cheap then with 4 GB 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.480
 let's go over 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.700
 On the other hand the good graphics card 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.010
 the graphics card I have chosen the best 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.810
 graphic card that I could so that 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.360
 we can play all the games there 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.360
 until now 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.670
 not full hd resolutions but if the 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.640
 medium high resolutions without any 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:19.590
 kind of problem worth is cute saffir 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:22.860
 hd 6670 radio of a giga drive gddr5 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.170
 highlight 800 megahertz frequency and 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.570
 memory frequencies 4000 megahertz is 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.550
 128 bit is worth with this card 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.300
 graphic we will be able to play at any 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.729
 game 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.110
 if we are very demanding we should 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:39.320
 buy one 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.830
 of greater range is worth but for this 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.430
 computer this card is the best one that 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.810
 you can find without any doubt 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.500
 on the other hand a hard drive because I have 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.449
 taken from the most basic we have a wd 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.050
 500 gb blue caviar 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:00.080
 at 7200 revolutions per minute good with 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.849
 this hard drive we are more than enough 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.589
 for anything we want to do 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:06.089
 If someone wants more capacity because 

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:08.729
 I would have to incorporate other discs 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:13.409
 hard but that this record so 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:16.619
 It's worth and what it is comes to us 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:20.279
 On the other hand, the dvd recorder 

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:23.869
 I have chosen a samsung 24 for then of 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:23.869
 the cheapest ones that we found since 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.480
 we do not mind having a cheaper or 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:33.100
 more expensive if there is someone who cares 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.200
 this aspect should be 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.450
 I should change it for a better one but 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.650
 let's go the objective of this computer is 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:46.330
 get the maximum is the maximum 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:48.400
 power for the lowest price is worth and for 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.650
 On the other side, the good tower I have chosen this 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:56.129
 tower because apart from that it is very cheap 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:57.809
 I like it, it's a clone , it fits 404 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:00.419
 The good thing about this tower is that 

00:05:57.809 --> 00:06:01.979
 Includes a 500-watt high x source 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.629
 Okay we are not going to have to buy a 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:06.839
 source apart then by very little 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:10.080
 price we have the tower with the source and 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:13.289
 also with things to add, we can 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.649
 put up to 4 cd-rom and has 4 bays 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:19.110
 for hard drives, I see it 

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:21.179
 very complete tower also has we can 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.029
 incorporate up to three fans 

00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:26.300
 12 by 12 in terms of cooling 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:28.699
 as well 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.370
 it can come to us quite well and the 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:33.979
 truth is that I liked it and that's why 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.900
 final I have chosen this ballet is good 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:39.530
 last we will collect plaque based on 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:44.259
 42 euros processors 75 euros memory 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:49.400
 ram 20 euros graphic 70 hard disk 50 

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:52.159
 DVD recorder 15 and tower plus source 28 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.319
 good as you can see the prices are very 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:58.479
 very very adjusted to give us a 

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:58.479
 total of 300 euros dumped
