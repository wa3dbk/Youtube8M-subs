00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 there was an annual weekly in colorado 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.480
 Uspen Security Forum where 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.140
 Chief of the General Staff of the United States General Martin 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.960
 dempsey 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.309
 accused Russia of provoking 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.950
 nationalism in europe that is 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.179
 Bandera provoke their neo-Nazism 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.430
 Muscovites themselves 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.039
 they also generally make Ukraine fall 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.980
 jumping on the forum did not talk about what 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.289
 Ukraine needs usa as a bridgehead at its side 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.570
 Russia as the epicenter of the conflict as 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.849
 sales market and weapons but that's what 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.269
 it is possible a step towards salvation 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.079
 USA 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.570
 thought through his salvation to america 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.239
 debt relief is big and profitable 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.160
 the war and there is not even particularly hide 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.190
 The head of the US General Staff announced his readiness 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.910
 fight while not mentioning her cancer not 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.610
 Afghanistan 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.770
 for some reason he spoke a lot to Russia my 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.730
 colleague konstantin semen about war and 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.239
 Economy early July two charming 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.160
 the ladies agreed for easy conversation in 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.140
 one of the Washington meeting rooms 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.539
 left Christine lagard head 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.729
 International Monetary Fund on the right with 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.180
 Janet Yellen Head of American 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.650
 Fedre you wonderfully told 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.689
 about all the efforts that were 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.430
 taken if we talk about the whole 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.090
 the universe under your 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.340
 guidance 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.439
 but this universe lately 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.930
 struck several parallel 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.150
 universes and considering all the tools 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.670
 the whole arsenal of reception in which you have 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.450
 by and large what are you going to do 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.220
 with this shadow banking sector 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.170
 you have now indicated what it represents 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.790
 giant challenge for us we are just 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.040
 must understand that even after the introduction 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.869
 legal restrictions anyway 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.909
 there is a chance that the situation will come out 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.979
 out of control the mouse won't even notice 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.180
 of this it will become a huge problem for 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.530
 us and what to do with it 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.149
 I have no answers for this fancy 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.140
 phraseological tango lurking alone 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.820
 unpleasant fact 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.009
 from the pyramid of public and private 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.350
 debt has reached such proportions 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.649
 that one random movement can 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.719
 bury the whole world economy not 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.149
 zero not even negative interest 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.429
 rates are not quantitative easing then 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.259
 there is simply money printing never 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.040
 stopped the crisis going on already 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.360
 sixth year 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.340
 injections of dollars and euros only led to 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.020
 outrageous growth of stock quotes 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.660
 but it had no effect on not 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.910
 production not on global demand not 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.020
 for real unemployment 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.810
 world economy finally 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.240
 turned into a giant casino 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.400
 if in 2008 the total volume of derivatives 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.370
 risky speculative contracts 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.830
 was 500 trillion dollars then to 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.060
 the end of this year the figure is approaching 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.240
 two quadrillion as it can be written off 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.460
 aggressive policy of the united states 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.760
 intensified along with the beginning 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.350
 economic crisis in 2008 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.810
 it is known when benefits are 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.510
 the capitalist system serves them 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.780
 need to hold anyway 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.400
 seeks to raise early May to the committee 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.220
 on international affairs american 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.230
 congress was introduced so-called act 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.160
 preventing Russian aggression 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.290
 beat number 2277 may seem like 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.280
 he was made up by a republican senator from 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.130
 Tennessee State 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.860
 bob corker even if it is like that 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.590
 prompted Boeing apartment lockheed 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.360
 martin northug grumman general dinamix 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.300
 and other largest manufacturers 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.920
 armament bill radically 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.770
 increases defense spending and 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.660
 financing of objects in Europe for 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.290
 listed corporations it means 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.840
 one military orders non terrorism not 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.480
 Russians or Chinese about budget cuts 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.930
 Here is the main challenge with which in conditions 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.790
 crisis faced the pentagon 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.360
 imperialist fatherland his 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.370
 military-industrial complex in danger 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.750
 current budget cuts reduce our 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.210
 strategic opportunities 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.860
 I'm in the army for 40 years I never 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.110
 had to be in a situation when i 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.920
 would have to choose which order I 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.410
 can do 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.380
 and what sequestration does not make our country 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.880
 vulnerable to external pressure 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.280
 is it really possible to lower the military 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.390
 expenses if the Russians start a new one 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.460
 cold war 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.490
 generally lounging in a dempsey chair 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.690
 said a lot worth listening to 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.609
 we see the Russian government 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.320
 decided to use the military 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.270
 force relative to independent 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.600
 foreign state is the first 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.180
 case may be since 1939 please note 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.950
 the us army is not afraid to fight a country can 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.450
 think differently but we will execute any order 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.550
 tell us about the Russian army like 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.760
 our military capabilities we relate 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.470
 It is still way ahead of conventional 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.240
 Armaments of course although the Russian army 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.010
 became more professional not 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.290
 as professional of course as 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.180
 we and our allies they raised their 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.080
 combat readiness earlier they didn't even 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.750
 conducted exercises 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.790
 but keep in mind most of all they invested in 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.500
 strategic weapons and technology 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.570
 in technology that should 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.419
 neutralize our benefits 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.790
 now in the Senate Democrats on 3 chairs 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.820
 more than republicans however the choice and 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.919
 soon if ok 2277 will be accepted 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.990
 Congress and Obama will sign it 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.090
 Ukraine will be given the status of military 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.669
 ally usa and even if in september 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:19.590
 Ukraine Georgia and Moldova does not attach to 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:22.419
 nato this will change little in essence 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.220
 As a result, the United States make Ukraine their 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.080
 military ally beyond contract 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.010
 nato since europe is still 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.720
 doubts 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.870
 This means that American troops 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.820
 can be sent to ukraine you in 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.040
 Russia can calm yourself but what 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.140
 there is a declaration of war 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.270
 if any of your politicians 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.430
 talk about western partners they 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.680
 must understand you have no western 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.110
 partners you have western opponents 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.820
 that's why your country is in the eyes 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.770
 Americans trying to expose 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.330
 source of threat comparable to 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.370
 Nazi Germany 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.680
 it is a serene Polish town

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:01.300
 base available here will be turned into 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:03.490
 Centre 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.199
 quick response to the case 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.189
 escalation of armed conflict in 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.409
 eastern europe 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:09.520
 when will have to turn to the fifth chapter 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:12.129
 Alliance Charter 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.530
 attack on 1 means being on 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:16.539
 all of them are no longer hypothetical 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.120
 opportunity and direct preparation for combat 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:21.430
 action on the continent news agency 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.500
 quoted unnamed source in nato 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.960
 the Russians decided to use force for 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.940
 achieving their goals is at odds with 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.979
 principles on which 25 years 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.110
 lined up a security system in 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:33.759
 Europe in the US week sent to Kiev

 new group of military specialists 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:38.800
 Poroshenko's army has long been transferred to

 american dry bread hammer and tools 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.319

 holland australia german press 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.150
 actively prepares the audience for what 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:54.219
 Bundeswehr soon 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.500
 may have to perform the task for 

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:58.150
 the border is all this every day more and more 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.180
 reminds the intervention of times 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.940
 civil 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.600
 big war with someone else's hands on someone else's 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.440
 territories 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:09.050
 the concept is old but from no less 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.610
 attractive her conservatives 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.220
 for some reason does not believe that the whole world will be 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.080
 on the verge of catastrophe they are convinced that this 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.850
 touches only Russia they are now 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.449
 profess the doctrine which holds that 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.580
 USA 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:21.050
 so big nuclear superiority 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.479
 Russia should be what they should 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.190
 take advantage of the window of opportunity 

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:27.620
 like to bows legs at 60 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:30.100
 to crush Russia if needed 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.630
 using a preemptive nuclear strike 

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.820
 this window of opportunity does not close 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:37.370
 just because russia china is strengthened 

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.440

 perceived by the west as a direct challenge 

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:46.370
 hegemony of the international monetary fund 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:48.560
 and dollar and brix countries only china is not 

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.990
 experienced the iron grip imf 

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.729
 now in the event of a state crisis
