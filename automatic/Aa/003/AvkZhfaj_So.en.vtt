 to a new video on my good channel today 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.790
 the truth that I had planned to upload a 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.309
 videoblog but all that I have a 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.349

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:22.890
 in that law but I noticed a cable r 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.810
 first of all tomorrow I take out the assembly 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.930
 tomorrow will be mounted after 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.879
 practically a year because already tomorrow 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.950
 the day arrived and tomorrow I take out the assembly 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:38.790
 The truth is that for me it has been a challenge 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.519
 staff and I am very very satisfied with 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.460
 the final result and with the work that 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.640
 has done that has done valjean has 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.289
 Rather currado 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.180
 We are very handsome and I loved the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.839
 assembly in fact when I pass it to me what 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.320
 I saw him sayo seven times in a row and 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.019
 love me the montage I love and like 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.030
 I say the first one that I played 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.320
 to get me clips not like some edits 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.690
 that I have around here for the channel that 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.140
 they were about me playing and if I got 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.530
 something that I liked because I put it not 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.170
 you studied you ended up playing me 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.970
 to get me clips but good 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.570
 I will now put the screen will 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.880
 put a devil or an image that puts 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.429
 the internet connection that I have 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.539
 because there are people that good that I do not 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:29.490
 wants when I say that I have bad 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.580
 connection so I'll put it right now 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.240
 I'm seeing now on screen 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.070
 connection that I have 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.020

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.360
 I'm fucking the temperature changes 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.479
 Well the truth is that for me it has been 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:54.000
 a personal challenge not celestial this montage 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:57.570
 and at the end of the video there is like one with 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.039
 a part of gratitude I say 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.280
 already because I know someone wins me said 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.930
 exposed to such make such in case 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.340
 maybe you go through the video of luck a 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.869
 like or something 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.250
 I know someone is going to put me that is 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.800
 good but the people who have put 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.239
 final thank-you means that 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.880
 in one way or another they have helped me 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:19.220
 they have inspired me 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.220
 motivation on youtube 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.690
 I do not say it because I'm sure someone 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.250
 will drop because any asshole 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.940
 so so 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.330
 the truth is that it has been pretty cool 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.900
 play all this year to get my clips 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.970
 see the montage as I say I put the 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.550
 people that for me has been more more 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.830
 important on youtube and that what has 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.830
 helped me I made videos with them 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.190
 even if I have not made videos with them 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.250
 but they have motivated me pretty 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.520
 for example to which to those who at 23 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.690
 that I have enough put like in a 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.420
 small altar would consume richard and 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.830
 maybe willy can I fly and 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.130
 when I started I did not see it that much but 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.480
 yes that 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.350
 when it started it was quite constant and 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.350
 what follows it remains 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.870
 sorry 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.750
 continues when I started I started watching videos 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.080
 from richter consumer but good about 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.970
 the case case apart 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.990
 so I'm really looking forward to that 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.180
 tomorrow you see the assembly as I say tomorrow 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.310
 in the description you will have the channel of 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.930
 valjean and the valiant tweet that has 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.130
 been the valjean twitter that has been 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.900
 edited the reassembly and the truth is that 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.690
 to do my first I'm pretty 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.000
 happy with the result 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.570
 forgive my voice and you will lose your study without 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.490
 sheet plan or but is that yesterday by the 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:57.460
 night I had a fever I'm based on 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:04:00.990
 ibuprofen does not stop them and so on 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.990
 since it has the tip shit 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.380
 and yes I wanted to tell you about this pair of 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.370
 things 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.370
 in the video 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.879
 a little more what 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.510
 to comment or just go back to 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:19.880
 thank you to see tomorrow if you 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.970
 like assembly as much as it has 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.710
 I liked it and I loved it 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.540
 I say with step number because I saw it as 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:33.639
 like six seven times in a row and I hope 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:39.460
 that has the same affectation 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:42.699
 in you that is the least that could 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.639
 what could I expect from a video I have 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.289
 preparing so very long the truth is 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.020
 that I have improved a lot with the sniper 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:52.689
 that a year ago decided to dedicate more 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.249
 time to the channel to the sniper and to the 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:58.870
 less less gameplay improved enough 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:02.740
 rather than outrageous what is 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.789
 improved and as I say I'm very happy 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:09.789
 very happy with the final result of 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:12.279
 neural press so tomorrow I hope that 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:15.610
 you too are satisfied 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:17.919
 because I've been and the least since 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.990
 It would be what you also like 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.610
 be the assembly so good tomorrow 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.039
