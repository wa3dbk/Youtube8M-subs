00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 so he stood there for me yes you have to 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.210
 to beat yourself as well as the whole 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.000
 beat people here at prime market 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.389
 he was always the free market of all that 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.389
 yes, how 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.179
 hey welcome to another bed box 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.579
 the camera display when you start times today 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:31.460
 back bed wars took so long 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:35.300
 not anymore and that's why me 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:44.269
 Do you bring something up again today? 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:45.290
 the commissioner was finished betraying 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.280
 Welcome every case 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:54.850
 I hope you all get into the 2 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:58.460
 and you still have your courage up to date 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:02.239
 There's nothing big to tell why today 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.630
 the result was mÃ©gane as we have something 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.460
 found what changed the world yes no 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.240
 but really what was next to us 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.710
 can bring 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:37.579
 but we still have a few things missing 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:43.549
 this one wants to expect you know I 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:44.719
 I saw that he should come and 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.289
 then I just have him down 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.289
 protected 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.509
 he keeps it as it sometimes falls already 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.259
 I thought for a long time 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.329
 next neighbors everything red with who to 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.799
 red by turns I'm currently playing 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.389
 that works pretty well, too, so I have fun 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.920
 just round it round by round 

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:05.329
 round getting more and more and more 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.729
 to accomplish 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:10.220
 and at sg we are really far 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.770
 direction 10.000 christa players private 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.950
 from time to time just like that for me 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.500
 so to play sun 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.800
 it's a bit difficult than 87 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.250
 necessarily always play to play 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:30.590
 I woke so many times back to 17 10 then 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.740
 or 1 in 2 because that's so nice 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.740
 beautiful 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.940
 is more pleasant to do with the 17 pvp 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.780
 you can just rave a lot better 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.700
 and everything else 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:49.780
 that's why it gets on everyone from me 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:52.720
 that's why the winter week is right 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.850
 unfamiliar with the 17 stop for example 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:00.040
 pvp to make it just not so cool 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:05.470
 orange was destroyed while blue there 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:08.190
 nice as both have no bed anymore 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.190
 you pay attention 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.780
 but I doubt he knows that me 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.540
 most likely behind him is that 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.370
 the you have that he might not know 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.110
 right now he will buy something and 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.240
 then immediately want to go further 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:28.410
 if one tries to build up 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:31.630
 and it's gone well that until tomorrow 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.300
 wednesday i think i'm good at the color 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:40.120
 but that is there so beautiful I am there 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:45.100
 just once one of the city just him 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.500
 so jobs let me down bock on it 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.420
 so he stood there for me yes you have to 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.940
 always strike as well as the whole people 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.180
 beat here at prime market 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.700
 he was always at free market because of all 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.290
 then the women want to go behind me 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.100
 know the female persons 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.340
 that's the WBC itself since the middle of the 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:11.800
 Things are not in the shop at what is not 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:13.480
 Bad is like a man and no idea 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.210
 that is a completely different world for me 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.950
 I'm so reluctant to ever 

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.420
 I'll go to her because 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.670
 I find this so unpleasant 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.710
 do not know what the people think about it 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.710
 that's how awesome hell is 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:35.020
 gold imperium up and the sg update 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.410
 is still there 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.590
 Of course there was a lot of wave of 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.670
 a few people house 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:47.570
 still live 2.0 one that the principle 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:50.600
 I already know that before 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.880
 confused what people will do that 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.610
 that will be endless discussion though 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.610
 clearly the topic believes that is so 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.820
 an endless war if you choose 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.220
 complained that after that later 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:08.840
 just so if you are so great 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:13.480
 I think everything is so exemplary 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.960
 also 24 and 28 the different servers 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.570
 to gamble 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.080
 it just makes fun mini power 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.720
 play 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.940
 That's why I play because it's fun 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.470
 very shocking most likely 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:31.310
 many of which is the solarwatt ag fun 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.620
 what's wrong with the boy though 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.270
 So you have to see there you have to 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.060
 you simply have to live with it 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.060
 I live with most games I come 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.190
 but I also like to play as I said 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.420
 sometimes network around there a bit 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.740
 going to feel that makes me really fun 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:54.380
 I do not necessarily show both 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:55.970
 mine because hot is not my world 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.100
 I say that's not my world 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:01.670
 Let's say that's how we hit it 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:05.360
 like on the half that is so 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:08.020
 the two have you there extremely because of this 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.060
 points principle while no one die 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.080
 everyone wants to be the best and hottest 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.150
 by the State ago 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.460
 and that's why they're right on three 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.380
 Years ago, you really have to watch what's there 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.340
 going 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.460
 that's why holding is not my world 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.670
 I do not get along with people who do that 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.860
 But to play that are playing there right 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:32.840
 so use that can be also play 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:35.980
 you right now I'm at Langel was 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.980
 or can push 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:43.030
 a discussion was funny again 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:45.070
 get things first then things 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:49.510
 can with the youtuber things on us 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:51.790
 would have a higher range would be unfair yes 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:54.480
 no higher man is definitely two 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.480
 not anymore years 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:04.750
 ntp is on four blocks at all 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:06.520
 If someone likes to youtuber people 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.890
 she wants to be able to 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.890
 on that also plays in the sg play 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:14.950
 I have a blatant person , I have to 

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:21.010
 so say the conditions have found 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:23.200
 I have a really gross range and so 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.480
 the best I found the claim that 

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:31.420
 at the youtube or she fools 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:33.630
 have better invited in chests how come 

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:37.270
 so on the idea 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:38.740
 I thought that was funny as well, we see 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.330
 us to another episode again from 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.190
 redbox I liked you if so 

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:45.300
 jobs in the comments decided that 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.300
 next video until then
