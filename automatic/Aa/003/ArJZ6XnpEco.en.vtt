00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
I've seen pictures of it in motoring

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.730 
I've seen pictures of it in motoring
magazines<00:00:05.730> yeah<00:00:06.120> so<00:00:06.509> wanted<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.379> take<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.560> look

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
magazines yeah so wanted to take a look

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.650 
magazines yeah so wanted to take a look
at<00:00:07.859> it<00:00:07.950> in<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.130> metal<00:00:08.429> see<00:00:09.179> whether<00:00:09.330> it<00:00:09.480> lived

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
at it in the metal see whether it lived

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.990 
at it in the metal see whether it lived
up<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.870> its<00:00:10.080> promise<00:00:10.230> I<00:00:10.769> think<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.610> veteran

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
up to its promise I think the veteran

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.539 
up to its promise I think the veteran
was<00:00:12.090> quite<00:00:12.330> utility<00:00:12.990> but<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.769> insignia<00:00:14.250> seems

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
was quite utility but the insignia seems

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.810 
was quite utility but the insignia seems
to<00:00:14.670> have<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.820> lot<00:00:14.880> more<00:00:15.410> special<00:00:16.410> touches<00:00:17.070> that

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
to have a lot more special touches that

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.060 
to have a lot more special touches that
the<00:00:18.000> design<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.720> circular<00:00:19.500> design<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
the design the circular design of the

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.310 
the design the circular design of the
dash<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.520> quite<00:00:20.730> appealing<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:22.109> certainly

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
dash is quite appealing and it certainly

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.259 
dash is quite appealing and it certainly
seems<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.740> have<00:00:22.830> good<00:00:22.949> technology<00:00:23.609> reminded

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
think people my age dreams would go for

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.320 
think people my age dreams would go for
it<00:01:50.069> matters<00:01:50.399> more<00:01:50.580> to<00:01:50.640> me<00:01:50.819> that<00:01:51.149> they're

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
it matters more to me that they're

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.359 
it matters more to me that they're
trying<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.750> do<00:01:51.869> more<00:01:52.049> with<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.350> miles<00:01:53.159> per

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
trying to do more with the miles per

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.219 
trying to do more with the miles per
gallon<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:54.149> know<00:01:54.270> not<00:01:54.479> not<00:01:54.810> particularly

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
gallon you know not not particularly

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.050 
gallon you know not not particularly
looking<00:01:55.350> at<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.619> diesels<00:01:56.069> which<00:01:56.789> I<00:01:56.909> think

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
looking at the diesels which I think

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.630 
looking at the diesels which I think
they've<00:01:57.440> you<00:01:58.440> know<00:01:58.530> it'll<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.100> more<00:01:59.280> than<00:01:59.429> my

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
they've you know it'll do more than my

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.779 
they've you know it'll do more than my
existing<00:02:00.149> one<00:02:00.179> which<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.630> also<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> diesel<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:02.759> I

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
existing one which is also a diesel so I

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:03.800 
existing one which is also a diesel so I
think<00:02:02.880> they're<00:02:03.090> moved<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.479> right<00:02:03.630> way

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
think they're moved in the right way

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.590 
think they're moved in the right way
considering<00:02:04.170> such<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.440> bigger<00:02:04.619> car<00:02:04.890> then<00:02:05.789> you

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
considering such a bigger car then you

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.300 
considering such a bigger car then you
know<00:02:06.690> that<00:02:06.720> matters<00:02:07.110> more<00:02:07.319> to<00:02:07.380> me<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.619> do<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:08.039> lot

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
know that matters more to me I do a lot

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.210 
know that matters more to me I do a lot
of<00:02:08.340> miles<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.479> would<00:02:10.080> certainly<00:02:10.259> make<00:02:11.160> a

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
of miles and that would certainly make a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.550 
of miles and that would certainly make a
big<00:02:11.430> difference<00:02:11.609> over<00:02:11.880> time<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.930> controls

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
big difference over time the controls

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.930 
big difference over time the controls
are<00:02:13.709> quite<00:02:13.890> light<00:02:14.070> buttons<00:02:14.489> I<00:02:14.640> don't<00:02:14.850> know

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
are quite light buttons I don't know

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.420 
are quite light buttons I don't know
anything<00:02:15.480> that's<00:02:15.750> too<00:02:15.930> obtuse<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.160> seems

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
anything that's too obtuse and it seems

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.910 
anything that's too obtuse and it seems
to<00:02:17.519> me<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.880> there<00:02:18.060> were

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
to me that there were

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.770 
to me that there were
things<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.490> need<00:02:19.640> which<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.660> me

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
things that you need which to me

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.930 
things that you need which to me
suggests<00:02:21.020> that<00:02:21.470> it's<00:02:21.920> then<00:02:22.130> easy<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.610> control

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
suggests that it's then easy to control

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.600 
suggests that it's then easy to control
when<00:02:23.300> you're<00:02:23.420> driving<00:02:23.950> whereas<00:02:24.950> if<00:02:25.190> you've

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
when you're driving whereas if you've

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.130 
when you're driving whereas if you've
got<00:02:25.790> these<00:02:25.940> idea<00:02:26.270> of<00:02:26.540> things<00:02:28.270> but<00:02:29.270> you<00:02:29.989> never

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
got these idea of things but you never

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.330 
got these idea of things but you never
quite<00:02:30.440> know<00:02:30.500> what<00:02:30.770> you're<00:02:30.890> going<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.069> come<00:02:31.220> up

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
quite know what you're going to come up

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.190 
quite know what you're going to come up
with<00:02:31.370> dude<00:02:31.640> oh<00:02:31.910> that's<00:02:32.239> very<00:02:32.660> eye-catching

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
with dude oh that's very eye-catching

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.640 
with dude oh that's very eye-catching
very<00:02:33.890> appealing<00:02:34.220> very<00:02:34.910> very<00:02:35.540> sleek<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:38.650> I'd

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
very appealing very very sleek and I'd

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.070 
very appealing very very sleek and I'd
be<00:02:39.890> I'd<00:02:40.100> like<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.430> drive<00:02:40.580> one<00:02:40.790> give<00:02:41.569> me<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.810> very

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
be I'd like to drive one give me a very

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.440 
be I'd like to drive one give me a very
and<00:02:42.459> gives<00:02:43.459> you<00:02:43.550> a<00:02:43.580> lot<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.760> status<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.300> grab

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
and gives you a lot of status to grab

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.479 
and gives you a lot of status to grab
one<00:02:44.480> of<00:02:44.660> those<00:02:44.810> things<00:02:45.040> makes<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.130> feel<00:02:46.310> very

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
one of those things makes you feel very

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.120 
one of those things makes you feel very
high-powered<00:02:46.880> I<00:02:47.709> think<00:02:48.709> it's<00:02:48.860> certainly

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
high-powered I think it's certainly

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.100 
high-powered I think it's certainly
better<00:02:49.310> looking<00:02:49.670> than<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.849> Mondeo<00:02:50.239> yes<00:02:50.810> which

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
better looking than the Mondeo yes which

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.720 
better looking than the Mondeo yes which
i<00:02:51.200> think<00:02:51.319> is<00:02:51.470> events<00:02:51.830> on<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:52.010> brick<00:02:52.220> like<00:02:52.370> with

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
i think is events on a brick like with

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.290 
i think is events on a brick like with
it<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:54.170> certainly<00:02:55.010> is<00:02:55.310> class<00:02:55.580> I'd<00:02:55.910> say<00:02:56.120> it's

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
it and certainly is class I'd say it's

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.449 
it and certainly is class I'd say it's
probably<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.630> best-looking<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.950> events<00:02:58.310> is

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
probably the best-looking the events is

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.750 
probably the best-looking the events is
he<00:02:59.060> talking<00:02:59.420> about<00:02:59.450> that<00:03:00.190> car<00:03:01.190> that's<00:03:01.220> really

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
he talking about that car that's really

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.940 
he talking about that car that's really
boring<00:03:01.880> looks<00:03:02.569> like<00:03:02.690> a<00:03:02.720> hearse<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:03.290> think

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
boring looks like a hearse I think

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.610 
boring looks like a hearse I think
you've<00:03:04.069> won<00:03:04.100> that<00:03:04.430> one
