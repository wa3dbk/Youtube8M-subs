00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 two 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:25.680
 how about friends of passion mobile good today 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:29.230
 we have the unboxing of lanix and that 620 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.990
 it's a low-end smartphone program 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.180
 media depends on me with what eyes what 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.760
 look, since we 've had several 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.440
 comments that we have been told in several 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.059
 videos in which we sometimes say that it is 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.910
 low-end and they tell us that it's from the 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:46.090
 medium but good that we're going to leave 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.330
 interpretation of each and I 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.770
 I consider that each device then in 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.420
 basis to what is the experience of 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.430
 user at the price and above all 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.220
 specifications because that is what 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.100
 finally determines if a smartphone is 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.230
 of low or medium range but then there are people 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.610
 that in view of what they want their 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.560
 devices are better what 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.950
 it really is sometimes they say they get to 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.130
 half 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.920
 well, this is the well sealed box 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.549
 what can they see, they sent it to us 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.539
 friends from lanix mexico may the granddaughter is 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.850
 Mexican but I can hand the corporate 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:25.819
 and put a little bit of work to remove 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.310
 these stamps that brand in the box 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:33.159
 as open today there is 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.670
 let's open then to see what it brings in 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.670
 its interior 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.990
 and there it is 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.130
 I told you a little bit, the shot is 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.760
 in this peculiar bag that we have seen 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.920
 on three occasions same boxing of linux 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.180
 and x the device that the truth is 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.660
 which is a little bit bigger than what 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.510
 I had thought I have this screen 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:08.970
 5 inches and an 8 megapixel camera 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:12.160
 a media processor with 4 cores and 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:17.470
 we found android kitkat we are going to 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:20.860
 take it off and we're going to stick it on the 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.470
 external part of the box plus part of 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:28.030
 above we will see what we find 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.280
 because the box has with this box as 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.520
 velvet inner part for 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.989
 protect the device and here what 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.900
 we obviously have since it's the 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:42.560
 removable battery 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:46.120
 which is 2000 thousand in pÃ©rez 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.890
 a million perez is not bad 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.260
 obviously it has a little more 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.420
 capacity that other teams sometimes 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.879
 lanix because obviously the screen of 5 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.780
 inches then demand this amount of 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:02.019
 energy not knowing what else we find 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.660
 We have here the card as and serve for 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.819
 load it 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.540
 electricity of the device 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.209
 Y 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.510
 Obviously, in fact, look at this 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.980
 of good quality in this plastic like 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.000
 mate that feels good a texture 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.240
 nice in this charger 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.620
 pretty small practical and what 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.540
 probably other manufacturers then 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.790
 they bring the much larger loaders 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.000
 that in the end when connecting the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.800
 several in one in this last 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.290
 multicontacts is sometimes impractical 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.150
 this type of contacts are the ideal 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.410
 because obviously they do not interfere or 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.090
 forward or back 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.010
 it is here says lux 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.380
 very well also for the knicks with this 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:53.380
 charger and we have a hearing aids 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.200
 which I suppose are going to be of quality 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.930
 average of what we would expect in a 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.420
 equipment of these characteristics has 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.950
 this part of metal milestone is nothing 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.990
 bad and they are the kind of vehicles that 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.150
 they like that they are not of gomita that 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.520
 they have to insert that nothing else is left 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.700
 as slightly above the ear in 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.610
 the auditory canal and this one feels 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.440
 well it's a plastic let's say not so 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.739
 How could I not wait for the hour? 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.220
 pretty good that his hands free there 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.270
 is and well here we have manuals 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.550
 guarantees and things like that 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.040
 who nobody 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.590
 because we are going to put the battery to 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.000
 smartphone let's take the fifth and 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.240
 other protective plastic 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.810
 and other protective plastic 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.810
 above 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.030
 there they are 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:53.020
 and now if this is the device it 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.020
 open up here 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.460
 has this type of casing that covers 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:06.960
 all the lateral part and the back part 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:06.960
 and inside it is not like that the amics s 620 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:15.760
 this one for the without this side we have the 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:19.120
 slot for microsd the camera and the flash and 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:22.620
 finally reactivates the battery 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.620
 we simply cover it 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.970
 and it takes a little work 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.970
 upwards but 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.910
 good even though the device feels 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.910
 solid right now to open it the truth is 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:43.240
 that the adjustment is not quite right 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:46.210
 of what the outer case is I do not 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.690
 he liked it is the sound he makes but 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.690
 there is 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.610
 in this 8 megapixel camera and we're going 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:58.160
 to turn it on to quickly see how 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.570
 looks the screen with which at first 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.730
 impression I can tell you that the 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.960
 resolution definitely leaves something that 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.970
 to wish although I do not know if maybe it 's 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.080
 the splash screen and indeed after 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.830
 screen that is in a resolution 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.039
 lower 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:15.090
 each screen looks a little better here to 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.090
 first glance 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:22.340
 let's omit omit omit omit 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.780
 ways 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.400
 until we arrive 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:31.270
 to the Home screen 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.270
 and 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.890
 ok there we arrived 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.560
 and here we have 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.390
 we have a pretty version of android 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:56.900
 clean although we have several 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.250
 third and pre-installed applications 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.400
 although we will see that many have 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:06.210
 you want and have you say the the regular lot 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.430
 of this type of device nothing out 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:11.100
 of the ordinary I tell you after 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.840
 works well let's do an analysis 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.850
 obviously full of this smartphone 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:18.000
 just like we always do this 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.830
 it was just the unboxing for let's say a 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.230
 First impression show what's coming 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:24.540
 in the box but it's a full scan 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:26.670
 to know how is your camera what 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.970
 such is in performance as well as others 

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:31.770
 details that we will tell you in 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:35.700
 the next few weeks when we publish 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:37.920
 the full video of this smartphone in 

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.140
 the Danish and which are manufacturers 

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:43.110
 Mexicans as I was telling you that it has gone 

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:45.360
 improving over the years and 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.310
 now they are very involved in all this of 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.010
 mobility with smartphones then 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:52.289
 so you can subscribe to our 

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:56.629
 channel and schleck to videos by 

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:56.629
 this is mobile passion
