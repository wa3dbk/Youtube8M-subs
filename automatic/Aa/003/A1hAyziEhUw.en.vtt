etc<00:01:56.579> etc<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:58.009> that's<00:01:59.009> that's<00:01:59.310> always<00:01:59.640> good<00:01:59.820> and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
etc etc so that's that's always good and

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.690 
etc etc so that's that's always good and
then<00:02:00.210> back<00:02:00.360> here<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.719> can<00:02:00.869> see<00:02:01.340> your<00:02:02.340> camera

to get get I guess you can see lay on

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.289 
to get get I guess you can see lay on
the<00:03:30.359> table<00:03:30.389> you<00:03:30.930> have<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.769> lay<00:03:31.859> on<00:03:31.979> the<00:03:32.069> table

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
the table you have that lay on the table

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.509 
the table you have that lay on the table
design<00:03:33.299> so<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.079> can<00:03:34.290> lay<00:03:34.409> it<00:03:34.530> face<00:03:34.650> down<00:03:34.709> or<00:03:35.099> on

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
design so you can lay it face down or on

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.789 
design so you can lay it face down or on
the<00:03:35.760> back<00:03:35.909> now<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.780> does<00:03:36.959> have<00:03:37.169> that<00:03:37.319> thing

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
the back now it does have that thing

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.729 
the back now it does have that thing
like<00:03:38.099> gets<00:03:38.849> kind<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.209> raised<00:03:39.389> here<00:03:39.930> just<00:03:40.590> like

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
like gets kind of raised here just like

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.369 
like gets kind of raised here just like
the<00:03:40.979> capsule<00:03:41.519> neo<00:03:41.699> so<00:03:42.180> on<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.780> table<00:03:43.169> it<00:03:43.229> can

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
the capsule neo so on a table it can

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:44.509 
the capsule neo so on a table it can
spin<00:03:43.590> if<00:03:43.829> you<00:03:43.919> want<00:03:44.069> to<00:03:44.129> put<00:03:44.250> one<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.459> those

spin if you want to put one of those

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.550 
spin if you want to put one of those
swirly<00:03:44.939> things<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.689> can<00:03:45.840> make<00:03:45.870> someone<00:03:46.169> busy
