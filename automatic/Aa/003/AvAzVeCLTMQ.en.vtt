okay<00:03:43.790> now<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.030> neck<00:03:44.360> we<00:03:45.290> have<00:03:45.379> a<00:03:45.440> compound

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
okay now the neck we have a compound

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.619 
okay now the neck we have a compound
radius<00:03:46.280> here<00:03:46.519> the<00:03:46.970> nine<00:03:47.150> and<00:03:47.180> a<00:03:47.300> half<00:03:47.330> inches

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
radius here the nine and a half inches

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.830 
radius here the nine and a half inches
here<00:03:48.170> twelve<00:03:49.129> inches<00:03:49.610> here<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:50.209> it's<00:03:50.660> about

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
here twelve inches here so it's about

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.080 
here twelve inches here so it's about
ten<00:03:51.140> inches<00:03:51.380> in<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:52.010> middle<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.849> nine<00:03:53.060> a

ten inches in the middle and the nine a

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.449 
ten inches in the middle and the nine a
half<00:03:53.420> inch<00:03:53.660> radius<00:03:53.870> is<00:03:54.260> rounder<00:03:55.069> so<00:03:55.310> it's

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
half inch radius is rounder so it's

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:02.380 
half inch radius is rounder so it's
comfortable<00:03:55.849> for<00:03:56.000> chord<00:03:56.510> playing<00:04:01.360> down<00:04:02.360> here

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
comfortable for chord playing down here

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.720 
comfortable for chord playing down here
and<00:04:02.870> then<00:04:03.349> the<00:04:03.440> flatter<00:04:03.709> radius<00:04:04.190> up<00:04:04.370> here<00:04:04.610> is

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
and then the flatter radius up here is

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.770

thing sticking in your hand there and

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.890 
thing sticking in your hand there and
also<00:04:28.639> this<00:04:28.820> neck<00:04:29.060> has<00:04:29.270> a<00:04:29.300> round<00:04:29.690> lamb

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
also this neck has a round lamb

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.930 
also this neck has a round lamb
fingerboard<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.889> round<00:04:31.130> lamb<00:04:31.340> fingerboard

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
fingerboard the round lamb fingerboard

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.940 
fingerboard the round lamb fingerboard
came<00:04:32.210> in<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.419> early<00:04:32.660> 60s<00:04:33.139> and<00:04:33.440> lasted<00:04:33.830> on

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
came in the early 60s and lasted on

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.090 
came in the early 60s and lasted on
through<00:04:34.460> into<00:04:34.790> the<00:04:34.910> 70s<00:04:35.389> and<00:04:35.680> it's<00:04:36.680> basically

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
through into the 70s and it's basically

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.180 
through into the 70s and it's basically
a<00:04:37.220> thinner<00:04:37.639> piece<00:04:38.389> of<00:04:38.600> rosewood<00:04:39.110> that's<00:04:39.889> round

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
a thinner piece of rosewood that's round

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.670 
a thinner piece of rosewood that's round
laminated<00:04:40.850> on<00:04:40.970> to<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.270> neck<00:04:41.450> now<00:04:42.229> I<00:04:42.260> think<00:04:42.470> it

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
laminated on to the neck now I think it

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.250 
laminated on to the neck now I think it
was<00:04:42.800> an<00:04:42.919> unintended<00:04:43.430> feature<00:04:43.930> but<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.020> round

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
was an unintended feature but the round

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.350 
was an unintended feature but the round
lamb<00:04:45.590> fingerboard<00:04:46.400> does<00:04:46.610> allow<00:04:46.880> a<00:04:46.910> little<00:04:47.150> bit

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
lamb fingerboard does allow a little bit

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.659 
lamb fingerboard does allow a little bit
more<00:04:47.539> growl<00:04:47.900> in<00:04:48.320> the<00:04:48.680> sound<00:04:48.979> because<00:04:49.460> there's

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
more growl in the sound because there's

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.240 
more growl in the sound because there's
actually<00:04:49.940> more<00:04:50.479> neck<00:04:50.930> versus<00:04:51.680> fingerboard

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
actually more neck versus fingerboard

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.879 
actually more neck versus fingerboard
and<00:04:52.810> then<00:04:53.810> finally<00:04:54.229> the<00:04:54.320> machine<00:04:54.650> head's

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
and then finally the machine head's

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.100 
and then finally the machine head's
they're<00:04:55.370> staggered<00:04:55.729> and<00:04:56.090> they<00:04:56.270> get<00:04:56.419> lower<00:04:56.720> as

they're staggered and they get lower as

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.820 
they're staggered and they get lower as
they<00:04:57.950> go<00:04:58.100> towards<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:59.120> first<00:04:59.389> string<00:04:59.830> for

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
they go towards the first string for

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.650 
they go towards the first string for
providing<00:05:01.250> more<00:05:01.490> angle<00:05:01.850> over<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.180> nut<00:05:02.360> here

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
providing more angle over the nut here

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.500 
providing more angle over the nut here
removing<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.740> need<00:05:03.979> for<00:05:04.010> a<00:05:04.610> string<00:05:04.970> tree<00:05:05.270> now

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
removing the need for a string tree now

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.590 
removing the need for a string tree now
the<00:05:05.570> string<00:05:05.960> tree<00:05:06.260> is<00:05:06.950> great<00:05:07.310> but<00:05:08.030> sometimes

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
the string tree is great but sometimes

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.570 
the string tree is great but sometimes
it<00:05:08.780> adds<00:05:08.960> friction<00:05:09.830> when<00:05:10.100> you<00:05:10.220> use<00:05:10.460> the

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
it adds friction when you use the

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.670 
it adds friction when you use the
tremolo<00:05:10.970> bar<00:05:11.150> or<00:05:11.419> if<00:05:11.960> you<00:05:12.050> bend<00:05:12.260> the<00:05:12.380> strings
