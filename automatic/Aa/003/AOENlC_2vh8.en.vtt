00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.610 
wasn't comfortable to me so this is a
position<00:00:51.629> that's<00:00:51.719> most<00:00:51.960> comfortable<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.500> me

position that's most comfortable to me
it's<00:00:52.860> almost<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.550> al<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.000> not<00:00:54.180> really<00:00:54.390> right

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
it's almost like al but not really right

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.110 
it's almost like al but not really right
the<00:00:55.140> language<00:00:55.500> back<00:00:55.649> right<00:00:56.100> right<00:00:56.550> maybe<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the language back right right maybe the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.760 
the language back right right maybe the
difficulty<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.260> shooting<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
difficulty that I have in shooting is a

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.189 
difficulty that I have in shooting is a
lot<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.070> times<00:00:59.250> my<00:00:59.489> head<00:00:59.640> moves<00:01:00.020> which<00:01:01.020> then

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
lot of times my head moves which then

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.750 
lot of times my head moves which then
throws<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.469> balance<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> shot<00:01:02.250> off<00:01:02.460> so

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
throws the balance of the shot off so

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.280 
throws the balance of the shot off so
you<00:01:02.820> know<00:01:03.000> if<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.270> even<00:01:03.449> if<00:01:03.870> I'm<00:01:03.960> shooting<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
you know if you even if I'm shooting a

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.250 
you know if you even if I'm shooting a
twist<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.739> fade<00:01:04.979> away<00:01:05.280> or<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:06.390> free<00:01:07.020> throw<00:01:07.229> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
twist and fade away or a free throw a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.740 
twist and fade away or a free throw a
three-point<00:01:07.770> shot<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.119> keep<00:01:09.270> my<00:01:09.420> head

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
straight because that's that's the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.859 
straight because that's that's the
balance<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.360> walk<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.600> through<00:01:12.630> some
