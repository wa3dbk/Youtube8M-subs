00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.560

 puncher on arrival at privas wednesday 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.390
 it flies over the 31 km time trial 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.550
 the wall is imposed before levi 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.739
 leipheimer and cadel evans respectively 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.800

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.800
 la France 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.390
 all is well who does a job 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.010
 wonderful 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.800
 we will see day after day the jersey 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.760
 yellow it's a good omen for the ride 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.960
 you know we'll first try to 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.580
 defend this shirt is the most 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.900
 important 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.880
 the tour de france is in three 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.660
 weeks and alejandro valverde do not think 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.760
 than that for months three years ago 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.170
 the Spanish discovers the big loop and 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.060
 offers a prestigious victory to 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.060
 Courchevel in front of King Armstrong 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.830
 last year after two abandons 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.600
 successive valverde finally ends 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.000
 the test at a very promising sixth 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.590
 place now he is convinced he 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.790
 will win one day the biggest race of the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.290
 world this season the runner of the 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.330
 savings bank has therefore decided to 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.670
 change his preparation fewer races 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.830
 and especially one goal at 28 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.110
 the Spanish learned wisdom and 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:45.220
 today has the experience of 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:45.700
 great tricks for me it's a yeah I 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.409
 believe yes 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.750
 today she has acquired a 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.950
 some experience then as the year 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.200
 last I surely a little too much 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.940
 attacked in the halls and I paid the 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.440
 bill in the Pyrenees 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.149
 today I understood that 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.050
 run more quietly and attacked 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.429
 only at the right moment the 120 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.229
 days from brest 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.119
 valverde will find on his way cadel 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.459
 evans the big favorite of the next round 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.170
 of France for many valverde evans 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.360
 the two runners did not let go 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.739
 on this issue and this week it's 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.660
 the Spanish who dictated his law to 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:21.519
 the Australian the two men could 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:26.440
 to redo the game in July the 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:28.420
 sales I believe it's favorite but 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.160
 we are several candidates for the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.870
 podium and to try to win the round 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.239
 hammer it's very very complicated for 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.040
 win the round but I think I do 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.040
 part of the candidates who can win 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.730
 you are surprised by the great shape of 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.459
 valverde on this dauphiné he won the 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.019
 against the clock he won the 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.060
 against the clock and in a very 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.500
 compelling 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.200
 I was doing very well but he took me 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.230
 more than 20 seconds on the course he has 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.040
 really been very impressive and he 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.810
 rolls very very fast 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.340
 in the fall a lot of people say that 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:08.209
 valverde you are the two favorites of the 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:09.260
 rate really is going yesterday when the 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.879
 great mountain stage 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.069
 evans did try to attack a 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.920
 last time valverde but the spanish has 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.510
 everything controlled this week the murcian has 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.959
 hit the spirits spoken to 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.909
 reassure 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.069
 these 7 verses will say that he is ready too 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:24.290
 early because for ten years alone launches 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.829
 Armstrong has passed the double dauphiné 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.829
 tour de France
