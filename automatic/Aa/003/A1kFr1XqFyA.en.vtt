California instead of in San Francisco

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.950 
California instead of in San Francisco
and<00:01:00.030> they're<00:01:00.149> most<00:01:00.329> likely<00:01:00.420> doing<00:01:00.840> this

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
and they're most likely doing this

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.599 
and they're most likely doing this
because<00:01:01.140> last<00:01:01.440> year<00:01:01.649> they<00:01:01.800> had<00:01:01.980> issues<00:01:02.430> when

because last year they had issues when

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.609 
because last year they had issues when
they<00:01:02.730> were<00:01:02.789> demoing<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.510> iphone<00:01:04.019> 4<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
they were demoing the iphone 4 and

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.440 
they were demoing the iphone 4 and
because<00:01:05.189> everybody<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> audience<00:01:06.030> was

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
because everybody in the audience was

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.300 
because everybody in the audience was
connecting<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.049> Wi-Fi<00:01:07.200> they<00:01:07.710> were<00:01:07.770> actually

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
connecting to Wi-Fi they were actually

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.370 
connecting to Wi-Fi they were actually
having<00:01:08.520> trouble<00:01:09.000> connecting<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.600> iphone<00:01:10.110> 4

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
having trouble connecting the iphone 4

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.590 
having trouble connecting the iphone 4
unit<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.890> Wi-Fi<00:01:11.280> as<00:01:11.340> well<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.240> again<00:01:12.479> they're

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
unit to Wi-Fi as well so again they're

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.969 
unit to Wi-Fi as well so again they're
most<00:01:12.780> likely<00:01:12.840> doing<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.590> they<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:13.830> have

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
most likely doing this so they can have

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.490 
most likely doing this so they can have
more<00:01:14.159> control<00:01:14.369> over<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.240> Wi-Fi<00:01:15.500> situation

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
