chocolate and half dark chocolate I find

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.160 
chocolate and half dark chocolate I find
this<00:00:56.300> gets<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:56.750> best<00:00:56.989> flavor<00:00:58.510> to<00:00:59.510> ensure<00:00:59.930> an

this gets the best flavor to ensure an

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.560 
this gets the best flavor to ensure an
even<00:01:00.379> coating<00:01:00.979> for<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.460> profiterole<00:01:01.820> it's

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
even coating for the profiterole it's

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.910 
even coating for the profiterole it's
easier<00:01:02.989> to<00:01:03.229> dip<00:01:03.500> them<00:01:03.769> in<00:01:03.920> by<00:01:04.159> hand<00:01:05.619> whereas<00:01:06.619> to
