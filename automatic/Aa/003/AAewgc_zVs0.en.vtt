 Pre-game this research information 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:21.810
 Deeen the fact that the first 33 times each machine cheats Sega name key ufo a la carte ed. 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.000
 Well ufo in game center something 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.780

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.780
 Japanese 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:33.910
 Of the type to take a prize by lowering down across the fence 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:39.100
 Or rather a little technique things 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:42.150
 I'd like to introduce you to something like the way Yes Ema It is this opportunity 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.450
 Adjust the height first 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.450
 Interpolation Re Te' 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.850
 It has risen a this time sideways 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:55.050
 Stop by in the place just right 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.360
 In this way Mr. service 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.320
 The 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.320
 Good pedigree with this 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:09.930
 Well that 's right as a point of capture 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:15.120
 I 'm hooked to this white hook 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.580
 If delivered, even where it has become like a Jane of was it is still the place want this flat section 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.670
 It's the box itself 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:26.310
 You can get it even if you press it directly 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:31.700
 Please I conquer I remember that I, so is not only one place it is where the aim 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:37.880
 It is the height I'd virtual raw, similar to the point of 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:41.090
 As there is such a dent on the side, let's take the height you want to aim as a guide 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:47.600
 For example , between the second and third 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:51.690
 I think it will be very easy to aim and easy to take if you decide Yes Yes this ufo 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.010
 Because it is not that probability machine a 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.450
 It is enough to do it 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.460
 Become a Prius Just by the shop 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:06.340
 Toka enough to break the ice up 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.940
 It is the distance that goes down from the trouble, etc. Since the setting is done, except that there 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.130
 Ne 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:16.500
 The more you do, the better it will be, so please try it! 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.940
