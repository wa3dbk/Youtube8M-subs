this<00:00:25.470> face<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.340> think<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.820> could<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.330> have

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
this face and I think that could I have

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.109 
this face and I think that could I have
actually<00:00:27.840> three<00:00:28.080> suspects<00:00:28.769> suspicions<00:00:29.760> um

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
actually three suspects suspicions um

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.680 
actually three suspects suspicions um
who<00:00:30.900> could<00:00:31.230> actually<00:00:31.410> be<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:33.239> first<00:00:33.480> one

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
who could actually be and the first one

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.250 
who could actually be and the first one
is<00:00:34.079> Russell<00:00:34.770> um<00:00:35.340> as<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.510> guys<00:00:36.540> say<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.020> think

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
is Russell um as you guys say I think

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.440 
is Russell um as you guys say I think
was<00:00:37.559> my<00:00:37.710> first<00:00:37.950> video<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.309> YouTube<00:00:38.730> was

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
was my first video on YouTube was

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.020 
was my first video on YouTube was
actually<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> few<00:00:40.020> us<00:00:40.200> when<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.620> East<00:00:40.800> Oak<00:00:41.040> um

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
actually a few us when the East Oak um

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.690 
actually a few us when the East Oak um
and<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.260> think<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:43.770> pretty<00:00:43.890> weak<00:00:44.129> because<00:00:44.430> in

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
and I think it's pretty weak because in

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.880 
and I think it's pretty weak because in
dollars<00:00:45.000> he<00:00:45.239> dies<00:00:45.539> then<00:00:45.870> he<00:00:45.960> comes<00:00:46.140> back<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.680> I

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
dollars he dies then he comes back in I

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.160 
dollars he dies then he comes back in I
don't<00:00:47.280> see<00:00:47.640> him<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.180> know<00:00:48.300> becoming<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.930> part

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
don't see him you know becoming a part

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.010 
don't see him you know becoming a part

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.920 
could be done the person who's in
control<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.950> could<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.750> possible<00:01:36.750> one

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
control that could be the possible one

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.170 
control that could be the possible one
actually<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.100> could<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.369> actually<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> girl

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
actually and it could be actually a girl

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.140 
actually and it could be actually a girl
um<00:01:39.920> but<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.040> never<00:01:41.159> know<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.490> heard<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.970> you
