00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
immigrants and I say this because it

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.800 
immigrants and I say this because it
wasn't<00:00:05.130> true<00:00:05.190> it<00:00:05.730> was<00:00:05.879> not<00:00:06.060> true<00:00:06.270> it<00:00:06.390> was<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.540> lie

wasn't true it was not true it was a lie
I<00:00:07.140> was<00:00:07.440> doing<00:00:07.830> something<00:00:08.370> that<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:09.090> felt<00:00:09.480> I

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
I was doing something that I felt I

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.299 
I was doing something that I felt I
should<00:00:09.809> do<00:00:10.349> because<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.800> wanted<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.130> get

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
should do because I wanted to get

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.549 
should do because I wanted to get
published<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:11.969> was<00:00:12.389> not<00:00:12.570> interested<00:00:12.750> in

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
published I was not interested in

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.259 
published I was not interested in
writing<00:00:13.950> about<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.400> my<00:00:14.519> heart<00:00:14.700> was<00:00:14.849> not<00:00:15.000> there

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
writing about it my heart was not there

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.060 
writing about it my heart was not there
and<00:00:15.480> then<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:16.020> know<00:00:16.109> this<00:00:16.320> probably<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.949> going

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
and then you know this probably is going

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.320 
and then you know this probably is going
to<00:00:17.190> sound<00:00:17.310> very<00:00:17.430> mushy<00:00:17.880> but<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.060> think<00:00:18.210> it's

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
to sound very mushy but I think it's

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.029 
to sound very mushy but I think it's
extremely<00:00:18.660> important<00:00:19.320> as<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.439> writer<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.830> you

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
extremely important as a writer that you

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.130 
extremely important as a writer that you
have<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.580> care<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:20.880> have<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.300> be<00:00:21.420> emotionally

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
invested and there and it has to be true

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.480 
invested and there and it has to be true
and<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.289> wasn't<00:00:25.650> treated<00:00:26.039> me<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.369> was<00:00:26.460> a

I didn't have a life when I was an

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.939 
I didn't have a life when I was an

type<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.660> way<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:33.899> then<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.050> sent<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.530> off<00:00:34.710> to

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
type of way and then I sent it off to

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.709 
type of way and then I sent it off to
agents<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.760> course<00:00:36.000> nobody<00:00:36.210> took<00:00:36.510> it

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
agents and of course nobody took it

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.650 
agents and of course nobody took it
because<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.440> was<00:00:37.500> bad<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.270> so<00:00:39.270> that's<00:00:39.390> what<00:00:39.510> I

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660

I knew it was not very good and at some
point<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.340> thought<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.670> know<00:00:44.850> I'm<00:00:45.059> just<00:00:45.300> going

this was what was true to me and I

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.500

thought<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.910> write<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.390> then

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
thought of you to write it and then

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.810 
thought of you to write it and then
we'll<00:00:57.690> see<00:00:57.870> what<00:00:58.079> happens<00:00:58.199> right<00:00:58.980> em<00:00:59.280> it's

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
we'll see what happens right em it's

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.209 
we'll see what happens right em it's
going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.090> be<00:01:00.149> more<00:01:00.300> difficult<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.780> sell

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
going to be more difficult to sell

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.329 
going to be more difficult to sell
obviously<00:01:02.219> but<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:03.989> true<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.979> felt

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
obviously but but it's true and I felt

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.030 
obviously but but it's true and I felt
much<00:01:05.610> much<00:01:05.909> better<00:01:06.119> than<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:07.350> disaster<00:01:07.830> i<00:01:07.860> had

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
much much better than the disaster i had

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.740 
much much better than the disaster i had
done<00:01:08.220> before<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.939> i<00:01:09.000> think<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.360> sense<00:01:09.540> it

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
done before so i think in a sense it

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.750 
done before so i think in a sense it
really<00:01:10.049> comes<00:01:10.290> from<00:01:10.380> what<00:01:10.740> your<00:01:10.979> motivations

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
really comes from what your motivations

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.940 
really comes from what your motivations
are<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.330> also<00:01:12.900> how<00:01:13.110> much<00:01:13.170> you've<00:01:13.439> put<00:01:13.619> into<00:01:13.799> it

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
are and also how much you've put into it

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.440 
are and also how much you've put into it
i<00:01:14.220> think<00:01:14.400> sometimes<00:01:14.580> also<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.119> might<00:01:15.270> have

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
i think sometimes also you might have

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.149 
i think sometimes also you might have
the<00:01:15.540> red<00:01:15.689> motivations<00:01:16.259> but<00:01:16.409> then<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.890> you

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
the red motivations but then you you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.420 
the red motivations but then you you
don't<00:01:17.580> take<00:01:17.790> your<00:01:17.939> time<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.509> them<00:01:19.250> one<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
don't take your time in them one of the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.340 
don't take your time in them one of the
things<00:01:20.580> i<00:01:20.759> find<00:01:20.939> example<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.570> nigeria<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.229> i

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
things i find example in nigeria and i

when<00:03:07.710> he's<00:03:07.830> just<00:03:07.860> not<00:03:08.220> working<00:03:08.610> here's<00:03:09.210> the

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
when he's just not working here's the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
when he's just not working here's the
thing<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.630> want<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.870> write<00:03:10.080> but<00:03:10.200> it's

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
thing that you want to write but it's

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.200 
thing that you want to write but it's
not<00:03:10.560> happening<00:03:10.710> and<00:03:11.220> when<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.700> do<00:03:11.850> right<00:03:12.060> you

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
not happening and when you do right you

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.580 
not happening and when you do right you
know<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.360> sentences<00:03:12.930> are<00:03:13.050> just<00:03:13.230> it's<00:03:13.530> just

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590

officer game because he said that

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.539 
officer game because he said that
certain<00:03:49.709> people<00:03:49.799> didn't<00:03:50.190> want<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.370> talk<00:03:50.489> about

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
I think if you set out to do it you can

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.200 
I think if you set out to do it you can
and<00:04:33.539> then<00:04:33.570> I<00:04:33.720> yield<00:04:34.020> yeah<00:04:34.919> also<00:04:35.250> had<00:04:35.639> them<00:04:35.910> in
