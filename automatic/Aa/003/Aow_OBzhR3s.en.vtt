00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.029
 today we have straight yeast dough 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.010
 for this we take two cups of milk 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.040
 warm warm it means somewhere 35-37 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.830
 degrees not more than 4 tablespoons 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.490
 sugar 2 tablespoons of yeast 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.980
 2 and a half teaspoons salt 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:29.490
 cups of vegetable oil and kilogram 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:36.710
 for starters we add warm milk 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.710
 sugar and yeast 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 stir 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.940
 yeast would need to go into the milk but 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.200
 sugar has practically disappeared 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.200
 accordingly should dissolve 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:09.040
 slowly begin to enter 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:09.040
 far salt 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.760
 while there is an opportunity we can mix 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.190
 with a spoon, a whisk, and when 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.110
 it will be another dough then 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.140
 put it on the table and knead it 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.140
 by hands 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.410
 gone the very moment of leaving 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:26.110
 hands more comfortable finger immediately vegetable 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:26.110
 oiled and you start 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.689
 knead will have quite a long minute 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.450
 ten knead until the state when 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:49.709
 the dough will absolutely cease to stick to 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.290
 table and hands dough in principle we 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:57.150
 ready but absolutely threads are not sticky 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.980
 nick hands not to the table is very pleasant and 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.889
 soft to the touch is so elastic 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:07.950
 it turns out the dough bowl lubricates it 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:10.939
 a little vegetable oil just 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.939
 so that the edges are not sticky 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:29.240
 put there our dough is covered with foil 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.260
 and clean in warm places and drafts 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.260
 he should go 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.719
 we had 40 minutes pastry 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.799
 increased by more than two 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:55.030
 just need to hug him once 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.030
 release carbon dioxide from there 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:16.150
 again tighten the film and remove more 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:16.150
 time we come to the test we have it 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.870
 we get the surface covered with flour 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.330
 sure for one pie like that 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.410
 the amount of test magician we will do a lot 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.410
 at least 2 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:54.180
 from this we'll make meat pie 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:05:02.450
 just a little dough left for 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:02.450
 decorations I'll take baking paper
