00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
looks like a zebra but this was actually

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.020 
looks like a zebra but this was actually
a<00:01:08.350> form<00:01:08.590> of<00:01:08.740> camouflage<00:01:09.340> this<00:01:09.670> was<00:01:09.850> called

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
a form of camouflage this was called

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.600 
a form of camouflage this was called
dazzle<00:01:10.600> camouflage<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.500> they<00:01:12.220> used<00:01:12.430> to<00:01:12.580> use

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
dazzle camouflage and they used to use

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.060 
dazzle camouflage and they used to use
it<00:01:12.970> back<00:01:13.180> in<00:01:13.420> World<00:01:13.690> War<00:01:13.810> one<00:01:14.140> on<00:01:14.380> naval<00:01:14.650> ships

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.400 
it back in World War one on naval ships
so<00:01:15.700> that's<00:01:16.120> the<00:01:16.360> inspiration<00:01:16.600> for<00:01:17.050> this<00:01:17.170> watch

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
so that's the inspiration for this watch

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.470

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
bin it's actually called dazzle

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.490 
bin it's actually called dazzle
camouflage<00:01:24.640> this<00:01:25.540> design<00:01:25.900> is<00:01:25.930> actually
