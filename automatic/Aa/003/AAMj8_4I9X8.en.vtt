00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 and 8th of the European Championships 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.259
 figure skating here in budapest brian 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.570
 joubert is our guest tonight good evening 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.500
 we go out we come back first on the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.210
 gross result 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.089
 this eighth place what is she 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.400
 inspires you bah it's not necessarily a 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.320
 very good place 8th I was fourth 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.580
 last year I can do a lot better 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.680
 after that there was 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.660
 a lot of mistakes on the short program 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.640
 the drunk program went well so 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.020
 I'm pretty proud of my reaction and 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.060
 that's really something 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.200
 from encouraging to for the continuation one 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.700
 back on this program runs a 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.070
 program that you have fashioned there are 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.110
 fifteen days in Russia it's really this 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.440
 explaining your difficulties and 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.720
 falls 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.110
 yes because I like it when the 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.460
 things are really perfect when I 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.080
 know my technique on the tips of 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.460
 fingers choreography transitions 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.059
 and that was really not the case with this 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.280
 new program 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.440
 so I got on track being 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.620
 very stressed with a lot of questions 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.390
 in the lead and that's when you're stressed in 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.190
 and that's where we do more mistakes 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.960
 on including on the quadrupled on 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.489
 triple axel you realized in 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.770
 contrast to a good free program even 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.090
 if he was a little lightened in trouble 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.799
 it's a certainty you're going to 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.100
 keep for the Olympics 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.560
 Sochi 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.670
 I will keep this program because 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.119
 it's a program in which I 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.430
 feel good 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.410
 who 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.360
 he brings me artistic notes that 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.510
 are not that bad it's necessary 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.650
 just work to improve it and I can 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.540
 do something very good to 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.880
 olympics you are going to work 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.920
 with your choreographer nikolai morozov 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.200
 why have you solicited 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.420
 why come back with him 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.440
 of the month of January simply stopped 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.490
 opposite it's not me who 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.530
 seek and he is the one who 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.740
 contacted in December who told me 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.119
 request 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.560
 finally who simply wanted 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.520
 help me because I think we have 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.979
 worked together for several 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.710
 years from 2003 to 2007 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.470
 and they like me a lot and I think 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.759
 that for my last season he wanted 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.009
 he wanted my girlfriend and then it's 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.439
 true that I continue to work with 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.340
 veronique too so we'll try to 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.570
 train a very good team 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.520
 you have one more competition 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.710
 are these Olympic games 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.939
 with what ambitions are you going 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.720
 you move to sochi 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:10.000
 I especially think that to make very 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.739
 good olympics very good program 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.260
 short very good for us so not 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.239
 error big difficulties 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.540
 here is a very good competition 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:22.379
 his regret 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.489
 after the result it is secondary a 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.230
 place on the podium it's still 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.810
 difficult to envisage in the face of 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.040
 Japanese and Canadians 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.930
 we must not hide the face to reims I 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.250
 think a medal is not winnable 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.390
 or if I can get a 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.700
 medal is that I go out the big game 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.620
 and the opponents do make mistakes 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.260
 after that everything can happen to the games 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.560
 Olympic and we never know thank you 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.720
 a lot 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.290
