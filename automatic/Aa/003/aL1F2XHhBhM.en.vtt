I'm<00:01:13.530> not<00:01:13.680> entirely<00:01:14.220> sure<00:01:14.869> it<00:01:15.869> could<00:01:16.170> crack<00:01:16.439> and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
I'm not entirely sure it could crack and

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.530 
I'm not entirely sure it could crack and
split<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.340> tried<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.729> actually<00:01:17.909> really

use it against something the blade is
made<00:01:22.200> out<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.799> cheap<00:01:23.460> steel<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:24.750> is

made out of a cheap steel it is
relatively<00:01:25.409> sharp<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.189> could<00:01:26.369> probably<00:01:26.640> cut

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
relatively sharp you could probably cut

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.520 
relatively sharp you could probably cut
through<00:01:27.270> some<00:01:27.420> melons<00:01:27.810> or<00:01:27.900> something<00:01:28.259> with<00:01:28.409> it

through some melons or something with it
but<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.740> wouldn't<00:01:29.040> try<00:01:29.189> anything<00:01:29.430> more<00:01:29.759> than

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
but I wouldn't try anything more than

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.399 
but I wouldn't try anything more than
that<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.920> blade<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.130> 30<00:01:32.549> inches<00:01:32.640> long<00:01:33.409> overall

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
that the blade is 30 inches long overall

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.090 
that the blade is 30 inches long overall
with<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.890> scabbard<00:01:35.490> it's<00:01:35.729> 46<00:01:36.659> inches<00:01:37.100> pretty

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100

the game is a kid half the time and he

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.940 
the game is a kid half the time and he
figure<00:01:44.040> if<00:01:44.159> kid<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.880> swing<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.450> around

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
figure if kid can swing this around

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.859 
figure if kid can swing this around
rather<00:01:46.950> unlikely<00:01:47.810> effectively<00:01:48.810> at<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.140> so

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
rather unlikely effectively at that so

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.690 
rather unlikely effectively at that so
well<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.259> belongs<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.399> realm<00:01:53.579> of

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
well it's belongs in the realm of

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.609 
well it's belongs in the realm of
fantasy<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.689> many<00:01:54.899> other<00:01:55.110> swords<00:01:55.560> that
