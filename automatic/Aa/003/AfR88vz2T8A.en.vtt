00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
when I believe it was either $4.99 I

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.169 
when I believe it was either $4.99 I
think<00:01:44.990> was<00:01:45.109> $4.99<00:01:45.649> it<00:01:45.979> might<00:01:46.189> have<00:01:46.340> been<00:01:46.459> $5.99

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
think was $4.99 it might have been $5.99

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.559 
think was $4.99 it might have been $5.99

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
but I know now it's up to $8.99 for the
