00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.679
 hello how are you and welcome to 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.230
 cartoonist today we are going to draw 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.779
 to coconut so let's start 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.170
 very well and let's start by giving the 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.900
 basic figure of the face remembers that 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.029
 this is a very important phase of the 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.160
 evolution of the super saiyan and then 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.160
 you must make it sensational 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.280
 to this circle that we just drew 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.000
 let's go it in half a bit in 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.519
 diagonal and let's plot the shape of the 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.290
 face remembers that it is a little chin 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:48.130
 triangular 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.920
 his rival falls into the tufts of hair and 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.420
 that's why we draw a bit with the shape 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.960
 of the 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.629
 now we define towards the center a 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.670
 vertical line a line diagonally the 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.839
 what is going to be the eyebrows and the eyes are going to 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.839
 have double line 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.990
 now it is simply add some 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.520
 small details so that you go noticing 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.520
 how is our character doing? 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.330
 goku pupil is also double you 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.450
 keep it in mind 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.369
 and the nose is not very big 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.939
 as we are drawing it in a 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.810
 position a little in profile three quarters 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.119
 the lower eye is not going to be very big 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.729
 is going to be a little smaller maybe it's going to 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.770
 hide a bit here from the nose 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.840
 for that reason and keep it in mind so that you do not 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.229
 you will be very disproportionate 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.229
 drawing 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.710
 and when we have our ours 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.950
 Goku's face is simply add a 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.950
 little detail to the face that fun 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.180
 already after having defined the face 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.580
 what we are going to do now is make my 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.820
 hair this is one of my parts 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.620
 favorite is very fun to draw the 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.620
 hair upset and crazy handsome 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.629
 remember that in this phase the hair that 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.879
 He is very long and the locks are 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.510
 longer than usual but they are also 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.510
 pointy 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.790
 and they should cover almost all their body 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.080
 after having drawn much of the 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.570
 hair let's draw under the face 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.880
 a small circle and we will retain it 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.900
 doing as hair 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:21.760
 remember that in this super sayayin cucu 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.760
 it tends to be a little hairier 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.590
 very well 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.310
 we finished extending the hair by the 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.310
 back side 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.670
 and it is simply adding a little more 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:08.310
 of detail that I leave to your freedom 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.310
 how do you want to finish your drawing 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.420
 and we're done, I hope I've 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.880
