00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:16.560
 let's go to the Italian player 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:20.340
 we remain in the field of defenders but here 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.859
 I see that Renzi nods and smiles because 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.519
 here we talk about something more than a 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.460
 defender 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.539
 this is a defense minister 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.080
 right after roberto baggio and paolo 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.329
 baldini 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.730
 let's go with the player's clip 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.940
 Italian that frank ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.940
 Bari 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.970
 53 years one of the strongest defenders of the 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.820
 world football 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.100
 twenty years at milan 15 as captain six 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.520
 badges 3 cups of champions two 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.539
 intercontinental three European Super Cups 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.850
 4 Italian supercups retired at 37 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.520
 years in the national team was the first reserve 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.459
 of scirea the world champion 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.850
 very young of 82 then captain with 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.920
 arrigo sacks from 91 remained of the 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.410
 mind of all those tears 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.780
 that bitterness but it had been great 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.620
 because after knee surgery 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:34.130
 he had returned 25 days later 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:42.440
 frank baresi in their football fan 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:45.220
 Italian and I would like to call a 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:50.530
 president the president honorable member 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.530
 today of the football association antonio matarrese 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.620

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:05.090
 active good or bad is not bad good evening 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.640
 to all, and then for a long time 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.190
 joke there was a famous referee who 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.830
 he said that not with baresi in the field 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.050
 assistants were needed because 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.570
 with his arms raised he always gave her 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:22.940
 indications today we see less I helped 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.950
 I helped them I am happy to receive 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.260
 this award 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.030
 this recognition we are honored by 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.670
 return to be part of them 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.209
 faith after bari Italian football not in 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.580
 part 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.290
 a necklace of samples they made 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.280
 great Italian football so for me 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.670
 it is an honor and he is satisfied with it 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.860
 because he is happy he is happy to have lived 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.350
 together the experience you cried 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.640
 together you started first on the shoulder 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.500
 of sacks then on the shoulder of matarrese 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:58.130
 is the most interesting thing was 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.950
 when the game is over, it remains 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.920
 out of the locker room that we were 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.900
 I was crying with those who arrived 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.790
 maldini said president saleh not 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.470
 come the locker room we don't finish of 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.110
 cry after crying together 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.940
 today we see why we remember 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.940
 these great champions of a great man 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.560
 and how many times we see players yes 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.510
 refuse to take a penalty kick 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.610
 a delicate moment because they hear the 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.770
 weight and maybe they don't feel like it 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.479
 betray the Franco-Bari comrades who 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.840
 came from a serious injury was 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.790
 returned in time only for the final ha 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.240
 pulled the first penalty kick but it was 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:38.240
 better not pull free of 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.660
 as the song said who does not throw it 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.580
 ninth place of player is measured to 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.419
 other things certainly not from a kick 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.000
 of rigor 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.229
 unfortunately we are neither gregori but his 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.240
 rigors arm are a lottery 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.530
 sometimes it was born well 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.840
 sometimes it went wrong we have 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.880
 also saw a world penalties therefore 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.650
 I think it's part of the sport 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.540
 and we must accept it here we see it again 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.250
 still beyond the winners of the years 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.720
 previous 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.110
 here it is, here it is, you don't do it to 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.110
 to review 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:11.029
 and I did n't mistake it 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:16.729
 you wanted to remove that spider web 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:18.930
 that was there at the intersection of the poles but 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.930
 batistuta said that then he makes you a 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:26.400
 corso su tells you gabriele and then one 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:30.180
 he machine-gunner among co 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.790
 but done extraordinary things not 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.009
 only in the national team but also with yours 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.620
 club a life in Milan 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:39.810
 today it is increasingly difficult because there is 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.740
 there are very few flags for us 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.720
 different moments 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.120
 because now there are many more 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.400
 many more opportunities opportunities too 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.509
 for the players themselves to change and to 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.750
 make new experiences 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:54.300
 then find a player who can 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.030
 staying 15 20 years will always be a lot 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.070
 it will be difficult to see one 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.220
 other short, other players like 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:04.889
 totti as maldini as me will be short 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.930
 difficult I see the sly look of 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.940
 I don't know if there are any questions 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.910
 impertinent but one thing I want you 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:15.210
 asking before you was rewarded 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.560
 maldini who is preparing test tubes 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.669
 become director of the technical area 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:24.810
 of your Milan how you see it 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:27.509
 this is the promotion of those who do not know 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.520
 it's hard to talk about these things too 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:30.180
 because now it seems that the waters have become 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.220
 subsided 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.110
 yes because it is important for the creed 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.910
 for the team it is however worth the di 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.669
 then serenity will be roles 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:40.650
 added paolo was extraordinary 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.470
 so as a player like girl like 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.570
 so professional like companion 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.630
 got to play with him grown up 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:51.030
 with me then I wish to find him well 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.760
 soon something in the world of football that 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.130
 can contribute in the lobby 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.560
 of famer there is adriano galliani was 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.210
 defined the golden ball of the managers 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.639
 even to carlo ancelotti but 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:06.060
 defined the cristiano ronaldo dei 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:08.220
 managers here is this combination with 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.960
 Galliani for a player like you 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.590
 flag player as it was but I believe 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.450
 that 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.180
 with Galliani there has always been a good one 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.740
 relationship was extraordinary for everyone 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.830
 we believe that when we played it is a 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.870
 manager who talks about history 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:24.870
 he won everything he was even 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:27.300
 in successes in 27 years so I believe that 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:30.150
 it is right that he too is part of 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:34.040
 this of this great necklace by 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.040
 champions of managers and players
