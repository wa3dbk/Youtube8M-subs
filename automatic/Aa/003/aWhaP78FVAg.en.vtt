ok so the moon's in Virgo for these

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.930 
ok so the moon's in Virgo for these
three<00:00:39.410> days<00:00:39.770> however<00:00:40.400> there's<00:00:40.610> a<00:00:40.670> lot<00:00:40.910> more

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
three days however there's a lot more

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.930 
three days however there's a lot more
activity<00:00:41.480> taking<00:00:42.050> place<00:00:42.200> in<00:00:42.559> the<00:00:42.650> aspect<00:00:43.190> part

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
activity taking place in the aspect part

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.110 
activity taking place in the aspect part
of<00:00:44.150> the<00:00:44.450> chart<00:00:45.040> which<00:00:46.040> is<00:00:46.190> going<00:00:46.430> to<00:00:46.550> I<00:00:46.790> think

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
of the chart which is going to I think

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.940 
of the chart which is going to I think
it's<00:00:47.300> not<00:00:47.420> going<00:00:47.510> to<00:00:47.600> be<00:00:47.660> so<00:00:47.809> Virgo<00:00:48.440> in<00:00:48.680> terms

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
it's not going to be so Virgo in terms

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.100 
it's not going to be so Virgo in terms
of<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.340> experiences<00:00:50.030> because<00:00:50.210> we<00:00:50.540> have<00:00:50.690> the

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
of the experiences because we have the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.020 
of the experiences because we have the
Sun<00:00:51.379> trining<00:00:51.800> up<00:00:51.890> to<00:00:52.040> Jupiter<00:00:52.460> we<00:00:52.580> have<00:00:52.700> Venus

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
Sun trining up to Jupiter we have Venus

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.640 
Sun trining up to Jupiter we have Venus
sex<00:00:53.270> dialing<00:00:53.600> up<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:53.840> Neptune<00:00:54.230> we<00:00:54.470> have<00:00:54.559> the

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
sex dialing up to Neptune we have the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.860 
sex dialing up to Neptune we have the
Sun<00:00:55.010> going<00:00:55.280> into<00:00:55.610> Sagittarius<00:00:56.330> and<00:00:56.629> this

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
Sun going into Sagittarius and this

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.450 
Sun going into Sagittarius and this
whole<00:00:57.020> uranus<00:00:57.440> pluto<00:00:57.470> square<00:00:58.040> all<00:00:58.250> within

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
whole uranus pluto square all within

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.390 
whole uranus pluto square all within
these<00:00:58.730> three<00:00:58.970> days<00:00:59.210> so<00:01:00.170> overall<00:01:00.680> though<00:01:01.129> on<00:01:01.309> an

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
these three days so overall though on an

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.950 
these three days so overall though on an
emotional<00:01:01.670> level<00:01:02.000> it's<00:01:02.390> very<00:01:02.570> important<00:01:02.930> that

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
emotional level it's very important that

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.509 
emotional level it's very important that
we're<00:01:03.140> taking<00:01:03.260> care<00:01:03.589> of<00:01:03.650> our<00:01:03.800> health<00:01:03.830> taking

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
we're taking care of our health taking

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.030 
we're taking care of our health taking
care<00:01:04.699> of<00:01:04.760> our<00:01:04.909> routine<00:01:05.530> during<00:01:06.530> these<00:01:06.800> few

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
care of our routine during these few

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.380 
care of our routine during these few
days<00:01:07.280> and<00:01:07.550> I<00:01:07.610> think<00:01:07.640> that's<00:01:08.000> what's<00:01:08.180> going<00:01:08.330> to

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
days and I think that's what's going to

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.080 
days and I think that's what's going to
provide<00:01:09.170> a<00:01:09.230> good<00:01:09.530> strong<00:01:09.830> grounding<00:01:10.760> for<00:01:11.000> us

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
provide a good strong grounding for us

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.180 
provide a good strong grounding for us
to<00:01:11.330> perhaps<00:01:11.810> enjoy<00:01:12.110> some<00:01:12.560> things<00:01:12.860> for<00:01:13.070> these

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
to perhaps enjoy some things for these

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.740 
to perhaps enjoy some things for these
three<00:01:13.400> days<00:01:13.550> or<00:01:13.729> make<00:01:13.880> some<00:01:14.060> changes<00:01:14.540> with

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
three days or make some changes with

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.110 
three days or make some changes with
this<00:01:14.870> overall<00:01:15.200> square<00:01:15.650> energy<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:16.729> see<00:01:16.940> how

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
this overall square energy so see how

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.910 
this overall square energy so see how
you<00:01:17.180> can<00:01:17.479> increase<00:01:17.750> that<00:01:17.990> health<00:01:18.290> how<00:01:18.530> you<00:01:18.590> can

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
you can increase that health how you can

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.200 
you can increase that health how you can
perhaps<00:01:19.310> make<00:01:19.580> sure<00:01:19.760> you're<00:01:19.909> getting<00:01:20.060> enough

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
perhaps make sure you're getting enough

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.390 
perhaps make sure you're getting enough
sleep<00:01:20.570> eating<00:01:21.170> right<00:01:21.200> those<00:01:21.890> types<00:01:22.159> of<00:01:22.340> things

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
sleep eating right those types of things

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.820 
sleep eating right those types of things
and<00:01:23.000> taking<00:01:23.240> care<00:01:23.540> of<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.720> day-to-day<00:01:23.900> for

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
and taking care of the day-to-day for

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.070 
and taking care of the day-to-day for
this<00:01:24.920> enjoyment<00:01:25.280> to<00:01:25.549> come<00:01:25.729> through<00:01:26.030> now<00:01:26.780> on

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
this enjoyment to come through now on

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.020 
this enjoyment to come through now on
Sunday<00:01:27.620> we<00:01:27.740> have<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.040> Sun<00:01:28.310> trining<00:01:28.729> up<00:01:28.850> to

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
Sunday we have the Sun trining up to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.720 
Sunday we have the Sun trining up to
Jupiter<00:01:29.540> so<00:01:29.780> this<00:01:30.050> is<00:01:30.520> this<00:01:31.520> is<00:01:31.580> about

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
Jupiter so this is this is about

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.300 
Jupiter so this is this is about
enthusiasm<00:01:32.600> this<00:01:32.690> is<00:01:32.870> about<00:01:32.990> buoyancy<00:01:33.350> you

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
enthusiasm this is about buoyancy you

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.340 
enthusiasm this is about buoyancy you
know<00:01:34.430> now<00:01:34.760> all<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.270> fast-moving<00:01:35.630> planets

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
know now all of the fast-moving planets

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.090 
know now all of the fast-moving planets
have<00:01:36.860> left<00:01:37.220> Scorpio<00:01:37.760> and<00:01:38.030> are<00:01:38.180> now<00:01:38.300> going<00:01:38.720> into

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
have left Scorpio and are now going into

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.080 
have left Scorpio and are now going into
Sagittarius<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:40.700> this<00:01:40.850> is<00:01:40.970> the

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
Sagittarius so this is the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.940 
Sagittarius so this is the
transformation<00:01:41.870> is<00:01:41.960> complete<00:01:42.080> we've<00:01:42.710> gone

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
transformation is complete we've gone

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.560 
transformation is complete we've gone
through<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.310> Scorpio<00:01:43.730> energies<00:01:44.180> of<00:01:44.390> this

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
through the Scorpio energies of this

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.870 
through the Scorpio energies of this
lunar<00:01:44.930> cycle<00:01:45.410> we've<00:01:45.830> gone<00:01:46.130> deep<00:01:46.460> perhaps

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
lunar cycle we've gone deep perhaps

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.030 
lunar cycle we've gone deep perhaps
we've<00:01:47.120> done<00:01:47.330> some<00:01:47.540> transformation<00:01:48.380> now<00:01:48.860> it's

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
we've done some transformation now it's

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.950 
we've done some transformation now it's
time<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.400> enjoy<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.640> fiery<00:01:50.060> more<00:01:50.390> passionate

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
more adventurous side of life and that's

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.060 
more adventurous side of life and that's
what<00:01:53.180> sagittarius<00:01:53.870> is<00:01:53.990> all<00:01:54.170> about<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:54.980> with
