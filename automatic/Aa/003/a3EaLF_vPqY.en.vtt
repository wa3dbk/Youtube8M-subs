00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.659
 hi everyone i hope you 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.950
 go well so here I am back 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:11.099
 after a few months six or seven months 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.360
 of total inactivity of the chain so he 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.610
 there are some explanations then the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.350
 work the job over the season the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.130
 work the season and the pre season and 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.109
 I moved 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.140
 so here I have not had time to 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.269
 to be able to edit a video project but 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.380
 that's it, it's gone with a little 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.380
 destruction guide 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.800
 first of all i'm going to do a little 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.280
 parenthesis and you talk about the main 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.589
 change 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.390
 the grimoire of sacrifice has no more dowry 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.219
 but had a 5% hub 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.500
 the glowing connection took a big nerve 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.089
 it went from 11 to 5% the flames 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.190
 incendiary sacrifices are a 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.500
 new talent and replaces harvest of 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.059
 life and trick of kid jaden who is not 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.340
 more passive and has become a talent 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.930
 then they laid us a beautiful 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.270
 paragraph about the value of the sisters but 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.970
 good by and large that's good and that's 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.970
 not good they just had to break 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.850
 techniques are missing and they 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.770
 are three twilight guards 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.420
 the curse of elements and ganges 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.410
 reflections and yeah and to finish with 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.420
 the changes we have a new 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.040
 feature the benefits of driver 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.360
 so first we have the trait 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.280
 chaos amplify his time 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.200
 incantation is reduced by 0.5 seconds 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.610
 immolation overwhelming your 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.930
 without thinking of inflicting immolation 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.220
 guys and more when she hits the target 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.740
 for the first time the connection 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:47.210
 glowing improve + 20% in front of screw 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.000
 extra yeah we feel when 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.320
 even the nerve 1 and the amplified tumult 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.340
 which reduces the cooldown of 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.690
 tumult of five seconds 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.570
 let's talk about statistics now 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.070
 istat failure the intelligence no longer believes 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.259
 chance to critically hit the odds 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.119
 of critical hit went from 8 to 5% 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.160
 the touch the expertise and the cap at 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.140
 have disappeared each specialization 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.670
 has a passive harmony and for 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.380
 we warn destruction the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.610
 devastation you win 15% of 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.989
 additional criticism on all 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.830
 sources and we have new 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.239
 characteristics 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.430
 versatility and multiple typing 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.120
 but let's talk about not actually I 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.620
 not going to talk about it 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.520
 you will understand why you 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.810
 maybe should tell him this time 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.860
 that we need to pause 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.320
 priorities 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.410
 so of course critical and then mastery 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.840
 yes we would tend to say that for 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.950
 the mono if it would take more criticism 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.590
 because it generates more embers is ready 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.230
 for the multi targets because with the 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.209
 tumult we can for the moment it takes 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.560
 to rely on a critical optimization 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.720
 mastery and there will most certainly 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.370
 a much more precise optimization when 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.140
 of a future maj of the extension in this 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.880
 concerning the charred remains 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.530
 I will not talk about it because for 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.000
 now it is the least to small and 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.530
 now the talents I'm going to you 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.830
 talk only about the last three 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.690
 bearings 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.340
 these are the most important indeed because 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.049
 most affect moving 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.610
 the damage absorption and the points 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.080
 so says everything depends on the boss then 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.610
 firstly we have the grimoire of 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.140
 sacrifice that sacrifices your 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.880
 demons and so increase the power 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.530
 of your character this grimoire is 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.940
 valid if you have a master's degree 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.110
 quite high and many copper 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.840
 then we have the grimoire of 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.209
 Service we forget the least to 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.890
 little ones for now and the grimoire of 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.720
 supremacy that allows you to improve 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.560
 your demons and increase by 20% his 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.810
 power 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.849
 by default to start on the most 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.590
 August and the demons let's go back the guy 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.280
 of funes if you use bondage 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.690
 demonic 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.280
 the observer was used in the 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.930
 most cases and the imp 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.670
 if you have target changes or 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.950
 of displacement second tier then 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.760
 we have the fury of my note I do not 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.860
 not going to talk about it 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.810
 then the Russian kid jaden a talent 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.130
 which is to use when you have two 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.750
 small displacements and darkness 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.980
 darchy world the talent that is to take 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.630
 in general when you do not have any 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.400
 movement or very little and the nibo palace 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.050
 without the demonic bondage 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.730
 it's a choice that we take by default 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.760
 cataclysm when you have many 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.769
 clive owen and the charred remains 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.330
 I will not talk about it I do not linger 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.950
 not on the pictures by cons we 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.420
 have the dark lady glyph which is 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.769
 interesting indeed it allows for 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.390
 reduce the cooldown of your 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.739
 dark soul had a minute 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.930
 but watch this glyph and profitable 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.670
 only if you need to do 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.110
 several burst phases if you are 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.610
 in the need to fall teenagers 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.930
 faster or so if you want that 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.579
 your bony bone 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.109
 and we also have the uproar lift 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.400
 which doubles your charges so 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.630
 to go from three to six 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.220
 but his recharge time increased by 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.810
 35 seconds so be careful it's a 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.310
 glyph to use with a lot of 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.720
 caution I will certainly make a 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.140
 next video to explain this more 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.700
 in detail 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.860
 optimization goes through enchantment 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.240
 and crimping there has been a change 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.440
 for each of his professions for 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.330
 enchantment are only available 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.430
 now that the tears collar 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.500
 the cape elano folds for gems the 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.600
 crimping bonus no longer exists and the 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.190
 young people became unique after in the 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.419
 choice of the characteristic if in 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.650
 your optimization you must but you 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.820
 criticism or mastery as I 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.160
 wanted to say not going to put me in 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.630
 strength or agility and to finish in 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.740
 consumables optimization 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.030
 we have the intelligence flask 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.830
 resnik that increases your intelligence 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.570
 200 for one hour the potion 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.680
 of intelligence resnik +1000 intelligence 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.539
 for 25 seconds 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.340
 the wild feast that increases by 100 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.320
 a secondary feature and the 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.820
 improvement rhune concentrated more than 50 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.840
 intelligence for an hour the 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.669
 gameplay 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.840
 the gameplay in mono target does not change 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.669
 but some mechanisms have been 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.289
 deleted as the system of 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.850
 periodic effects update 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:15.050
 but I'll talk about it later 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.150
 sense level talents and at the 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.220
 suppression of selling 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.900
 so as usual maintain 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.640
 immolation on the target all the time 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.980
 contrary your breizh using 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.960
 conflagration and incinerate use 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.650
 your chaos trait with the maximum of 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.690
 possible proofs 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.520
 the burning of london at 20% points 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.440
 of life with the maximum of proc most 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.000
 of fire if traveling if you 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.290
 do not have account creation and well 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.910
 sure in the most delicate moments 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.890
 do not forget to use your soul 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.120
 dark and your sisters ratio I will do very 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.100
 certainly later another video 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.630
 on opening in destruction the 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.520
 multi target gameplay is identical to 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.120
 that of mr pandaria but there is a 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.040
 difference 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.300
 the reactualization of the effects 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.250
 periodical 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.960
 no, but what is this delirium in combat? 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.380
 a fight mists of pandaria pandemic 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.820
 nice it could look like it's going 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.140
 guys we keep fighting we get 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.040
 not that we fight to get ready and 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.660
 go go go go go go 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:07.050
 simply satisfied 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:09.180
 I put over updates the 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:15.710
 warlocks we will end up with 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:15.710
 weird dudes according to shifts right 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:25.950
 the evening in there is there we finally fall 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.270
 in these towers is served as tires 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.940
 winter 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.260
 I do not care to be a little bit more 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.150
 clear with you for example if a mister 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.900
 pandaria you put a dowry so 200 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.240
 % power 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.380
 the title of your remaining lot is at 200% at 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.640
 less of course to refresh it 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.710
 except that now you ask your 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.240
 buddy with 200% power and when 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.340
 for example, you had an intel proc 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.110
 of ethics which at the base was 200% 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.670
 adapts to the current proc we have 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.440
 so period effects that have become 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.790
 dynamic at the cycle level there is 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.530
 no real change of tumults 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.090
 and use when available 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.740
 on a secondary target and remember 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.480
 not that immolation conflagration 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.370
 cremated and the burning of the shadow 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.080
 consumes a stack while the trait 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.670
 chaos consumes 3 at the level of 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.500
 duplication of spells and techniques by 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.300
 your tumult there are two schools 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.830
 different depending on the situation during 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.390
 of a fight since in the example of 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.250
 fight against paradises slaps if 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.580
 it is useless to duplicate his feature of 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.950
 chaos 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.870
 Apart from scratching the DPS for the 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.460
 level of the strategy of mono dps is 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.350
 more profitable so we have the optics 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.490
 embers expense duplicate the burn 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.590
 of london and the trait of chaos and 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.960
 the optics generation of embers duplicate 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.580
 the cremated conflagration and immolation 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.200
 and here is this video is now 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.430
 completed I want to thank all 

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.920
 especially one to esca 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.630
 director of warnock spirit for 

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.830
 his support and for his help to the 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.910
 creation of this guide 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.440
 do not forget that this video is 

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.790
 for beginners and that I have 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.410
 not pretending to be a big fat 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.120
 players here I find you very quickly 

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.330
