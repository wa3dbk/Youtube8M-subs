00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Servus people welcome to the fitness tv 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.180
 my name is rafael this time we want 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.309
 again a corner answer many of 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.230
 you wanted to know you can target 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.420
 Say, if I target the decrease 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.190
 because belly also train from there 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.660
 yes, can specifically build muscles speak 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.250
 When I change the biceps often, the wheels change 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.359
 Of course if I have the chest often in 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.189
 Of course everyone grows these too 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.060
 Consequently, you can also targeted 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.800
 lose weight 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.420
 I have to disappoint you unfortunately that 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.730
 is not possible why is not that 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.349
 possible because the body is even 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.849
 that would decrease quite completely 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.140
 Comic proportions come when I am 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.110
 train a certain area and 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.829
 It's much less then it is 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.510
 so that you increase there rather 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.160
 but not seen negatively now 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.960
 You train a muscle area 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.390
 the muscles are strengthened and grow 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.129
 accordingly you have to do that 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.300
 Generally so imagine with the weight loss 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.309
 the with a swimming pool 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.260
 why the pool when a 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.539
 at the pool rangeht and from the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.800
 water with a bucket of water brings out 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.539
 then she is not just one 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.920
 hole in the pool but that 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.410
 balances out again and that is with 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.340
 human body actually the same 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.989
 while there are places 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.000
 There you take off first that is at 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.610
 man's face and neck and at 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.130
 the woman also the face and the bosom 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.439
 but now a targeted muscle area 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.210
 train or an area 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.150
 Exercising on the body is losing weight there 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.310
 not possible you should still 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.080
 should train targeted areas yes 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.460
 As I said, one strengthens this one 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.020
 area then if you for example the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.630
 belly on trains then the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.250
 Hull muscles strengthen the vessel 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.049
 structure is expanded and general 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.049
 improves blood circulation there 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.640
 which of course has various advantages 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.710
 It is so if you like a lot 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.210
 sports and exercises his stomach 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.640
 then of course you strengthen the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.060
 abdominal muscle this grows and if 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.159
 I then after a long patience 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.939
 time I say finally losing weight 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.890
 of course, then you can also see that on 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.720
 belly was so to speak trained because the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.189
 abdominal muscles are larger than at 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.290
 someone who does not exercise the abdomen 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.570
 So hat has said anyway 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.259
 benefits now targeted to areas 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.880
 work out 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.159
 I hope I could ask you the question 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.840
 answer if you can lose weight 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.910
