the paper and it looks like it's uneven

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.479 
the paper and it looks like it's uneven
but<00:03:17.840> once<00:03:17.989> it<00:03:18.109> dries<00:03:18.349> it<00:03:18.380> actually<00:03:18.919> evens<00:03:19.340> out

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
but once it dries it actually evens out

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.270 
but once it dries it actually evens out
I've<00:03:20.180> done<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:21.019> the<00:03:21.139> other<00:03:21.319> sides<00:03:23.230> but

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
I've done it to the other sides but

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.849 
I've done it to the other sides but
unfortunately<00:03:25.419> because<00:03:26.419> these<00:03:26.930> papers<00:03:27.590> all

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
unfortunately because these papers all

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.839 
unfortunately because these papers all
fold<00:03:28.639> on<00:03:28.849> top<00:03:29.090> of<00:03:29.269> each<00:03:29.419> other<00:03:30.489> this<00:03:31.489> is<00:03:31.700> the

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
fold on top of each other this is the

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.729 
fold on top of each other this is the
longest<00:03:32.209> process<00:03:32.690> which<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:33.139> but<00:03:33.380> waiting<00:03:33.709> for

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
longest process which is but waiting for

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.500 
longest process which is but waiting for
the<00:03:34.010> glitter<00:03:34.250> glue<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.639> dry<00:03:34.760> so<00:03:35.030> that<00:03:35.060> I<00:03:35.180> can<00:03:35.389> do

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
the glitter glue to dry so that I can do

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.740 
the glitter glue to dry so that I can do
another<00:03:35.750> side<00:03:36.079> I've<00:03:36.620> done<00:03:37.060> everyone<00:03:38.060> except
