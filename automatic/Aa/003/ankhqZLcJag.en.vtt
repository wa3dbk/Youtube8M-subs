the<00:05:51.080> 80s<00:05:51.380> like<00:05:52.190> not<00:05:52.760> that<00:05:53.060> I've<00:05:53.210> been<00:05:53.240> to<00:05:53.750> small

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
the 80s like not that I've been to small

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.800 
the 80s like not that I've been to small
town<00:05:54.320> bars<00:05:54.590> the<00:05:54.770> 80s<00:05:55.130> I<00:05:55.370> just<00:05:56.090> feel<00:05:56.360> like<00:05:56.600> this

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
town bars the 80s I just feel like this

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:57.940 
town bars the 80s I just feel like this
could<00:05:56.990> have<00:05:57.110> been<00:05:57.200> a<00:05:57.230> small<00:05:57.500> town<00:05:57.710> barn

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
could have been a small town barn

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.400 
could have been a small town barn
eighties<00:05:58.300> and<00:05:59.300> now<00:05:59.450> our<00:05:59.570> Poncho's<00:06:00.050> hurry<00:06:00.320> up

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
eighties and now our Poncho's hurry up

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.480 
eighties and now our Poncho's hurry up
we've<00:06:00.560> got<00:06:00.740> like<00:06:00.920> like<00:06:01.490> nine<00:06:01.730> minutes<00:06:03.370> to<00:06:04.370> be

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
we've got like like nine minutes to be

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.250 
we've got like like nine minutes to be
fair<00:06:04.790> like<00:06:05.000> we've<00:06:05.150> been<00:06:05.330> sharing<00:06:05.630> our<00:06:05.960> beers

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260
