I really don't want the guts is part of

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.550 
I really don't want the guts is part of
the<00:01:05.830> bait<00:01:09.660> also<00:01:10.660> if<00:01:10.840> you're<00:01:11.050> in<00:01:11.170> a<00:01:11.200> place<00:01:11.440> where

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
the bait also if you're in a place where

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.280 
the bait also if you're in a place where
you're<00:01:11.920> not<00:01:12.100> sure<00:01:12.460> if<00:01:12.610> there's<00:01:12.880> crayfish<00:01:13.450> you

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
you're not sure if there's crayfish you

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.260 
you're not sure if there's crayfish you
can<00:01:14.500> take<00:01:14.710> some<00:01:14.980> cut<00:01:15.220> bait<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:15.550> just<00:01:15.970> place<00:01:16.240> it

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
can take some cut bait and just place it

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.690 
can take some cut bait and just place it
in<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.720> water<00:01:16.960> it's<00:01:17.590> best<00:01:17.860> if<00:01:18.100> you<00:01:18.130> anchor<00:01:18.670> it

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
in the water it's best if you anchor it

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.490 
in the water it's best if you anchor it
so<00:01:19.030> it<00:01:19.150> doesn't<00:01:19.360> disappear<00:01:19.990> when<00:01:20.200> you're<00:01:20.320> not

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
so it doesn't disappear when you're not

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.130 
so it doesn't disappear when you're not
looking<00:01:20.980> but<00:01:21.550> just<00:01:21.790> go<00:01:21.940> ahead<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:22.450> tie<00:01:23.110> a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
looking but just go ahead and tie a

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.170 
looking but just go ahead and tie a
piece<00:01:23.470> of<00:01:23.530> bait<00:01:23.860> with<00:01:24.130> some<00:01:24.340> string<00:01:24.700> or<00:01:24.970> rope

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
piece of bait with some string or rope

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.660 
piece of bait with some string or rope
or<00:01:25.510> netting<00:01:25.870> or<00:01:26.050> something<00:01:26.530> anchor<00:01:27.310> it<00:01:27.430> to<00:01:27.460> the

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
or netting or something anchor it to the

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.650 
or netting or something anchor it to the
bottom<00:01:28.890> then<00:01:29.890> give<00:01:30.160> it<00:01:30.190> about<00:01:30.400> 15<00:01:31.090> minutes<00:01:31.510> or

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
bottom then give it about 15 minutes or

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.900 
bottom then give it about 15 minutes or
so<00:01:31.900> and<00:01:31.930> come<00:01:32.290> back<00:01:32.440> and<00:01:32.680> check<00:01:32.770> it<00:01:33.190> if<00:01:33.580> there's

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
so and come back and check it if there's

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.640 
so and come back and check it if there's
crayfish<00:01:34.420> there<00:01:34.750> they're<00:01:34.990> gonna<00:01:35.140> come<00:01:35.470> in

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
crayfish there they're gonna come in

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.990 
crayfish there they're gonna come in
there<00:01:35.830> and<00:01:35.860> they're<00:01:36.070> going<00:01:36.190> to<00:01:36.310> be<00:01:36.430> pulling<00:01:36.729> on

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
there and they're going to be pulling on

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.880 
there and they're going to be pulling on
that<00:01:37.210> bait<00:01:37.510> they're<00:01:37.840> gonna<00:01:37.990> try<00:01:38.260> and<00:01:38.290> drag<00:01:38.680> it

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
that bait they're gonna try and drag it

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.859 
that bait they're gonna try and drag it
off<00:01:39.070> into<00:01:39.340> a<00:01:39.490> hole<00:01:39.729> someplace<00:01:40.090> so<00:01:40.540> they<00:01:40.660> can

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
off into a hole someplace so they can

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.960 
off into a hole someplace so they can
have<00:01:41.050> it<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.320> themselves<00:01:41.500> but<00:01:42.460> that's<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.760> good

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
have it to themselves but that's a good

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.520 
have it to themselves but that's a good
way<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.210> know<00:01:43.600> whether<00:01:43.900> or<00:01:44.020> not<00:01:44.140> there's

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
way to know whether or not there's

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.560 
way to know whether or not there's
crayfish<00:01:45.040> in<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.369> area<00:01:45.790> before<00:01:46.000> you<00:01:46.330> go

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
crayfish in the area before you go

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.109 
crayfish in the area before you go
invest<00:01:47.020> in<00:01:47.260> any<00:01:47.410> traps<00:01:47.800> or<00:01:48.100> anything<00:01:51.119> this

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
invest in any traps or anything this

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.300 
invest in any traps or anything this
brings<00:01:52.479> us<00:01:52.690> to<00:01:52.930> our<00:01:52.960> next<00:01:53.290> method<00:01:53.979> for

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
brings us to our next method for

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.390 
brings us to our next method for
catching<00:01:54.759> crayfish<00:01:55.530> I've<00:01:56.530> taken<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:57.160> guts

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
catching crayfish I've taken the guts

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.230 
catching crayfish I've taken the guts
from<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.180> trash<00:01:58.690> fish<00:01:59.140> and<00:01:59.770> I<00:02:00.550> put<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:00.850> rock<00:02:01.210> on

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
from the trash fish and I put a rock on

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.180 
from the trash fish and I put a rock on
top<00:02:01.540> of<00:02:02.110> it<00:02:02.259> so<00:02:02.500> it<00:02:02.619> can't<00:02:02.890> be<00:02:02.979> drugged<00:02:03.369> away

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
top of it so it can't be drugged away

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.740 
top of it so it can't be drugged away
that'll<00:02:06.190> tell<00:02:06.429> me<00:02:06.640> if<00:02:06.759> there's<00:02:07.000> crayfish<00:02:07.509> in

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
that'll tell me if there's crayfish in

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.000 
that'll tell me if there's crayfish in
the<00:02:07.869> area<00:02:09.600> and<00:02:10.600> if<00:02:10.750> I<00:02:10.899> don't<00:02:11.140> have<00:02:11.350> Nets<00:02:11.740> or<00:02:11.980> a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
the area and if I don't have Nets or a

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.430 
the area and if I don't have Nets or a
pole<00:02:12.340> that'll<00:02:12.910> also<00:02:13.060> give<00:02:13.300> me<00:02:13.660> an<00:02:13.780> opportunity

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
pole that'll also give me an opportunity

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:32.520 
pole that'll also give me an opportunity
to<00:02:14.560> catch<00:02:14.890> them

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.520 

but<00:02:33.530> there's<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.860> Handcock<00:02:34.460> crazy<00:02:34.850> fish<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:36.440> I

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
but there's a Handcock crazy fish so I

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.620 
but there's a Handcock crazy fish so I
could<00:02:36.770> sit<00:02:37.010> here<00:02:37.040> for<00:02:37.460> hours<00:02:37.490> and<00:02:38.210> just<00:02:38.390> keep

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
could sit here for hours and just keep

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.120 
could sit here for hours and just keep
pulling<00:02:38.870> these<00:02:39.140> things<00:02:39.200> out<00:02:39.770> one<00:02:40.100> by<00:02:40.340> one<00:02:42.130> well
