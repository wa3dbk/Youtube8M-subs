user interface of the camera is also

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.210 
user interface of the camera is also
pretty<00:03:48.690> good<00:03:48.840> this<00:03:49.530> option<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:50.040> switch

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
pretty good this option to switch

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.520 
pretty good this option to switch
between<00:03:50.370> two<00:03:50.970> user<00:03:51.209> interfaces<00:03:51.780> one<00:03:52.380> is

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
between two user interfaces one is

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.860 
between two user interfaces one is
simple<00:03:52.950> another<00:03:53.400> one<00:03:53.640> is<00:03:53.690> advanced<00:03:54.690> for

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
simple another one is advanced for

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.140 
simple another one is advanced for
advanced<00:03:55.230> users<00:03:55.340> with<00:03:56.340> which<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.670> can<00:03:56.910> access

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
advanced users with which you can access

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.259 
advanced users with which you can access
to<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.870> manual<00:03:58.310> iso<00:03:59.310> white<00:03:59.880> balance

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
to the manual iso white balance

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.780 
to the manual iso white balance
selection<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:00.989> stuff<00:04:01.140> like<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.320> also<00:04:02.070> it

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
selection and stuff like that also it

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.449 
selection and stuff like that also it
has<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.120> manual<00:04:03.420> macro<00:04:04.019> mode<00:04:04.170> so<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.070> photos

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
has a manual macro mode so the photos

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.090 
has a manual macro mode so the photos
are<00:04:05.640> quite<00:04:05.970> crispy<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:07.290> metal<00:04:07.530> sorts<00:04:07.950> are

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
are quite crispy and the metal sorts are

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.550 
are quite crispy and the metal sorts are
really<00:04:08.370> great<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:08.910> so<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.630> spread<00:04:09.959> is<00:04:10.140> pretty

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
really great and so the spread is pretty

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.590 
really great and so the spread is pretty
good<00:04:10.799> so<00:04:11.489> another<00:04:11.700> thing<00:04:11.790> maybe<00:04:12.269> you<00:04:12.480> are

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
good so another thing maybe you are

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.870 
good so another thing maybe you are
thinking<00:04:12.630> that<00:04:13.110> why<00:04:13.350> this<00:04:13.410> phone<00:04:13.920> is<00:04:14.190> so<00:04:14.670> much

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
thinking that why this phone is so much

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.150 
thinking that why this phone is so much
cheap<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.630> reason<00:04:15.989> of<00:04:16.109> this<00:04:16.169> cheap<00:04:16.829> phone

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
cheap the reason of this cheap phone

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.090 
cheap the reason of this cheap phone
because<00:04:17.880> there<00:04:18.479> is<00:04:18.600> no<00:04:18.989> advertising<00:04:19.500> cost<00:04:19.919> of

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
because there is no advertising cost of

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.730 
because there is no advertising cost of
the<00:04:20.340> phone<00:04:20.579> it<00:04:21.030> will<00:04:21.299> never<00:04:21.570> see<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.200> jemmye's

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
Flipkart website and just about it I

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.870 
Flipkart website and just about it I
think<00:04:32.180> so<00:04:32.710> Jeremy<00:04:33.710> is<00:04:33.860> really<00:04:34.130> cut<00:04:34.370> down<00:04:34.400> into

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
think so Jeremy is really cut down into

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.840 
think so Jeremy is really cut down into
the<00:04:34.970> advertising<00:04:35.480> costs<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:36.020> even<00:04:36.860> when<00:04:37.730> the

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
the advertising costs and even when the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.510 
the advertising costs and even when the
phone<00:04:38.060> was<00:04:38.240> coming<00:04:38.630> out<00:04:38.810> and<00:04:39.020> that<00:04:39.740> actual

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
phone was coming out and that actual

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.190 
phone was coming out and that actual
price<00:04:40.850> of<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.120> phone<00:04:41.150> were<00:04:41.510> six<00:04:41.810> thousand

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
price of the phone were six thousand

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.260 
price of the phone were six thousand
rupees<00:04:44.110> 6999<00:04:45.110> rupees<00:04:45.560> but<00:04:46.130> then<00:04:46.430> just<00:04:47.150> before

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
rupees 6999 rupees but then just before

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.330 
rupees 6999 rupees but then just before
one<00:04:47.600> day<00:04:47.750> of<00:04:47.870> launch<00:04:48.110> they<00:04:48.680> change<00:04:48.980> the<00:04:49.130> price

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
one day of launch they change the price

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.960 
one day of launch they change the price
to<00:04:49.520> 5099<00:04:50.480> so<00:04:50.960> it's<00:04:51.920> pretty<00:04:52.100> cheap<00:04:52.340> also<00:04:52.850> the

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
to 5099 so it's pretty cheap also the

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.850 
to 5099 so it's pretty cheap also the
phone<00:04:53.210> is<00:04:53.360> built<00:04:53.630> on<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:53.870> markets<00:04:54.290> of<00:04:54.470> China

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
phone is built on the markets of China

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.400 
phone is built on the markets of China
and<00:04:55.160> Korea<00:04:55.430> so<00:04:56.150> that<00:04:56.450> means<00:04:56.690> that<00:04:56.960> there<00:04:57.260> was

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
and Korea so that means that there was

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.860 
and Korea so that means that there was
very<00:04:57.770> very<00:04:58.220> low<00:04:58.580> labor<00:04:58.970> costs<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.480> very<00:04:59.630> very

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
very very low labor costs and very very

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.140 
very very low labor costs and very very
low<00:05:00.110> production<00:05:00.500> cost<00:05:00.650> so<00:05:01.430> that<00:05:01.460> is<00:05:01.940> one<00:05:02.060> of

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
low production cost so that is one of

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.030 
low production cost so that is one of
the<00:05:02.180> other<00:05:02.480> another<00:05:02.960> factor<00:05:03.380> why<00:05:03.620> this<00:05:03.680> phone

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
the other another factor why this phone

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.280 
the other another factor why this phone
is<00:05:04.280> so<00:05:04.310> much<00:05:04.670> cheap<00:05:04.970> well<00:05:05.540> that<00:05:05.810> being<00:05:06.050> said

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
is so much cheap well that being said

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.810 
is so much cheap well that being said
whether<00:05:06.560> everyone<00:05:06.920> is<00:05:07.220> going<00:05:07.520> to<00:05:07.610> have<00:05:07.700> the
