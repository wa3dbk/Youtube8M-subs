the<00:01:47.009> first<00:01:47.250> girl<00:01:47.460> gave<00:01:47.729> him<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.030> confidence

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
to go on a school a second which will

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.319 
to go on a school a second which will
give<00:01:50.159> them<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.310> confidence<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.790> go<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.149> and

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
give them the confidence to go on and

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.770 
give them the confidence to go on and
score<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.840> lot<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.530> goals<00:01:53.210> not<00:01:54.210> necessarily

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
score a lot of goals not necessarily

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.840 
score a lot of goals not necessarily
this<00:01:55.049> year<00:01:55.259> but<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.530> coming<00:01:55.890> seasons<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.670> I

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
this year but in coming seasons and I

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.889 
this year but in coming seasons and I
think<00:01:57.560> he<00:01:58.560> might<00:01:58.740> he<00:01:59.340> won't<00:01:59.549> ever<00:01:59.750> shrug<00:02:00.750> off

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
think he might he won't ever shrug off

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.020 
think he might he won't ever shrug off
that<00:02:01.140> price<00:02:01.380> price<00:02:02.009> tag<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.460> was<00:02:02.579> too<00:02:02.790> high

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
that price price tag it was too high

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.330 
that price price tag it was too high
they<00:02:03.450> paid<00:02:03.719> over<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.020> odds<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.649> he<00:02:05.219> will

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
they paid over the odds and he will

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.130 
they paid over the odds and he will
never<00:02:05.460> live<00:02:05.700> up<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.000> 50<00:02:06.509> million<00:02:06.990> they

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
never live up to that 50 million they

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.700 
never live up to that 50 million they
paid<00:02:07.670> but<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.970> am<00:02:09.629> confident

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
paid but I am confident

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.190 
paid but I am confident
that<00:02:11.370> he<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.700> getting<00:02:11.850> back<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.360> his<00:02:12.480> best<00:02:12.810> a

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
that he is getting back to his best a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.740 
that he is getting back to his best a
lot<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.190> people<00:02:14.430> said<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:15.330> after<00:02:15.540> than<00:02:15.660> the

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
lot of people said that after than the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.570 
lot of people said that after than the
operation<00:02:16.230> he<00:02:16.320> had<00:02:16.410> at<00:02:16.530> Liverpool<00:02:16.950> he<00:02:17.130> lost<00:02:17.310> it

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
operation he had at Liverpool he lost it

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.940 
operation he had at Liverpool he lost it
and<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:18.390> think<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:18.960> true<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.440> an<00:02:19.500> extent

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
and I think that is true to an extent

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.760 
and I think that is true to an extent
but<00:02:20.910> he<00:02:21.810> suddenly<00:02:22.050> looks<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.590> lot<00:02:22.710> more

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
but he suddenly looks a lot more

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.610 
but he suddenly looks a lot more
confident<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:24.540> rather<00:02:24.780> than<00:02:24.990> coming<00:02:25.320> deep

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
confident and it rather than coming deep

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.590 
confident and it rather than coming deep
and<00:02:25.860> looking<00:02:26.070> for<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.220> ball<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.490> not<00:02:27.270> playing

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
and looking for the ball and not playing

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.200 
and looking for the ball and not playing
how<00:02:27.870> Torres<00:02:28.260> usually<00:02:28.740> plays<00:02:29.010> he's<00:02:29.580> looking<00:02:30.150> a

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
how Torres usually plays he's looking a

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.640 
how Torres usually plays he's looking a
bit<00:02:30.240> more<00:02:30.510> like<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.930> Torres<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.350> sits<00:02:31.560> on

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
bit more like the Torres that sits on

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.700 
bit more like the Torres that sits on
the<00:02:31.770> last<00:02:31.980> man<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.520> is<00:02:33.270> always<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.840> big<00:02:34.020> threat

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
the last man and is always a big threat

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.710 
the last man and is always a big threat

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
best because he's an exciting player to

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.070 
best because he's an exciting player to
watch<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.670> is<00:03:11.760> best<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:12.270> it's<00:03:12.810> going<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:12.990> be

against<00:03:19.680> Spurs<00:03:20.250> but<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:20.940> think<00:03:21.360> that's<00:03:21.510> going

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
against Spurs but I think that's going

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.210 
against Spurs but I think that's going
to<00:03:21.660> be<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.810> very<00:03:21.870> tight<00:03:22.320> game<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.710> couldn't<00:03:23.070> call

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
to be a very tight game I couldn't call

to be a very tight game I couldn't call
that<00:03:23.460> I<00:03:23.670> mean<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.300> really<00:03:24.480> couldn't<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:25.980> anyway

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
that I mean I really couldn't so anyway

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.650

guys<00:03:26.580> that's<00:03:26.640> all<00:03:26.910> I<00:03:26.970> wanted<00:03:27.210> to<00:03:27.330> speak<00:03:27.540> about

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.350 
guys that's all I wanted to speak about
today<00:03:28.140> I<00:03:28.380> think<00:03:28.770> she'll<00:03:29.010> see<00:03:29.190> if<00:03:29.960> you<00:03:30.960> know

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
today I think she'll see if you know

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.580 
today I think she'll see if you know
it's<00:03:33.360> hard<00:03:33.540> because<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:33.930> paid<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:34.410> much<00:03:34.470> money

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
it's hard because I paid so much money

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.830 
it's hard because I paid so much money
for<00:03:34.980> him<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.280> can't<00:03:35.520> justify<00:03:35.910> that<00:03:36.180> but<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:36.750> think

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
for him I can't justify that but I think

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.360 
for him I can't justify that but I think
they<00:03:37.140> might<00:03:37.350> have<00:03:37.380> finally<00:03:37.740> got<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.190> player

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
they might have finally got the player

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.180 
they might have finally got the player
they<00:03:38.610> wanted<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.440> like<00:03:40.440> I<00:03:40.590> say<00:03:40.740> it's<00:03:40.920> early
