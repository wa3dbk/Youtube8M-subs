then you strain it and the water that

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.009 
then you strain it and the water that
you<00:03:13.099> get<00:03:13.280> off<00:03:13.489> just<00:03:13.849> training<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.419> that's<00:03:14.870> a

vegetable stock to this okay give it one
last<00:03:22.400> stir<00:03:22.700> before<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:24.380> pressure<00:03:24.650> cooker<00:03:25.130> so

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.699 

we've<00:03:28.519> been<00:03:28.669> pressure<00:03:28.880> cooking<00:03:29.239> our<00:03:29.389> soup<00:03:29.750> for

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
really tough day you come home and you

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.009 
really tough day you come home and you
don't<00:03:44.180> really<00:03:44.599> want<00:03:45.190> like<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.250> big<00:03:46.370> meal<00:03:46.880> so<00:03:47.299> you

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
can make the soup and you can have a

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.020 
can make the soup and you can have a
piece<00:03:50.750> of<00:03:50.780> bread<00:03:51.049> with<00:03:51.349> it<00:03:51.530> and<00:03:51.799> boiler<00:03:52.730> you're

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
piece of bread with it and boiler you're

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.800 
piece of bread with it and boiler you're
done<00:03:53.530> so<00:03:54.530> now<00:03:54.799> I<00:03:54.829> have<00:03:55.489> turned<00:03:56.090> off<00:03:56.299> the<00:03:56.359> flame

done so now I have turned off the flame
of<00:03:57.669> the<00:03:58.669> pressure<00:03:58.879> cooker<00:03:59.000> so<00:03:59.540> the<00:04:00.290> pressure

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
of the pressure cooker so the pressure

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.159 
of the pressure cooker so the pressure
inside<00:04:01.430> is<00:04:01.639> released<00:04:02.000> and<00:04:02.269> I<00:04:02.389> can<00:04:02.540> safely<00:04:02.750> open

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
inside is released and I can safely open

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:05.020 
inside is released and I can safely open
this<00:04:03.349> so<00:04:03.919> now<00:04:04.069> we're<00:04:04.459> gonna<00:04:04.549> open<00:04:04.729> the

this so now we're gonna open the

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.460 
this so now we're gonna open the
pressure<00:04:05.239> cooker<00:04:06.190> mmm<00:04:07.190> it's<00:04:07.609> all<00:04:08.030> smells<00:04:08.780> wool

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
to have some fun the distressing blender

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:29.450 
to have some fun the distressing blender
attack<00:04:21.130> here<00:04:22.130> we<00:04:22.310> go

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.910 

so<00:04:30.460> are<00:04:30.610> tomatoes<00:04:31.150> carrots<00:04:31.930> onions<00:04:32.590> all<00:04:32.800> the

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
so are tomatoes carrots onions all the

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.230 
so are tomatoes carrots onions all the
lovely<00:04:33.190> ingredients<00:04:33.700> we<00:04:33.820> put<00:04:33.970> into<00:04:34.090> the

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
lovely ingredients we put into the

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.900 
lovely ingredients we put into the
pressure<00:04:34.480> cooker<00:04:34.630> is<00:04:35.050> now<00:04:35.290> blended<00:04:36.220> into<00:04:36.580> this

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
pressure cooker is now blended into this

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.810 
pressure cooker is now blended into this
which<00:04:37.570> we<00:04:37.870> are<00:04:38.020> going<00:04:38.200> to<00:04:38.500> strain<00:04:39.130> through<00:04:39.670> the

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
which we are going to strain through the

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:47.550 
which we are going to strain through the
sieve<00:04:42.690> so<00:04:43.690> that<00:04:43.980> you<00:04:44.980> only<00:04:45.220> get<00:04:45.640> the<00:04:46.390> nice<00:04:46.810> non

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
sieve so that you only get the nice non

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.880 
sieve so that you only get the nice non
pulpy<00:04:48.360> liquid<00:04:49.360> so<00:04:49.840> now<00:04:50.080> comes<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:50.410> crucial

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
pulpy liquid so now comes the crucial

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.400 
pulpy liquid so now comes the crucial
test<00:04:51.190> of<00:04:51.520> making<00:04:52.300> just<00:04:52.540> about<00:04:52.750> anything<00:04:53.670> is

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
test of making just about anything is

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.410 
test of making just about anything is
the<00:04:56.410> salt<00:04:56.680> right<00:04:59.520> yes<00:05:00.550> psychology

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
the salt right yes psychology

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.110 
the salt right yes psychology
salt<00:05:02.260> is<00:05:02.380> right<00:05:02.860> so<00:05:03.310> I've<00:05:03.430> already<00:05:03.760> put<00:05:03.910> a<00:05:03.940> pan

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
salt is right so I've already put a pan

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.600 
salt is right so I've already put a pan
on<00:05:04.150> heat<00:05:04.540> and<00:05:04.870> I'm<00:05:05.140> gonna<00:05:05.320> take<00:05:05.590> this<00:05:05.770> Puri<00:05:06.160> and

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
on heat and I'm gonna take this Puri and

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.440 
on heat and I'm gonna take this Puri and
add<00:05:07.420> it<00:05:07.780> into<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.770> pan<00:05:08.950> so<00:05:09.910> I'm<00:05:10.030> gonna<00:05:10.180> let<00:05:10.390> it

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
add it into the pan so I'm gonna let it

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.750 
add it into the pan so I'm gonna let it
boil<00:05:10.840> it's<00:05:11.170> already<00:05:11.500> starting<00:05:11.890> to<00:05:11.920> boil<00:05:12.220> so

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
boil it's already starting to boil so

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.070 
boil it's already starting to boil so
that<00:05:12.970> you<00:05:13.150> know<00:05:13.240> it<00:05:13.330> becomes<00:05:13.570> a<00:05:13.720> little<00:05:13.870> more

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
that you know it becomes a little more

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.040 
that you know it becomes a little more
thick<00:05:14.410> okay<00:05:15.100> so<00:05:15.160> now<00:05:15.490> I've<00:05:15.850> got<00:05:16.210> it<00:05:16.390> roughly<00:05:16.840> to

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
thick okay so now I've got it roughly to

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.870 
thick okay so now I've got it roughly to
the<00:05:17.140> consistency<00:05:17.680> I<00:05:18.010> want<00:05:18.400> because<00:05:18.580> you<00:05:18.790> know

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
the consistency I want because you know

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.100 
the consistency I want because you know
when<00:05:19.000> you're<00:05:19.090> gonna<00:05:19.180> add<00:05:19.450> the<00:05:19.660> coconut<00:05:19.870> milk

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
when you're gonna add the coconut milk

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.860 
when you're gonna add the coconut milk
it's<00:05:20.560> again<00:05:21.250> going<00:05:21.280> to<00:05:21.640> get<00:05:21.910> a<00:05:22.150> little<00:05:22.630> lighter

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
it's again going to get a little lighter

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.740 
it's again going to get a little lighter
than<00:05:23.320> what<00:05:23.470> you<00:05:23.620> have<00:05:23.800> here<00:05:24.150> right<00:05:25.150> it's<00:05:25.510> time

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
than what you have here right it's time

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.200 
than what you have here right it's time
