 hello to all the kids these fish 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.660
 iTunes and in this video I'm going to tell you about 

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:11.940
 little bit about whatsapp television 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.919
 in yesterday 7 whatsapp is one of the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.570
 most expected updates under my 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.510
 point of view for all users 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.920
 of using since since they left them 7a 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.690
 already run since September if not 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.320
 I remember badly they have not updated yet 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.090
 the application this is pissing off at 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.990
 many users I have seen enough 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.989
 videos out there post equipment and so on 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.700
 worth criticizing whatsapp enough 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.380
 good from my point of view a company 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.510
 as big as whatsapp with so many 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.100
 users and so much money can not 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.880
 allow yourself to update your application 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.040
 for the users of it 7 also good 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.460
 if the application would still be 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.230
 free as we could understand it but 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.620
 besides that we are paying for it 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.719
 what a minimum they give us there are in 7 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.180
 Well the fact is that after so much 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.829
 time without whatsapp news seems 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.379
 be that they have sent the update 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.409
 of them 7 apple and to the surprise of 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.140
 all apple has supposedly rejected 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.840
 ok it 's a guess apple has 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.020
 rejected the application due to problems of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.130
 privacy policy at least that's 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.680
 what several have insured 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.409
 developers on whatsapp twitter 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.140
 It seems to be good that we are going to have 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.670
 to wait a little longer to have whatsapp 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.009
 adapted to them 7 good a very video 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.110

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.910
