these<00:00:28.980> rectangles<00:00:29.970> right<00:00:30.150> here<00:00:32.059> and<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.450> you

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
these rectangles right here and I you

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.280 
these rectangles right here and I you
know<00:00:33.809> play<00:00:34.110> some<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.829> quarter<00:00:35.960> for<00:00:36.960> whatever

know play some that quarter for whatever
as<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.399> can<00:00:38.579> see<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.300> know<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:40.200> want<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.500> make

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
as you can see you know you want to make

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.209 
as you can see you know you want to make

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
them diagonal like that way so when you

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.619 
them diagonal like that way so when you
come<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.610> with<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.910> curved<00:00:45.270> line<00:00:45.530> you<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:47.629> you

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
come in with the curved line you can you

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.400 
come in with the curved line you can you
get<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.760> sharp

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
get that sharp

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.010 
get that sharp
curl<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.850> chin<00:00:54.060> to<00:00:54.300> it

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
curl the chin to it

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.410 
curl the chin to it
and<00:00:55.970> so<00:00:56.970> see<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.720> curve<00:00:57.960> line<00:00:58.170> manga<00:00:59.420> so

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
and so see the curve line manga so

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.070 
and so see the curve line manga so
anyways<00:01:00.810> we<00:01:01.770> want<00:01:01.950> to<00:01:02.070> place<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.900> over<00:01:03.900> there

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
anyways we want to place that over there

it's<00:01:57.990> kind<00:01:58.289> of<00:01:58.409> ugly<00:01:59.280> right<00:01:59.670> now<00:01:59.729> but<00:02:01.009> because

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
it's kind of ugly right now but because

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.789 
it's kind of ugly right now but because
I<00:02:02.159> was<00:02:02.250> moving<00:02:02.460> things<00:02:02.880> around<00:02:03.000> anyways<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
I was moving things around anyways and

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.279 
I was moving things around anyways and
then<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.039> come<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.310> with<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.759> G<00:02:05.969> right<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
then you come in with the G right so the

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.449 
then you come in with the G right so the
g<00:02:07.530> oh<00:02:07.829> yeah<00:02:08.580> i<00:02:08.849> also<00:02:09.179> use<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:10.459> medium

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
g oh yeah i also use the medium

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.240 
g oh yeah i also use the medium
rectangle<00:02:11.670> for<00:02:12.569> some<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.050> stuff<00:02:13.319> because

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
rectangle for some of the stuff because

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.670 
rectangle for some of the stuff because
i<00:02:14.670> figured<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.510> thin<00:02:15.840> rectangle<00:02:16.470> when<00:02:16.590> you

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
i figured the thin rectangle when you

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.190 
i figured the thin rectangle when you
try<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.920> make<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:18.480> know<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.750> was<00:02:18.870> like<00:02:18.989> that

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
try to make it you know it was like that

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.080 
try to make it you know it was like that
then<00:02:20.930> so<00:02:21.930> medium<00:02:22.860> one<00:02:23.040> worked<00:02:23.310> better<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.970> make

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
then so medium one worked better to make

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.120 
then so medium one worked better to make
just<00:02:24.420> part<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.780> jeep<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.519> know<00:02:26.989> so

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
just part of the jeep I know so

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.660 
just part of the jeep I know so
I<00:02:29.190> mean<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.300> know<00:02:30.420> that's<00:02:30.630> basically<00:02:31.490> make<00:02:32.490> it

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
I mean you know that's basically make it

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.350 
I mean you know that's basically make it
all<00:02:32.790> then<00:02:33.300> make<00:02:33.480> your<00:02:33.600> G<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.230> then<00:02:35.150> we<00:02:36.150> gonna

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
all then make your G and then we gonna

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.080 
all then make your G and then we gonna
get<00:02:36.660> this<00:02:37.050> part<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.650> G<00:02:37.830> that's<00:02:38.010> curved<00:02:38.370> you

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
get this part of the G that's curved you

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.800 
get this part of the G that's curved you
know<00:02:39.210> when<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.200> made<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:41.220> was<00:02:41.370> right<00:02:41.580> here<00:02:41.810> so

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
know when I made it it was right here so

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.320 
know when I made it it was right here so
you<00:02:43.410> know<00:02:43.530> select<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.370> layer<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.910> keep

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
you know select that layer I keep

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.860 
you know select that layer I keep
pumping<00:02:46.020> it<00:02:46.140> up<00:02:46.260> until<00:02:46.710> you<00:02:46.770> you<00:02:47.700> pass<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.630> over

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
pumping it up until you you pass it over

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.180 
pumping it up until you you pass it over
the<00:02:48.990> hill<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:50.610> know<00:02:50.670> that's<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:52.190> make

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
the hill and you know that's it I make

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.280 
the hill and you know that's it I make
sure<00:02:53.220> you're<00:02:53.610> very<00:02:53.640> very<00:02:54.090> last<00:02:56.300> layer<00:02:57.300> it's

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
sure you're very very last layer it's

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.290 
sure you're very very last layer it's
going<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.650> be<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:59.100> background<00:02:59.550> layer<00:02:59.640> you

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
going to be the background layer you

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.190 
going to be the background layer you
know<00:03:00.480> that's<00:03:01.350> where<00:03:01.760> you're<00:03:02.760> gonna<00:03:02.960> see<00:03:03.960> all
