 What is a decentralized market big than 80 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:10.369
 gramm fat or something about a day 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:11.930
 100 105 kilo 80 grams of fat a day so 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.400
 I should already have 50 km of protein 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.980
 calculated and cancer 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.140
 fill up a bit more times 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.750
 I do not feel a little less 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:26.600
 important at the moment I take care of that 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.910
 Use nutrition correctly 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.340
 obviously in reuth and have 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.210
 otherwise as I said 70 percent I am 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.840
 M traveling 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.750
 It's enough right now because I have two 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.410
 for years on types of construction therefore 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.989
 the exercise had been trained now 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.900
 really like that if you really 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.580
 trained hard then it is like that 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.720
 then you can clearly I have one now 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.209
 bit bold 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.350
 but I was I knew the ten weeks 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:00.050
 again a bit of form and 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.060
 is also so if as long as he trained 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.459
 Body knows what with this energy 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.450
 to start you guys for this 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.239
 is not it 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.950
 they are so you can virtually in you 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.510
 does not pull the absolute track 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.830
 you can not really go in there 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.170
 be bold quotation marks 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:21.080
 I have now after 4 4 5 kilo weighs 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:41.450
 and not all of it was completely muscle 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:43.280
 but definitely you can 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.590
 I can really get fit that way 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.569
 long hard these guys trained this 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.720
 power lifts that are really fat 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.489
 make force feeding that is the 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.410
 force yourself to eat bring yourself 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.959
 really shitty eat because even the 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.910
 So do not force yourself to do that 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.310
 hunger and the press again 20 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.810
 do not make the gram on Austria 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.840
 Do not go so far as to table 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:11.690
 are still relatively safe is not much 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:13.880
 More shit the first 10,000 calories 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.189
 days around scratching with shit ford full 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.389
 full weeks so 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:21.250
 the rest are liberated from the 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:25.750
 calories from fat with carbohydrates 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.819
 protein artificial especially what has 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.340
 these people make so this this 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:40.090
 a kilo of protein stories like mill 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:41.560
 under construction if you want to build up clean 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.449
 then you have all the macros 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.210
 stretch it all right if he 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.710
 however, as I say now, hey 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.150
 I have my priority now, too 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.979
 honestly says is no longer with 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.180
 strong on fitness because it is pretty 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.449
 become a by-thing 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.000
 but my priority is hardly 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.870
 more than ever and his business topics 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.870
 to support 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:08.110
 then you can be successful too 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:10.449
 only build up with 170 accuracy and 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.770
 just eat when you hungry and 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:16.719
 easy through the food selection 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.840
 So pay attention 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:21.340
 the product ways of life and we were 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.349
 even in such a part of the story 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.210
 there it was really that this is 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.440
 This thai curry is just the number 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.210
 just be pure fat 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.360
 and something brings you then also 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.409
 not something of something the 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.480
 take distance 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:39.530
 then the shop is running 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.610
 Very well, I really wanted it that way 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.620
 a little bit is the old 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.100
 possibility he should have something 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:49.550
 Dismantled one say yes ralf you are and 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.290
 what you do not do anything trained determines 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.650
 does not eat all day but shit 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.610
 and so and I have to tell you it has 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.080
 a huge stress as I am now 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:02.750
 example, any blue work of 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.430
 pick up ground to eat currently 100 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.220
 percent with markus on the way to be so 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.320
 Ralf has me completely Hesse also drive 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.060
 Mental mental capacity a bit 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.510
 Celebrate, you just go and tell me 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.520
 I'm hungry 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.690
 I want to eat that now and then it is 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.150
 you know then do not think about it 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.580
 it's for the people say hey 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.030
 the optics is out of the question if you 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.620
 if you say optics is yours 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.960
 first place 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.540
 then it could be his team 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.880
 follow advice 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.710
 his tip and his 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.970
 implement advice and a suitable one 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.590
 stays the whole time we have to 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.420
 but of course more effort 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.860
 operate and I operate 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.840
 currently with nutrition no big 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.550
 effort but operates people 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.170
 i was stupid about quite different things 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.640
 topics eg how I am 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.500
 regular genes for example that to 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.970
 for example, a topic that I do it myself 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.790
 Much more important that my time better 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:56.350
 created 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:58.770
 our physio team needs you to go 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.800
 he has to make up the camera 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.800
 O
