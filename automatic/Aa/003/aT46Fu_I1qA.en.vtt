00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520
 warning more hurts there walked well old 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.200
 so if the opponent jorge bittar the 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.200
 enemy in the air 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.000
 Tell me guys, Bruno, just seven back. 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.160
 everything good beauty in the video today I'll bring 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.610
 a sharing of santi destroys you 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.620
 or locate and destroy you prefer 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.750
 but this is not a saint and ordinary destroys 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.370
 is a part of the withdrawal of a free play 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.150
 who was playing yesterday afternoon with the 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.220
 friends 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.159
 we set up a team at tony museum 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.540
 montana popped the star game and ovina to 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.640
 people set up a team played some 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.159
 matches the village had to leave the people 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.019
 called half to complete the team 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.180
 Obviously, you have to form another team. 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.220
 to do a new ranking and it was very 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.170
 fun to format super pleasurable there 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.119
 I was happy to be able to capture 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.060
 This game you know that I am not 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.430
 no one was playing this 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.570
 only with a monster 2 pro and what is 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.090
 entering the competitive landscape 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.490
 that something was starting to get involved 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.259
 a little more about it and the middle and tony 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.369
 already has a great experience playing with 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.079
 Bibi 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.820
 so I was founding the team of guys 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.759
 But they are so good that we 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.219
 got to stay in the legal marriage but 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.310
 This match fell to get better 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:32.530
 will be well will leave the modesty of 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.509
 On the other hand, I was really good at this match. 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.399
 I'm not kidding, it's hard to play 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.619
 bit of gameplay to mainly me 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.450
 because we have a tendency it is not 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.539
 always clear but we have a 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.249
 tendency to find more players 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.929
 experienced players who play a little 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:49.390
 better have a different knowledge of the 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.340
 game have an experience in terms 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.859
 to understand some of the routes 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.969
 of responsa strategies etc. 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:57.069
 so I'm staying for a little longer 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:00.069
 complicated but did not stop being 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.749
 fun because it was like that for me one 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.340
 useful experience because it was 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:06.100
 a moment of evolution I improved a little 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.810
 in the game is for it may not seem like they can 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.869
 not perceive the difference between and how 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.640
 but I improved a little on the game and the face 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.440
 I wanted to tell you the following I 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.750
 I had a certain pet peeve with the link 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.030
 play unipar and it was a great idea 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.489
 creating brought to you that you do not know 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.610
 league play is a playlist is a way 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.100
 to find matches 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.470
 that simulated the competitive landscape in 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.900
 two modes have the championship if 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.150
 I'm not mistaken and the mosh pit looks no 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.210
 it would be a modality that you do 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.490
 individual rankings you evolve your 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.010
 profile and then you play all kinds of 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.420
 mode has fewer restrictions if it does not 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.400
 I 'm wrong, I did not play the male. 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.470
 picchu speaking out of what I 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.140
 I remember researching the 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.360
 so the team has the chip that would be the 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.390
 mode in which you play in the 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.640
 four modes versus 4 has anger 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.980
 bridges that would be sant location 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.260
 destroys what it is to locate and destroy and 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.940
 capture the flag the flag capture 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.860
 it is these three modes of play that people 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.060
 Do we have several restrictions with 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.470
 relation to pÃ¢ques that trikes to teams 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.630
 equipment in general so he 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.070
 leaves the game more balanced more 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.440
 balanced especially if you are 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.489
 a little tired of the appeals of the 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.100
 public lobbies 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.230
 the escape to the igp play is interesting and 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.270
 this issue of legal extension to people 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.430
 mainly the decod player has a 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.019
 competitive nature in players of 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.090
 multiplayer in general have a 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.940
 competitive nature and if you generate a 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.250
 ranking this facilitates competition 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.590
 Makes you meet more times 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.420
 close to him from the level of his team in 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.120
 category of your team 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.769
 if I'm not mistaken, there are seven divisions 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.080
 We have to play five games. 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.299
 inside these five matches we will go 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.769
 view the statistics generated on the team and 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.470
 this is the basis to make the 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.269
 mapping in a given division and the 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.680
 As your team evolved it was 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.780
 playing more games 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.549
 Of course you can go up or down 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.560
 division depending on performance 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.360
 one of the things that implied with free 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.580
 to tell me why I had 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.250
 with the way she was 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.200
 too little xp for your profile 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.480
 public lobby let's call it that you 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.430
 wins xp for normal matches for 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.220
 evolve your lobby profile as you 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.229
 plays in the public lobby but was very 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.120
 little respect you win does not end 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.310
 well worth it and most of the staff 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.050
 Just did not like playing the free play. 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.400
 but now it has been modified I do not know you 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.360
 say exactly when you had this 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.979
 change 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.770
 but this has now been modified if you 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:34.140
 have played a match and won 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.669
 you get 10,000 xp points which is one 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.360
 very interesting point however 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.770
 from there 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.469
 the public that gets this 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.340
 score and even if you come to lose 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:43.710
 the game 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.219
 but if the team stays until the end does not give 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.020
 a retweet you are 7,500 xp points 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:51.479
 besides other scores between you 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.300
 You're acquiring then you're going up level in the 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.189
 your public lobby very fast I played 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.939
 yesterday afternoon I started in the branch in the light 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:58.620
 15 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:01.379
 We played some matches and I already 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.909
 I stopped at 30 is something very fast if 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:05.879
 It was very interesting that I already 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:08.580
 more interest has aroused me more 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:10.560
 interest in the call play because so 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.270
 I want to evolve, it 's obvious I 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.879
 I want to arrive at the last do not need more 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.830
 have there precise need of the public lobby and 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:18.900
 playing fair is interesting is the kind of 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.120
 mode I like the scenery short 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.000
 competitive despite the fact that I'm not very 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.310
 involved short thought it's cool and another 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.310
 question too that there I speak you have 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.259
 to play the free because of this is that 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.060
 all equipment is already released 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.710
 You do not have to climb up the rankings. 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.090
 to be able to release their 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.379
 equipment are all weapons are 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.389
 clear that there are some who are 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.610
 forbidden to use but all weapons 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.860
 released until you kiss see and released 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.629
 for sure then you can mount the 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.669
 class the way you like to play 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:49.409
 the most comfortable and clear way 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.569
 appropriate for the game mode that you 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:53.339
 If you play then you are 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:56.400
 accustomed to playing with Suddenly with 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:57.930
 n 94 which is one of the last weapons to be 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.719
 released if I'm not mistaken is the last until 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.580
 you can play the free play she goes 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:05.099
 talk from the beginning and then you will 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.110
 winning xp for public blog when you 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:10.289
 playing it was already the public you already 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.060
 will get yours and 94 released then it's worth 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.099
 How much is this word being robbery? 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.560
 Leaving there for you, it's not stealing you. 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:18.240
 just playing a different mode 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.159
 What is this xp? 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.979
 just like any other modality 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:24.449
 inside the game so highly recommend 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:26.819
 that you play a little bit of the lig play 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:28.740
 experience the legal competitive landscape 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:30.810
 and the question of setting up a team is more 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.419
 interesting than evolved your Player 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.979
 individually because it brings this 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:36.779
 to assemble strategies you are in 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.279
 communication with the team and of course 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:39.779
 the companion of a game copy is always 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:42.000
 more fun more enjoyable 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:44.159
 so I recommend it there the tip guy league 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.680
 play is the channel nowadays I'm going to play 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:48.300

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.639
 if possible I'll do 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.530
 in london to put up plate 3 of you there 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:54.150
 To build a team with me, we play.

 some games there during the day 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.300
 I think it's going to be cool but that's it. 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.979
 I just wanted to introduce you guys. 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.669

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.440
 knew
