is slide it back into position but when

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.090 
is slide it back into position but when
you're<00:02:39.870> doing<00:02:40.110> so<00:02:40.290> be<00:02:40.500> careful<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.069> don't

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
you're doing so be careful you don't

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.740 
you're doing so be careful you don't
want<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.489> pinch<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.910> servo<00:02:42.120> wire<00:02:42.450> in<00:02:42.720> between

blocks now I didn't mention this before
but<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:55.739> might<00:02:55.950> be<00:02:56.069> easier<00:02:56.100> if<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:56.610> take<00:02:56.850> off

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
but it might be easier if you take off

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.729 
but it might be easier if you take off
