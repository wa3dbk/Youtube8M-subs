00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.410
 and now we change the subject and we talk about health because most of 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:07.080
 us when we go to jail we take antibiotics 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.139
 we have all 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.149
 We take antibiotics from the throat 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:15.479
 we take antibiotics and so on but in those cases we 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:18.979
 recommends taking antibiotics or not a specialist does not explain it 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.999
 antibiotics are medicines 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:23.449
 We believe in caring a lot 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.509
 they fear that antibiotics are drugs that what they do is eliminate 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.579
 bacteria infections by bacteria 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.530
 I must be clear that not all the infections that we present are due to 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.480
 bacteria 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.310
 many good times we are constantly seeing the changes 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.430
 climatic conditions are dispersing favors the appearance of many infections 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.600
 Respiratory systems are mostly viral, so for those cases 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.100
 antibiotics are not useful 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.270
 antibiotics do not fight infections caused by viruses such as 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.970
 colds and flu most of the causes of all bronchitis smells of 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.750
 throat 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.609
 p after analgesics 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.650
 the antibiotics no more prescribed musti taldea 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.460
 by doctors' offices 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.460
 because people feel calm when they take antibiotics and they push 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.640
 many times so that it does not prescribe 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.960
 so we have to have 50 here that patients understand that it's not that 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.980
 one wants is that we do it sometimes because it does not merit 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.140
 has a roof is not because of bacteria the antibiotic is not going to feel more like 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.490
 It can even be harmful and counterproductive 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.630
 America mental should be purchased only with a prescription 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.510
 we already know that it is something that is not fulfilled 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.820
 we know that it is something that is not fulfilled and we have this one had a great fight be 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.460
 that 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.330
 by who mm the bad prescription of antibiotics to what is leading to 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.720
 the emergence of resistant strains of resistant germs 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.380
 once they are prescribed by the doctor to attack the infections 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.090
 caused by bacteria 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.090
 the treatment must be followed until the end 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.670
 when using medications in a way 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.850
 conformed interrupted let's read a chance to the bacteria that are staying 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.830
 begin to develop mechanisms to evade the action of these antibiotics 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.830
 and as living beings, they will continue to proliferate 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:15.049
 inheriting their future generations these these mechanisms to be able 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.229
 against the inaction of consent 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:21.389
 It is very important that if antibiotics are prescribed for a certain amount of 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:23.429
 days take it to the end 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:26.629
