indulgences they probably think about

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.539 
indulgences they probably think about
what<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.049> Catholic<00:03:43.380> Church<00:03:43.560> used<00:03:43.859> to<00:03:44.010> do<00:03:44.370> with

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
what the Catholic Church used to do with

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.509 
what the Catholic Church used to do with

years ago and and and you know the
Catholic<00:03:49.829> Church<00:03:50.130> is<00:03:50.160> not<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.489> perfect

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
Catholic Church is not a perfect

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.210 
Catholic Church is not a perfect
organization<00:03:51.450> but<00:03:51.959> I<00:03:52.169> understand<00:03:53.010> not

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
organization but I understand not

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.440 
organization but I understand not
knowing<00:03:53.519> too<00:03:53.669> much<00:03:53.700> of<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.030> history<00:03:54.180> of

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
knowing too much of the history of

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.710 
knowing too much of the history of
intelligences<00:03:55.169> that<00:03:56.000> they<00:03:57.000> maybe<00:03:57.299> even<00:03:57.540> used

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
intelligences that they maybe even used

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.199 
intelligences that they maybe even used
to<00:03:57.870> sell<00:03:58.139> intelligences<00:03:58.859> and<00:03:59.129> an<00:03:59.639> indulgence

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
to sell intelligences and an indulgence

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.140 
to sell intelligences and an indulgence
is<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.660> amount<00:04:00.989> of<00:04:01.139> time<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:01.889> you<00:04:02.519> that<00:04:03.030> it

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
is the amount of time that you that it

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.789 
is the amount of time that you that it
would<00:04:03.329> take<00:04:03.569> care<00:04:03.840> of<00:04:03.900> some<00:04:04.319> time<00:04:04.560> that<00:04:04.680> you

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
would take care of some time that you

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.190 
would take care of some time that you
actually<00:04:05.010> spent<00:04:05.519> in<00:04:05.700> purgatory<00:04:07.010> so<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.840> it<00:04:09.840> used

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
actually spent in purgatory so I it used

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.240 
actually spent in purgatory so I it used
to<00:04:10.290> be<00:04:10.379> associated<00:04:10.620> with<00:04:10.799> a<00:04:10.919> certain<00:04:11.040> number

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
to be associated with a certain number

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.009 
to be associated with a certain number
of<00:04:11.400> days<00:04:11.730> for<00:04:11.790> instance<00:04:12.480> if<00:04:12.599> you<00:04:12.720> say<00:04:12.989> a

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
of days for instance if you say a

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.740 
of days for instance if you say a
certain<00:04:13.319> prayer<00:04:13.829> you<00:04:14.069> spend<00:04:14.400> 10<00:04:14.730> fewer<00:04:15.389> days

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
certain prayer you spend 10 fewer days

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.920 
certain prayer you spend 10 fewer days
in<00:04:16.109> purgatory<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:17.359> and<00:04:18.359> this<00:04:18.570> got<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:18.900> be

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
in purgatory and and this got to be

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.050 
in purgatory and and this got to be
probably<00:04:19.889> an<00:04:20.310> abusive<00:04:21.949> item<00:04:22.949> that<00:04:23.220> some

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
probably an abusive item that some

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.480 
probably an abusive item that some
officials<00:04:24.360> in<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:24.990> church<00:04:25.200> probably<00:04:25.770> started

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
officials in the church probably started

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.440 
officials in the church probably started
