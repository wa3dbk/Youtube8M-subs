00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.359
 dvd criticism another trailer check 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.400
 and man has so certain 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.230
 fears like at night in 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.240
 to be in a forest or in the open sea 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.500
 lost joined seen on film 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.179
 now the loneliness in the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.010
 universe to it and with it we throw one 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.010
 look at the thriller gravity 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.269
 beautiful 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.370
 the sunrise 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.110
 drastic 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.050
 I'm not sure about the trailer yet 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.430
 certainly what I should think of him 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.960
 but as we clooney and sandra hereby 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.820
 Bullock as main actors have become 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.380
 I can see them both incredibly 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.180
 I imagine that the film 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.280
 could be really strong here plays 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.560
 sandra bullock a biomedizinerin the 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.150
 still just her first outing into 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.010
 World experienced and george clooney on the 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.900
 the other side is an astronaut who is about to 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.330
 his pension is an old hare 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.160
 and on a routine trip it comes 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.570
 to the catastrophe and her shuttle 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.520
 or space form of government is 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.900
 destroyed and both drift through it 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.510
 Space only one connection 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.700
 but not to the earth now 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.410
 still the infinity of space 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.690
 lie in front of them and the question can be 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.150
 the survival and every breath robs 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.710
 him the vital oxygen 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.930
 they still have and so could this one 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.280
 to be very very thrilling and thriller 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.960
 reminds me with this loneliness 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.300
 somehow to movies like open water or 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.950
 touched where it is about it somehow 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.570
 a certain scenario still a certain 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.200
 time to survive with hope 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.520
 rescue 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.020
 and that I am very curious then 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.820
 I really like such films a team 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.770
 peppered with two great topical 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.840
 also soon staged by, among others 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.310
 director alfonso cuarÃ³n has under 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.830
 for example, the direction children of men 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.730
 made or even pans labyrinth 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.410
 co-produced and I think there 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.970
 i could be the right man for this 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.860
 something one so I'm very excited 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.080
 What gravity has to offer the film 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.600
 Incidentally, warner brothers from the 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.040
 third october 2013 in german 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.630

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.190
