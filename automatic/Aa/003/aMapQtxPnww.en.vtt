going<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.560> do<00:03:14.680> it<00:03:14.709> because<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.280> erases<00:03:15.880> your

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030

very careful with this disk opiate-based

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.240 
very careful with this disk opiate-based
because<00:03:32.319> you<00:03:32.680> may<00:03:32.830> lose<00:03:33.519> your<00:03:33.550> save<00:03:34.060> file
