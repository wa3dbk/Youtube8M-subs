00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.090
 the militancy amputation 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.430
 dependent 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.749
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:13.000
 I'm in Ibbenbüren today at the biggest music fair in Northern Germany 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.699
 and beside me to 6 Christian Haller the IAB 3 explained now 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.519
 So far Hardcore Musel should be supposed to be "Old acquaintance" applause though 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.260
 that is already met here that is important because we had in the 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.010
 Martin Bruckner 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.269
 but Martin Keil Buchner 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:30.849
 and you have today 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.339
 GAM Holding had something to start with and secondly, there was ground 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.130
 that's exactly 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.050
 but that's 9 Sampras fashion label 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.330
 from the gasoline price like to have many in the past since we have 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.360
 made it clear in the 94 after a 4 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.770
 came that are a really cool pedals that we have in principle all these 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.800
 Pedals taken and named in a unit of the party 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.440
 on 9 especially Murdoch had to bring about different effects 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.510
 under in different categories long please hear 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.130
 cool action 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.540
 and I can do it all 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.900
 save as part of a scene 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.490
 a scene is she was at a configuration 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.020
 May have different storm boxes 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.140
 since the time here a year also the quasi the products which series the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.520
 Imposition whole also still changeable very otherwise in math which one can not 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.770
 absolutely right i can go 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.910
 and have me on this band, for example 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.140
 lay out three different effects 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.789
 Modulation suspects percent the LaCie effect 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.240
 have and all this way for example 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.670
 under Kanders while it turns on and off the game of a normal game 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.030
 Slowfox up to 90 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.430
 in addition Carina with 2 3 the developers also lay with complete 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.650
 different effects 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.520
 but there will be no question 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.700
 I have all these effects Edith of her are important Storm Boxes 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.249
 here operation and can be different 

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:54.190
 Parameters by aliens thousands of özdemir 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.560
 the conclusion because the old is that but unfortunately not there he took again 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.380
 meet more often 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.440
 to have 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.920
 he said an analyst why he has great displays but then I have 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.070
 I've seen so far so started to see what you do 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.859
 and I can, for example, click on how easy and on Sundays 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:14.669
 and say and who different attitudes so rightly why these 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:15.399
 market 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:17.149
 I can also press on it 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:19.889
 to call on the category Filter Effects 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:21.389
 or Halle swept 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:25.289
 the world would have been marked where Lazio the Verge Sale 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:28.210
 for it over the modulation the fact nevertheless so that it also in the play 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.830
 long it looked through which the LJG also the 60 Sat 1-serie aux input and 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.799
 Remove series 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.950
 worthy of praise is the "Mister Dakar" but I can easily do it 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:40.719
 use to drive 2 1 2 or call that Iran because such use 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.349
 wonderful things then reappeared as good but he had to 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.839
 On one particular have given because that should sound cool 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:51.299
 it may turn off to bathing some of them pregnant 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.659
 the new volunteer work 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.659
 Just have a look, we have change 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.719
 my motivation has decreased 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.089
 there you have a look 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.949
 It is called analogous to rust our I have here you can moderate Bauer 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:10.319
 Guitar decided on the program and the players demanded everything from the victim 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.319
 clear 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.930
 you have it after five Manager Product Manager as well as ready 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.930
 I just turn closer 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.749
 that Wenger shows up 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:36.749
 Felser 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.139
 paradox Wenger but here as well 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:45.149
 Gallen 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:55.179
 and so again 

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:56.429
 Arminia Bielefeld 

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:59.429
 is pretty cool 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.359
 Participants a tenant that stores 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.189
 that is here the media worlds are 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.139
 they would all be good 

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:16.739
 Dollar firmer 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.910
 Of course I can combine all these things, he is sure that we will 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.469
 passed quickly now 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.159
 have moderation z 6 4 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.689
 because she's here for me, for example 

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:29.090
 otherwise prefer revenue 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.090
 as an interested party 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:36.659
 he 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.199
 jur 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.210
 not bad 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.210
 I see here is also never in vacation or brand names 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:47.870
 so that's one 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.999
 complete Medi plant already 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.199
 integrate 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.110
 since there are many colleagues as well as like was still 19 »should use parts 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.600
 or the medial foreigners have 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.629
 or the Dr 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:02.999
 Harvest in Panamá Mediaset Abidjan intensifies on the i who is capable 

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.920
 want to use 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.050
 that is spent by the medial 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.370
 Bonn that's why they were meant for me 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.070
 but for some of the best ideas, they also test them 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.389
 they are like controlling the effects remotely 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.029
 pte round Speaking of club tournament also on top of it 

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:21.080
 Val d'isere still a super 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.280
 and that is supposed to have been rebuilt so that is advertises it 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.669
 basically integrated at the beginning of a 20 second super 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.529
 Rahman Dr makes the procrastination sound up when 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:32.469
 So that's one 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:34.029
 a track in Bonn 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:37.299
 until the next wall came into Israel and as the other with the 

00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:38.939
 different effects from the again 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:40.259
 to enrich 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.889
 The Andasa again quickly showed readers the fact that theirs 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.460
 a total of 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.430
 have the different scenes 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.900
 Blanc dodged while looking at the entire configuration of 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.349
 different zones word 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:55.729
 Of course it has to be that with a song many need a lot of reverb 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:58.919
 Bammer next summer Ori different Rolf has himself and 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.070
 maybe no no 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.590
 when you look at the shops 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.930
 Metternich here on it 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.789
 and then it goes into scene mode 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:10.110
 Metternich also press in front of another scene and for example 4 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.560
 that was something rooted in that it was these different links 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.669
 saving can be just about choosing the right one, for example a complete one 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:18.999
 around 

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:21.999
 that too affects itself to have the magnify 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:36.259
 Merkel 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:39.369
 and then that will be allowed quickly by a scene 

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:43.529
 for one song to another scene to put another song otherwise only see 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:47.879
 formally pleasing thing for it is something similar hears but also hears 

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:50.319
 something different according to Handelsblatt 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:54.110
 Porcelain that means in principle the ladies m9 Storm Box Modder 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.160
 have now 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.699
 is completely available 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:00.139
 dominant would have the waterbed 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:04.159
 what a very good question percent the magnificent he in a second train 

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:05.909
 So Walter became the assistant 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:07.589
 to his 70th 

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:12.750
 Borowski often comes 3 69 that with what price secured 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.570
 he is all top so Christian Tebbe thanked the world 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:16.000
 counterrevolutionary
