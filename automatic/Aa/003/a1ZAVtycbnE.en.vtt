00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.700
 talking about fashion I want to remember one more 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.590
 I somehow heard your words in your 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.869
 radio and radio interview 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.490
 questions leading what is now fashion as 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.789
 interpret what is in fashion what is not 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.580
 fashion 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.010
 You said that fashion collections are changing. 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.930
 every six months and here is the fashion itself 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.929
 changes every 10 years 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.730
 Do I understand correctly that we are all now 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.920
 together we are on the verge of another 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.860
 some kind of grand global fashionable 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.690
 revolution but in me it seems you understand 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.520
 see every day what happens in 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.309
 Italy what is happening greece 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.590
 fashion is the mirror of history and the ultimate 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.160
 h is the result of either 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:54.090
 calm will default be possible 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.949
 euro and possibly political problems 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:02.670
 the European Union is overtaken and as inevitable 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.739
 its collapse of course will lead to bankruptcy 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.610
 so many fashion houses because fashion 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.830
 it 's still a luxury 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.470
 especially if they are expensive fashion 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.200
 everyday if it is not zara 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.509
 or not h &amp; m and if it is something more 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.310
 exclusive naturally very 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.380
 many Italian houses as a result 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.810
 unrest 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.030
 go bankrupt and of course holy place 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.060
 empty does not come others will come 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.890
 chinese houses arab houses indian 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.610
 fashion houses but europe of course is now on 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.560
 sunset 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.270
 but this does not mean that she is not beautiful and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.000
 doesn't mean we don't love her culture 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.220
 we just state Petersburg too 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.740

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.600
 silver age golden age how would we 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.820
 did not want like we did not say that the city 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.860
 the hour is beautiful and its inhabitants are beautiful 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.080
 not so beautiful so earlier 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.910
 it's just a very strong population 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.710
 changed well, not the nature of life 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.960
 if we put aside the economic 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.490
 background of the fashion business 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.220
 understandably this is of course very 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.980
 important and here in 2008 a lot 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.820
 fashion houses french and italian and not 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.869
 only went broke if we did 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.330
 We focus your attention on 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.490
 the creative part of the question right i 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.590
 I understand that now, as many say 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.780
 fashion fashion critics world fashion 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.030

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.360

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.600

 so that he will manage it for another five years 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.790

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:08.069
 where to go in these cultures 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:10.080
 where do you understand and then for this should 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.970
 be some first figures that so 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.000
 would dress for them to say 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.910
 Look here and we will 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.250
 imitate and when there is no sample for 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.989
 imitation is very difficult to force 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.710
 Russian women dress 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:28.020
 when especially they just dress like 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.000
 would say attractively attractive 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.270

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.880

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:40.470

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.660
 the villagers you said now about the Russians 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.250
 women, I remembered another story about 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.340
 who was once told in the next 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.979
 interviews you often arrange away 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.840
 seminars are training and one of them somehow 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.280
 held in istanbul im beautiful 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.229
 city ​​which is also considered one of 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.690
 such fashion centers have probably 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.910
 the Mediterranean region so here is you 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.639
 in the port of Istanbul met the group 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.410
 Russian students and you just 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.060
 women who wanted to give you find out 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.160
 what is fashion what is style and how 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.150
 nice dress up here you stand and 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.820
 look 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.650
 from the airport as your group 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.100
 female students coming down the ramp 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.630
 aircraft and they are very Russian 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.820
 girls were different from everyone else 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:30.350
 passengers because it's right there 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.360
 bright clothes on the face of all sorts 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.650
 make up we are cops and they all go in these 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.229
 famous as you put it 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.729
 kokoshnikov that is the most famous glasses 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.260
 world brands there chanel and roberto 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.800
 cavalli armani and so on and so forth 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:45.500
 and you it is always very somehow 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.500
 makes you laugh and you say that the Russians 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.099
 girls don't always dress like that 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.050
 dress up 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:53.840
 Europeans like me right 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.910
 I understand that the Russians we will not 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.490
 divide there woman men somehow here 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:01.580
 no sense of style and they always dress 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.050
 somewhat flashy and even coarse 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.030
 or am i wrong you 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.639
 interpreted well we have such 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.440
 custom for women should be small 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.050
 clothes and lots of jewelry 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:16.190
 so here it turns out that he loves here 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:18.770
 deeply cut and short cropped here 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.520
 Sleeveless if you can then have the power 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.540
 show 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:27.380
 well and at the same time earrings beads bracelets and 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:30.580
 clock on clay nails hair glasses 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:34.910
 rhinestones heels glisten bags burn 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:38.120
 such a character they give and it is good 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:40.580
 is bad but it is a national quality 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.220
 we can not say and national 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.560
 quality that developed only in 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.410
 last years just men by 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.480
 so few statistics 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.220
 thank you so much i will remind you about fashion and 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.630
