trying to figure out what new to go with

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.160 
trying to figure out what new to go with
I<00:01:41.840> would<00:01:42.530> say<00:01:43.010> that<00:01:43.250> creme<00:01:43.700> de<00:01:43.910> nude<00:01:44.120> is<00:01:44.660> more

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
I would say that creme de nude is more

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.940 
I would say that creme de nude is more
of<00:01:45.530> a<00:01:45.830> nude<00:01:46.250> nude<00:01:46.940> color<00:01:47.360> while<00:01:48.170> this<00:01:48.650> one

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
of a nude nude color while this one

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.730 
of a nude nude color while this one
lincolni<00:01:49.700> he<00:01:50.300> adds<00:01:50.570> a<00:01:50.690> little<00:01:50.840> bit<00:01:50.960> more<00:01:51.110> color

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
lincolni he adds a little bit more color

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.860 
lincolni he adds a little bit more color
to<00:01:51.890> it<00:01:52.130> even<00:01:52.640> though<00:01:52.790> it<00:01:52.970> is<00:01:53.000> pretty<00:01:53.480> subtle

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
to it even though it is pretty subtle

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.290 
to it even though it is pretty subtle
but<00:01:54.650> you'll<00:01:54.830> get<00:01:55.010> a<00:01:55.070> little<00:01:55.490> bit<00:01:55.640> more<00:01:55.880> of<00:01:56.180> a

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
but you'll get a little bit more of a

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.510 
but you'll get a little bit more of a
color<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:57.140> your<00:01:57.290> lips<00:01:57.590> if<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:57.920> don't<00:01:58.280> want<00:01:58.430> to

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
color to your lips if you don't want to

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.640 
color to your lips if you don't want to
go<00:01:58.640> all<00:01:58.910> the<00:01:59.150> way<00:01:59.180> to<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.660> nude<00:01:59.930> tones<00:02:00.290> and

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
go all the way to the nude tones and

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.460 
go all the way to the nude tones and
also<00:02:01.490> if<00:02:01.760> you<00:02:01.910> have<00:02:02.120> dry<00:02:02.480> lips<00:02:02.510> I<00:02:03.140> would<00:02:03.320> go

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
also if you have dry lips I would go

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.410 
also if you have dry lips I would go
with<00:02:03.590> this<00:02:03.770> one<00:02:03.980> because<00:02:04.370> this<00:02:04.580> one<00:02:04.640> is<00:02:04.970> even

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
with this one because this one is even

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.139 
with this one because this one is even
creamier<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.260> softer<00:02:07.220> than<00:02:07.460> creme<00:02:07.760> de<00:02:07.970> nude

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
creamier and softer than creme de nude

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.450 
creamier and softer than creme de nude
