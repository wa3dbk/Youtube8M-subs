00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
being so polished that it becomes sort

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.420 
being so polished that it becomes sort

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
when you have something which is so

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.710 
when you have something which is so
proper<00:02:23.650> in<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.489> modern<00:02:24.819> world<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.390> need<00:02:25.570> to
