00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
everything unfold and I think that's the

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.850 
everything unfold and I think that's the
crazy<00:02:06.729> power<00:02:07.030> of<00:02:07.420> you<00:02:07.929> know<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.200> media<00:02:08.379> and

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
crazy power of you know the media and

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.250 
crazy power of you know the media and
the<00:02:09.700> power<00:02:09.879> that<00:02:10.179> television<00:02:10.569> can<00:02:10.959> actually

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
the power that television can actually

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.800 
the power that television can actually
have<00:02:11.470> over<00:02:11.890> us<00:02:11.920> sometimes<00:02:12.519> now<00:02:13.239> on<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.780> other

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
have over us sometimes now on the other

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.869 
have over us sometimes now on the other
side<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.319> things<00:02:14.709> that<00:02:15.310> can<00:02:15.459> be<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.640> bit

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
side of things that can be a bit

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.390 
side of things that can be a bit
concerning<00:02:16.299> at<00:02:16.569> times<00:02:16.810> because<00:02:17.560> if<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.220> look

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
concerning at times because if you look

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.020 
concerning at times because if you look
at<00:02:18.640> like<00:02:19.299> the<00:02:19.810> news<00:02:19.989> media<00:02:20.349> for<00:02:20.530> example<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:21.099> lot

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
at like the news media for example a lot

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.600 
at like the news media for example a lot
of<00:02:22.150> times<00:02:22.330> they<00:02:22.720> can<00:02:22.989> really<00:02:23.920> twist<00:02:24.310> things

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
of times they can really twist things

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.759 
of times they can really twist things
and<00:02:24.790> make<00:02:24.940> things<00:02:25.019> not<00:02:26.019> exactly<00:02:26.319> what<00:02:26.650> they

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
and make things not exactly what they

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.130 
and make things not exactly what they
are<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.970> me<00:02:28.120> there's<00:02:28.329> always<00:02:28.540> two<00:02:28.930> sides

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
are and to me there's always two sides

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.420 
are and to me there's always two sides
to<00:02:29.319> every<00:02:29.590> story<00:02:29.620> which<00:02:30.010> is<00:02:30.130> one<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
to every story which is one of the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.100 
to every story which is one of the
reasons<00:02:30.670> why<00:02:30.790> I<00:02:30.819> never<00:02:31.000> really<00:02:31.599> watched<00:02:31.870> the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
reasons why I never really watched the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.410 
reasons why I never really watched the
news<00:02:32.319> because<00:02:32.530> depending<00:02:33.310> on<00:02:33.579> what<00:02:33.849> news<00:02:34.269> a

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420

lot<00:02:34.480> you're<00:02:34.720> watching<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.260> lot<00:02:35.410> of<00:02:35.440> times<00:02:35.650> you

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
lot you're watching a lot of times you

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.670 
lot you're watching a lot of times you
may<00:02:36.069> only<00:02:36.250> get<00:02:36.489> one<00:02:36.849> side<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.510> story<00:02:37.840> you

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
may only get one side of the story you

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.050 
may only get one side of the story you
may<00:02:38.860> not<00:02:39.040> really<00:02:39.250> get<00:02:39.459> a<00:02:39.489> true<00:02:39.819> understanding

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060

that's<00:03:19.150> going<00:03:19.329> on<00:03:19.389> and<00:03:19.540> think<00:03:19.690> about<00:03:19.870> both

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
that's going on and think about both

side<00:03:20.500> of<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:20.769> before<00:03:21.040> you<00:03:21.069> form<00:03:21.489> your<00:03:21.549> own

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
side of it before you form your own

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.699 
side of it before you form your own
opinion<00:03:21.819> and<00:03:22.480> unfortunately<00:03:23.319> I<00:03:23.380> think<00:03:23.470> that

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
opinion and unfortunately I think that

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.520 
opinion and unfortunately I think that
it<00:03:23.829> has<00:03:24.130> a<00:03:24.190> major<00:03:24.519> impact<00:03:24.790> on<00:03:25.239> many<00:03:26.139> of<00:03:26.380> us

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
it has a major impact on many of us

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.680 
it has a major impact on many of us
because<00:03:26.980> I<00:03:27.099> think<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.340> lot<00:03:27.370> of<00:03:27.519> people<00:03:27.609> don't<00:03:28.480> do

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
because I think a lot of people don't do

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.059 
because I think a lot of people don't do
that<00:03:28.900> you<00:03:29.109> know<00:03:29.169> I'd<00:03:29.230> say<00:03:29.410> again<00:03:29.709> they're<00:03:29.919> just

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
that you know I'd say again they're just

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.309 
that you know I'd say again they're just
focused<00:03:30.459> on<00:03:30.579> one<00:03:31.299> side<00:03:31.510> of<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.690> story<00:03:31.750> and

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
focused on one side of the story and

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.979 
focused on one side of the story and
people<00:03:32.650> get<00:03:32.980> so<00:03:33.690> judgmental<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:34.840> so

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
people get so judgmental and so

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.319 
people get so judgmental and so
opinionated<00:03:35.980> when<00:03:36.579> they<00:03:36.669> don't<00:03:36.819> have<00:03:36.940> all<00:03:37.120> the

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
opinionated when they don't have all the

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.259 
opinionated when they don't have all the
facts<00:03:37.859> so<00:03:38.859> it's<00:03:39.099> just<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.430> me<00:03:39.519> it's<00:03:39.700> amazing

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
facts so it's just to me it's amazing

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.849 
facts so it's just to me it's amazing
like<00:03:40.359> how<00:03:40.630> much<00:03:40.870> power<00:03:41.139> the<00:03:41.380> media<00:03:41.709> actually

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
like how much power the media actually

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.800 
like how much power the media actually
has<00:03:42.130> over<00:03:42.459> us<00:03:42.549> which<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.329> one<00:03:43.480> of<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.630> major

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
has over us which is one of the major

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.170 
has over us which is one of the major
reasons<00:03:43.959> why<00:03:44.530> I<00:03:44.560> actually<00:03:44.950> don't<00:03:45.430> watch<00:03:45.910> the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
reasons why I actually don't watch the

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
to have that type of power over millions

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.920
