people within their ass they're going to
keep<00:05:41.630> using<00:05:41.810> the<00:05:41.990> same<00:05:42.170> app<00:05:42.410> and<00:05:42.650> start

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
keep using the same app and start

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.170

but<00:05:44.990> so<00:05:45.320> I<00:05:45.350> thought<00:05:45.530> your<00:05:45.680> entropy<00:05:46.100> this<00:05:46.280> is

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
but so I thought your entropy this is

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.550 
but so I thought your entropy this is
the<00:05:46.640> first<00:05:46.970> feature<00:05:47.570> in<00:05:47.990> a<00:05:48.080> series<00:05:48.530> of

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
the first feature in a series of

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.170 
the first feature in a series of
features<00:05:49.160> that<00:05:49.250> will<00:05:49.460> be<00:05:49.580> products<00:05:49.970> that<00:05:50.120> will

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
features that will be products that will

features that will be products that will
be<00:05:50.360> accompanied<00:05:50.750> is<00:05:51.050> it<00:05:51.230> because<00:05:52.160> if<00:05:52.490> you

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
be accompanied is it because if you

00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:01.310 
be accompanied is it because if you
should<00:05:52.730> be<00:05:52.850> on<00:05:53.030> board
