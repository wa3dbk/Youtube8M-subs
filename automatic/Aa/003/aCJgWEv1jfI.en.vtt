right here was already on there so
pretty<00:01:17.500> much<00:01:17.680> this<00:01:18.009> is<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.430> way<00:01:18.579> it<00:01:18.790> looks

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
pretty much this is the way it looks

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.420 
pretty much this is the way it looks
without<00:01:19.240> any<00:01:19.720> of<00:01:19.869> the<00:01:19.990> stickers<00:01:20.409> and<00:01:20.860> you<00:01:21.219> can

without any of the stickers and you can

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.219 
without any of the stickers and you can
see<00:01:21.729> that<00:01:21.759> it<00:01:22.090> still<00:01:22.360> looks<00:01:22.570> good<00:01:22.810> I'm<00:01:23.049> sure

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
see that it still looks good I'm sure

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.600 
see that it still looks good I'm sure
it's<00:01:23.380> going<00:01:23.500> to<00:01:23.590> look<00:01:23.710> a<00:01:23.799> lot<00:01:23.920> nicer<00:01:23.979> with<00:01:24.490> the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
it's going to look a lot nicer with the

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.520 
it's going to look a lot nicer with the
stickers<00:01:24.969> but<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.509> lot<00:01:25.780> of<00:01:25.810> times<00:01:26.079> I<00:01:26.229> like<00:01:26.350> to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
stickers but a lot of times I like to

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.530 
stickers but a lot of times I like to
modify<00:01:26.860> it<00:01:27.040> and<00:01:27.340> stuff<00:01:27.640> so<00:01:27.880> I<00:01:28.119> don't<00:01:28.360> do<00:01:28.570> that

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
modify it and stuff so I don't do that

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.780 
modify it and stuff so I don't do that
anyway<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:32.290> articulation<00:01:32.979> like<00:01:33.159> I<00:01:33.189> said<00:01:33.430> it's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
anyway the articulation like I said it's

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.880 
anyway the articulation like I said it's
really<00:01:34.119> good<00:01:34.329> I<00:01:34.570> think<00:01:34.960> it<00:01:35.170> actually<00:01:35.380> does

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
really good I think it actually does

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.639 
really good I think it actually does
look<00:01:36.189> like<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:36.939> wolf<00:01:37.210> so<00:01:37.570> that<00:01:37.930> is<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.140> total

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
look like a wolf so that is a total

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.520 
look like a wolf so that is a total

see<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:25.030> this<00:02:25.330> sword<00:02:25.739> actually<00:02:26.739> comes<00:02:26.980> in<00:02:27.190> two

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.270 
see the this sword actually comes in two
parts<00:02:28.000> right<00:02:28.360> there<00:02:28.420> it's<00:02:28.930> this<00:02:29.200> a

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280

translucent<00:02:30.280> blue<00:02:31.200> stuff<00:02:32.200> which<00:02:32.920> I<00:02:33.220> think

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
translucent blue stuff which I think

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.039 
translucent blue stuff which I think
would<00:02:33.610> look<00:02:33.670> really<00:02:34.120> good<00:02:34.239> as<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.569> staff

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
would look really good as a staff

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.280 
would look really good as a staff
perhaps<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.220> then<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.120> should<00:02:37.989> what<00:02:38.260> should

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
perhaps and then the should what should

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.289 
perhaps and then the should what should
I<00:02:38.470> call<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:38.799> a<00:02:38.860> lightsaber<00:02:39.370> hilt<00:02:39.670> basically

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
I call it a lightsaber hilt basically

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.020 
I call it a lightsaber hilt basically

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
as you can see this is one of the main

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.140 
as you can see this is one of the main
differences<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:35.770> wolf<00:04:36.010> has<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.730> tail<00:04:36.910> that<00:04:37.060> i

showed<00:04:37.360> you<00:04:37.390> before<00:04:37.600> the<00:04:37.900> lion<00:04:38.260> has<00:04:38.560> more<00:04:38.860> like

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
showed you before the lion has more like

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.400 
showed you before the lion has more like
a<00:04:39.070> it's<00:04:39.610> almost<00:04:39.850> like<00:04:40.030> a<00:04:40.060> elephant's<00:04:41.050> trunk

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
a it's almost like a elephant's trunk

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.530 
a it's almost like a elephant's trunk
looking<00:04:42.040> piece<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.760> idea<00:04:43.030> is<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.270> same<00:04:43.300> the

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
looking piece the idea is the same the

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.470 
looking piece the idea is the same the
way<00:04:43.840> it<00:04:44.230> connects<00:04:44.680> and<00:04:44.950> the<00:04:45.940> other<00:04:46.090> main

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
way it connects and the other main

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.480 
way it connects and the other main
difference<00:04:46.930> other<00:04:47.200> than<00:04:47.320> the<00:04:47.530> color<00:04:47.710> is<00:04:48.070> the

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
difference other than the color is the

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.460 
difference other than the color is the
face<00:04:48.730> the<00:04:49.210> faces<00:04:49.780> is<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.260> main<00:04:50.440> difference

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
face the faces is the main difference

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.380 
face the faces is the main difference
there<00:04:51.010> are<00:04:51.130> other<00:04:51.370> smaller<00:04:51.910> minor

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
there are other smaller minor

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.810 
there are other smaller minor
differences<00:04:53.020> but<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:54.130> overall<00:04:54.400> construction

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
differences but the overall construction

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.720 
differences but the overall construction
is<00:04:55.270> is<00:04:55.480> very<00:04:55.990> very<00:04:56.200> similar<00:04:56.590> so<00:04:57.310> if<00:04:57.460> you<00:04:57.580> look

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
is is very very similar so if you look

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.730 
is is very very similar so if you look
at<00:04:57.850> the<00:04:57.970> face<00:04:58.180> of<00:04:58.210> both<00:04:58.720> of<00:04:58.930> them<00:04:59.110> like<00:04:59.560> the

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
at the face of both of them like the

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.060 
at the face of both of them like the
lion's<00:05:00.100> mouth<00:05:00.220> it<00:05:00.760> does<00:05:01.030> move<00:05:01.270> like<00:05:02.230> so<00:05:02.590> and<00:05:02.890> of

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
lion's mouth it does move like so and of

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.310 
lion's mouth it does move like so and of
course<00:05:03.310> head<00:05:03.520> is<00:05:03.670> articulated<00:05:04.420> on<00:05:04.600> that<00:05:04.810> ball

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
course head is articulated on that ball

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.350 
course head is articulated on that ball
joint<00:05:05.620> and<00:05:05.890> then<00:05:06.460> here's<00:05:06.730> the<00:05:06.790> wolf's<00:05:07.210> mouth

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
joint and then here's the wolf's mouth

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.360 
joint and then here's the wolf's mouth
both<00:05:07.690> of<00:05:07.840> them<00:05:07.960> have<00:05:08.200> a<00:05:08.230> much<00:05:08.710> smaller<00:05:09.010> mouth

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
both of them have a much smaller mouth

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.970 
both of them have a much smaller mouth
compared<00:05:09.850> to<00:05:10.000> be<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.570> alligator<00:05:10.990> so<00:05:11.530> out<00:05:11.920> of

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
compared to be the alligator so out of

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.150 
compared to be the alligator so out of
the<00:05:12.520> three<00:05:12.550> um<00:05:13.270> if<00:05:14.170> you<00:05:14.410> kind<00:05:14.620> of<00:05:14.830> want<00:05:15.070> that

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
the three um if you kind of want that

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.860 
the three um if you kind of want that
chomping<00:05:15.880> action<00:05:16.330> I<00:05:16.480> would<00:05:16.540> definitely

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
chomping action I would definitely

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.560 
chomping action I would definitely
recommend<00:05:17.290> the<00:05:17.680> alligator<00:05:18.250> out<00:05:18.880> of<00:05:19.420> these

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
recommend the alligator out of these

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.320 
recommend the alligator out of these
three<00:05:19.870> and<00:05:20.230> between<00:05:21.220> these<00:05:21.430> two<00:05:21.700> I<00:05:21.730> think<00:05:22.180> it's

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
three and between these two I think it's

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.620 
three and between these two I think it's
just<00:05:22.420> preference<00:05:22.900> you<00:05:23.560> might<00:05:23.770> actually<00:05:24.700> pick

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
just preference you might actually pick

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.630 
just preference you might actually pick
a<00:05:25.840> certain<00:05:26.260> one<00:05:26.410> because<00:05:26.740> you<00:05:27.040> like<00:05:27.250> a<00:05:27.280> certain

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
a certain one because you like a certain

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.940 
a certain one because you like a certain
character<00:05:27.910> better<00:05:28.480> okay<00:05:29.170> so<00:05:29.230> thank<00:05:29.620> you<00:05:29.740> for
