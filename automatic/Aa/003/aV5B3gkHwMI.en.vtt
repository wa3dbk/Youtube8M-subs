00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
my perspective yes Pilates can help you

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.780 
my perspective yes Pilates can help you
lose<00:02:18.879> weight<00:02:18.909> a<00:02:19.299> hundred<00:02:19.810> percent<00:02:19.930> yes<00:02:20.790> but

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
lose weight a hundred percent yes but

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.879 
lose weight a hundred percent yes but
the<00:02:21.879> reason<00:02:21.999> may<00:02:22.269> not<00:02:22.450> be<00:02:22.599> quite<00:02:23.049> what<00:02:23.769> you

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:23.889 
the reason may not be quite what you

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.449 
the reason may not be quite what you
think<00:02:24.249> so<00:02:25.409> is<00:02:26.409> Pilates<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:26.980> cardio<00:02:27.400> workout

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
think so is Pilates a cardio workout

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.699 
think so is Pilates a cardio workout
we'll<00:02:27.939> start<00:02:28.150> with<00:02:28.269> that<00:02:28.450> Pilates<00:02:29.409> is<00:02:29.560> not

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
we'll start with that Pilates is not

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.520 
we'll start with that Pilates is not
always<00:02:30.069> a<00:02:30.400> cardio<00:02:30.849> workout<00:02:31.079> if<00:02:32.079> you<00:02:32.200> take<00:02:32.409> an

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
always a cardio workout if you take an

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.860 
always a cardio workout if you take an
advance<00:02:32.859> or<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.400> fast<00:02:33.760> paced<00:02:34.030> cardio<00:02:34.299> class

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
advance or a fast paced cardio class

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.920 
advance or a fast paced cardio class

weather gets nicer but I I tend to have

weather gets nicer but I I tend to have
a<00:04:48.250> bit<00:04:48.460> of<00:04:48.580> a<00:04:48.900> negative<00:04:49.900> effect<00:04:50.710> sometimes

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
a bit of a negative effect sometimes

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.990 
a bit of a negative effect sometimes
when<00:04:51.430> I<00:04:51.460> run<00:04:51.790> for<00:04:52.210> one<00:04:52.570> I<00:04:53.550> really<00:04:54.550> rub<00:04:54.790> my

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
when I run for one I really rub my

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.770 
when I run for one I really rub my
metabolism<00:04:55.660> so<00:04:55.840> I<00:04:55.870> get<00:04:56.110> really<00:04:56.380> hungry<00:04:56.620> and

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
metabolism so I get really hungry and

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.180 
metabolism so I get really hungry and
sometimes<00:04:58.780> I'm<00:04:58.960> legitimately<00:04:59.350> hungry<00:04:59.950> and

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
sometimes I'm legitimately hungry and

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
sometimes it's more of a mental thing

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.310 
sometimes it's more of a mental thing
like<00:05:03.130> I<00:05:03.310> sweat<00:05:03.970> so<00:05:04.240> hard<00:05:04.479> I<00:05:04.780> worked<00:05:05.020> so<00:05:05.290> hard

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
interestingly enough I found that up the

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.060 
interestingly enough I found that up the
baby's<00:05:52.780> awake<00:05:52.900> that's<00:05:53.320> the<00:05:53.590> meaning<00:05:53.860> of<00:05:53.889> doing

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
baby's awake that's the meaning of doing

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.760 
baby's awake that's the meaning of doing
videoblocks

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
videoblocks

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.250 
videoblocks
anyways<00:05:56.770> I'm<00:05:56.979> gonna<00:05:57.070> continue<00:05:57.430> so<00:05:58.210> that's<00:05:58.780> the

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
anyways I'm gonna continue so that's the

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.469 
anyways I'm gonna continue so that's the
beauty<00:05:59.710> of<00:05:59.740> doing<00:06:00.039> Pilates<00:06:00.310> is<00:06:00.760> that<00:06:01.000> you

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
beauty of doing Pilates is that you

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:06.560 
beauty of doing Pilates is that you
don't<00:06:02.349> get<00:06:02.650> that<00:06:02.950> kind<00:06:03.669> of<00:06:04.320> rub<00:06:05.320> metabolism

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
don't get that kind of rub metabolism

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.240 
don't get that kind of rub metabolism
starving<00:06:07.570> effect<00:06:07.900> after<00:06:08.080> and<00:06:08.470> also<00:06:08.620> that

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
starving effect after and also that

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.339 
starving effect after and also that
temptation<00:06:09.940> to<00:06:10.090> go<00:06:10.240> replace<00:06:10.630> the<00:06:10.960> work<00:06:11.139> that

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 
temptation to go replace the work that

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:13.529 
temptation to go replace the work that
you've<00:06:11.500> just<00:06:11.740> done<00:06:11.979> so<00:06:12.700> in<00:06:12.849> that<00:06:12.970> regards<00:06:13.419> I
