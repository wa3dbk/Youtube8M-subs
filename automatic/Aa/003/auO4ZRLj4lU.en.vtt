00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.990 
next run yeah so that's these things and
there's<00:02:15.400> five<00:02:15.790> of<00:02:15.819> each<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:17.590> I'm<00:02:18.489> not<00:02:18.760> sure

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
there's five of each and I'm not sure

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.610 
there's five of each and I'm not sure
yet<00:02:19.209> how<00:02:19.480> cost-effectively<00:02:20.260> with<00:02:20.440> neither

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
yet how cost-effectively with neither

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.890 
yet how cost-effectively with neither
maybe<00:02:20.920> I'd<00:02:21.069> sell<00:02:21.340> in<00:02:21.459> sets<00:02:21.880> for<00:02:22.569> some<00:02:22.750> people

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
maybe I'd sell in sets for some people

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.520 
maybe I'd sell in sets for some people
but<00:02:26.220> they're<00:02:27.220> if<00:02:28.209> if<00:02:28.690> this<00:02:28.900> becomes<00:02:29.290> like<00:02:29.500> a

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
but they're if if this becomes like a

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.289 
but they're if if this becomes like a
real<00:02:29.769> pain<00:02:29.980> in<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.160> ass<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.610> may<00:02:30.760> never<00:02:31.090> make

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
real pain in the ass I may never make

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.420 
real pain in the ass I may never make
any<00:02:31.569> more<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.319> they<00:02:32.769> might<00:02:32.950> be<00:02:32.980> like<00:02:33.250> just
