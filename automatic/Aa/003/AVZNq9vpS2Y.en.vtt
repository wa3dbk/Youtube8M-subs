you you drive total electric drive under

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.290 
you you drive total electric drive under
48<00:00:36.770> miles<00:00:36.950> an<00:00:37.100> hour<00:00:37.190> is<00:00:37.400> that<00:00:37.430> right<00:00:37.730> correct

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
48 miles an hour is that right correct

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.390 
48 miles an hour is that right correct
that's<00:00:38.690> where<00:00:38.960> it<00:00:39.290> has<00:00:39.500> two<00:00:39.800> modes<00:00:40.040> it's

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
that's where it has two modes it's

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.910 
that's where it has two modes it's
called<00:00:40.610> a<00:00:40.850> doom<00:00:41.059> old<00:00:41.360> system<00:00:42.050> where<00:00:42.739> you've

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
called a doom old system where you've

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.490 
called a doom old system where you've
got<00:00:43.129> the<00:00:43.309> capability<00:00:43.489> of<00:00:44.059> doing<00:00:44.270> series<00:00:44.930> under
