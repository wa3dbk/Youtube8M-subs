00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.780
 Welcome to the pre-season performance. This video introduces you to the biggest changes 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.620
 which occurs during the pre-season 2015 for tasks, items and also in the jungle. 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.300
 Think of it as an overall summary; if you are interested in details, 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.660
 there is a pre-season microsite and update notes for you. 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.500
 Before we throw in all the pebbles, the lobsters, and other changes, 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.340
 let's mention the main goal for 2015: strategic diversity. Essentially, 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.340
 to win multiple different paths and make decisions during a match 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.848
 it was just as important as choosing a champion. 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.760
 All right, jungle. it sounds a lot like last year's pre-season, 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.420
 however, this year we are trying a different approach. 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.540
 We have new sets of items, Spell got interesting enhancements and monsters are stronger 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.000
 to make the differences between Warwick and Rammus more distinct. 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.480
 We've removed ghost items. The Hunting Machete now creates four new items 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.975
 each of which changes the Spell spell in some way. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.976
 The Hitchhiker's Blade focuses on raids, 

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:13.975
 Spell Hitting slows and hurts even champions. 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.640
 The poacher knife is for anti-jungle, 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.740
 Spell Gives you bonuses for destroying camps in an enemy jungle. 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.180
 The saber's saber is for duels. 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.560
 if you use the hit on your opponent, you get a buff against it for a few seconds. 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.240
 And finally there is a Border Pioneer, ideal for pharmacy. 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.900
 With it, your strike gets a flat effect and restores some of your health and mana. 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.980
 You can also buy spells that will add the attributes needed to the end of the game. 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.780
 Study them properly because we won't mention them any more. 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.180
 We also add bonuses using the Spell Against Monsters spell. 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.920
 The Raptors will give you a real vision for the Spell to hit when a totem hits you. Thanks to the Šerkovs, you get the spirit of view 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:10.060
 the lobster will put you in poison armor, the stones will give you a stun buff 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.340
 monsters and reds with blue are restoring health and mana. Perhaps it is clear who gives what. 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.000
 And finally, a new camp has been added to the jungle, which will surely make you happy: 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.380
 river crab. This armored crustacean runs away from the fight, 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.100
 but when you kill him, you get a view of the Baron's or Dragon's Lair, and your entire team can enjoy the sanctuary of speed. 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.760
 or dragon's lair and your whole team can enjoy the sanctuary of speed. Thanks, box. 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.260
 Let's talk about tasks. It is changing. Strategic. 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.000
 First towers. The inner towers were given a new restoring shield, which also covers the surrounding allies. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.400
 which facilitates siege defense. And yes - what you see is actually a laser. 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.720
 This is a new change in the inhibitor tower. Who will hit, 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.140
 this will slow down and reduce the damage it causes. 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.400
 Jax sweats at split pressure now. 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.980
 Jax sweats at split pressure now. 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.920
 The Baron is no longer a snack at the end of the match, but a big bastard. You'll have to think well, 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.580
 when to go to him 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.620
 and by training it you will get a buff that halves the return cast 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.820
 and the hops around you turn into powerful mining machines. 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.960
 The dragon and the towers always had a similar reward - gold. 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.180
 To distinguish them, the dragon no longer gives gold, but a permanent counting buff. 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.840
 The more kites your team kills, the stronger the buff will be; at the end of the day, there is really a lot of mega. 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.820
 If you slaughter five dragons, you will roll through Žleb like a steam cylinder strung in armor ... from smaller steam cylinders. 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.780
 This year, we focus a lot on strategic items that are otherwise beneficial to your team 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.260
 than by increasing your attributes. 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.320
 First, there are new elixirs. The Elixir of Destruction causes higher damage to the towers and is suited to split pressure, 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:58.580
 The Witchcraft Elixir increases the power of abilities and gives direct damage, the Iron Elixir adds to size and increases the speed of allies' movement 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.440
 Behind you, and the Elixir of Anger increases you offensive damage and healing attacks. 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.600
 Each one is designed for a particular situation. 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.280
 Secondly, we have the Glory of Justice. We are mainly interested in its activatable effect, which increases your speed of movement in pursuing those annoying teams, 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.960
 what they avoid direct conflict. 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.240
 In addition, after a few seconds, he sends a powerful pulse, 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.560
 that will slow down all enemy champions in the neighborhood. 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.600
 Unfortunately, the speed of movement does not increase in proportion to the annoyance of the opponent's team. 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.740
 Unfortunately, the speed of movement does not increase in proportion to the annoyance of the opponent's team. 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.560
 In short, we want teams to go for victory in different ways. 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.560
 In short, we want teams to go for victory in different ways. 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.320
 And that's just the beginning. 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.080
 During the pre-season, we can experiment more with the game to improve it, 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.780
 so we have a lot of changes up our sleeve that we didn't mention here. 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.600
 So visit our microsite and read the update notes 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.260
 where to find more details. Indeed, this performance of the pre-season is over.
