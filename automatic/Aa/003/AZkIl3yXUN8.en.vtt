00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
it from a different angle here again

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.359 
it from a different angle here again
bait<00:01:53.340> up<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.610> reel<00:01:53.810> elbow<00:01:54.810> up<00:01:55.130> pushing<00:01:56.130> down

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
cast to this this nice weed line edge

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.800 
cast to this this nice weed line edge
here<00:02:05.640> again<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.240> tout<00:02:06.929> level<00:02:08.000> forward<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.720> I

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810
