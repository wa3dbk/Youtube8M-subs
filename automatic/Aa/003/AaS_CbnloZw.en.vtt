process that trial and error process

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.709 
process that trial and error process
wastes<00:00:46.620> time<00:00:46.950> which<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.850> money<00:00:48.090> but<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.629> also

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
wastes time which is money but it also

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.610 
wastes time which is money but it also
