00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:24.060
 hello friends welcome to the connection 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.740
 words to pretend to be good 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:33.390
 dancer this Friday baby ham today 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.210
 with all of you for third the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.090
 third begins with a basic case 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:45.270
 same as the others if I want a vee 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.610
 is caught at the end of the lap 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.560
 with the tip of the right foot teaching 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.200
 our new hazelnuts full of 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.710
 cured it is as if we had a pass to 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.790
 hollow Mixtec style and return to give 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.970
 another olÃ© turn 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.650
 and we do the same with the other foot to 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.390
 time 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.140
 then 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.950
 step back we use with her 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.370
 and we do other basics and they come to me 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.370
 fabra 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:21.980
 consists of three steps on the right and 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.950
 stomp the ground the key is to make 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.900
 a lot of noise so if you do it over 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.290
 of a better tablao and if you think of 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.570
 someone who is near better yet already 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.500
 that you will have the level of the zapateo and a 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.850
 powerful falcon cry we say two 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.950
 times more is surrounded one each side 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:47.230
 until you have the feet terms 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:51.620
 up to the knees step back crossing 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:55.430
 basic crossing and we cross again 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:02:04.390
 but from behind while we step on the 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:07.640
 toes step back and end 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.920
 and here thanks to the desire of you 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:16.000

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.660

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.660
