has forced our weak foot so that does
kind<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.760> work<00:02:27.940> nicely<00:02:28.180> with<00:02:28.420> podolsky<00:02:28.900> they

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050

each other and be across each side and

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.620 
each other and be across each side and
that<00:02:32.920> does<00:02:33.190> mean<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.670> can<00:02:33.820> usually<00:02:34.000> just

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
that does mean that you can usually just

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.000 
that does mean that you can usually just
have<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.930> same<00:02:35.110> sort<00:02:35.350> of<00:02:35.380> finishing<00:02:35.740> on<00:02:35.890> his
