00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
oh yah oh hello and welcome to Seoul for

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.890 
oh yah oh hello and welcome to Seoul for
the<00:00:09.960> solution<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.380> my<00:00:10.650> club<00:00:11.160> problem<00:00:11.790> so<00:00:12.570> in

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
the solution to my club problem so in

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.980 
the solution to my club problem so in
how<00:00:13.440> many<00:00:13.500> position<00:00:14.309> does<00:00:14.940> this<00:00:15.120> club<00:00:15.389> has<00:00:15.719> its

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
how many position does this club has its

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.590 
how many position does this club has its
hands<00:00:16.260> together<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:17.130> little<00:00:18.119> bit<00:00:18.390> more<00:00:18.539> than

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
hands together a little bit more than

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.019 
hands together a little bit more than
one<00:00:18.960> o<00:00:18.990> clock<00:00:19.199> without<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.100> first<00:00:20.369> position<00:00:20.670> a

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
one o clock without the first position a

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.679 
one o clock without the first position a
little<00:00:21.480> bit<00:00:21.600> one<00:00:21.840> more<00:00:22.619> than<00:00:22.830> two<00:00:23.070> o'clock<00:00:23.689> we

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
little bit one more than two o'clock we

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.870 
little bit one more than two o'clock we
get<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> second<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.039> same<00:00:26.220> for<00:00:26.430> little

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
get the second and the same for little

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.339 
get the second and the same for little
bit<00:00:27.029> more<00:00:27.210> than<00:00:27.269> three<00:00:27.630> but<00:00:28.050> it'll<00:00:28.320> be

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
bit more than three but it'll be

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.710 
bit more than three but it'll be
pardoned<00:00:28.800> for<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:29.340> little<00:00:29.670> bit<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:30.150> more<00:00:30.510> than

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
pardoned for a little bit for more than

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.690 
pardoned for a little bit for more than
five<00:00:31.050> o<00:00:31.080> clock<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.890> get<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.219> position<00:00:32.450> so<00:00:34.700> it's

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
five o clock we get the position so it's

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.930 
five o clock we get the position so it's
a<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.660> position<00:00:37.140> after<00:00:37.320> five<00:00:37.829> more<00:00:38.550> than<00:00:38.700> six

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
a the position after five more than six

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.430 
a the position after five more than six
or<00:00:39.059> not<00:00:39.239> no<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.629> before<00:00:39.960> because<00:00:40.260> it's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
or not no it's before because it's

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.569 
or not no it's before because it's
before<00:00:40.829> even<00:00:41.640> 530<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.260> it's<00:00:43.410> around<00:00:43.710> here<00:00:43.829> so

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
before even 530 so it's around here so

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.830 
before even 530 so it's around here so
form<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:46.320> one<00:00:46.620> two<00:00:47.250> three<00:00:47.969> four<00:00:48.690> and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
form we have here one two three four and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.750 
form we have here one two three four and
five<00:00:49.440> positions<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.980> thing<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
five positions and the thing is the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.590 
five positions and the thing is the
clock<00:00:54.379> works<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.590> same<00:00:55.620> way<00:00:56.030> for<00:00:57.030> and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
clock works the same way for and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.369 
clock works the same way for and
backward<00:00:58.489> which<00:00:59.489> means<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:00.750> gather<00:01:00.989> if

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
backward which means that we gather if

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.520 
backward which means that we gather if
we<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.680> five<00:01:01.980> solution<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.820> side<00:01:03.530> this

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
we have five solution on this side this

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.920 
we have five solution on this side this
side<00:01:04.589> we're<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.939> five<00:01:06.540> solutions

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
side we're going to have five solutions

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.280 
side we're going to have five solutions
on<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:08.130> side<00:01:08.490> which<00:01:09.210> means<00:01:09.240> five<00:01:09.720> plus<00:01:10.080> five

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
on that side which means five plus five

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.460 
on that side which means five plus five
makes<00:01:11.040> ten<00:01:11.670> solution<00:01:12.299> but<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.720> not<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.350> not

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
makes ten solution but it's not it's not

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.340 
makes ten solution but it's not it's not
all<00:01:13.860> because<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.400> forgot<00:01:14.700> one<00:01:14.939> with<00:01:15.479> forgot<00:01:16.170> of

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
all because we forgot one with forgot of

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.520 
all because we forgot one with forgot of
course<00:01:17.000> midnight<00:01:18.000> which<00:01:18.540> makes<00:01:18.810> one<00:01:19.350> more

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
course midnight which makes one more

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.550 
course midnight which makes one more
solution<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.880> because<00:01:21.150> it's<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.509> symmetry<00:01:21.960> we

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
solution so because it's a symmetry we

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.929 
solution so because it's a symmetry we
have<00:01:22.710> 11<00:01:23.369> positions<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:25.220> if<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.310> wonder<00:01:26.670> what

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
have 11 positions and if you wonder what

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.800 
have 11 positions and if you wonder what
is<00:01:27.119> 11<00:01:27.780> position<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.560> 12<00:01:29.100> hours<00:01:29.310> well<00:01:29.939> check

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
is 11 position in 12 hours well check

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.289 
is 11 position in 12 hours well check
this<00:01:30.960> out<00:01:31.170> between<00:01:31.740> 12<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.579> o'clock<00:01:32.939> you

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
this out between 12 and one o'clock you

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.850 
this out between 12 and one o'clock you
don't<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.630> any<00:01:33.840> position<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.619> little

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
don't have any position it's a little

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.499 
don't have any position it's a little
bit<00:01:35.009> more<00:01:35.220> than<00:01:35.369> one<00:01:35.610> which<00:01:36.150> means<00:01:36.420> that

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
bit more than one which means that

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.289 
bit more than one which means that
between<00:01:37.170> 12<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.619> 11<00:01:37.829> we<00:01:38.759> don't<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.090> any

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
between 12 and 11 we don't have any

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.440 
between 12 and 11 we don't have any
position<00:01:39.810> either<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.880> that's<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.240> way<00:01:42.390> it

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
position either so that's the way it

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.230 
position either so that's the way it
works<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.960> that's<00:01:43.470> why<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:44.009> are<00:01:44.310> only<00:01:44.430> 11

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
works and that's why we are only 11

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.469 
works and that's why we are only 11
positions<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.079> now<00:01:46.799> yes<00:01:47.250> MA<00:01:47.490> here's<00:01:48.240> my<00:01:48.329> a

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
positions and now yes MA here's my a

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.580 
positions and now yes MA here's my a
more<00:01:48.899> difficult<00:01:49.229> question<00:01:49.979> oh<00:01:50.899> and<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.470> have

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
more difficult question oh and you have

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.889 
more difficult question oh and you have
to<00:01:52.770> find<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.130> less<00:01:53.399> than<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.790> minute<00:01:54.060> though

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
to find in less than a minute though

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.840 
to find in less than a minute though
i'll<00:01:55.049> give<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.560> solution<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.310> week

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.389 

assuming<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.079> the<00:02:01.079> hands<00:02:01.320> get<00:02:01.530> separated<00:02:02.100> at

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
assuming that the hands get separated at

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.169 
assuming that the hands get separated at
midnight<00:02:04.340> at<00:02:05.340> what<00:02:06.240> time<00:02:06.860> precisely<00:02:08.179> will

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
midnight at what time precisely will

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.500 
midnight at what time precisely will
they<00:02:09.390> meet<00:02:09.569> again<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> fifth

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
they meet again for the fifth

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.470 
they meet again for the fifth
time<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:14.470> hope<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.620> enjoyed<00:02:15.920> this<00:02:16.040> one<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.610> see

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
time I hope you enjoyed this one and see

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.310 
time I hope you enjoyed this one and see
you<00:02:17.569> next<00:02:17.659> time<00:02:17.930> for<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.829> solution
