damaged enough that it would hold curls

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.759 
damaged enough that it would hold curls
so<00:03:47.269> that<00:03:47.420> was<00:03:47.569> a<00:03:47.600> really<00:03:47.840> good<00:03:48.079> thing<00:03:48.139> I<00:03:48.530> really

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
so that was a really good thing I really

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.170 
so that was a really good thing I really
was<00:03:48.920> happy<00:03:49.130> about<00:03:49.340> that<00:03:49.609> I<00:03:49.670> could<00:03:49.940> finally

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
was happy about that I could finally

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.229 
was happy about that I could finally
have<00:03:50.450> curly<00:03:50.780> hair<00:03:50.810> did<00:03:51.139> last<00:03:51.380> 4<00:03:51.620> days<00:03:51.709> so<00:03:52.579> yeah

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
have curly hair did last 4 days so yeah

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.270 
have curly hair did last 4 days so yeah
I<00:03:53.269> guess<00:03:53.569> sometimes<00:03:53.989> damaged<00:03:54.620> hair<00:03:54.829> can<00:03:55.069> be<00:03:55.250> a

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
I guess sometimes damaged hair can be a

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.650 
I guess sometimes damaged hair can be a
good<00:03:55.459> thing<00:03:55.519> it<00:03:55.850> does<00:03:56.060> hold<00:03:56.239> your<00:03:56.450> curls

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
good thing it does hold your curls

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.660 
good thing it does hold your curls
better<00:03:56.930> hold<00:03:57.200> your<00:03:57.319> teasing<00:03:58.160> better<00:03:58.370> anything

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
better hold your teasing better anything

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.970 
better hold your teasing better anything
better<00:03:59.030> because<00:03:59.359> it's<00:03:59.540> all<00:03:59.690> damaged<00:04:00.380> so<00:04:00.950> I

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
better because it's all damaged so I

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.740 
better because it's all damaged so I
guess<00:04:01.519> it<00:04:01.730> can<00:04:01.850> be<00:04:01.940> a<00:04:01.970> good<00:04:02.150> or<00:04:02.299> bad<00:04:02.329> thing<00:04:02.450> I

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
guess it can be a good or bad thing I

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.539 
guess it can be a good or bad thing I
know<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:02.900> lot<00:04:03.049> of<00:04:03.079> girls<00:04:03.290> um<00:04:03.590> that<00:04:04.100> have<00:04:04.250> really

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
know a lot of girls um that have really

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.759 
know a lot of girls um that have really
nice<00:04:04.670> soft<00:04:05.000> silky<00:04:05.450> hair<00:04:05.660> their<00:04:06.290> hair<00:04:06.319> won't
