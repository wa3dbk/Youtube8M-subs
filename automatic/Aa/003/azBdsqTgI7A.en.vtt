system<00:00:44.309> well<00:00:44.520> right<00:00:44.910> now<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.120> truth<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
system well right now the truth of the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.260 
system well right now the truth of the
matter<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.170> we<00:00:46.770> have<00:00:46.800> no<00:00:47.129> idea<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.850> black<00:00:48.059> ops

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270

matter is we have no idea the black ops
3<00:00:48.539> spawning<00:00:48.870> system<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.379> probably<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.309> to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
3 spawning system is probably going to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.939 
3 spawning system is probably going to
be<00:00:50.550> built<00:00:50.940> something<00:00:51.329> around<00:00:51.840> what<00:00:52.440> black<00:00:52.680> ops

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
be built something around what black ops

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.799 
be built something around what black ops

yes there are boundaries to spawns but
there's<00:02:01.140> also<00:02:01.380> times<00:02:01.829> where<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.759> can<00:02:02.939> go

will still spawn there and that's

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.180 
will still spawn there and that's

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
game speed black ops 2 was perhaps one

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.270

terms of how it worked out well because

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.170 
terms of how it worked out well because
these<00:02:44.590> spawning<00:02:44.980> systems<00:02:45.520> weren't<00:02:45.910> really

these spawning systems weren't really

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.880 
these spawning systems weren't really
too<00:02:46.360> much<00:02:46.480> affected<00:02:46.960> but<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.200> game<00:02:47.530> was

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
too much affected but the game was

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.190

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690

what these spawning systems are like

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.449 
what these spawning systems are like
that<00:03:13.720> is<00:03:13.870> because<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.410> game<00:03:14.680> mode<00:03:14.920> endgame

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
that is because the game mode endgame

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.120 
that is because the game mode endgame

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
bothers me are the people's place

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.670 
bothers me are the people's place
thousand<00:03:25.480> people<00:03:25.720> camping<00:03:26.080> whenever<00:03:26.470> they

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
thousand people camping whenever they

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.900 
thousand people camping whenever they

that<00:03:28.030> kind<00:03:28.209> of<00:03:28.239> stuff<00:03:28.360> but<00:03:29.080> the<00:03:29.230> actual<00:03:29.650> game<00:03:29.860> I

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
that kind of stuff but the actual game I

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.130 
that kind of stuff but the actual game I
am<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.250> huge<00:03:30.519> fan<00:03:30.550> of<00:03:30.790> but<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:31.360> can<00:03:31.720> definitely

am a huge fan of but I can definitely

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.710 
am a huge fan of but I can definitely

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
recognize that sledgehammer has made a

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.720 
recognize that sledgehammer has made a

the game itself the algorithms can't
really<00:03:39.430> keep<00:03:39.610> up<00:03:39.820> with<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.300> movements

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
really keep up with the movements

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.750 
really keep up with the movements

in a more advanced way something that

in a more advanced way something that

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
matches the times of 2065 but we don't

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
game that is a lot faster you have to

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.700 
game that is a lot faster you have to
decrease<00:04:43.150> that<00:04:43.419> time<00:04:43.749> for<00:04:44.319> these<00:04:44.439> spawn

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
decrease that time for these spawn

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.920 
decrease that time for these spawn
algorithms<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.520> actually<00:04:45.969> react<00:04:46.360> if<00:04:46.599> you're

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
algorithms to actually react if you're

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.149 
algorithms to actually react if you're
going<00:04:47.169> to<00:04:47.259> keep<00:04:47.439> it<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.680> same<00:04:47.949> as<00:04:48.129> the

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
going to keep it the same as the

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.580 
going to keep it the same as the
standard<00:04:48.729> spawn<00:04:49.300> algorithm<00:04:49.930> where<00:04:50.139> it<00:04:50.289> looks

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
standard spawn algorithm where it looks

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.379 
standard spawn algorithm where it looks
for<00:04:50.860> a<00:04:50.889> hole<00:04:51.159> in<00:04:51.189> the<00:04:51.490> map<00:04:51.669> where<00:04:51.909> people<00:04:52.210> are

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
for a hole in the map where people are

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.559 
for a hole in the map where people are
not<00:04:52.659> if<00:04:52.930> your<00:04:53.349> players<00:04:53.680> are<00:04:54.009> too<00:04:54.310> fast<00:04:54.639> it<00:04:54.969> does

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
not if your players are too fast it does

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.990 
not if your players are too fast it does
exploit<00:04:56.289> that<00:04:56.319> and<00:04:56.680> can<00:04:56.949> make<00:04:57.129> it<00:04:57.279> very<00:04:57.550> hard

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
exploit that and can make it very hard

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.330 
exploit that and can make it very hard
so<00:04:58.210> that's<00:04:58.840> amiright<00:04:59.349> there<00:04:59.560> is<00:04:59.740> the<00:04:59.889> biggest

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
so that's amiright there is the biggest

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.730 
so that's amiright there is the biggest
thing<00:05:00.520> in<00:05:00.580> which<00:05:01.029> can<00:05:01.360> either<00:05:01.659> kill<00:05:02.139> or<00:05:02.319> make

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
thing in which can either kill or make

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.459 
thing in which can either kill or make
spawns<00:05:03.189> in<00:05:03.460> black<00:05:03.879> ops<00:05:04.180> 3<00:05:04.360> personally<00:05:05.229> like<00:05:05.349> I

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:05.469 
spawns in black ops 3 personally like I

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:07.709 
spawns in black ops 3 personally like I
said<00:05:05.680> black<00:05:05.889> ops<00:05:06.159> 2<00:05:06.370> to<00:05:06.610> me<00:05:06.759> was<00:05:07.000> not<00:05:07.240> too<00:05:07.479> bad

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:07.719 
said black ops 2 to me was not too bad

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:09.809 
said black ops 2 to me was not too bad
so<00:05:07.990> I<00:05:08.020> do<00:05:08.199> have<00:05:08.469> faith<00:05:08.710> in<00:05:08.919> track<00:05:09.189> that<00:05:09.639> this

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819 
so I do have faith in track that this

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:11.700 
so I do have faith in track that this
could<00:05:10.060> actually<00:05:10.300> come<00:05:10.840> out<00:05:11.050> to<00:05:11.229> be<00:05:11.259> a<00:05:11.379> good

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
could actually come out to be a good

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.529 
could actually come out to be a good
thing<00:05:11.919> making<00:05:12.490> the<00:05:12.729> movement<00:05:12.939> a<00:05:13.180> little<00:05:13.449> bit

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
thing making the movement a little bit

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.600 
thing making the movement a little bit
more<00:05:13.689> fast-paced<00:05:14.169> than<00:05:14.439> we<00:05:14.590> saw<00:05:14.770> in<00:05:14.800> black<00:05:15.340> ops

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
more fast-paced than we saw in black ops

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.429 
more fast-paced than we saw in black ops
2<00:05:15.909> a<00:05:16.120> little<00:05:16.419> bit<00:05:16.629> slower<00:05:16.960> than<00:05:17.229> maybe

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:17.439 
2 a little bit slower than maybe

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:19.890 
2 a little bit slower than maybe
advanced<00:05:18.069> warfare<00:05:18.580> but<00:05:18.969> also<00:05:19.360> still<00:05:19.629> keep

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
advanced warfare but also still keep

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.420 
advanced warfare but also still keep
that<00:05:20.080> common<00:05:20.529> ground<00:05:20.800> where<00:05:20.979> these<00:05:21.129> spawns

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
that common ground where these spawns

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.399 
that common ground where these spawns
needs<00:05:21.789> to<00:05:21.909> be<00:05:22.060> good<00:05:22.330> because<00:05:22.479> let's<00:05:23.139> face<00:05:23.229> it

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:23.409 
needs to be good because let's face it

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:25.140
