in<00:01:18.720> tune<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.140> they're<00:01:19.290> not<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.680> best<00:01:20.180> they<00:01:21.180> do

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
in tune but they're not the best they do

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.969 
in tune but they're not the best they do
slip<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.689> little<00:01:21.840> bit<00:01:21.990> more<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.409> seems<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.770> me

slip a little bit more and seems to me

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.490

then then a modern kind of grover tuner

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.460 
then then a modern kind of grover tuner
