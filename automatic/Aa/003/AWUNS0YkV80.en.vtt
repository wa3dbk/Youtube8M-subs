00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
they've got this on the side which is a

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.789 
they've got this on the side which is a
mini<00:00:11.550> DV<00:00:12.300> I'll<00:00:12.809> record<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.259> yeah<00:00:13.440> that's

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
mini DV I'll record it yeah that's

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.000 
mini DV I'll record it yeah that's
what's<00:00:13.950> called<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:15.260> that<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.440> basically<00:00:16.859> a

what's called and that is basically a
new<00:00:17.369> kind<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.240> black<00:00:18.660> box<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.230> records<00:00:19.380> all

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
new kind of black box that records all

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.019 
new kind of black box that records all
the<00:00:19.980> stuff<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.840> the<00:00:21.840> plane<00:00:22.109> sees<00:00:22.850> so<00:00:23.850> I'm

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
the stuff that the plane sees so I'm

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:37.700 
the stuff that the plane sees so I'm
gonna<00:00:24.210> pluck<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:32.390> nice<00:00:34.850> it's<00:00:35.850> high<00:00:36.710> okay

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
gonna pluck that nice it's high okay

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.010 
gonna pluck that nice it's high okay
guys<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.730> some<00:00:39.030> test<00:00:39.270> footage<00:00:39.360> from

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
that Jack camera that's right this is um

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.560 
that Jack camera that's right this is um
the<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.690> from<00:00:48.870> hobbyking<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.559> $300<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:50.570> that

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
the one from hobbyking the $300 one that

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.520 
the one from hobbyking the $300 one that
comes<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> 5.0<00:00:53.039> q<00:00:53.250> her<00:00:53.460> transmitter

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
comes with the 5.0 q her transmitter

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.290 
comes with the 5.0 q her transmitter
people<00:00:56.430> sort<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.670> ask<00:00:56.789> what<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:56.969> footage<00:00:57.180> is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
people sort of ask what the footage is

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.729 
people sort of ask what the footage is
like<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.840> what<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> fleece<00:00:58.320> looks<00:00:58.559> like

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
like this is what the fleece looks like

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.680 
like this is what the fleece looks like
this<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.190> recorded<00:00:59.670> with<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> DVR<00:01:00.120> as<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.570> can

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690

that's<00:01:05.880> right<00:01:06.500> it<00:01:07.500> seems<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.830> be<00:01:07.890> very

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
that's right it seems to be very

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.399 
that's right it seems to be very
susceptible<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.760> noise<00:01:09.450> from<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.869> motor

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
susceptible to noise from the motor

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.600 
susceptible to noise from the motor
I'm<00:01:10.710> running<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.220> young<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:12.049> felt<00:01:13.049> are<00:01:13.200> there<00:01:13.610> an

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
I'm running a young I felt are there an

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.149 
I'm running a young I felt are there an
LC<00:01:15.210> filter<00:01:15.600> which<00:01:15.840> seems<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.500> helped<00:01:16.860> but

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
LC filter which seems to have helped but

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.240 
LC filter which seems to have helped but
I<00:01:17.340> think<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.580> problem<00:01:17.939> with<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:19.250> Skywalker's

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
I think the problem with the Skywalker's

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.980 
I think the problem with the Skywalker's
is<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:20.790> small<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.330> need<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.600> really<00:01:21.810> move

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
is just so small I need to really move

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.950 
is just so small I need to really move
the<00:01:22.140> transmitter<00:01:22.619> away<00:01:22.979> from<00:01:23.630> where<00:01:24.630> all<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the transmitter away from where all the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.859 
the transmitter away from where all the
ESC<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.830> all<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.369> electronics<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.450> I

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
ESC and all the electronics is so I

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.240 
ESC and all the electronics is so I
think<00:01:28.110> everything's<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.590> packed<00:01:28.799> too<00:01:28.979> close

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
think everything's just packed too close

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.160 
think everything's just packed too close
together<00:01:29.430> as<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.659> see<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.869> doesn't

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
together as you can see it doesn't

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.170 
together as you can see it doesn't
handle<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.740> low<00:01:31.950> light<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.340> contrast<00:01:32.790> isn't

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
handle the low light the contrast isn't

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.929 
handle the low light the contrast isn't
great<00:01:33.450> but<00:01:34.439> soon<00:01:34.770> as<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.979> turn<00:01:35.250> away<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.820> I've

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
great but soon as I turn away and I've

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.319 
great but soon as I turn away and I've
got<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.150> Sun<00:01:36.360> behind<00:01:36.540> me<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:38.790> video<00:01:39.060> footage

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
got the Sun behind me the video footage

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.120 
got the Sun behind me the video footage
is<00:01:39.450> quite<00:01:39.689> acceptable<00:01:40.049> isn't<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.409> yeah<00:01:40.890> it's

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
is quite acceptable isn't it yeah it's

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.950 
is quite acceptable isn't it yeah it's
great<00:01:41.340> video<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.939> mean<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.450> thought<00:01:42.659> for

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
great video I mean you thought for

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.800 
great video I mean you thought for
probably<00:01:43.530> about<00:01:43.619> 15<00:01:43.890> minutes<00:01:44.399> or<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.880> what

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
probably about 15 minutes or so and what

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.550 
probably about 15 minutes or so and what
were<00:01:45.899> your<00:01:45.990> thoughts

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
were your thoughts

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.770 
were your thoughts
it<00:01:47.250> was<00:01:47.399> great<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.790> fly<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.060> waviness<00:01:48.509> was

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
it was great to fly the waviness was

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.420 
it was great to fly the waviness was
have<00:01:48.899> been<00:01:49.049> knowing<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:49.680> otherwise<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.340> was

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
have been knowing but otherwise it was

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.460 
have been knowing but otherwise it was
just<00:01:50.579> great<00:01:50.880> yeah<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.049> what<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.320> looks

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
just great yeah so this is what it looks

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.670 
just great yeah so this is what it looks
like

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
like

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.960 
like
we'll<00:01:53.100> probably<00:01:53.220> lost<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.579> little<00:01:53.700> bit<00:01:53.880> of

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
we'll probably lost a little bit of

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.270 
we'll probably lost a little bit of
quality<00:01:54.119> here<00:01:54.509> cuz<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> DVR<00:01:55.110> I've<00:01:55.259> got<00:01:55.500> I'm

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
quality here cuz the DVR I've got I'm

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.649 
quality here cuz the DVR I've got I'm
not<00:01:56.520> really<00:01:56.700> happy<00:01:56.939> with<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.479> was<00:01:57.540> to

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
not really happy with this it was to

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.679 
not really happy with this it was to
handle<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.079> NTSC<00:01:58.619> footage<00:01:59.130> from<00:01:59.689> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
handle the NTSC footage from the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.230 
handle the NTSC footage from the
Fatshark<00:02:00.960> better<00:02:01.500> than<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.799> handles<00:02:02.240> pal

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
Fatshark better than it handles pal

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.039 
Fatshark better than it handles pal

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
right you've got the hobbyking camera if

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.170 
right you've got the hobbyking camera if
you<00:03:12.000> can<00:03:12.150> sort<00:03:12.300> of<00:03:12.330> ignore<00:03:12.450> those<00:03:14.180> horizontal

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
you can sort of ignore those horizontal

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.470 
you can sort of ignore those horizontal
lines<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:17.280> can<00:03:17.430> sort<00:03:17.610> of<00:03:17.670> see<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.090> way<00:03:18.240> it

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
lines you can sort of see the way it

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.000 
lines you can sort of see the way it
seems<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.750> handle<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.080> darker<00:03:19.500> areas<00:03:19.800> a<00:03:19.830> lot

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
seems to handle the darker areas a lot

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.570 
seems to handle the darker areas a lot
better<00:03:20.280> than<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.790> um<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:22.770> fetch<00:03:23.010> our<00:03:23.220> camera

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
better than the um the fetch our camera

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.540 
better than the um the fetch our camera
the<00:03:24.360> contract<00:03:24.810> is<00:03:24.959> that<00:03:24.990> is<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.260> lot<00:03:25.500> better<00:03:25.709> but

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
the contract is that is a lot better but

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.280 
the contract is that is a lot better but
then<00:03:26.700> again<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.090> also<00:03:27.240> susceptible<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:28.020> any

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
then again it is also susceptible to any

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.590 
then again it is also susceptible to any
sunlight<00:03:28.560> directly<00:03:28.950> into<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.580> camera<00:03:29.790> so

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
sunlight directly into the camera so

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.940 
sunlight directly into the camera so
that<00:03:30.690> sort<00:03:30.870> of<00:03:30.930> gives<00:03:31.080> you<00:03:31.230> an<00:03:31.380> idea<00:03:31.620> what<00:03:31.860> the

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
that sort of gives you an idea what the

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.130 
that sort of gives you an idea what the
fetch<00:03:32.100> our<00:03:32.340> cameras<00:03:32.670> or<00:03:32.790> camera<00:03:33.240> is<00:03:33.360> like<00:03:33.510> okay

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
fetch our cameras or camera is like okay

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.449 
fetch our cameras or camera is like okay
it's<00:03:34.230> not<00:03:34.320> bad<00:03:34.380> for<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:34.800> price<00:03:34.980> considering

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
it's not bad for the price considering

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.210 
it's not bad for the price considering
you<00:03:35.550> get<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.730> camera<00:03:35.970> in<00:03:36.380> fpv<00:03:37.380> camera<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:37.950> also

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
you get a camera in fpv camera and also

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.720 
you get a camera in fpv camera and also
the<00:03:38.640> transmitter<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.300> go<00:03:39.420> with<00:03:39.630> it<00:03:41.480> and

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
the transmitter to go with it and

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.550 
the transmitter to go with it and
everything<00:03:44.730> has<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:44.970> add<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.270> a<00:03:45.300> top<00:03:45.560> not

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
everything has to add to a top not

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.040 
everything has to add to a top not
really<00:03:47.070> um

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
really um

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.230 
really um
another<00:03:49.620> hop<00:03:49.800> picking<00:03:50.010> one<00:03:50.190> there's<00:03:50.490> security

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240
