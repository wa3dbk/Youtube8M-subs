basically in a do prediction as best as

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.040 
basically in a do prediction as best as
possible<00:00:18.539> with<00:00:19.289> this<00:00:19.500> slightly<00:00:20.810> cold<00:00:21.810> that

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
possible with this slightly cold that

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.950 
possible with this slightly cold that
I'm<00:00:22.140> actually<00:00:22.320> getting<00:00:22.650> over<00:00:23.480> so<00:00:24.480> let's<00:00:24.750> talk

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
I'm actually getting over so let's talk

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.700 
I'm actually getting over so let's talk
about<00:00:25.760> Sheamus<00:00:26.779> since<00:00:27.779> he's<00:00:28.080> kind<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.560> one

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
about Sheamus since he's kind of the one

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.500 
about Sheamus since he's kind of the one
that's<00:00:28.920> actually<00:00:29.279> going<00:00:29.460> after<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.150> WB

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
that's actually going after the WB

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.970 
that's actually going after the WB
champion<00:00:31.080> for<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.980> World<00:00:32.219> Heavyweight<00:00:32.660> title

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
champion for the World Heavyweight title

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.370 
champion for the World Heavyweight title
so<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.579> main<00:00:35.730> reason<00:00:36.180> why<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.360> think<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.170> he's

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
so the main reason why I think that he's

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.490 
so the main reason why I think that he's
going<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.770> definitely<00:00:38.070> lose<00:00:38.640> tonight<00:00:39.629> or<00:00:40.290> not

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
going to definitely lose tonight or not

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.490 
going to definitely lose tonight or not
tonight<00:00:40.710> tomorrow<00:00:41.160> or<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.809> possibly<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
tonight tomorrow or the possibly the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.650 
tonight tomorrow or the possibly the
reason<00:00:43.800> why<00:00:43.980> he<00:00:44.280> could<00:00:44.460> possibly<00:00:44.640> win<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.629> well

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
reason why he could possibly win as well

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.990 
reason why he could possibly win as well
I<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.680> two<00:00:46.920> separate<00:00:47.280> reasons<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:48.800> both<00:00:50.000> so

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
I have two separate reasons on both so

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.910 
I have two separate reasons on both so
first<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.539> think<00:00:51.629> I'll<00:00:51.840> start<00:00:52.110> off<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.620> if

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
first I think I'll start off with if

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.490 
first I think I'll start off with if
what<00:00:53.850> if<00:00:54.000> Sheamus<00:00:54.449> actually<00:00:54.989> lost<00:00:55.170> against

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
what if Sheamus actually lost against

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.459 
what if Sheamus actually lost against
Big<00:00:55.739> Show<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.340> would<00:00:56.489> actually<00:00:56.640> happen

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
Big Show and what would actually happen

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.930 
Big Show and what would actually happen
okay<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.980> thing<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.550> was<00:00:59.789> actually

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
okay so the thing that I was actually

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.819 
okay so the thing that I was actually
thinking<00:01:00.149> about<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.050> Sheamus<00:01:01.350> actually

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
thinking about is if Sheamus actually

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.310 
thinking about is if Sheamus actually
lost<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.340> match<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:03.539> would<00:01:03.780> actually<00:01:03.930> give

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
lost this match this would actually give

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.010 
lost this match this would actually give
once<00:01:04.979> again<00:01:05.339> Dolph<00:01:05.909> Ziggler<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.450> chance<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
once again Dolph Ziggler a chance to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.210 
once again Dolph Ziggler a chance to
come<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.830> possibly<00:01:09.380> take<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.560> Big<00:01:10.799> Show<00:01:11.040> if

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
come in and possibly take on Big Show if

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.560 
come in and possibly take on Big Show if
he<00:01:11.340> wants<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.610> actually<00:01:11.939> have<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> challenge

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
he wants to actually have a challenge

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.990 
he wants to actually have a challenge
but<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.320> doubt<00:01:13.560> he<00:01:13.770> will<00:01:13.979> he<00:01:14.280> likes<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.610> be<00:01:14.700> kind

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
but I doubt he will he likes to be kind

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.800 
but I doubt he will he likes to be kind
of<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.350> edge<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.920> CM<00:01:17.130> Punk's<00:01:17.580> CM<00:01:18.390> Punky<00:01:18.780> i

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
of like edge and CM Punk's CM Punky i

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.480 
of like edge and CM Punk's CM Punky i
would<00:01:19.020> say<00:01:19.170> mixed<00:01:19.560> together<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.310> both

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
would say mixed together so they both

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.260 
would say mixed together so they both
are<00:01:20.820> kind<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.330> like<00:01:21.479> smart<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.320> kind<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.710> a

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
are kind of like smart and kind of a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.850 
are kind of like smart and kind of a
kind<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.390> shy<00:01:24.659> kind<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.290> person<00:01:25.619> who<00:01:25.680> doesn't

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
kind of a shy kind of person who doesn't

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.070 
kind of a shy kind of person who doesn't
want<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.159> take<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> big<00:01:26.759> guy<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.810> I'm

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
want to take on a big guy so I'm

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.960 
want to take on a big guy so I'm
thinking<00:01:28.560> that's<00:01:28.829> what<00:01:29.100> will<00:01:29.280> happen<00:01:29.430> if

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
thinking that's what will happen if

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.030 
thinking that's what will happen if
actually<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.659> Sheamus<00:01:30.900> lost<00:01:31.320> it'll

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
actually if Sheamus lost it'll

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.160 
actually if Sheamus lost it'll
definitely<00:01:32.250> be<00:01:32.579> Dolph<00:01:33.090> Ziggler's<00:01:33.509> chance<00:01:33.840> if

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
definitely be Dolph Ziggler's chance if

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.170 
definitely be Dolph Ziggler's chance if
you<00:01:34.409> want<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.770> actually<00:01:34.890> take<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.670> risk<00:01:35.939> it

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
you want to actually take it and risk it

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.039 
you want to actually take it and risk it
all<00:01:36.299> he<00:01:37.200> could<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.979> then<00:01:39.049> another

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
all he could do that and then another

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.170 
all he could do that and then another
thing<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.590> Sheamus<00:01:40.979> will<00:01:41.220> actually<00:01:41.909> be

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
thing that Sheamus will actually be

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.749 
thing that Sheamus will actually be
doing<00:01:42.299> after<00:01:42.899> he<00:01:42.990> losses<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.460> could

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
doing after he losses is that this could

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.550 
doing after he losses is that this could
be<00:01:44.880> his<00:01:45.000> last<00:01:45.030> chance<00:01:45.540> at<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.380> World

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
be his last chance at the World

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.139 
be his last chance at the World
Heavyweight<00:01:46.710> title<00:01:47.100> for<00:01:47.549> probably<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.090> couple

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
Heavyweight title for probably a couple

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.499 
Heavyweight title for probably a couple
months<00:01:49.140> or<00:01:49.470> maybe<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.799> couple<00:01:50.100> storylines<00:01:50.729> but

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
months or maybe a couple storylines but

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.840 
months or maybe a couple storylines but
we're<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.170> getting<00:01:52.649> tired<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.250> seeing<00:01:53.610> Big

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
we're just getting tired of seeing Big

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.719 
we're just getting tired of seeing Big
Show<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.479> Sheamus<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:55.460> going<00:01:56.460> one-on-one

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
Show and Sheamus just going one-on-one

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.060 
Show and Sheamus just going one-on-one
for<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.450> last<00:01:57.689> like<00:01:57.960> two<00:01:58.259> three<00:01:58.290> pay-per-view

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
for the last like two three pay-per-view

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.280 
for the last like two three pay-per-view
matches<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.670> it's<00:01:59.790> just<00:02:00.060> getting<00:02:00.420> really

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
matches and it's just getting really

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.600 
matches and it's just getting really
irritating<00:02:01.890> because<00:02:01.950> it's<00:02:02.189> kind<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> same

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
irritating because it's kind of the same

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
like he's gone from that so that just

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.190 
like he's gone from that so that just
shows<00:02:25.240> you<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:27.220> storyline<00:02:27.760> I'm

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
shows you that this storyline I'm

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.660 
shows you that this storyline I'm
definitely<00:02:29.200> going<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.740> say<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.280> has<00:02:30.460> to

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
definitely going to say that it has to

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.080 
definitely going to say that it has to
be<00:02:30.760> done<00:02:30.940> this<00:02:31.570> pay-per-view<00:02:32.170> cuz<00:02:32.800> I<00:02:33.190> don't

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
be done this pay-per-view cuz I don't

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.610 
be done this pay-per-view cuz I don't
think<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.540> would<00:02:34.630> hold<00:02:34.840> up<00:02:35.080> if<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.410> went

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
think it would hold up if it went

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.600 
think it would hold up if it went
anywhere<00:02:36.190> past<00:02:36.880> it<00:02:37.300> and<00:02:37.570> then<00:02:38.440> uh<00:02:38.470> next<00:02:39.430> up

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
anywhere past it and then uh next up

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.980 
anywhere past it and then uh next up
let's<00:02:39.790> actually<00:02:40.030> talk<00:02:40.300> about<00:02:40.510> what<00:02:40.690> what

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
let's actually talk about what what

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.410 
let's actually talk about what what
happened<00:02:41.350> if<00:02:41.440> Sheamus<00:02:41.710> actually<00:02:42.130> won<00:02:42.820> that

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
happened if Sheamus actually won that

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.510 
happened if Sheamus actually won that
World<00:02:43.780> Heavyweight<00:02:43.900> Championship<00:02:44.470> ok<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:45.490> I

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
World Heavyweight Championship ok so I

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.400 
World Heavyweight Championship ok so I
actually<00:02:45.730> came<00:02:46.240> up<00:02:46.300> with<00:02:46.570> a<00:02:46.600> very<00:02:46.930> good<00:02:47.170> idea

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
actually came up with a very good idea

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.710 
actually came up with a very good idea
right<00:02:47.680> now<00:02:47.740> actually<00:02:48.100> if<00:02:48.580> Sheamus<00:02:49.240> actually

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
right now actually if Sheamus actually

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.820 
right now actually if Sheamus actually
won<00:02:49.900> this<00:02:50.050> belt<00:02:51.480> there<00:02:52.480> could<00:02:52.660> possibly<00:02:52.840> be<00:02:53.170> a

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
won this belt there could possibly be a

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.130 
won this belt there could possibly be a
chance<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:54.790> Dolph<00:02:55.420> Ziggler<00:02:55.810> could<00:02:55.930> actually

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
chance that Dolph Ziggler could actually

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.160 
chance that Dolph Ziggler could actually
come<00:02:56.500> in<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:56.950> face<00:02:57.520> Sheamus<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.330> beat<00:02:58.990> the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
come in and face Sheamus and beat the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.350 
come in and face Sheamus and beat the
hell<00:02:59.380> out<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.620> him<00:02:59.890> in<00:03:00.100> a<00:03:00.490> couple<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:00.820> seconds

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
hell out of him in a couple of seconds

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.810 
hell out of him in a couple of seconds
and<00:03:01.570> then<00:03:01.630> basically<00:03:01.840> then<00:03:02.350> Big<00:03:03.040> Show<00:03:03.070> will

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
and then basically then Big Show will

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.850 
and then basically then Big Show will
laugh<00:03:04.030> at<00:03:04.270> him<00:03:04.420> they'll<00:03:04.690> be<00:03:04.780> like<00:03:04.900> oh<00:03:05.050> who<00:03:05.290> you

lost will have a championship in 15
seconds<00:03:08.800> or<00:03:09.010> 20<00:03:09.970> seconds<00:03:10.450> or<00:03:10.540> however<00:03:10.690> how

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
seconds or 20 seconds or however how

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.780 
seconds or 20 seconds or however how
long<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.560> takes<00:03:11.800> for<00:03:11.920> Dolph<00:03:12.130> Ziggler<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.610> pin

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
long it takes for Dolph Ziggler the pin

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.940 
long it takes for Dolph Ziggler the pin
him<00:03:12.910> but<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:14.080> could<00:03:14.230> possibly<00:03:14.590> be<00:03:14.680> another

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
him but that could possibly be another

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.170 
him but that could possibly be another
act<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:15.400> I<00:03:15.430> was<00:03:15.550> actually<00:03:15.670> thinking<00:03:15.850> about

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
act that I was actually thinking about

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.410 
act that I was actually thinking about
so<00:03:16.959> let's<00:03:17.110> go<00:03:17.290> on<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.739> Big<00:03:17.950> Show<00:03:18.250> ok<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.970> first

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
so let's go on to Big Show ok the first

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.229 
so let's go on to Big Show ok the first

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
we'll start out with the main reason and

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.020 
we'll start out with the main reason and
why<00:03:22.239> he<00:03:22.630> will<00:03:22.840> win<00:03:23.340> ok<00:03:24.340> so<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.670> reason<00:03:24.820> why

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
why he will win ok so the reason why

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.530 
why he will win ok so the reason why
he'll<00:03:25.269> win<00:03:25.480> this<00:03:25.690> match<00:03:25.959> is<00:03:26.760> course<00:03:27.760> they<00:03:28.360> want

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
he'll win this match is course they want

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.800 
he'll win this match is course they want
to<00:03:28.690> end<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.050> with<00:03:29.380> Sheamus<00:03:30.070> and<00:03:30.280> Big<00:03:30.310> Show<00:03:30.810> so

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
to end it with Sheamus and Big Show so

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.050 
to end it with Sheamus and Big Show so
I'm<00:03:31.959> definitely<00:03:32.380> I<00:03:32.680> say<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.160> winner<00:03:33.370> who

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
I'm definitely I say the winner who

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.430 
I'm definitely I say the winner who
actually<00:03:34.330> holds<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.170> World<00:03:35.350> Heavyweight

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
actually holds the World Heavyweight

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.530 
actually holds the World Heavyweight
title<00:03:35.800> will<00:03:36.370> definitely<00:03:36.790> have<00:03:37.000> to<00:03:37.180> win<00:03:37.360> this

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
title will definitely have to win this

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.090 
title will definitely have to win this
so<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.050> storyline<00:03:38.500> could<00:03:38.769> definitely

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
so the storyline could definitely

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.280 
so the storyline could definitely
diminish<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:39.970> possibly<00:03:40.450> go<00:03:40.660> into<00:03:40.930> something

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
diminish and possibly go into something

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.930 
diminish and possibly go into something
else<00:03:41.440> so<00:03:41.709> that's<00:03:42.400> kind<00:03:42.640> of<00:03:42.670> why<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:42.820> was

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
else so that's kind of why I was

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.630 
else so that's kind of why I was
thinking<00:03:43.590> because<00:03:44.590> Dolph<00:03:45.010> Ziggler<00:03:45.370> is<00:03:45.400> like

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
thinking because Dolph Ziggler is like

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.810 
thinking because Dolph Ziggler is like
rambling<00:03:46.540> on<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.720> stuff<00:03:47.230> about<00:03:47.350> oh<00:03:47.820> this

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
rambling on and stuff about oh this

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.240 
rambling on and stuff about oh this
pay-per-view<00:03:49.120> or<00:03:49.870> this<00:03:50.140> night<00:03:50.680> or<00:03:50.980> something

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
pay-per-view or this night or something

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.650 
pay-per-view or this night or something
will<00:03:51.550> be<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.790> day<00:03:52.890> excuse<00:03:53.890> me<00:03:54.390> will<00:03:55.390> be<00:03:55.540> the

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
saying in the last video the only way

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.680 
saying in the last video the only way
that's<00:04:05.739> gonna<00:04:05.830> happen<00:04:05.950> is<00:04:06.519> if<00:04:06.700> this<00:04:06.940> match<00:04:07.330> is

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
that's gonna happen is if this match is

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.770 
that's gonna happen is if this match is
the<00:04:08.049> very<00:04:08.260> last<00:04:08.440> match<00:04:09.239> they<00:04:10.239> actually<00:04:10.450> hit

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
the very last match they actually hit

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.720 
the very last match they actually hit
that<00:04:10.810> ref<00:04:12.360> so<00:04:13.360> basically<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:14.950> fallout<00:04:15.370> a<00:04:15.519> big

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
that ref so basically the fallout a big

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.120 
that ref so basically the fallout a big
show<00:04:15.970> winning<00:04:16.359> again<00:04:16.600> is<00:04:16.840> that<00:04:16.900> Sheamus<00:04:17.620> like

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
show winning again is that Sheamus like

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.159 
show winning again is that Sheamus like
I<00:04:18.280> was<00:04:18.370> saying<00:04:18.580> is<00:04:19.000> gonna<00:04:19.239> scoot<00:04:19.600> along<00:04:19.720> and

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
I was saying is gonna scoot along and

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.380 
I was saying is gonna scoot along and
I'm<00:04:20.320> thinking<00:04:20.350> Dolph<00:04:20.950> Ziggler<00:04:21.340> will<00:04:21.729> actually

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
I'm thinking Dolph Ziggler will actually

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.460 
I'm thinking Dolph Ziggler will actually
come<00:04:22.630> in<00:04:22.780> and

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
come in and

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.910 
come in and
the<00:04:23.620> if<00:04:23.950> Big<00:04:24.700> Show<00:04:24.730> actually<00:04:25.210> lost<00:04:25.470> that<00:04:26.470> we

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
the if Big Show actually lost that we

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.410 
the if Big Show actually lost that we
already<00:04:27.100> know<00:04:27.400> is<00:04:27.730> not<00:04:28.000> going<00:04:28.210> to<00:04:28.270> be

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
already know is not going to be

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.780 
already know is not going to be
important<00:04:29.020> that<00:04:29.590> just<00:04:29.830> shows<00:04:30.070> that<00:04:30.130> they<00:04:30.610> want

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
important that just shows that they want

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.210 
important that just shows that they want
to<00:04:30.880> get<00:04:30.940> more<00:04:31.120> younger<00:04:31.360> people<00:04:31.810> in<00:04:32.020> and<00:04:32.320> that

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
to get more younger people in and that

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.130 
to get more younger people in and that
also<00:04:33.430> shows<00:04:33.610> Dolph<00:04:34.090> Ziggler<00:04:34.420> is<00:04:34.570> ready<00:04:34.840> and

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
also shows Dolph Ziggler is ready and

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.930 
also shows Dolph Ziggler is ready and
that's<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.890> only<00:04:35.920> reason<00:04:36.100> why<00:04:36.430> he<00:04:36.610> would<00:04:36.700> lose

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
that's the only reason why he would lose

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.300 
that's the only reason why he would lose
against<00:04:37.540> sheamus<00:04:37.780> because<00:04:38.320> Dolph<00:04:38.680> Ziggler<00:04:39.040> or

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
against sheamus because Dolph Ziggler or

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.180 
against sheamus because Dolph Ziggler or
either<00:04:39.700> I'm<00:04:40.450> thinkin<00:04:41.200> she'll<00:04:41.920> could

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
either I'm thinkin she'll could

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.310 
either I'm thinkin she'll could
interrupt<00:04:42.430> so<00:04:43.300> those<00:04:43.510> are<00:04:43.630> two<00:04:43.660> things<00:04:43.810> I'm

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
interrupt so those are two things I'm

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.230 
interrupt so those are two things I'm
the<00:04:44.440> reason<00:04:44.560> why<00:04:44.740> Big<00:04:45.010> Show<00:04:45.160> will<00:04:45.310> lose<00:04:45.520> so

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
the reason why Big Show will lose so

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.400 
the reason why Big Show will lose so
we're<00:04:46.540> coming<00:04:46.690> up<00:04:46.840> to<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:46.990> end<00:04:47.110> of<00:04:47.230> the<00:04:47.290> video

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
some comparisons and stuff on why they

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.100 
some comparisons and stuff on why they
