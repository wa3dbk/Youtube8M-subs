00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 so hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.850
 first making-of tutorials to the front 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.990
 Place service with the question of ms 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.610
 minecraft boom 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.679
 He asked me how I did it 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.809
 have that when you go to the wall games 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.549
 item throws away that teleport away 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.590
 and may i have new scoreboard 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.970
 features of the 1.7 used earlier 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.189
 you could only count how many times you 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.380
 died or how many times you yourself 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.119
 somehow killed somebody and since 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.320
 1.7 are added more features 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.769
 For example, I can be here now 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.019
 with scoreboard objectives at the names 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.300
 and then let drop city point 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.100
 how many items a player thrown away 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.660
 we're still pretty handy 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.489
 times very briefly happy up here and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.200
 then I would not throw anything away 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.160
 shown that so far thrown in the way 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.440
 I have a few other things 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.850
 throw away here lay gauck with less 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.010
 displayed how many items I exactly 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.660
 threw it away even when I was with one 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.430
 sehschlitz command own get 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.070
 throw it also as once 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.410
 counted and there are as I said then can 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.610
 I keep checking the score here and 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.480
 Later he teleported 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.239
 and there are a few more here 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.980
 Other features eg I can with here 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.549
 scoreboard objectives at inventory also 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.439
 the names low point open in theory 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.689
 let's aim at the mental pot 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.670
 You can vote that way and then publicly 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.200
 Inventory again on the chip 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.640
 now count how many times inventory 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.000
 open and for example there's also 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.710
 the feature scoreboard objectives at 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.299
 catwalk of always good her 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.500
 Click and counted here as well 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.549
 many centimeters me in the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.170
 minecraft world put back back 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.490
 So that's a few more 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.549
 Command that it really only one 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.020
 fraction of the selection of my page as 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.950
 57 everything can be checked 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.450
 now it is in the description 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.710
 I think this will link with it 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.450
 you can find your way around 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.979
 and that's what you want to show in the end how to 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.400
 It manages that we import directly 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.630
 become 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.009
 because if I now I have 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.689
 yes, not even the imprint around 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.460
 strode wants umswitchen can I 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.869
 now everyone sees you i already have 14 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.520
 a discarded we now in 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.899
 command playern honor if I go away 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.939
 does not teleport again 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.590
 if the way teleported ran again 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.420
 I'll be teleported away again 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.000
 My drop is higher than 1 if you had the one 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.689
 Print again on zero scoreboard players 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.070
 said comolli drops to zero 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.240
 then I can be quite normal here and we 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.320
 have to believe it because I still have 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.220
 I'm not an item 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.750
 thrown away 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.110
 because this command blog teleports 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.480
 all the way back the one belongs 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.710
 Drop chorus as 0 and radios three 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.540
 I have to work properly here now 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.650
 can be to the certain coordinates and so on 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.970
 comes the whole check 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.350
 if you want to get that one 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.850
 that makes you have to score again 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.020
 reset and yes it should be 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.490
 have been so far 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.740
 left now comes to a video in the 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.360
 I all the innovations of the 1.7 in detail 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.370
 imagine or you can right click on 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.570
 a beginner tutorial to the scoreboard 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.220
 however, we are also in the 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.360
 Thanks a lot for watching 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.360
 bye bye
