cell phone on a different note I was

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.410 
cell phone on a different note I was
recently<00:07:02.530> discussing<00:07:03.190> with<00:07:03.340> a<00:07:03.370> viewer<00:07:03.730> the

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:04.420 
recently discussing with a viewer the

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.990 
recently discussing with a viewer the
formula<00:07:05.170> to<00:07:05.380> calculate<00:07:05.650> the<00:07:06.250> mental<00:07:06.880> maturity

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 
formula to calculate the mental maturity

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.810 
formula to calculate the mental maturity
of<00:07:07.600> men<00:07:07.900> versus<00:07:08.350> women<00:07:08.380> in<00:07:08.920> order<00:07:09.670> to

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820 
of men versus women in order to

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.240 
of men versus women in order to
determine<00:07:10.240> ones<00:07:10.870> appropriate<00:07:11.680> dating<00:07:12.070> pool

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
determine ones appropriate dating pool

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.839 
determine ones appropriate dating pool
personally<00:07:13.210> I'm

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:13.849 
personally I'm

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:15.790 
personally I'm
baffled<00:07:14.300> so<00:07:14.809> I<00:07:14.839> thought<00:07:15.139> that<00:07:15.199> I<00:07:15.379> would<00:07:15.589> put<00:07:15.770> it

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 
baffled so I thought that I would put it

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.799 
baffled so I thought that I would put it
to<00:07:16.009> the<00:07:16.039> rest<00:07:16.429> of<00:07:16.580> you<00:07:16.729> to<00:07:16.909> see<00:07:17.089> if<00:07:17.179> anyone<00:07:17.659> has

00:07:17.799 --> 00:07:17.809 
to the rest of you to see if anyone has

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:19.959 
to the rest of you to see if anyone has
stumbled<00:07:18.080> upon<00:07:18.289> an<00:07:18.679> appropriate<00:07:19.189> algorithm<00:07:19.789> I

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:19.969 
stumbled upon an appropriate algorithm I

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:22.719 
stumbled upon an appropriate algorithm I
would<00:07:20.599> assume<00:07:20.929> that<00:07:21.169> the<00:07:21.319> range<00:07:21.709> gets<00:07:22.189> larger

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:22.729 
would assume that the range gets larger

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:24.999 
would assume that the range gets larger
the<00:07:22.879> older<00:07:23.240> you<00:07:23.270> get<00:07:23.689> but<00:07:24.199> i'm<00:07:24.319> not<00:07:24.499> sure<00:07:24.770> if

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:25.009 
the older you get but i'm not sure if

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:28.239 
the older you get but i'm not sure if
the<00:07:25.189> difference<00:07:25.809> stays<00:07:26.809> the<00:07:27.110> same<00:07:27.409> gets

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:28.249 
the difference stays the same gets

00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:30.549 
the difference stays the same gets
bigger<00:07:28.580> or<00:07:28.909> gets<00:07:29.149> smaller<00:07:29.539> or<00:07:30.139> maybe<00:07:30.319> it's

00:07:30.549 --> 00:07:30.559 
bigger or gets smaller or maybe it's

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:32.409 
bigger or gets smaller or maybe it's
some<00:07:30.740> sort<00:07:30.889> of<00:07:31.009> curve<00:07:31.339> now<00:07:31.909> i'll<00:07:32.119> give<00:07:32.330> you

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:32.419 
some sort of curve now i'll give you

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:35.019 
some sort of curve now i'll give you
something<00:07:32.839> to<00:07:32.990> start<00:07:33.409> with<00:07:33.559> he<00:07:34.429> suggested

00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:35.029 
something to start with he suggested

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:36.790 
something to start with he suggested
that<00:07:35.179> a<00:07:35.240> man<00:07:35.509> should<00:07:35.749> date<00:07:35.990> a<00:07:36.169> woman<00:07:36.379> who<00:07:36.770> is

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 
that a man should date a woman who is

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.699 
that a man should date a woman who is
half<00:07:37.189> his<00:07:37.429> age<00:07:37.580> plus<00:07:37.879> seven<00:07:37.939> plus<00:07:38.569> or<00:07:39.319> minus

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:39.709 
half his age plus seven plus or minus

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.669 
half his age plus seven plus or minus
two<00:07:40.240> flat<00:07:41.240> out<00:07:41.419> let's<00:07:41.929> just<00:07:42.020> assume<00:07:42.379> that<00:07:42.529> the

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:42.679 
two flat out let's just assume that the

00:07:42.679 --> 00:07:44.439 
two flat out let's just assume that the
formula<00:07:43.099> we're<00:07:43.279> creating<00:07:43.789> only<00:07:44.149> applies<00:07:44.419> to

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:44.449 
formula we're creating only applies to

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:47.049 
formula we're creating only applies to
people<00:07:44.749> who<00:07:44.990> are<00:07:45.110> over<00:07:45.379> 18<00:07:45.770> I<00:07:46.039> think<00:07:46.789> we<00:07:46.909> can

00:07:47.049 --> 00:07:47.059 
people who are over 18 I think we can

00:07:47.059 --> 00:07:49.239 
people who are over 18 I think we can
perfect<00:07:47.389> it<00:07:47.479> a<00:07:47.569> little<00:07:47.719> more<00:07:47.990> for<00:07:48.619> starters<00:07:48.889> I

00:07:49.239 --> 00:07:49.249 
perfect it a little more for starters I

00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:51.249 
perfect it a little more for starters I
don't<00:07:49.669> think<00:07:49.879> that<00:07:49.999> the<00:07:50.119> plus<00:07:50.449> or<00:07:50.659> minus<00:07:50.990> two

00:07:51.249 --> 00:07:51.259 
don't think that the plus or minus two

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:53.919 
don't think that the plus or minus two
is<00:07:51.289> near<00:07:52.069> a<00:07:52.099> big<00:07:52.399> enough<00:07:52.610> range<00:07:52.939> and<00:07:53.269> the<00:07:53.719> rest

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:53.929 
is near a big enough range and the rest

00:07:53.929 --> 00:07:57.540 
is near a big enough range and the rest
of<00:07:54.050> the<00:07:54.169> formula<00:07:54.580> seems<00:07:55.580> flawed<00:07:55.909> as<00:07:56.119> well<00:07:56.360> so

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:57.550 
of the formula seems flawed as well so

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.999 
of the formula seems flawed as well so
can<00:07:58.550> you<00:07:58.580> do<00:07:58.879> better<00:07:59.080> so<00:08:00.080> that's<00:08:00.499> all<00:08:00.800> I<00:08:00.830> have

00:08:00.999 --> 00:08:01.009 
can you do better so that's all I have

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:03.159 
can you do better so that's all I have
time<00:08:01.309> for<00:08:01.369> today<00:08:01.639> I'll<00:08:02.300> see<00:08:02.659> you<00:08:02.749> next<00:08:02.809> week

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:03.169 
time for today I'll see you next week

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:12.219 
time for today I'll see you next week
this<00:08:03.349> is<00:08:03.529> geek<00:08:03.769> girl<00:08:04.300> signing<00:08:05.300> off<00:08:09.219> yeah
