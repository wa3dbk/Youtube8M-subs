teach you guys how to Snell a hook first
what<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:11.670> want<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.910> do<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:12.840> want<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.019> put

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
what you want to do is you want to put

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.110 
what you want to do is you want to put
your<00:00:13.230> tag<00:00:13.469> end<00:00:13.740> through<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.250> loop<00:00:14.429> just<00:00:14.940> like

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
your tag end through the loop just like

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.029 
your tag end through the loop just like
that<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.509> pull<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.020> out<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.170> good<00:00:16.440> 12<00:00:17.279> inches

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
that and pull it out a good 12 inches

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.279 
that and pull it out a good 12 inches
got<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> log<00:00:20.340> tag<00:00:20.760> end<00:00:20.970> right<00:00:21.119> here<00:00:21.300> then<00:00:22.170> you

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
got a log tag end right here then you

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.470 
got a log tag end right here then you
want<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.619> turn<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.519> into<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:24.000> loop<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.449> you

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
want to turn that into a loop so you

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.089 
want to turn that into a loop so you
just<00:00:24.660> kind<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.930> flip<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.260> around<00:00:25.380> make<00:00:26.070> a

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
just kind of flip it around make a

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.609 
just kind of flip it around make a
little<00:00:26.310> loop<00:00:26.460> right<00:00:26.519> there<00:00:26.960> then<00:00:27.960> pull<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.410> out

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
little loop right there then pull it out

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.130 
little loop right there then pull it out
until<00:00:29.630> you<00:00:30.630> have<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:32.390> good<00:00:33.390> size<00:00:33.630> loop<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:34.020> your

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
until you have a good size loop in your

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.229 
until you have a good size loop in your
hand<00:00:34.350> just<00:00:34.530> like<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.950> with<00:00:35.370> your<00:00:35.579> tag<00:00:36.210> end

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
hand just like that with your tag end

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.389 
hand just like that with your tag end
right<00:00:36.600> up<00:00:36.750> here<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.700> now<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:39.059> have<00:00:39.300> two

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
right up here and now that you have two

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.310 
right up here and now that you have two
lines<00:00:41.399> right<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.760> top<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.390> tag<00:00:42.600> end<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.079> part

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
lines right on top the tag end and part

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.170 
lines right on top the tag end and part
of<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.469> loop<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:44.399> want<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.640> take<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.940> right

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
of the loop you want to take the right

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.319 
of the loop you want to take the right
side<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.660> loop<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.820> want<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.120> wrap<00:00:48.300> it

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
side of the loop and you want to wrap it

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.360 
side of the loop and you want to wrap it
around<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.110> shaft<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> hook

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
around the shaft of the hook

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.790 
around the shaft of the hook
six<00:00:50.820> times<00:00:51.590> do<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.800> one<00:00:54.379> do<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> first<00:00:55.739> one

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
six times do this one do the first one

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.260 
six times do this one do the first one
little<00:00:56.070> loose<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.489> pull<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:56.940> down<00:00:57.059> on

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
little loose so you can pull it down on

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.459 
little loose so you can pull it down on
the<00:00:57.329> second<00:00:57.570> one<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.930> two<00:00:58.190> three<00:00:59.300> four<00:01:00.469> five

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
the second one so two three four five

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.399 
the second one so two three four five
and<00:01:02.250> six<00:01:05.240> then<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.330> want<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.570> pinch<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.320> it

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
and six then you want to pinch it so it

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.000 
and six then you want to pinch it so it
doesn't<00:01:07.530> go<00:01:07.710> anywhere<00:01:09.020> then<00:01:10.020> what<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.830> want

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
doesn't go anywhere then what you want

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.429 
doesn't go anywhere then what you want
to<00:01:11.070> do<00:01:11.540> is<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.659> want<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.840> take<00:01:13.020> your<00:01:13.170> tag<00:01:13.409> end

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
to do is you want to take your tag end

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.160 
to do is you want to take your tag end
right<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.880> want<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.119> pull<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.420> tight

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
right here and you want to pull it tight

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.950 
right here and you want to pull it tight
so<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.560> loop<00:01:16.950> over<00:01:17.220> there<00:01:17.540> cinches<00:01:18.540> down<00:01:18.570> on

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
so that loop over there cinches down on

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.130 
so that loop over there cinches down on
itself<00:01:20.030> pull<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.180> all<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.360> way<00:01:21.570> until<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.930> goes

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
itself pull it all the way until it goes

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.880 
itself pull it all the way until it goes
nice<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.380> tight<00:01:23.390> so<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.960> it's

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
nice and tight so you have this it's

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.010 
nice and tight so you have this it's
basically<00:01:26.340> almost<00:01:26.580> done<00:01:26.880> now<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.840> want

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
to do is you want to pull on this part

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.550 
to do is you want to pull on this part
of<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.180> line<00:01:30.409> it<00:01:31.409> will<00:01:31.560> slide<00:01:31.890> up<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:33.560> tighten

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
of the line it will slide up and tighten

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.840 
of the line it will slide up and tighten
down<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.890> itself<00:01:35.250> see<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.600> like<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:37.820> get<00:01:38.820> a

you guys I make quick little eater put a
little<00:01:58.200> surgeon's<00:01:58.740> loop<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.100> top<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.610> smelled

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
little surgeon's loop on top and smelled

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.249 
little surgeon's loop on top and smelled
on<00:02:00.600> two<00:02:00.810> hooks<00:02:02.119> is<00:02:03.119> something<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.600> control<00:02:04.020> it

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
on two hooks is something you control it

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.200 
on two hooks is something you control it
from<00:02:04.530> anyway

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
from anyway
