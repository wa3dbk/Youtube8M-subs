00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello very good and welcome to this 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.250
 small review to look at 1.7 point 10 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.849
 but good more citizens of what is 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.130
 about 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.980
 estimated then this one allows us 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.779
 exchange land for diamonds 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.240
 diamonds sea africa yes yes it is 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.920
 quite still in my opinion but at 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.990
 people who like mining in the mine 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.789
 to me for example I love that is the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.650
 essence of minecraft but good every 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.369
 one to your liking we go to a table 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.910
 cracking and we put this way we will take out 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.260
 live day we can do more what 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.469
 You want all the diamonds you fuck 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.629
 because this kind of diamond 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.969
 earth so to speak okay we're going to 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.530
 an oven and what we're going from here we get 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.500
 diamonds is much like extension 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.510
 previously but I do not know 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.609
 it's fine but on the other hand 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.440
 it did not make sense but good each one to 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.690
 his taste is worth it and another little curiosity 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.409
 and it is already 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.900
 this look at diamonds is that this bird is 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.970
 that is fine but on the other hand it is 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.040
 bad and another little curiosity of this 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.340
 So we 're going to a manufacturing table 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.670
 or at aek we would remove this 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.619
 let's see this I do not know about myself but it seems that it is 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.679
 to troll in my opinion because it is very 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.539
 like we can do all this but what 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.319
 only bad of this diamond as I take it out 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.850
 from the earth there is no skull 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:32.399
 corresponding with this material but 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.280
 it is quite similar in looking we give 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:39.270
 the real one we're going to throw the fake 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.130
 the fake are very similar to that of the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.170
 left has a little more brightness 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.170
 in the in the item but good does not matter 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.599
 Here I have come out with this seed that 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.950
 I'm going to leave the coordinates we do not know 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:54.260
 here next but that I leave the seed 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.300
 sorry 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.040
 we have left here I am going to put creative 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.680
 because it is the right time 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.150
 we have left here here we have left here 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.250
 is rod a couple of trees to do the 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.720
 review here next and it's about the 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.360
 seed because it looks really good 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:13.360
 ok to see around here is a little rabbi 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.360
 good 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.490
 what interests us is the town 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.140
 we have wheat carrots a little bit for 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.170
 here 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.110
 the carrots we want books for the 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.540
 for enchantments we want a 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.569
 smithy and here we have kicks is very 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.249
 full 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.409
 here we have a little wool in case 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:38.349
 we do not see sheep there is a little we can 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:41.750
 do up with this lady now 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:48.450
 but with this we are going to make the bed 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:50.700
 the seed inside to see is worth seven 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.840
 cast iron is fine four 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.840
 apples well 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.300
 pretty obsidian I think they are 11 in 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.790
 total to make the portal black and a 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.360
 iron peak that is very very well 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.280
 but I'm going to leave here 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:12.230
