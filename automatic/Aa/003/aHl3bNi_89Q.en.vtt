00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.490
 let's go so that in this little fish 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.750
 to prepare us broadcast we will start by 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.110
 this side 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.260
 a cut where the bone 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.939
 pressed for this part he gets the regal 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.449
 of the part here and I will give a cut in 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.449
 a tree 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.789
 until arriving 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.840
 the comb or the backbone even if the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.210
 hair comb 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.230
 but in asia 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.280
 and pass the knife 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.550
 private 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.500
 in this way I am releasing the flesh of 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.760
 breathing 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.760
 short on this side 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.230
 Pegadito to the bone I keep removing the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.230
 fillet 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.630
 I really have left 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.630
 it's not a shot 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.350
 of busquets 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:13.369
 on our side 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.369
 repeat the same operation pressed but 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.490
 Thank you 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.490
 Pressure 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.010
 listen to them 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.170
 I find myself again with the comb 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.750
 a process when lifting the steak 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.770
 and they repeat themselves in respect 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.890
 the skin of the fish we do this job 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.590
 our after 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.619
 I know the knife but the blade in the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.140
 table subject from here the skin and I start 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:18.020
 simply to 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.020
 knife to work biology 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.230
 I 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.480
 to extend the retirement 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:30.060
 source where the kinect and tonics 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.060
 for another steak that we make 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.310
 why withdraw 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.820
 in this cut to be able to enter the 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.380
 knife in this way not too tight 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.690
 because if there is no part 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.690
 of the skin on the steak 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.349
 well here we already have the steaks that 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.550
 we had obtained from our fish in 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:01.620
 each 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:05.730
 maiden with brand sign now I 'm going to 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.410
 half each steak to get 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.520
 the traditional juices that go by the 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.360
 Seville 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.260
 from ground 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.260
 and correct 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.310
 two 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.840
 yes 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.150
 to attack 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.260
 well we already have the extensive weapons I have 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.690
 the fish that bring cubes is 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.690
 holding pointed ice flowers shot 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.030
 sometimes 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.860
 onion in the wash a little bit of 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.170
 chopped culantro we have the house gilismo 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.310
 be here a little bit like a little 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.840
 Garlic 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.670
 Amen 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.670
 I'm going to take a bowl of fish 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.360
 and started these fresh and fresh 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.440
 a little bit of chopped garlic 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:26.270
 also that it is comfortable to tolerate but 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.180
 also that he does not have to see the bits of 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.390
 ajÃ­ rubbed between bolt a bit of the 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.920
 vaginismus 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.210
 was a little the coriander 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.510
 I only have here a little bit of 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.510
 Health 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:46.600
 I immediately squeezed the lemon juice 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.600
 ace 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.599
 do not 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.750
 but a little onion 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.140
 and a core is designed 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.200
 I have seen that it has been said by the banana 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.330
 good now for the implant 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:21.330
 I have a piece 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.330
 this last corn I have shooting 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:28.520
 and this is a traditional 100% ceviche 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.240
 it is a variant 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.310
 in which 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.660
 in this container I have a little chili 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.660
 yellow ground 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:50.289
 and good to have a cebichito something different 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.289
 a very particular touch 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:57.059
