00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
the corruption so what else has gone on

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.340 
the corruption so what else has gone on

meet and I was screaming my lungs out

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.699 
meet and I was screaming my lungs out
because<00:02:35.760> we<00:02:36.090> just<00:02:36.540> moved<00:02:36.720> on<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.170> regionals

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
because we just moved on to regionals

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.190 
because we just moved on to regionals
and<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:39.090> has<00:02:39.300> never<00:02:39.510> happened<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.900> my<00:02:40.020> school

sister before so were freaking out um I

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.490 
sister before so were freaking out um I
was<00:02:42.570> covered<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:42.870> paint<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.230> I'm<00:02:43.290> not<00:02:43.380> usually

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
was covered in paint and I'm not usually

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.699 
was covered in paint and I'm not usually
one<00:02:43.799> for<00:02:43.830> fanfare<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:45.000> wasn't<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.709> fun

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
one for fanfare and it wasn't that fun

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.229 
one for fanfare and it wasn't that fun
to<00:02:46.860> wash<00:02:46.980> off<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.430> I'm<00:02:47.910> waiting<00:02:48.030> for<00:02:48.150> my

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
to wash off and I'm waiting for my

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.630 
to wash off and I'm waiting for my
girlfriend<00:02:48.330> yeah<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:49.170> also<00:02:49.560> bought<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.980> ant

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
girlfriend yeah I also bought the ant

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.070 
girlfriend yeah I also bought the ant
sprayer<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.239> can<00:02:51.360> get<00:02:51.480> all<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.690> ants<00:02:51.870> in<00:02:51.900> one

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
sprayer so I can get all the ants in one

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.990 
sprayer so I can get all the ants in one
spray<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:52.890> then<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.130> maximum<00:02:53.549> one<00:02:53.880> or

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
spray and then the maximum one or

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.210 
spray and then the maximum one or
whatever<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.510> gets<00:02:54.780> off<00:02:54.930> five<00:02:55.260> ants

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
whatever that gets off five ants

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.610 
whatever that gets off five ants
permanently<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.600> think<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.840> reduces<00:02:58.320> the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
permanently and I think it reduces the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.500 
permanently and I think it reduces the
amount<00:02:58.769> of<00:02:58.860> time<00:02:59.400> takes<00:03:00.360> for<00:03:00.600> ants<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.260> bid<00:03:01.799> up

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
amount of time takes for ants to bid up

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.210 
amount of time takes for ants to bid up
in<00:03:03.510> future<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.930> will<00:03:04.260> be<00:03:04.290> picking<00:03:04.560> up<00:03:04.739> those<00:03:04.980> two

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
in future I will be picking up those two

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.220 
in future I will be picking up those two
things<00:03:05.400> down<00:03:05.700> here<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.180> then<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:07.080> adventure

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
things down here and then the adventure

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.770 
things down here and then the adventure
reminder<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.160> key<00:03:09.090> thing<00:03:09.330> that<00:03:09.450> makes<00:03:09.690> it

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
reminder and the key thing that makes it

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.460 
reminder and the key thing that makes it
so<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:09.930> travel<00:03:10.620> faster<00:03:11.269> mm-hmm

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
so I travel faster mm-hmm

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.949 
so I travel faster mm-hmm
all<00:03:13.470> right<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.880> just<00:03:14.970> another<00:03:15.209> quick<00:03:15.540> thing<00:03:15.840> I

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
all right and just another quick thing I

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.759 
all right and just another quick thing I
want<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.290> point<00:03:16.560> out<00:03:16.799> is<00:03:17.040> that<00:03:17.370> for<00:03:18.590> upgrades<00:03:19.590> I

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
want to point out is that for upgrades I

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.890 
want to point out is that for upgrades I
maxed<00:03:20.280> out<00:03:20.400> my<00:03:20.459> max<00:03:20.880> speed<00:03:21.090> in<00:03:21.330> starting<00:03:21.660> speed

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
maxed out my max speed in starting speed

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.479 
maxed out my max speed in starting speed
I'm<00:03:22.410> gonna<00:03:22.560> try<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.709> max<00:03:22.950> out<00:03:23.100> all<00:03:23.250> these

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
I'm gonna try to max out all these

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.800 
I'm gonna try to max out all these
things<00:03:25.430> hopefully<00:03:26.430> by<00:03:26.850> next<00:03:27.060> video<00:03:27.480> that

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
things hopefully by next video that

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.390 
things hopefully by next video that
would<00:03:27.870> be<00:03:27.989> really<00:03:28.380> nice

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
would be really nice

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.890 
would be really nice
that's<00:03:29.910> probably<00:03:30.299> little<00:03:30.420> bit<00:03:30.540> unrealistic

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
that's probably little bit unrealistic

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.500 
that's probably little bit unrealistic
I'll<00:03:31.140> have<00:03:31.260> at<00:03:31.380> least<00:03:31.440> one<00:03:31.650> or<00:03:31.769> two<00:03:31.860> more<00:03:32.010> done

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
I'll have at least one or two more done

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.420 
I'll have at least one or two more done
and<00:03:33.590> probably<00:03:34.590> three<00:03:34.799> thousand<00:03:35.130> everything

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
and probably three thousand everything

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.650 
and probably three thousand everything
here<00:03:35.579> will<00:03:35.730> be<00:03:35.760> max<00:03:36.030> which<00:03:36.239> would<00:03:36.360> be<00:03:36.450> pretty

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
here will be max which would be pretty

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.390 
here will be max which would be pretty
freaking<00:03:37.230> dope<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.709> could<00:03:38.070> always<00:03:38.220> buy<00:03:38.370> a

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
freaking dope I could always buy a

freaking dope I could always buy a
stadium<00:03:38.700> tokens<00:03:39.120> but<00:03:39.269> those<00:03:39.420> are<00:03:39.570> expensive

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
stadium tokens but those are expensive

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.039 
stadium tokens but those are expensive
because<00:03:41.070> green<00:03:41.670> coins<00:03:41.910> are<00:03:42.209> valuable<00:03:42.750> because

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
because green coins are valuable because

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.699 
because green coins are valuable because
I<00:03:43.470> need<00:03:43.769> them<00:03:44.040> for<00:03:45.799> this<00:03:46.799> stuff<00:03:47.220> blue<00:03:48.209> coins
