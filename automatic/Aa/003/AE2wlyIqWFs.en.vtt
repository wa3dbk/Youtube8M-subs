00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
before I learned how fish I used to buy

to heat up and serve I realized it had a

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.119 
to heat up and serve I realized it had a
lot<00:00:51.330> of<00:00:51.449> sodium<00:00:51.750> ingredients<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.800> didn't

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
lot of sodium ingredients I didn't

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.520 
lot of sodium ingredients I didn't
really<00:00:53.340> need<00:00:53.520> plus<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.629> didn't<00:00:54.900> even<00:00:55.050> taste<00:00:55.290> as

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
good as the fish I baked myself yeah I

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.540 
good as the fish I baked myself yeah I
tried<00:00:58.409> to<00:00:58.500> eat<00:00:58.620> fish<00:00:58.830> a<00:00:58.860> couple<00:00:59.220> times<00:00:59.400> a<00:00:59.519> week

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550

too<00:00:59.970> for<00:01:00.659> a<00:01:00.690> long<00:01:00.900> time<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.379> was<00:01:01.530> worried<00:01:01.800> about

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
too for a long time I was worried about

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.710 
too for a long time I was worried about
mercury<00:01:02.250> because<00:01:03.150> I<00:01:03.210> knew<00:01:03.330> it<00:01:03.449> would<00:01:03.540> be<00:01:03.570> an

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
mercury because I knew it would be an

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.990 
mercury because I knew it would be an
issue<00:01:03.839> if<00:01:04.050> I<00:01:04.199> got<00:01:04.379> pregnant<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.760> didn't

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
issue if I got pregnant but I didn't

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.610 
issue if I got pregnant but I didn't
know<00:01:06.090> which<00:01:06.300> ones<00:01:06.540> had<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> lot<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.110> mercury<00:01:07.260> so

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
know which ones had a lot of mercury so

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.590 
know which ones had a lot of mercury so
I<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.830> avoided<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.310> all<00:01:08.460> together<00:01:08.610> how<00:01:09.540> did

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
I just avoided it all together how did

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.660 
I just avoided it all together how did
you<00:01:09.780> decide<00:01:10.110> which<00:01:10.320> ones<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.680> choose<00:01:10.710> well<00:01:11.400> I

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
you decide which ones to choose well I

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.370 
you decide which ones to choose well I
looked<00:01:12.000> into<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.750> discovered<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.290> it

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
looked into it and I discovered that it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.260 
looked into it and I discovered that it
was<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.620> bigger<00:01:13.860> predatory<00:01:14.610> fish<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.150> had
