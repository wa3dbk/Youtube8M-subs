00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.020 
there and that will cut out everything
around<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.440> then<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.610> can<00:02:53.790> select

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030

the<00:02:54.540> check<00:02:55.290> mark<00:02:55.560> here<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.580> will<00:02:56.760> draw<00:02:57.060> an

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
the check mark here and it will draw an

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.570 
the check mark here and it will draw an
additional<00:02:58.080> white<00:02:58.350> border<00:02:58.860> around<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.370> so

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
additional white border around it so

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.490 
additional white border around it so
that<00:02:59.700> you<00:02:59.819> can<00:02:59.970> then<00:03:00.000> use<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:00.360> as<00:03:00.600> an<00:03:00.720> emoji<00:03:00.959> but

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500
