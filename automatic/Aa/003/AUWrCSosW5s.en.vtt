00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
and I realized the first thing I

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.250 
and I realized the first thing I
realized<00:00:56.309> was<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.520> sniping<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.300> not<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
realized was that sniping is not the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.990 
realized was that sniping is not the
same<00:00:58.530> as<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.949> was<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.160> modern<00:00:59.520> warfare<00:00:59.550> 2

same as it was in modern warfare 2
modern<00:01:00.870> warfare<00:01:01.020> 3<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.980> much<00:01:02.309> faster<00:01:02.640> paced

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090

quickly in modern warfare 3 and because
of<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.430> sniping<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.720> little<00:01:36.960> more

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
of that sniping is a little more

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.950 
of that sniping is a little more
difficult<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.880> sniping<00:01:39.509> itself<00:01:39.810> is

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
difficult to do like sniping itself is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.870 
difficult to do like sniping itself is
not<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.590> much<00:01:40.860> harder<00:01:41.100> than<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.400> wasn't<00:01:41.759> call

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
not that much harder than it wasn't call

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.240 
not that much harder than it wasn't call
of<00:01:41.939> duty<00:01:42.150> 4<00:01:42.180> or<00:01:42.659> modern<00:01:43.229> warfare<00:01:43.350> 2<00:01:43.710> but

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
of duty 4 or modern warfare 2 but

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.649 
of duty 4 or modern warfare 2 but
because<00:01:44.579> these<00:01:44.820> circumstances<00:01:45.270> are

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
because these circumstances are

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.450 
because these circumstances are
different<00:01:45.689> because<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.320> combat<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:47.130> little

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
different because the combat is a little

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.910 
different because the combat is a little
different<00:01:47.880> sniping<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.840> find<00:01:49.110> or<00:01:49.350> at<00:01:49.590> least<00:01:49.770> I

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
who have played mon / 3 or you can try

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.780 
who have played mon / 3 or you can try
it<00:01:55.500> out<00:01:55.619> yourself<00:01:55.770> when<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.219> game<00:01:56.399> comes<00:01:56.579> out

it out yourself when the game comes out
but<00:01:57.329> I've<00:01:57.479> had<00:01:57.719> some<00:01:57.899> trouble<00:01:58.200> with<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.350> sniper

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
but I've had some trouble with a sniper

but I've had some trouble with a sniper
sniping<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> sort<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.810> blend<00:02:01.110> between<00:02:01.560> call

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
sniping is a sort of blend between call

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.459 
sniping is a sort of blend between call
of<00:02:02.070> duty<00:02:02.280> 4<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.790> mon<00:02:02.939> /<00:02:03.090> tue<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.869> very<00:02:04.170> very

heavily dependent on center shoot so you

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.779 
heavily dependent on center shoot so you

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
been a really good sniper at cod4 and I

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.679 
been a really good sniper at cod4 and I
used<00:02:28.349> to<00:02:28.530> always<00:02:28.769> always<00:02:29.459> always<00:02:30.000> drag<00:02:30.389> scope

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
used to always always always drag scope

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.470 
used to always always always drag scope
in<00:02:30.840> mon<00:02:31.170> /<00:02:31.290> tue<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.739> black<00:02:31.950> ops<00:02:32.189> so<00:02:32.730> I've<00:02:33.239> had

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
in mon / tue and black ops so I've had

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.420 
in mon / tue and black ops so I've had
some<00:02:33.689> difficulties<00:02:34.349> adjusting<00:02:34.469> to<00:02:35.040> the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
some difficulties adjusting to the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.580 
some difficulties adjusting to the
sniping<00:02:35.819> system<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.329> new<00:02:36.480> game<00:02:36.719> I<00:02:36.930> don't

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
sniping system in the new game I don't

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.349 
sniping system in the new game I don't
drag<00:02:37.859> as<00:02:38.010> much<00:02:38.189> I<00:02:38.370> can't<00:02:38.849> drag<00:02:39.090> as<00:02:39.209> much

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
drag as much I can't drag as much

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.240 
drag as much I can't drag as much
because<00:02:39.510> sometimes<00:02:39.989> drag<00:02:40.530> shots<00:02:40.769> just<00:02:40.980> don't

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
because sometimes drag shots just don't

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.589 
because sometimes drag shots just don't
hit<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:41.639> cod4<00:02:42.180> or<00:02:42.689> 1<00:02:42.930> or<00:02:42.959> 4<00:02:43.200> 3<00:02:43.499> so<00:02:44.040> yeah<00:02:44.939> I<00:02:45.150> mean

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
hit in cod4 or 1 or 4 3 so yeah I mean

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.539 
hit in cod4 or 1 or 4 3 so yeah I mean
I've<00:02:45.780> had<00:02:45.900> some<00:02:46.109> difficulties<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.859> don't<00:02:47.400> know

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
I've had some difficulties I don't know

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.250 
I've had some difficulties I don't know
if<00:02:47.669> I'm<00:02:47.790> going<00:02:47.969> to<00:02:48.239> carry<00:02:48.689> on<00:02:48.780> as<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:48.989> full-time

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
if I'm going to carry on as a full-time

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.890 
if I'm going to carry on as a full-time
sniper<00:02:49.709> or<00:02:50.099> try<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.760> adjust<00:02:50.939> using<00:02:51.599> different

sniper or try to adjust using different

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.780 
sniper or try to adjust using different
weapons<00:02:52.230> or<00:02:52.379> even<00:02:52.650> relearn<00:02:53.219> sniping<00:02:53.699> in<00:02:53.760> the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
weapons or even relearn sniping in the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.819 
weapons or even relearn sniping in the
new<00:02:53.969> game<00:02:54.180> but<00:02:54.750> I've<00:02:55.199> just<00:02:55.439> had<00:02:55.590> some

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
new game but I've just had some

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.069 
new game but I've just had some
difficulties<00:02:56.400> about<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.969> and<00:02:57.150> whenever<00:02:57.750> you

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
difficulties about it and whenever you

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.899 
difficulties about it and whenever you
play<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.409> game<00:02:58.590> just<00:02:59.010> keep<00:02:59.519> in<00:02:59.639> mind<00:02:59.669> that

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
play the game just keep in mind that

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.240 
play the game just keep in mind that
modern<00:03:00.209> 143<00:03:00.659> is<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.900> much<00:03:01.620> faster<00:03:01.829> paced<00:03:02.189> game

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
modern 143 is a much faster paced game

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.420 
modern 143 is a much faster paced game
so<00:03:02.699> if<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.959> do<00:03:04.139> bad<00:03:04.349> don't<00:03:05.040> let<00:03:05.159> that<00:03:05.250> deter

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
so if you do bad don't let that deter

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.550 
so if you do bad don't let that deter
you<00:03:05.609> and<00:03:05.939> also<00:03:06.389> remember<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:06.959> in<00:03:07.169> domination

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
you and also remember that in domination

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.500 
you and also remember that in domination
these<00:03:08.129> spawn<00:03:08.430> points<00:03:08.790> are<00:03:08.909> absolute<00:03:09.329> loop

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
these spawn points are absolute loop
