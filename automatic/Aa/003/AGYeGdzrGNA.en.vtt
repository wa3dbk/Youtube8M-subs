changes have been made since version 1
and<00:00:23.840> I'm<00:00:24.260> going<00:00:24.380> to<00:00:24.410> try<00:00:24.560> and<00:00:24.680> show<00:00:24.830> you<00:00:24.860> them

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
quickly in this video now the main thing

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.599 
quickly in this video now the main thing
I've<00:00:29.480> been<00:00:29.660> trying<00:00:29.990> to<00:00:30.050> get<00:00:30.260> is<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:30.830> focusing

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
I've been trying to get is the focusing

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.840 
I've been trying to get is the focusing
to<00:00:31.850> be<00:00:32.059> a<00:00:32.239> lot<00:00:32.539> faster<00:00:33.020> and<00:00:33.109> smoother<00:00:33.620> so<00:00:34.520> as

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
to be a lot faster and smoother so as

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.819 
to be a lot faster and smoother so as
you<00:00:35.000> can<00:00:35.120> see<00:00:35.180> now<00:00:35.660> as<00:00:35.690> I<00:00:35.989> look<00:00:36.230> at<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.590> bridge

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
you can see now as I look at the bridge

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.549 
you can see now as I look at the bridge
it<00:00:37.129> comes<00:00:37.519> into<00:00:37.760> focus<00:00:38.050> almost<00:00:39.050> immediately

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
it comes into focus almost immediately

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.559 
it comes into focus almost immediately
and<00:00:39.829> my<00:00:40.579> character<00:00:40.969> goes<00:00:41.089> out<00:00:41.239> of<00:00:41.269> focus

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:41.569 
and my character goes out of focus

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:44.200 
and my character goes out of focus
pretty<00:00:42.409> quickly<00:00:42.710> as<00:00:42.890> well<00:00:42.920> and<00:00:43.309> when<00:00:43.879> I<00:00:43.909> turn

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
pretty quickly as well and when I turn

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.209 
pretty quickly as well and when I turn
back<00:00:44.449> to<00:00:44.600> look<00:00:44.629> at<00:00:44.809> the<00:00:44.870> character<00:00:45.319> he<00:00:45.949> comes

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
back to look at the character he comes

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.069 
back to look at the character he comes
in<00:00:46.370> focus<00:00:46.729> instantly<00:00:47.300> and<00:00:47.479> the<00:00:47.569> background

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
in focus instantly and the background

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.239 
in focus instantly and the background
goes<00:00:48.530> out<00:00:48.679> of<00:00:48.710> focus

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:49.249 
goes out of focus

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.789 
goes out of focus
almost<00:00:49.789> immediately<00:00:50.149> now<00:00:51.079> I've<00:00:51.350> added<00:00:51.440> a<00:00:51.620> few

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:51.799 
almost immediately now I've added a few

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:54.479 
almost immediately now I've added a few
extra<00:00:51.859> settings<00:00:52.370> this<00:00:52.999> one<00:00:53.239> is<00:00:53.479> the<00:00:53.749> almost

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
extra settings this one is the almost

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.449 
extra settings this one is the almost
instantaneous<00:00:55.489> setting<00:00:55.969> and<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:57.459> settings

00:00:58.449 --> 00:00:58.459 
instantaneous setting and the settings

00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:02.199 
instantaneous setting and the settings
now<00:00:58.639> just<00:00:59.420> decide<00:00:59.870> how<00:01:00.350> fast<00:01:01.030> objects<00:01:02.030> will

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:02.209 
now just decide how fast objects will

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:05.740 
now just decide how fast objects will
blur<00:01:02.949> so<00:01:03.949> if<00:01:04.159> you<00:01:04.280> set<00:01:04.519> it<00:01:04.549> to<00:01:04.760> be<00:01:04.879> slow<00:01:05.390> they

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
blur so if you set it to be slow they

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.010 
blur so if you set it to be slow they
will<00:01:05.930> blur<00:01:06.320> in<00:01:06.680> slowly<00:01:07.250> however<00:01:07.869> when<00:01:08.869> you

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
will blur in slowly however when you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.380 
will blur in slowly however when you
look<00:01:09.290> at<00:01:09.440> objects<00:01:10.130> they<00:01:10.730> will<00:01:10.760> always<00:01:11.180> come

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
look at objects they will always come

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.600 
look at objects they will always come
into<00:01:11.690> focus<00:01:12.020> quickly<00:01:12.980> so<00:01:13.160> whatever<00:01:13.430> you're

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
into focus quickly so whatever you're

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.970 
into focus quickly so whatever you're
looking<00:01:13.850> at<00:01:14.180> comes<00:01:14.810> into<00:01:15.110> focus<00:01:15.290> immediately

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
looking at comes into focus immediately

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.730 
looking at comes into focus immediately
this<00:01:16.970> will<00:01:17.180> make<00:01:17.360> play<00:01:17.660> in<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.930> game<00:01:18.110> a<00:01:18.320> lot

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
this will make play in the game a lot

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.400 
this will make play in the game a lot
more<00:01:18.770> pleasant<00:01:19.250> it's<00:01:20.180> a<00:01:20.360> lot<00:01:20.780> easier<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:21.170> play

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
more pleasant it's a lot easier to play

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.840 
more pleasant it's a lot easier to play
when<00:01:21.680> whatever<00:01:21.890> you're<00:01:22.160> looking<00:01:22.310> at<00:01:22.550> comes

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
when whatever you're looking at comes

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.300 
when whatever you're looking at comes
into<00:01:23.120> focus<00:01:23.270> immediately<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:24.350> whatever

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
into focus immediately and whatever

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.070 
into focus immediately and whatever
you're<00:01:25.490> not<00:01:25.520> looking<00:01:26.090> at<00:01:26.210> goes<00:01:26.420> out<00:01:26.660> of<00:01:26.690> focus

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
you're not looking at goes out of focus

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.850 
you're not looking at goes out of focus
at<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:28.070> speed<00:01:28.400> you<00:01:28.880> decide<00:01:29.300> and<00:01:29.630> it<00:01:30.320> is<00:01:30.470> a<00:01:30.500> lot

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
at the speed you decide and it is a lot

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.410 
at the speed you decide and it is a lot
faster<00:01:31.310> now<00:01:31.340> I<00:01:32.890> have<00:01:33.890> also<00:01:34.100> removed<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.180> bug

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
faster now I have also removed the bug

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.690 
faster now I have also removed the bug
where<00:01:35.660> if<00:01:35.810> you<00:01:35.930> change<00:01:36.290> depth<00:01:36.700> directions

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
where if you change depth directions

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.680 
where if you change depth directions
quickly<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.510> focus<00:01:38.960> would<00:01:40.180> go<00:01:41.180> all<00:01:41.330> blurry

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
quickly the focus would go all blurry

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.260 
quickly the focus would go all blurry
that's<00:01:42.110> now<00:01:42.380> been<00:01:42.800> fixed<00:01:43.070> as<00:01:43.460> you<00:01:43.670> can<00:01:43.820> see<00:01:44.060> you

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
that's now been fixed as you can see you

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.450 
that's now been fixed as you can see you
can<00:01:44.420> now<00:01:44.570> switch<00:01:44.870> directions<00:01:45.260> without<00:01:45.920> any

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
can now switch directions without any

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.440 
can now switch directions without any
worry<00:01:47.120> of<00:01:47.270> blur

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.980 

now<00:01:51.659> another<00:01:52.380> thing<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.770> have<00:01:52.860> added<00:01:53.159> is

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
now another thing I have added is

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.130 
now another thing I have added is
several<00:01:54.990> static<00:01:55.740> depth-of-field<00:01:56.250> settings

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
several static depth-of-field settings

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.320 
several static depth-of-field settings
now<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.200> vanilla<00:01:58.619> game<00:01:59.070> has<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.400> very<00:01:59.759> slight

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
now the vanilla game has a very slight

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.289 
now the vanilla game has a very slight
depth<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.200> field<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.830> distant<00:02:02.640> mountains<00:02:03.090> it's

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
depth of field on distant mountains it's

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.539 
depth of field on distant mountains it's
very<00:02:03.570> slight<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.920> when<00:02:05.159> you're<00:02:05.310> using

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
very slight but when you're using

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.120 
very slight but when you're using
Dynavision<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.509> focuses<00:02:07.049> wherever<00:02:07.470> you<00:02:07.680> focus

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
Dynavision it focuses wherever you focus

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.620 
Dynavision it focuses wherever you focus
if<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.429> look<00:02:08.610> at<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.759> mountain<00:02:09.209> now<00:02:09.390> it's

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
if you look at the mountain now it's

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.880 
if you look at the mountain now it's
clearly<00:02:10.500> in<00:02:10.619> focus<00:02:10.830> now<00:02:12.050> if<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.290> don't<00:02:13.500> like

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
clearly in focus now if you don't like

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.850 
clearly in focus now if you don't like
the<00:02:14.190> dynamic<00:02:14.430> depth<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.239> field<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:16.500> you'd

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
the dynamic depth of field and you'd

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.250 
the dynamic depth of field and you'd
prefer<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.190> static<00:02:17.790> depth<00:02:18.000> field<00:02:18.330> or<00:02:18.569> if<00:02:19.019> for

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
prefer a static depth field or if for

set low on the distance and you want to

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.849 
set low on the distance and you want to
hide<00:03:15.359> that<00:03:15.570> effect<00:03:15.870> or<00:03:16.019> if<00:03:16.290> you<00:03:16.410> just<00:03:16.620> like

save the game it the dynamic depth of
field<00:04:32.800> on<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.400> then<00:04:33.850> uninstall<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:34.780> mod<00:04:35.020> the

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.200 
scripts are left behind
we<00:04:38.710> found<00:04:39.040> this<00:04:39.220> it's<00:04:39.400> a<00:04:39.490> weakness<00:04:39.910> in<00:04:40.090> the

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
we found this it's a weakness in the

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.420 
we found this it's a weakness in the
game<00:04:40.419> engine<00:04:40.690> there's<00:04:41.140> nothing<00:04:41.710> really<00:04:42.070> I<00:04:42.250> can

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
game engine there's nothing really I can

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.730 
game engine there's nothing really I can
do<00:04:42.520> about<00:04:42.700> it<00:04:42.820> I<00:04:42.970> tried<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.660> put<00:04:43.840> some<00:04:44.110> methods

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
do about it I tried to put some methods

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.920 
do about it I tried to put some methods
of<00:04:44.950> the<00:04:45.160> script<00:04:45.490> detecting<00:04:46.210> and<00:04:46.780> what

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
of the script detecting and what

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.690 
of the script detecting and what
disappeared<00:04:47.440> but<00:04:47.650> they<00:04:47.770> all<00:04:47.950> failed<00:04:48.400> at

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
disappeared but they all failed at

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.080 
disappeared but they all failed at
various<00:04:49.090> points<00:04:49.419> so<00:04:50.230> this<00:04:50.500> option<00:04:50.980> is<00:04:51.160> by<00:04:51.640> far

allows you to reboot the dynamic depth
field<00:05:24.010> if<00:05:24.280> for<00:05:24.729> some<00:05:24.760> reason<00:05:25.570> it<00:05:25.750> stops<00:05:26.380> I<00:05:26.620> know

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
field if for some reason it stops I know

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.250 
field if for some reason it stops I know
a<00:05:26.890> few<00:05:27.310> people<00:05:27.790> had<00:05:28.270> a<00:05:28.300> small<00:05:28.720> problem<00:05:29.229> with

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
a few people had a small problem with

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.100 
a few people had a small problem with
the<00:05:29.470> depth<00:05:29.650> of<00:05:29.800> field<00:05:29.950> suddenly<00:05:30.460> stopping<00:05:30.760> and

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
the depth of field suddenly stopping and

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.020 
the depth of field suddenly stopping and
if<00:05:32.110> it<00:05:32.229> does<00:05:32.410> you<00:05:32.440> can<00:05:32.770> just<00:05:32.979> turn<00:05:33.580> it<00:05:33.700> off<00:05:33.789> and

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
if it does you can just turn it off and

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.920 
if it does you can just turn it off and
then<00:05:34.120> once<00:05:35.110> it's<00:05:35.289> off<00:05:35.440> turn<00:05:36.370> it<00:05:36.550> back<00:05:36.700> on<00:05:36.930> and

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
then once it's off turn it back on and

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:38.850 
then once it's off turn it back on and
after<00:05:38.140> a<00:05:38.350> second

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
after a second

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.700 
after a second
so<00:05:39.099> the<00:05:40.090> depth<00:05:40.300> of<00:05:40.449> field<00:05:40.659> should<00:05:41.259> come<00:05:41.530> back

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
so the depth of field should come back

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.209 
so the depth of field should come back
as<00:05:42.210> before<00:05:43.530> and<00:05:44.530> hopefully<00:05:44.949> that<00:05:45.099> will<00:05:45.159> be

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:45.219 
as before and hopefully that will be

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:47.309 
as before and hopefully that will be
kind<00:05:45.879> of<00:05:45.939> useful<00:05:46.300> for<00:05:46.840> those<00:05:46.930> annoying

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 
kind of useful for those annoying

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:54.839 
kind of useful for those annoying
moments<00:05:50.400> and<00:05:51.840> so<00:05:52.840> that's<00:05:53.050> it<00:05:53.259> for<00:05:53.530> version<00:05:54.189> 1.4

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
moments and so that's it for version 1.4

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:57.779 
moments and so that's it for version 1.4
I<00:05:55.120> am<00:05:55.719> already<00:05:56.620> beginning<00:05:56.919> to<00:05:57.009> think<00:05:57.370> about

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
I am already beginning to think about

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:01.920 
I am already beginning to think about
version<00:05:58.419> 2<00:05:59.020> and<00:06:00.419> some<00:06:01.419> of<00:06:01.509> the<00:06:01.569> things<00:06:01.750> I<00:06:01.870> am

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
version 2 and some of the things I am

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.490 
version 2 and some of the things I am
thinking<00:06:02.379> for<00:06:02.409> version<00:06:02.919> 2<00:06:03.159> are<00:06:03.780> to<00:06:04.780> improve

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
thinking for version 2 are to improve

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.550 
thinking for version 2 are to improve
the<00:06:05.710> speed<00:06:06.069> even<00:06:06.430> more<00:06:06.819> I<00:06:07.060> want<00:06:07.330> the<00:06:07.569> range

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
the speed even more I want the range

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.100 
the speed even more I want the range
detection<00:06:09.250> to<00:06:09.460> be<00:06:09.610> instant<00:06:10.330> and<00:06:10.569> I<00:06:10.659> have<00:06:10.780> a<00:06:10.810> few

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
detection to be instant and I have a few

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.059 
detection to be instant and I have a few
ideas<00:06:11.229> for<00:06:11.800> it<00:06:11.949> I<00:06:12.129> want<00:06:13.120> to<00:06:13.740> find<00:06:14.740> a<00:06:14.860> way<00:06:15.039> to

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:15.069 
ideas for it I want to find a way to

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:17.490 
ideas for it I want to find a way to
make<00:06:15.580> the<00:06:15.729> script<00:06:15.939> update<00:06:16.509> more<00:06:16.779> often<00:06:17.110> so<00:06:17.379> we

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
make the script update more often so we

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.920 
make the script update more often so we
can<00:06:17.650> get<00:06:17.740> even<00:06:18.009> smoother<00:06:18.939> transitions<00:06:19.629> the

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
can get even smoother transitions the

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.929 
can get even smoother transitions the
more<00:06:20.169> often<00:06:20.469> I<00:06:20.560> can<00:06:20.620> get<00:06:20.800> it<00:06:20.889> to<00:06:20.979> update<00:06:21.279> the

00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:21.939 
more often I can get it to update the

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:23.670 
more often I can get it to update the
smoother<00:06:22.479> the<00:06:22.719> transitions<00:06:23.289> can<00:06:23.500> be

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
smoother the transitions can be

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.469 
smoother the transitions can be
obviously<00:06:24.129> I<00:06:24.580> don't<00:06:24.669> want<00:06:24.909> to<00:06:25.090> do<00:06:25.180> it<00:06:25.300> too

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 
obviously I don't want to do it too

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:27.629 
obviously I don't want to do it too
often<00:06:25.689> otherwise<00:06:26.139> it<00:06:26.379> might<00:06:26.710> hit<00:06:27.039> performance

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
often otherwise it might hit performance

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.700 
often otherwise it might hit performance
and<00:06:27.909> currently<00:06:28.599> I've<00:06:28.810> still<00:06:29.110> got<00:06:29.349> it<00:06:29.379> with

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
and currently I've still got it with

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.580 
and currently I've still got it with
zero<00:06:30.479> performance<00:06:31.479> hit<00:06:31.689> which<00:06:31.900> is<00:06:31.930> very<00:06:32.319> nice

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
zero performance hit which is very nice

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.100 
zero performance hit which is very nice
so<00:06:33.400> those<00:06:33.759> are<00:06:33.969> a<00:06:34.029> few<00:06:34.060> of<00:06:34.539> the<00:06:34.599> things<00:06:34.779> I'm

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
so those are a few of the things I'm

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.589 
so those are a few of the things I'm
going<00:06:35.349> to<00:06:35.439> be<00:06:35.529> trying<00:06:35.949> for<00:06:36.069> I'm<00:06:36.969> also<00:06:37.210> looking

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 
going to be trying for I'm also looking

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:39.779 
going to be trying for I'm also looking
into<00:06:38.020> getting<00:06:38.169> some<00:06:38.620> different<00:06:39.189> types<00:06:39.550> of

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789 
into getting some different types of

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:41.429 
into getting some different types of
depth<00:06:40.000> of<00:06:40.180> field<00:06:40.449> I<00:06:40.659> know<00:06:40.779> some<00:06:41.110> people<00:06:41.259> have

00:06:41.429 --> 00:06:41.439 
depth of field I know some people have

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:45.180 
depth of field I know some people have
asked<00:06:41.740> for<00:06:41.919> a<00:06:41.979> more<00:06:43.169> brutal<00:06:44.169> form<00:06:44.800> of<00:06:44.979> depth

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
asked for a more brutal form of depth

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.409 
asked for a more brutal form of depth
field<00:06:45.639> where<00:06:46.800> there's<00:06:47.800> a<00:06:47.860> very<00:06:48.129> narrow<00:06:48.580> depth

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:49.419 
field where there's a very narrow depth

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:52.619 
field where there's a very narrow depth
of<00:06:49.629> focus<00:06:50.110> and<00:06:50.319> I've<00:06:50.919> talked<00:06:51.219> to<00:06:51.460> my<00:06:52.240> good<00:06:52.479> eye

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:52.629 
of focus and I've talked to my good eye

of focus and I've talked to my good eye
that's<00:06:52.960> the<00:06:53.169> other<00:06:53.319> mod<00:06:53.589> offer<00:06:53.800> and<00:06:54.360> we're

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 
that's the other mod offer and we're

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.640 
that's the other mod offer and we're
going<00:06:55.509> to<00:06:55.569> try<00:06:55.779> and<00:06:55.900> come<00:06:56.050> up<00:06:56.080> with<00:06:56.199> something

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
going to try and come up with something

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.860 
going to try and come up with something
but<00:06:56.800> we<00:06:56.949> want<00:06:57.610> to<00:06:57.759> keep<00:06:57.969> something<00:06:58.240> that<00:06:58.509> looks

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:58.870 
but we want to keep something that looks

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.920 
but we want to keep something that looks
vaguely<00:06:59.710> realistic<00:07:00.580> some<00:07:01.330> of<00:07:01.479> these<00:07:01.599> really

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 
vaguely realistic some of these really

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.100 
vaguely realistic some of these really
tight<00:07:02.379> depth<00:07:02.830> of<00:07:03.039> field<00:07:03.539> effects<00:07:04.539> don't<00:07:04.870> look

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
tight depth of field effects don't look

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.709 
tight depth of field effects don't look
very<00:07:05.139> realistic<00:07:05.710> to<00:07:06.219> us<00:07:06.310> so<00:07:06.729> we're<00:07:07.419> not<00:07:07.449> that

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:07.719 
very realistic to us so we're not that

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:09.510 
very realistic to us so we're not that
keen<00:07:07.960> on<00:07:08.199> them<00:07:08.409> so<00:07:08.919> we're<00:07:09.069> going<00:07:09.189> to<00:07:09.250> try<00:07:09.460> and

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 
keen on them so we're going to try and

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.100 
keen on them so we're going to try and
find<00:07:09.729> something<00:07:10.150> that's<00:07:10.449> an<00:07:10.750> in-between

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.110 
find something that's an in-between

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.040 
find something that's an in-between
