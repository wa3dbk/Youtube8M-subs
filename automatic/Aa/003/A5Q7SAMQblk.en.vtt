00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello today i did a little 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.859
 session in the forest where I was picked up 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.599
 So starting this is good carbs 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.280
 you can not make fat with that you can 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.190
 to send you is good 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.199
 and suddenly I took the opportunity to make a 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.230
 little training and ben I'll show you 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.180
 how to do deadlift on a trunk 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.189
 finally it's easy you already know how to do it 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.420
 but I show you for fun like that 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.460
 it will give ideas and it inspires you 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.040
 so here are lifts with a trunk in 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.079
 do the trick that will change is the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.850
 take is not quite the same you 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.620
 bumps a little bit more gray because 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.239
 that sometimes you have a hold not everything to 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.719
 do it the same way that's a little bit 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.370
 the more we will say primitive and tapas the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.629
 same angle also at the level of the arms by 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.610
 report to a bar where you really go 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.250
 to be like that and where you can even do 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.280
 a reversed grip to not roll 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.460
 the bar so here I go like that then 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.410
 I do not care your mouth the trunk he has 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.550
 rained it is wet so it's going there 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.449
 is heavy me it makes me good 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.309
 series so deduced that gives that I do 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.460
 some series in general when I 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.460
 come here 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.700
 so that's the way to train a 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.820
 little when moving whether to trunks or 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.950
 stuff like that 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.979
 even if piles of tree in the garden you 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.850
 can you use it like that so that's it 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.940
 it gave you ideas 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.060
 cool leaves less as we will be more 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.060
 late
