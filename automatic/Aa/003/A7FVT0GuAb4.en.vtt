00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 when the temperature drops the weather cools 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.069
 It's only natural for us to feel the 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.780
 skin or very dry or pulling and 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.820
 There are some little djs I'm going to show. 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.340
 for you who will help you leave your 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.970
 most beautiful skin now also the first 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.920
 tip is nothing super hot bath I 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.900
 I know you're going to want to kill me more 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.789
 this is very important because water 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.320
 it removes a lot of oil 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.080
 natural skin 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.390
 so it's good to avoid another nice tip is 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.579
 nothing to spend too much soap 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.309
 because the soap will also take away the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.260
 natural oiliness from pm, there you are 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.320
 came out of his bath is that little vapor 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.570
 It's hot, it's hot, it's time to 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.390
 to pass the body moisturizer because this 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.670
 Toasty and this little steam will help 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.350
 the cream penetrates better into your skin and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.280
 this other tip I'm sure 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.520
 Are you going to tell me what I already know but drink? 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.129
 water even in winter is very very 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.250
 important people now that our skin 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.979
 does not get so hydrated the water will help 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.150
 So much water owes me a lot. 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.640
 I'm sure you'll notice 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.799
 difference on these colder days 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.840
 our side begins to receive the here 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.850
 to crawl out those pebbles that 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.650
 we feel like staying in the field a 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.930
 tooth but can not 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.970
 I 'm going to give you a tip now. 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.030
 cool that will help to leave your mouth 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.189
 more beautiful and moisturized and without 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.350
 those boring little screens that your mouth is 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.390
 super dry you will apply a 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.390
 powerful lip moisturizer 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.960
 and now a tip so it's for life, huh? 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.300
 the sunscreen 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.070
 sometimes we think only because the sun 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.170
 it's not burning it's not there anymore 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.150
 he is here every day 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.310

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.000
