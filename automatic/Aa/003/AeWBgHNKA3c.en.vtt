however though Arnold Schwarzenegger
didn't<00:03:02.560> want<00:03:02.740> to<00:03:02.830> do<00:03:02.980> any<00:03:03.190> sequels<00:03:03.640> at<00:03:03.760> the

didn't want to do any sequels at the

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.540 
didn't want to do any sequels at the
time<00:03:04.060> he<00:03:04.720> had<00:03:04.840> just<00:03:05.080> come<00:03:05.230> off<00:03:05.260> doing<00:03:05.800> Conan

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
time he had just come off doing Conan

time he had just come off doing Conan
the<00:03:06.970> sequel<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.600> it<00:03:07.810> didn't<00:03:08.050> really<00:03:08.170> go<00:03:08.260> over

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
the sequel and it didn't really go over

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.960 
the sequel and it didn't really go over
well<00:03:08.710> so<00:03:08.920> we<00:03:08.980> didn't<00:03:09.190> want<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.430> jump<00:03:09.580> into<00:03:09.760> this

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
well so we didn't want to jump into this

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.880 
well so we didn't want to jump into this
because<00:03:10.720> he's<00:03:10.870> worried<00:03:11.080> about<00:03:11.140> box<00:03:11.530> office

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
because he's worried about box office

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.040 
because he's worried about box office
results<00:03:12.010> so<00:03:12.880> instead<00:03:13.300> what<00:03:13.570> they<00:03:13.720> did<00:03:13.870> is<00:03:13.990> they

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
results so instead what they did is they

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.870 
results so instead what they did is they
took<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.590> movie<00:03:14.770> that<00:03:15.250> they<00:03:15.370> were<00:03:15.430> going<00:03:15.760> to
