these<00:02:21.209> are<00:02:21.420> fine<00:02:21.720> cast<00:02:22.580> which<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.819> nice

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
these are fine cast which is a nice

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.070 
these are fine cast which is a nice
feature<00:02:24.569> fine<00:02:25.050> cast<00:02:25.410> tends<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.510> not<00:02:27.510> break<00:02:27.840> as

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
feature fine cast tends to not break as

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.830 
feature fine cast tends to not break as
easily<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.739> it's<00:02:28.890> not<00:02:29.069> as<00:02:29.250> heavy<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.940> I

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
easily and it's not as heavy and I

the game this guy is a hawk lund rifle
which<00:02:56.069> can<00:02:56.430> pick<00:02:57.030> out<00:02:57.209> characters<00:02:57.989> in<00:02:58.200> an

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
which can pick out characters in an

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.120 
which can pick out characters in an
enemy<00:02:58.650> unit<00:02:59.299> all<00:03:00.299> right<00:03:00.870> here<00:03:01.799> you<00:03:01.830> have<00:03:01.950> a

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
enemy unit all right here you have a

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.400 
enemy unit all right here you have a
lumen<00:03:02.549> arc<00:03:02.700> this<00:03:03.450> one<00:03:03.690> happens<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.290> be

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
lumen arc this one happens to be

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.580 
lumen arc this one happens to be
magnetized<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.959> also<00:03:07.170> makes<00:03:07.500> a

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
magnetized so that also makes a

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.870 
magnetized so that also makes a
hurricane<00:03:07.980> um<00:03:08.100> but<00:03:08.190> I'm<00:03:08.280> not<00:03:08.459> going<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.670> show

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
know this guy's a little magnet and it's

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.900 
know this guy's a little magnet and it's
foot<00:03:12.600> this<00:03:12.900> guy<00:03:13.079> magnetizes<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.489> carriage

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
foot this guy magnetizes the carriage

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.640 
foot this guy magnetizes the carriage
flips<00:03:15.269> around<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.780> then<00:03:15.930> he<00:03:16.049> switched<00:03:16.410> the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
flips around and then he switched the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.569 
flips around and then he switched the
machine<00:03:17.340> up<00:03:17.790> top<00:03:18.329> so<00:03:18.660> let's<00:03:18.959> give<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.709> 360

closer<00:03:31.980> look<00:03:33.049> in<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.230> model<00:03:34.590> by<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.070> way<00:03:35.190> this

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
closer look in the model by the way this

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.789 
closer look in the model by the way this
model<00:03:35.730> is<00:03:36.000> by<00:03:36.120> Games<00:03:36.390> Workshop<00:03:36.540> for<00:03:37.470> its

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
model is by Games Workshop for its

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.530 
model is by Games Workshop for its
Warhammer<00:03:38.459> Fantasy<00:03:38.959> game<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.940> it<00:03:41.940> makes<00:03:42.269> a

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
Warhammer Fantasy game and it makes a

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.099 
Warhammer Fantasy game and it makes a
lumen<00:03:43.470> Ark<00:03:43.650> which<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.430> what<00:03:44.609> this<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:44.959> which<00:03:45.959> is

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
lumen Ark which is what this is which is

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.259 
lumen Ark which is what this is which is
kind<00:03:46.320> of<00:03:46.350> like<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.530> laser<00:03:46.890> cannon<00:03:47.370> in<00:03:47.760> Warhammer

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
kind of like a laser cannon in Warhammer

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.170 
kind of like a laser cannon in Warhammer
Fantasy<00:03:48.480> it<00:03:48.840> shoots<00:03:49.140> this<00:03:49.519> beam<00:03:50.519> of<00:03:50.730> light<00:03:50.970> and

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
Fantasy it shoots this beam of light and

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.099 
Fantasy it shoots this beam of light and
has<00:03:51.359> some<00:03:51.540> other<00:03:51.720> abilities<00:03:52.290> too<00:03:54.109> quite

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
has some other abilities too quite

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.870 
has some other abilities too quite
frankly<00:03:55.440> I<00:03:55.530> would<00:03:55.709> take<00:03:55.859> one<00:03:56.069> of<00:03:56.190> each<00:03:56.370> in<00:03:56.400> any

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
frankly I would take one of each in any

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.250 
frankly I would take one of each in any
empire<00:03:57.390> army<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.910> so<00:03:59.910> one<00:04:00.150> kit<00:04:00.420> makes<00:04:00.690> both<00:04:00.989> I

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
empire army and so one kit makes both I

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.650 
empire army and so one kit makes both I
think<00:04:01.290> it<00:04:01.590> retails<00:04:02.010> for<00:04:02.130> about<00:04:02.359> fifty<00:04:03.359> maybe

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
think it retails for about fifty maybe

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.400 
think it retails for about fifty maybe
fifty<00:04:04.139> seven<00:04:04.709> dollars<00:04:06.079> definitely<00:04:07.079> well

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
fifty seven dollars definitely well

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.559 
fifty seven dollars definitely well
worth<00:04:07.440> it<00:04:07.920> it's<00:04:08.100> extremely<00:04:09.030> well<00:04:09.209> sculpted

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
worth it it's extremely well sculpted

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.530 
worth it it's extremely well sculpted
with<00:04:09.959> tons<00:04:10.319> and<00:04:10.709> tons<00:04:10.790> and<00:04:11.790> tons<00:04:11.880> of<00:04:12.299> options

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
with tons and tons and tons of options
