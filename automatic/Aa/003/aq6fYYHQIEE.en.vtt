a technique that typically requires the

post-production<00:00:49.720> in<00:00:50.559> this<00:00:50.800> case<00:00:51.040> we<00:00:51.370> have

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
post-production in this case we have

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.340 
post-production in this case we have
chips<00:00:51.820> within<00:00:52.239> the<00:00:52.329> camera<00:00:52.600> that<00:00:52.960> can<00:00:53.079> process

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
chips within the camera that can process

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.819 
chips within the camera that can process
the<00:00:53.770> image<00:00:54.010> in<00:00:54.160> real<00:00:54.370> time

the image in real time

so<00:00:55.429> not<00:00:55.640> only<00:00:55.789> can<00:00:55.969> we<00:00:56.469> record<00:00:57.469> in

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
so not only can we record in

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.170 
so not only can we record in

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
how can i use it it's not something that

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.010 
how can i use it it's not something that
I<00:01:10.310> can<00:01:10.460> broadcast<00:01:10.729> right<00:01:11.479> now<00:01:11.690> that<00:01:11.900> this

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
I can broadcast right now that this

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.560 
I can broadcast right now that this
broadcast<00:01:12.590> stations<00:01:12.979> go<00:01:13.130> through<00:01:13.340> four

in<00:01:14.930> this<00:01:15.140> case<00:01:15.640> typically<00:01:16.640> would<00:01:17.150> report<00:01:17.810> in

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
in this case typically would report in

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.010 
in this case typically would report in
4k<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:18.860> probably<00:01:19.520> there's<00:01:20.330> some<00:01:20.540> sort<00:01:20.810> of

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
4k and probably there's some sort of

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.040 
4k and probably there's some sort of

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
the nice thing with a 4k images

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.160 
the nice thing with a 4k images
in<00:01:28.440> it

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
in it

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.789 
in it
choose<00:01:31.960> high-definition<00:01:32.960> portions<00:01:33.470> of<00:01:33.619> the

later<00:01:34.780> on<00:01:34.990> so<00:01:35.200> in<00:01:35.320> post-production<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:36.730> can

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
later on so in post-production you can

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.660 
later on so in post-production you can

interchangeable lenses based on the same
body<00:02:31.109> is<00:02:31.409> this<00:02:31.680> but<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.519> uses<00:02:32.670> interchangeable

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
body is this but it uses interchangeable

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.080 
body is this but it uses interchangeable
lenses<00:02:33.870> on<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.200> larger<00:02:34.709> imager<00:02:35.159> a<00:02:35.189> one<00:02:35.579> and<00:02:35.849> a

lenses on a larger imager a one and a
quarter<00:02:36.389> inch<00:02:36.810> integer<00:02:37.379> so<00:02:37.950> if<00:02:38.040> you're

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
quarter inch integer so if you're

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.789 
quarter inch integer so if you're
looking<00:02:38.280> for<00:02:38.459> shallow<00:02:38.879> depth<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.359> field<00:02:39.799> the

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
looking for shallow depth of field the

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.149 
looking for shallow depth of field the
more<00:02:41.299> cinematography<00:02:42.299> type<00:02:42.599> of<00:02:42.959> images<00:02:43.620> you

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
more cinematography type of images you

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.300 
more cinematography type of images you
would<00:02:44.340> probably<00:02:44.790> choose<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.299> camera

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
would probably choose that camera

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.490 
would probably choose that camera
it<00:02:46.610> has<00:02:46.760> interchangeable<00:02:47.120> lenses<00:02:48.020> so<00:02:48.290> that

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
it has interchangeable lenses so that

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.200 
it has interchangeable lenses so that
you<00:02:48.620> can<00:02:48.770> slide<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.430> lens<00:02:50.150> of<00:02:50.300> your<00:02:50.480> choice

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
you can slide the lens of your choice

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.930 
you can slide the lens of your choice
so<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:52.020> is<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.200> prototype<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.430> larger

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
so this is a prototype of the larger

imager<00:02:54.600> camera<00:02:55.110> uses<00:02:55.500> interchangeable
