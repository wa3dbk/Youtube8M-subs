00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
doing is sort of making a little tube

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.160 
doing is sort of making a little tube
that's<00:01:18.930> why<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.229> called<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.470> cord<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:21.170> here

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
that's why it's called a cord and here

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.810 
that's why it's called a cord and here
it<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.320> again<00:01:22.650> there's<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.130> yarn<00:01:23.340> coming<00:01:23.670> from

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820

it is again there's the yarn coming from
that<00:01:23.970> fourth<00:01:24.270> side<00:01:25.460> you're<00:01:26.460> going<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:27.140> pull<00:01:28.140> it

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
that fourth side you're going to pull it

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.050 
that fourth side you're going to pull it
tight<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.829> when<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.100> knit<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.850> first

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
tight here when you knit the first

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.630 
tight here when you knit the first
stitch<00:01:30.270> which<00:01:31.200> then<00:01:31.470> sort<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.799> pulls<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.520> back

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
stitch which then sort of pulls the back

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.940 
stitch which then sort of pulls the back
together<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.270> makes<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.540> round<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.740> I

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
together and makes it round and the I

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.060 
together and makes it round and the I
and<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.700> cord<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.570> short<00:01:36.840> for<00:01:37.079> idiot<00:01:37.590> which<00:01:37.890> is

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and I cord is short for idiot which is

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.010 
and I cord is short for idiot which is
no<00:01:38.430> longer<00:01:38.909> really<00:01:39.619> proved<00:01:41.180> terminology<00:01:42.180> but

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
no longer really proved terminology but

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.469 
no longer really proved terminology but
the<00:01:43.200> idea<00:01:43.649> behind<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.189> idiot<00:01:44.729> cord<00:01:45.000> was<00:01:45.270> that

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
the idea behind the idiot cord was that

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.499 
the idea behind the idiot cord was that
this<00:01:45.899> was<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.380> simple<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.759> anyone<00:01:48.360> could

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
this was so simple that anyone could

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.600 
this was so simple that anyone could
learn<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.619> confusing<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.369> don't

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
learn it so if it's confusing you don't

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.690 
learn it so if it's confusing you don't
worry<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:51.149> practice<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.840> will<00:01:51.960> get<00:01:52.170> it

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
worry just practice you will get it

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.690 
worry just practice you will get it
finish<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.880> row<00:01:54.030> slide<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.990> down<00:01:55.280> I'm<00:01:56.280> showing

finish the row slide it down I'm showing
you<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:56.909> bulky<00:01:57.240> yarn<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.869> could<00:01:58.049> use<00:01:58.200> any

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you on bulky yarn but you could use any

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.160 
you on bulky yarn but you could use any
size<00:01:58.710> yarn<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.610> really<00:02:00.600> any<00:02:00.780> number<00:02:01.049> of

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
size yarn and really any number of

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.480 
size yarn and really any number of
stitches<00:02:01.350> up<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> point

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
stitches up to a point

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.880 
stitches up to a point
smaller<00:02:02.939> numbers<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.390> stitches<00:02:03.869> are<00:02:04.140> what<00:02:04.770> we

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
smaller numbers of stitches are what we

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.229 
smaller numbers of stitches are what we
usually<00:02:05.100> see<00:02:06.320> so<00:02:07.320> that's<00:02:07.500> an<00:02:07.619> i-cord<00:02:08.239> there's

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
usually see so that's an i-cord there's

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.419 
usually see so that's an i-cord there's
the<00:02:09.420> back

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
the back

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.539 
the back
there's<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.450> front<00:02:11.689> it's<00:02:11.989> nice<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.349> round
