00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
would have to work on those games from

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.530 
would have to work on those games from
scratch<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.009> they<00:01:38.310> had<00:01:38.430> an<00:01:38.520> idea<00:01:38.640> where<00:01:39.119> they

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
scratch so they had an idea where they

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.210 
scratch so they had an idea where they
can<00:01:39.689> make<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> platform<00:01:40.500> where<00:01:40.650> they<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.100> make

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
can make a platform where they can make

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.219 
can make a platform where they can make
all<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.610> content<00:01:41.880> live<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.659> which<00:01:42.930> would<00:01:43.110> be

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
all that content live in which would be

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.319 
all that content live in which would be
disney<00:01:43.649> infinity<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:44.820> there's<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> new

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
disney infinity so if there's like a new

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.880 
disney infinity so if there's like a new
disney<00:01:45.689> movie<00:01:45.960> coming<00:01:46.170> out<00:01:46.320> they<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.860> just

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
disney movie coming out they can just

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.380 
disney movie coming out they can just
make<00:01:47.159> some<00:01:47.310> new<00:01:47.430> characters<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.090> somebody

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
make some new characters and somebody

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.690 
make some new characters and somebody
playsets<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.079> put<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.680> into<00:01:49.890> disney<00:01:50.310> infinity

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
playsets and put it into disney infinity

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.880 
playsets and put it into disney infinity
instead<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.329> making<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.990> whole<00:01:52.320> brand<00:01:52.710> new

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
instead of making the whole brand new

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.069 
instead of making the whole brand new
games<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.700> maybe<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.210> will<00:01:54.420> actually<00:01:54.630> happen

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
games so maybe this will actually happen

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.300 
games so maybe this will actually happen
i<00:01:55.320> guess<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.590> will<00:01:55.649> depend<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:56.130> how<00:01:56.280> well

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
i guess it will depend on how well

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.520 
i guess it will depend on how well
disney<00:01:57.030> infinity<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.540> received<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.140> how<00:01:58.290> well

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
disney infinity is received and how well

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.649 
disney infinity is received and how well
it<00:01:58.649> sells<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.219> if<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.790> doesn't<00:02:00.149> sell<00:02:00.299> well<00:02:00.540> i

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
it sells and if it doesn't sell well i

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.789 
it sells and if it doesn't sell well i
guess<00:02:00.899> maybe<00:02:01.110> they'll<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.320> go<00:02:01.530> back<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
guess maybe they'll just go back to

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.649 
guess maybe they'll just go back to
their<00:02:01.920> old<00:02:02.040> ways<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.610> next<00:02:02.939> office<00:02:03.479> that

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
