00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.250
 I recently realized that steelseries siberia v2 came out as much as five years ago and it’s up to 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.710
 so far one of the most popular headsets in the world in 2015 is 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.539
 change because stella release as many as four new models the most 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.630
 available from them steelseries siberia rouy prism 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.920
 look at her 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.120
 headphones are completely made of plastic, so such lightweight plastic is not the most 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.170
 cool but the youngest model in the line of premium materials and there will be no 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.430
 no metals but the design looks reliable this is the only model in 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.600
 lineup which has no floating headband design 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.820
 regulated as standard and in stock 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.600
 not bad lining fabric and inside apparently foam rubber ear cushions are the same 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.500
 and they are easy to take off in order to do this, I often have to do it because 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.850
 them very much so practical color we generally look like a combination of white and gray 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.310
 very cool bowls are regulated soft cushions but after a couple of hours I 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.580
 I'm starting to feel discomfort right here in the jaw area 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.740
 the pressure is slight but it is felt so much so that is direct super comfort 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.630
 promised in a press release there is no but about the breathing bowls did not lie ears and 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.460
 really do not sweat me well, can it we will sweat but now in winter there is no wire 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.350
 white and most likely it will quickly get dirty it is hard without braiding and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.590
 ends and the sd adapter is good because the headset becomes 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.159
 multiplatform that is, you can connect to it and to the computer and to the consoles but 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.200
 along the street you are with them like me keep in mind that uizbi headphones if u 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.120
 you are not grounded sockets can make such a sound 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.720
 unpleasant 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.869
 microphone as usual in the left ear but not taken out some kind of taken in the lineup 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.140
 Cyberia is this pip it is a microphone 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.160
 omnidirectional and your voice is well heard here for example now you hear 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.170
 the voice is recorded and it is on this microphone that the microphone button is on 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.870
 all the same ear when you press you will hear a signal 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.150
 two short microphones are turned off one long one is on and the backlight is on 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.620
 you can choose any color you like or run colors in a circle 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.970
 Moreover, it can be either a cold color of growth types blu or warm as in heat 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.370
 orange or just cut it out and if you don’t 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.450
 like it is done in the software of steelseries engine 3 except settings 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.049
 Highlights here have an equalizer and several presets to it as well 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.860
 voice enhancement functions on the left with better audible you can create 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.890
 your personal profiles and then switch between them 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.150
 the sound here is in the best traditions of saiberia good frequency balance 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.430
 nice bass clean tops and crisp averages perfect positioning in 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.329
 Country music is very well heard by the enemy, even if it is located through two walls 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.440
 from you you very clearly understand where someone is and which way goes to 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.000
 maps such as nuke are easy to understand from above the enemy or from below in dota too 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.410
 very well heard through the half-map where where what table who use where who 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.670
 teleports and so on here without any questions at all and the music sounds in them 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.489
 not bad but if something you always have an equalizer 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.670
 So we have a kind of budget headphones that have everything ok with sound with 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.400
 software and microphone plus a modest but trendy design and light 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.390
 so that there is a version with the usual my jack so that you can walk down the street 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.410
 more different bright colors there will be a fire on it all with you
