00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.550 
now this basically makes you spawn
midair<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.689> you<00:02:03.689> just<00:02:03.869> basically<00:02:04.049> start

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
midair and you just basically start

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.069 
midair and you just basically start
skydiving<00:02:05.130> down<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.540> have<00:02:06.659> no<00:02:06.869> way<00:02:07.020> to

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
skydiving down and you have no way to

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.979 
skydiving down and you have no way to
use<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.770> parachute<00:02:08.459> pretty<00:02:09.209> much<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.539> only<00:02:09.569> way

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
use a parachute pretty much the only way

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.559 
use a parachute pretty much the only way
to<00:02:10.050> survive<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.890> by<00:02:11.489> pressing<00:02:11.849> forward<00:02:12.150> on<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
to survive is by pressing forward on the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.130 
to survive is by pressing forward on the
left

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
left

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.010 
left
log<00:02:13.290> stick<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.770> hitting<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.280> wall<00:02:14.580> or<00:02:15.020> the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
log stick and hitting a wall or the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.430 
log stick and hitting a wall or the
ground<00:02:16.319> head-on<00:02:17.300> but<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:18.360> mean<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.810> don't

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
ground head-on but I mean you don't

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.080 
ground head-on but I mean you don't
really<00:02:19.620> want<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:19.920> survive<00:02:20.190> doing<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.670> but<00:02:21.030> a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
really want to survive doing that but a

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.699 
really want to survive doing that but a
number<00:02:21.360> for<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.569> is<00:02:23.360> 1997<00:02:25.100> 593<00:02:26.780> 255<00:02:27.780> now<00:02:28.650> if

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
number for that is 1997 593 255 now if

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.980 
number for that is 1997 593 255 now if
you'd<00:02:28.830> like<00:02:28.980> slow<00:02:29.370> motion<00:02:29.400> aim<00:02:29.970> all<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.810> need

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
you'd like slow motion aim all you need

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.020 
you'd like slow motion aim all you need
to<00:02:31.020> do<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.470> call<00:02:32.040> one<00:02:32.310> trouble<00:02:32.880> 933<00:02:33.890> 23<00:02:35.030> 393

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
to do is call one trouble 933 23 393

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.820 
to do is call one trouble 933 23 393
that's<00:02:36.510> basically<00:02:36.810> dead<00:02:37.110> i<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.709> will

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
that's basically dead i and that will

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.610 
that's basically dead i and that will
help<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.190> in<00:02:38.370> most<00:02:39.000> situations<00:02:39.500> because<00:02:40.500> it's

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
help you in most situations because it's

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.960 
help you in most situations because it's
basically<00:02:41.100> four<00:02:41.670> times<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:43.550> for<00:02:44.550> increased

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
basically four times and for increased

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.199 
basically four times and for increased
effect<00:02:45.330> is<00:02:45.830> it<00:02:46.830> is<00:02:47.130> hard<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.489> explain<00:02:47.790> but<00:02:48.060> it's

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
effect is it is hard to explain but it's

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.570 
effect is it is hard to explain but it's
really<00:02:48.480> really<00:02:48.780> good<00:02:49.170> especially<00:02:49.500> in<00:02:50.280> extra
