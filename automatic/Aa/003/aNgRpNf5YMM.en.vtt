00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:01.149 

this<00:01:52.049> wants<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.469> go

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.399 

and<00:02:01.670> unfortunately<00:02:02.210> there's<00:02:03.079> going<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:03.289> be<00:02:03.319> a

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
and unfortunately there's going to be a

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.440 
and unfortunately there's going to be a
bunch<00:02:03.679> of<00:02:03.829> cars<00:02:04.100> in<00:02:04.249> front<00:02:04.460> of<00:02:04.640> us<00:02:04.789> getting<00:02:05.359> on

what i'm using the the drift innovation
external<00:03:22.760> mic<00:03:23.000> i<00:03:23.270> bought<00:03:23.480> separately<00:03:24.230> for<00:03:24.470> the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
external mic i bought separately for the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.800 
external mic i bought separately for the
camera<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.700> i<00:03:25.760> just<00:03:25.970> got<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.120> mounted<00:03:26.630> right

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
camera and i just got a mounted right

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
camera and i just got a mounted right
under<00:03:27.050> right<00:03:27.260> underneath<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:29.050> that<00:03:30.050> like<00:03:30.680> the

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
under right underneath the that like the

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.470 
under right underneath the that like the
wind<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:33.160> little<00:03:34.160> elastic<00:03:34.580> piece<00:03:35.090> underneath

wind a little elastic piece underneath

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.600 
wind a little elastic piece underneath
your<00:03:35.750> chin<00:03:36.050> to<00:03:36.320> prevent<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.160> wind<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.580> one

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
your chin to prevent the wind and one

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.470 
your chin to prevent the wind and one
