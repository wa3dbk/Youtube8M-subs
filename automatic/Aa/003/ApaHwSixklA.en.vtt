00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.900 
now in this moment aluminium is the most
popular<00:01:49.650> because<00:01:50.510> it's<00:01:51.510> very<00:01:51.750> light<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.910> it's

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
popular because it's very light and it's

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.290 
popular because it's very light and it's
not<00:01:54.120> too<00:01:54.390> expensive<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:55.260> say<00:01:56.010> here<00:01:56.280> we<00:01:56.670> only

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
not too expensive you say here we only

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.219 
not too expensive you say here we only
point<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.590> frame<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.940> now<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.360> for<00:02:00.869> America

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
point the frame this now is for America

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.680 
point the frame this now is for America
if<00:02:01.440> you<00:02:02.190> want<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.759> still<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.270> little<00:02:03.509> bit

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
if you want to have still a little bit

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.609 
if you want to have still a little bit
the<00:02:03.810> steel<00:02:04.080> no<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:05.130> that's<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.940> special<00:02:06.150> sizes

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
the steel no so that's a special sizes

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.680 
the steel no so that's a special sizes
for<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.650> steel<00:02:07.950> frame<00:02:08.100> so<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:09.240> see<00:02:09.420> we<00:02:09.540> can

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
for a steel frame so you can see we can

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.600 
for a steel frame so you can see we can
change<00:02:09.990> everything<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:11.160> now<00:02:11.310> you're<00:02:11.490> going

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
change everything and now you're going

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.670 
change everything and now you're going
to<00:02:11.700> point<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.300> then<00:02:12.690> after<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.350> bracelet

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
to point it and then after the bracelet

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.070 
to point it and then after the bracelet
together<00:02:14.300> what<00:02:15.300> percentage<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.840> still

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
together what percentage is still

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.220 
together what percentage is still
friends<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.500> make<00:02:17.209> less<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.240> less<00:02:18.510> oh<00:02:18.780> yeah

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
friends you make less and less oh yeah

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.060 
friends you make less and less oh yeah
maybe<00:02:20.930> five<00:02:21.930> or<00:02:22.140> ten<00:02:22.440> percent<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.950> the

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
maybe five or ten percent of the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.460 
maybe five or ten percent of the
production<00:02:23.280> really<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.480> steel

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
production really is a steel

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.460 
production really is a steel
all<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.280> rest<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:27.200> aluminum<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.380> titanium

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
all the rest is aluminum and titanium

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.490 
all the rest is aluminum and titanium
the<00:02:29.340> time<00:02:29.820> is<00:02:30.030> it's<00:02:30.930> not<00:02:31.080> lighter<00:02:31.320> than

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
the time is it's not lighter than

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.410 
the time is it's not lighter than
aluminum<00:02:31.590> which<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.010> much<00:02:32.310> stiffer<00:02:32.550> yeah<00:02:33.060> it's

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
aluminum which is much stiffer yeah it's

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.220 
aluminum which is much stiffer yeah it's
much<00:02:33.600> different<00:02:35.540> standing<00:02:36.540> frame<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:36.959> have

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
much different standing frame you have

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.199 
much different standing frame you have
it<00:02:37.350> for<00:02:37.560> your<00:02:37.920> life<00:02:38.070> whatever<00:02:38.850> what<00:02:39.060> do<00:02:39.120> you

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
it for your life whatever what do you

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.690 
it for your life whatever what do you
think<00:02:39.390> about<00:02:39.480> mixing<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.739> materials<00:02:41.310> like

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
think about mixing of materials like

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.250 
think about mixing of materials like
using<00:02:42.060> some<00:02:42.300> thirteen<00:02:42.630> because<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.930> see<00:02:43.080> there

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
using some thirteen because I see there

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.289 
using some thirteen because I see there
you<00:02:43.350> use<00:02:43.530> carbon<00:02:44.310> fiber<00:02:44.519> in<00:02:44.640> Alameda<00:02:45.030> what

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
you use carbon fiber in Alameda what

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.410 
you use carbon fiber in Alameda what
about<00:02:45.540> one<00:02:46.230> containing<00:02:46.830> tube<00:02:47.459> with<00:02:48.000> caramel

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
about one containing tube with caramel

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.850 
about one containing tube with caramel
and<00:02:48.480> William<00:02:48.810> where<00:02:49.970> you<00:02:50.970> don't<00:02:51.150> like<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.390> I

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
and William where you don't like that I

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.940 
and William where you don't like that I
prefer<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:52.920> with<00:02:53.690> all<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.930> frame<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.709> same

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
prefer it with all the frame the same

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.250 
prefer it with all the frame the same
the<00:02:56.130> same<00:02:56.340> yeah<00:02:56.760> because<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.750> materials<00:02:58.170> are

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
the same yeah because the materials are

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.770 
the same yeah because the materials are
working<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.860> not<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.850> same<00:03:00.060> thing<00:03:00.390> now<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:00.750> I

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
working the not the same thing now so I

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.130 
working the not the same thing now so I
think<00:03:01.110> it's<00:03:01.320> better<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.739> have<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.989> all<00:03:03.989> the

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
think it's better to have the all the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.400 
think it's better to have the all the
materials<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.650> same<00:03:04.860> but<00:03:06.019> you<00:03:07.019> going<00:03:07.230> with

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
materials the same but you going with

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.229 
materials the same but you going with
the<00:03:07.560> click<00:03:07.980> with<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.160> market<00:03:08.519> yeah<00:03:08.670> yeah<00:03:09.000> yeah

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
the click with the market yeah yeah yeah

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.720 
the click with the market yeah yeah yeah
yeah<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.630> show<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.290> will<00:03:10.530> make<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.950> depending

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
yeah I show you will make the depending

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.720 
yeah I show you will make the depending
that's<00:03:12.560> still<00:03:13.560> very<00:03:13.799> much<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.070> traditionalist

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
that's still very much a traditionalist

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.710 
that's still very much a traditionalist
now<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.150> paint<00:03:15.540> shop<00:03:16.820> but<00:03:17.820> before<00:03:18.209> we<00:03:18.660> start

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
now the paint shop but before we start

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.860 
now the paint shop but before we start
painting<00:03:19.440> we<00:03:20.840> we<00:03:21.840> put<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.590> frames<00:03:22.860> in

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
painting we we put the frames in

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.420 
painting we we put the frames in
different<00:03:24.870> baths<00:03:25.049> for<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.620> anti-corrosion

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
different baths for the anti-corrosion

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.190 
different baths for the anti-corrosion
protection<00:03:27.239> for<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.720> frame<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:28.170> that

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
protection for the frame is that

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.340 
protection for the frame is that
important<00:03:28.769> for

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
important for

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.380 
important for
yes<00:03:31.350> yeah

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
yes yeah

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.410 
yes yeah
then<00:03:33.390> here<00:03:33.540> first<00:03:33.840> here<00:03:34.020> we<00:03:34.200> put<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.410> primer<00:03:35.420> and

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
then here first here we put a primer and

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.140 
then here first here we put a primer and
then<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.930> then<00:03:37.310> we<00:03:38.310> start<00:03:38.580> paying<00:03:38.819> the<00:03:38.910> first

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
then and then we start paying the first

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.840 
then and then we start paying the first
four<00:03:39.990> score<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.560> then<00:03:41.280> after<00:03:41.580> they<00:03:41.670> put

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
four score and then after they put

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.080 
four score and then after they put
decals<00:03:42.050> on<00:03:43.050> like<00:03:43.800> this<00:03:43.950> see<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.790> different

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
decals on like this see the different

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.050 
decals on like this see the different
decals<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.870> then<00:03:46.680> they<00:03:46.800> start<00:03:47.069> painting<00:03:47.640> the

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
decals and then they start painting the

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.190 
decals and then they start painting the
different<00:03:48.330> colors

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.589 

five

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.559 

that<00:03:55.319> may<00:03:55.530> never<00:03:56.040> do<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.430> same<00:03:56.640> there<00:03:57.359> are<00:03:57.390> two

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
that may never do the same there are two

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.160 
that may never do the same there are two
the<00:03:57.659> same<00:03:58.189> and<00:03:59.189> that's<00:03:59.519> then<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.989> finished<00:04:00.989> bike

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
the same and that's then a finished bike

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.599 
the same and that's then a finished bike
so<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:02.040> blue<00:04:02.900> you<00:04:03.900> have<00:04:03.959> silver<00:04:04.769> you<00:04:05.489> have

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
so the blue you have silver you have

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.390 
so the blue you have silver you have
white<00:04:05.879> and<00:04:06.689> you<00:04:06.749> have<00:04:06.810> orange<00:04:07.200> color<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:08.249> then

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
white and you have orange color and then

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.619 
white and you have orange color and then
you<00:04:08.489> have<00:04:08.519> clear<00:04:09.889> then<00:04:10.889> the<00:04:11.340> decals<00:04:12.030> there's
