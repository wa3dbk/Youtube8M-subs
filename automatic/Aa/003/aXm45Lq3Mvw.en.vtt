00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.990 
which is sort of a dark brown and this
is<00:01:07.940> like<00:01:08.210> a<00:01:08.240> comparative<00:01:08.960> review<00:01:09.170> I<00:01:10.000> needed

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
is like a comparative review I needed

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.780 
is like a comparative review I needed
one<00:01:11.180> in<00:01:11.360> black<00:01:11.710> and<00:01:12.710> I<00:01:12.860> needed<00:01:13.190> something<00:01:13.490> that

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
one in black and I needed something that

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.910 
one in black and I needed something that
wasn't<00:01:14.120> as<00:01:14.240> expensive<00:01:14.570> as<00:01:15.200> being<00:01:15.620> a<00:01:15.710> Bobby

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
wasn't as expensive as being a Bobby

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.130 
wasn't as expensive as being a Bobby
Brown

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
Brown

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.690 
Brown
so<00:01:18.140> I<00:01:18.880> got<00:01:19.880> this<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:21.070> it<00:01:22.070> comes<00:01:22.280> with<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.490> brush

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
so I got this and it comes with a brush

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.460 
so I got this and it comes with a brush
and<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.660> brush<00:01:23.960> is<00:01:24.259> just<00:01:25.009> great<00:01:25.790> because<00:01:26.720> the

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
and the brush is just great because the

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.749 
and the brush is just great because the
lines<00:01:27.710> of<00:01:28.040> make<00:01:28.250> is<00:01:29.240> releasing<00:01:30.369> perfect<00:01:31.369> for

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
lines of make is releasing perfect for

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.580 
lines of make is releasing perfect for
position

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
position

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.620 
position
and<00:01:36.729> what<00:01:37.729> I<00:01:37.759> can<00:01:38.000> say<00:01:38.149> is<00:01:38.299> it's<00:01:38.530> much<00:01:39.549> thinner

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
and what I can say is it's much thinner

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.770 
and what I can say is it's much thinner
than<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.929> Bobby<00:01:42.200> Brown<00:01:42.469> gel<00:01:43.429> liner<00:01:43.670> brush<00:01:44.030> so

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
than the Bobby Brown gel liner brush so

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.870 
than the Bobby Brown gel liner brush so
it<00:01:44.869> doesn't<00:01:45.200> look<00:01:45.319> like<00:01:45.560> that

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.910 

make<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:50.299> much<00:01:50.540> thinner<00:01:51.850> so<00:01:52.850> thin<00:01:53.240> that<00:01:53.659> I<00:01:54.649> can

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
make it much thinner so thin that I can

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.920 
make it much thinner so thin that I can
use<00:01:55.130> it<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.780> line<00:01:56.780> my<00:01:56.990> waterline<00:01:57.850> there<00:01:58.930> or

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
use it to line my waterline there or

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.660 
use it to line my waterline there or
underneath<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:00.829> wanted<00:02:01.159> to<00:02:03.250> and<00:02:04.250> it's<00:02:04.549> really

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
underneath I wanted to and it's really

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:15.759 
underneath I wanted to and it's really
really<00:02:05.270> black<00:02:13.150> it's<00:02:14.150> really<00:02:14.660> really<00:02:15.019> black

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
really black it's really really black

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.270 
really black it's really really black
true<00:02:16.160> black<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:17.780> takes<00:02:17.989> what<00:02:18.260> one<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:19.069> two

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280

quickly as my Bobbi Brown and because I

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.350

doesn't<00:02:44.420> dry<00:02:44.750> as<00:02:44.989> quick<00:02:45.319> as<00:02:45.500> my<00:02:45.680> Bobbi<00:02:45.920> Brown

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
doesn't dry as quick as my Bobbi Brown
this<00:02:48.640> will<00:02:49.640> happen<00:02:49.849> if<00:02:50.209> you<00:02:50.299> can<00:02:50.450> see<00:02:50.630> them<00:02:50.810> see

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
touched that part of my eye that I lined

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.520 
touched that part of my eye that I lined
right<00:03:04.069> there<00:03:04.780> well<00:03:05.780> that's<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:06.019> bummer<00:03:06.200> that

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
right there well that's a bummer that

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.789 
right there well that's a bummer that
means<00:03:07.190> I<00:03:07.280> have<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.549> correct<00:03:07.790> that<00:03:08.650> but<00:03:09.650> it's

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
means I have to correct that but it's

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.250 
means I have to correct that but it's
long<00:03:10.549> wearing<00:03:10.989> waterproof

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.350 

so<00:03:15.260> I'll<00:03:15.530> just<00:03:15.770> keep<00:03:16.400> my<00:03:16.460> eyes<00:03:16.790> open<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.240> whole

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
so I'll just keep my eyes open the whole

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.140 
so I'll just keep my eyes open the whole
day<00:03:17.590> because<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.860> doesn't<00:03:19.190> show<00:03:19.340> unless<00:03:19.880> I<00:03:22.150> so

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
day because it doesn't show unless I so

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.570 
day because it doesn't show unless I so
that's<00:03:23.360> about<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.960> only<00:03:24.260> thing<00:03:24.980> that<00:03:25.250> bums<00:03:25.460> me

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
that's about the only thing that bums me

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.320 
that's about the only thing that bums me
out<00:03:25.700> out<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:27.160> Maybelline<00:03:28.160> gel<00:03:28.550> liner<00:03:29.030> it

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
out out of the Maybelline gel liner it

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.580 
out out of the Maybelline gel liner it
also<00:03:29.510> comes<00:03:29.840> in<00:03:30.080> brown<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:34.430> retails<00:03:34.940> for

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
also comes in brown and it retails for

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.980

work which is around 12 to 16 hours so

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.090

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400

think it's just that it's getting old
but<00:04:59.210> for<00:04:59.690> now<00:04:59.980> while<00:05:00.980> this<00:05:01.250> is<00:05:01.490> new<00:05:01.780> it<00:05:02.780> hasn't

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
flaked on me it doesn't mean it doesn't

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.990

like me and fixing it later or what I'd

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.150 
like me and fixing it later or what I'd
have<00:06:16.870> to<00:06:16.990> do<00:06:17.110> is<00:06:17.260> just<00:06:17.470> close<00:06:17.740> my<00:06:17.979> eyes<00:06:18.130> a

have to do is just close my eyes a

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.659 
have to do is just close my eyes a
little<00:06:18.580> longer<00:06:18.790> and<00:06:19.740> fine<00:06:20.740> it<00:06:20.950> until<00:06:21.520> it's

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
little longer and fine it until it's

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.520 
little longer and fine it until it's
completely<00:06:22.300> denied<00:06:22.630> like<00:06:22.900> this<00:06:23.050> one<00:06:23.229> like<00:06:23.320> I'm

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
completely denied like this one like I'm

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.240 
completely denied like this one like I'm
in<00:06:23.710> here

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
in here

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.290 
in here
I<00:06:24.280> didn't<00:06:25.240> stain<00:06:25.510> my<00:06:25.780> mid<00:06:26.020> like<00:06:26.470> my<00:06:27.070> hood<00:06:27.280> on<00:06:27.669> it

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
I didn't stain my mid like my hood on it

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.000 
I didn't stain my mid like my hood on it
so<00:06:28.780> it's<00:06:29.740> something<00:06:30.040> that<00:06:31.500> I'd<00:06:32.500> have<00:06:32.740> to<00:06:32.770> live

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
so it's something that I'd have to live

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:38.370 
so it's something that I'd have to live
with<00:06:33.660> or<00:06:35.010> get<00:06:36.010> the<00:06:36.130> black<00:06:36.400> one<00:06:37.139> but<00:06:38.139> I

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
with or get the black one but I

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.820 
with or get the black one but I
recommend<00:06:39.250> this<00:06:39.690> especially<00:06:40.690> for<00:06:41.110> women<00:06:41.560> who

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
recommend this especially for women who

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.100 
recommend this especially for women who
don't<00:06:42.100> have<00:06:42.400> issues<00:06:42.580> with<00:06:42.940> their<00:06:43.150> hoods<00:06:43.360> who

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
don't have issues with their hoods who

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.060 
don't have issues with their hoods who
don't<00:06:44.320> have<00:06:44.530> issues<00:06:44.740> with<00:06:45.160> drying<00:06:45.520> their

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.070 
don't have issues with drying their

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:54.230 
don't have issues with drying their
their<00:06:48.070> a<00:06:48.100> liner<00:06:48.630> and<00:06:50.370> if<00:06:51.370> I<00:06:52.120> do<00:06:52.300> oh<00:06:52.960> by<00:06:53.500> the<00:06:53.530> way

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
their a liner and if I do oh by the way

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.340 
their a liner and if I do oh by the way
it<00:06:55.240> doesn't<00:06:55.510> transfer<00:06:56.430> so<00:06:57.430> I<00:06:57.460> water<00:06:58.330> a<00:06:58.750> tight

00:06:59.340 --> 00:06:59.350 
it doesn't transfer so I water a tight

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.279 
it doesn't transfer so I water a tight
line<00:06:59.620> my<00:06:59.650> waterline<00:07:00.460> here<00:07:01.060> and<00:07:01.450> it<00:07:01.780> doesn't

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:02.289 
line my waterline here and it doesn't

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:05.730 
line my waterline here and it doesn't
transfer<00:07:02.590> to<00:07:03.010> the<00:07:03.820> lower<00:07:04.060> part<00:07:04.510> so<00:07:04.900> in<00:07:05.560> that

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
transfer to the lower part so in that

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.920 
transfer to the lower part so in that
sense<00:07:06.990> it<00:07:07.990> dries<00:07:08.770> quickly<00:07:09.100> it<00:07:10.000> doesn't<00:07:10.479> it

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930 
sense it dries quickly it doesn't it

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.260 
sense it dries quickly it doesn't it
just<00:07:11.229> doesn't<00:07:11.770> dry<00:07:12.010> as<00:07:12.340> fast

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.270 
just doesn't dry as fast

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.719 
just doesn't dry as fast
so<00:07:14.720> that's<00:07:15.560> what<00:07:15.740> I<00:07:15.770> like<00:07:16.009> about<00:07:16.160> it<00:07:16.430> I<00:07:16.550> might

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:16.729 
so that's what I like about it I might

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:19.390 
so that's what I like about it I might
get<00:07:16.970> to<00:07:17.150> use<00:07:17.270> it<00:07:17.419> for<00:07:17.630> my<00:07:17.870> waterline<00:07:18.169> and<00:07:18.830> I

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 
get to use it for my waterline and I

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.339 
get to use it for my waterline and I
like<00:07:19.639> the<00:07:19.789> fact<00:07:20.000> that<00:07:20.180> it<00:07:20.389> doesn't<00:07:20.599> transfer

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:21.349 
like the fact that it doesn't transfer

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:23.529 
like the fact that it doesn't transfer
to<00:07:21.380> my<00:07:22.370> mower<00:07:22.669> or

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:23.539 
to my mower or

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:27.189 
to my mower or
water<00:07:23.990> line<00:07:24.580> so<00:07:25.580> hopefully<00:07:26.389> this<00:07:26.539> helps<00:07:26.930> if

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 
water line so hopefully this helps if

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:29.469 
water line so hopefully this helps if
you<00:07:27.410> have<00:07:27.500> any<00:07:27.680> further<00:07:27.979> questions<00:07:28.550> leave<00:07:29.449> a

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:29.479 
you have any further questions leave a

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:48.100 
you have any further questions leave a
comment<00:07:29.810> below<00:07:30.099> thank<00:07:31.099> you<00:07:31.190> and<00:07:31.550> bye<00:07:31.699> you<00:07:31.759> too
