00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.069
 We have ... 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:13.929
 It is associated because this is specified in the proposal 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.929
 It is mm to sing with all the participants 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:20.830
 I could say it was the sun 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.179
 Red is the mainstream in Japan 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.599
 But I say that there are more yellow in the world 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.949
 In addition, phosphorus is not red in Europe but green 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.470
 It seems that the reason is the difference in the varieties being distributed 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.970
 The green apple is also a green apple in Japan 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.770
 I will explain paid 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.640
 The person who is the starting point specifies three colors first 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.960
 Horse-drawn 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.640
 Medical loss 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.160
 The speaker points to any person according to the Thai hail 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.460
 The named person drew the same color as the prescribed medical care 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.140
 Do 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.240
 Even tomato tomato 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.579
 I will point my finger further 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.630
 Point your finger at the yellow medical color ie 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.900
 Name name name buy a finger 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.570
 Have medical care 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.619
 Medical care is good 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.580
 The name is lost 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.480
 Put on the mass death of all 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.480
 Repeat this with good tempo 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.630
 1 point here 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.220
 If the same color is repeated twice 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.040
 Tomato tomato 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.980
 I need to answer the same thing 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.980
 However 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.990
 If the same amount is repeated three times 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.020
 Tuna 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.020
 All must be answered differently 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.540
 It is the reason that it is said to be a 3 consecutive win frame 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.440
 Commonwealth out 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.759
 Forget pointing to the power distribution 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.499
 Do you mean that you answer something different from the specified color? 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.229
 Let's do this actually 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:24.799
 Also 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.289
 I get it 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:30.289
 The title was set to never have setter 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:32.550
 Four 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.120
 It was worthy of much lower and extremely high 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:38.639
 Four 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.029
 I understood 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:46.649
 It feels like this and the ones before March 2004 encourage some reductions 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:51.119
 This is also the story of the important little finger bones Kazuko everyone 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:56.149
 Please spend a moment Goodbye Arurukan 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:57.479
 I do not understand
