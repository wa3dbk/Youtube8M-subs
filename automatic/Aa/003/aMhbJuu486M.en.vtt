components right here is a she shot

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.329 
components right here is a she shot
karma<00:01:02.420> right<00:01:03.420> there<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> Brad's<00:01:04.339> right

there's<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.640> bullet<00:01:06.619> first<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.010> start

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
there's a bullet first we have to start

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.359 
there's a bullet first we have to start
by<00:01:08.369> priming<00:01:08.909> do<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.780> use<00:01:09.900> for<00:01:10.140> us<00:01:10.200> because<00:01:11.070> it

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
by priming do you use for us because it

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.630 
by priming do you use for us because it
is<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.520> use<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:11.970> us<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:12.600> any<00:01:12.869> brats

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
is a use for us and it's not any brats

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.620 
is a use for us and it's not any brats
so<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:15.030> do<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.530> take<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.680> piece<00:01:17.420> then<00:01:18.420> hold

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
so to do that take this piece then hold

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.109 
so to do that take this piece then hold
right<00:01:18.900> down<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.290> middle<00:01:19.729> when<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.820> set<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
right down the middle when you set the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.580 
right down the middle when you set the
brass<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.049> like<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:23.990> you<00:01:24.990> then<00:01:25.170> take<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
brass in it like so you then take the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.109 
brass in it like so you then take the
deep<00:01:25.740> frying<00:01:25.979> tool<00:01:26.280> which<00:01:26.580> has<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.790> small

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
deep frying tool which has a small

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.510 
deep frying tool which has a small
needle<00:01:27.330> like<00:01:27.600> tool<00:01:27.869> at<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> end<00:01:28.200> then<00:01:29.189> put<00:01:29.430> it

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
needle like tool at the end then put it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.560 
needle like tool at the end then put it
down<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.270> brass<00:01:31.640> with<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> couple<00:01:33.030> swift<00:01:33.299> hits

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
down the brass with a couple swift hits

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.289 
down the brass with a couple swift hits
up<00:01:33.960> from<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> hammer<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.820> case<00:01:36.060> I'm<00:01:36.240> using

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
up from a hammer in this case I'm using

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.450 
up from a hammer in this case I'm using
a<00:01:36.509> ball<00:01:36.689> peen<00:01:36.869> hammer<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.890> will<00:01:38.100> knock<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
a ball peen hammer it will knock the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:48.050 
a ball peen hammer it will knock the
power<00:01:38.670> out<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:45.710> voila<00:01:46.710> my<00:01:47.460> case<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.880> deep

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
power out and voila my case is deep

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.080 
power out and voila my case is deep
round

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.660 

here's<00:01:54.090> my<00:01:54.270> news<00:01:54.450> powder<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:55.520> personally<00:01:56.520> keep

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
here's my news powder I personally keep

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.880 
here's my news powder I personally keep
all<00:01:56.850> my<00:01:56.970> progress<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.570> don't<00:01:57.840> know<00:01:57.900> why<00:01:58.050> I<00:01:58.440> heard

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
all my progress I don't know why I heard

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.200 
all my progress I don't know why I heard
some<00:01:59.130> people<00:01:59.159> actually<00:01:59.490> take<00:01:59.850> him<00:01:59.970> in<00:02:00.060> for

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
some people actually take him in for

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.710 
some people actually take him in for
scrap

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
scrap

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.560 
scrap
so<00:02:01.110> I'm<00:02:01.170> figured<00:02:01.470> that's<00:02:01.560> relative<00:02:02.390> then<00:02:03.390> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
so I'm figured that's relative then the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.830 
so I'm figured that's relative then the
next<00:02:03.869> step<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.770> actually<00:02:04.860> clean<00:02:05.490> out<00:02:05.840> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
next step is to actually clean out the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.870 
next step is to actually clean out the
primer<00:02:07.110> pocket<00:02:07.229> which<00:02:07.890> isn't<00:02:08.070> necessary

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
primer pocket which isn't necessary

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.320 
primer pocket which isn't necessary
necessary<00:02:09.630> but<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.899> do<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.170> anyway<00:02:11.030> some<00:02:12.030> people

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
necessary but I do it anyway some people

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.580 
necessary but I do it anyway some people
just<00:02:12.360> clean<00:02:12.810> against<00:02:13.050> better<00:02:13.260> accuracy

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
just clean against better accuracy

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.410 
just clean against better accuracy

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
case I'm just trying to get all of it

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.960 
case I'm just trying to get all of it
off<00:05:11.800> the<00:05:11.980> neck<00:05:12.160> because<00:05:12.400> it's<00:05:12.580> sticking<00:05:12.850> in

off the neck because it's sticking in
the<00:05:13.030> back<00:05:13.210> I<00:05:13.630> think<00:05:13.930> I<00:05:14.020> had<00:05:14.139> a<00:05:14.169> little

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.610

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
lubrication in the sizing die which

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.350 
lubrication in the sizing die which
shouldn't<00:05:20.919> have<00:05:21.040> happened<00:05:21.310> but<00:05:21.970> I<00:05:22.000> think<00:05:22.090> it

shouldn't have happened but I think it

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.379 
shouldn't have happened but I think it
is<00:05:22.480> in<00:05:22.630> there<00:05:22.860> we<00:05:23.860> then<00:05:24.040> take<00:05:24.580> our<00:05:24.790> prime<00:05:25.090> case

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
is in there we then take our prime case

of<00:06:36.160> reloading<00:06:36.610> should<00:06:37.060> only<00:06:37.210> take<00:06:37.450> about<00:06:37.600> two

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
of reloading should only take about two

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.650 
of reloading should only take about two
minutes<00:06:38.580> it<00:06:39.580> works<00:06:39.820> a<00:06:39.910> lot<00:06:40.030> better<00:06:40.090> if<00:06:40.419> you<00:06:40.539> do
