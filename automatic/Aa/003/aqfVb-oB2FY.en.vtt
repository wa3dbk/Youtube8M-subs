capacity actually what I was reading is
that<00:03:06.850> there<00:03:07.030> are<00:03:07.060> studies<00:03:07.420> that<00:03:07.450> say<00:03:07.750> can

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
that there are studies that say can

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.410 
that there are studies that say can
actually<00:03:08.320> reverse<00:03:08.980> memory<00:03:09.700> loss<00:03:10.030> that's

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
actually reverse memory loss that's

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.000 
actually reverse memory loss that's
that's<00:03:10.660> a<00:03:10.810> whole<00:03:10.960> different<00:03:11.170> ballgame<00:03:11.530> that's

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
that's a whole different ballgame that's

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.830 
that's a whole different ballgame that's
exactly<00:03:12.190> right<00:03:12.640> so<00:03:12.880> we've<00:03:13.060> always<00:03:13.300> known<00:03:13.780> that
