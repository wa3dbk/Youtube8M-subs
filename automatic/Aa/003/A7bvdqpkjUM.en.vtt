00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 and so I performed with you 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.420
 previous assignment 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.599
 added 9 entries to your site 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.950
 and added 2 comments but for now they 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.160
 hang on check 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.890
 it should be literally 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.920
 the next lesson we will explain why this 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.369
 so and how to make a comment 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.500
 such as automatically added 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.529
 Now the goal of our class is to learn 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.769
 create other than ordinary entries 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.530
 also pages because if you 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.660
 notice any block there 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.910
 except for such ordinary records 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.530
 there is always 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.710
 stationary page ie for example 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.950
 This page will repeat this with me 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.480
 there are pages I recommend there are pages 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.190
 my other projects 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.160
 and so on, that is, it is such 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.570
 pages that should be on the site 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.239
 initially and they should not be seen 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.210
 such records that gradually go away 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.750
 lower and lower exactly it will always be 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.119
 available from the main menu 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.369
 how are they added wordpress for this 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.530
 there is a separate item here which 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.580
 called the page we choose it 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.250
 add new new and here exactly 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:26.310
 also in the same way that because of the labels 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:29.360
 we write the name of the page this 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.040
 text that will be here inside it 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.700
 I still also save time 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.009
 add any text here you can 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.360
 add your photo if this 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.470
 author page 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.750
 maybe a video about myself and also click 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.259
 publish here as you can see 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:54.439
 no rubric is needed here 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:56.729
 we can only specify the menu itself as if 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.939
 pay attention to our page 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.310
 displayed on the blog right here and 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.619
 initially if i want to have me 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.610
 the page is displayed here next 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.960
 list I need to specify that 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.820
 she has no parent page 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.490
 in this case, it will appear immediately 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:19.080
 here if I want her to be like 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.960
 submenu for here this page I already 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.480
 I choose this page and it will be for 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.350
 her combo parent 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.080
 so put no so here we are through point 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.690
 the order can change the order of these 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.960
 pages that is, the smaller the number of topics 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.390
 the page will be closer to the left 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.600
 if we want to allow new 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.300
 a page appeared before this one 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.450
 should a new page let's put 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.580
 unit priority, but this one 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.970
 let's say deuce then our new 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:57.090
 will appear in front of her and here we choose 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.780
 the template here will look like 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.880
 page 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.860
 can be made so that the side column 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.660
 there was no getting away so that this 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.590
 website was not displayed 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:13.230
 Well, for example, you can do without side 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:16.830
 column click on publish and go out 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.440
 back updating my blog here i have 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.100
 page shoes when russia appeared 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.310
 put her priority 0 and she therefore 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:29.130
 got closer here than pages that already 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.330
 It was not so now if I go there 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.670
 here it is my page without a side column 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.700
 so look as it is more convenient for you and 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.630
 but do this page in principle 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.510
 can be deleted 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.740
 which as an example goes i go on 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.050
 page list 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.040
 select and click delete the same 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.110
 can do 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.890
 worth a test record that goes 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:04:00.270
 initially hello world and also 0 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.310
 so all the pages that we have here yet 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.830
 may be useful for you and you may 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.950
 there is such a question how to make 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.230
 a page that won't be in the menu here 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.510
 I now have when I am adding a page 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:18.100
 we always appear in the menu 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:20.590
 but there will be situations when you donâ€™t 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.010
 want the page link to be in 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.310
 menu 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.620
 for example you are doing some kind of prom 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.310
 a promotion can be a page do 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.310
 under it maybe you have there just 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.140
 page with some instruction which 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.290
 you give maybe at your training and 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:41.140
 there is no sense in and from here therefore 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.940
 Now we do not dwell on this 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.880
 we will because it is done by 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.520
 special plug- in as soon as we 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.010
 let's get to the lesson on plugins, I'll show you 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.400
 how can you adjust will for 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:57.460
 pages appear menu or not here 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.580
 Now your task is to create at least one 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.530
 page at least this is this page about 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.910
 the author 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.130
 which should always be on the site 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.280
 You can also create a page. 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.320
 contacts that include your address 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.580
 I will give your phone how to contact you and 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:20.010
 drove so on this on the pages I 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.010
 finish see you in the next video
