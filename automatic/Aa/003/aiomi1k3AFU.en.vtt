cutting<00:02:18.510> soil<00:02:21.290> will<00:02:22.290> just<00:02:22.470> put<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> little<00:02:22.740> soil

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
cutting soil will just put a little soil

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.660 
cutting soil will just put a little soil
in<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.520> pot<00:02:23.730> here

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.370 

your<00:02:27.670> plants<00:02:28.120> will<00:02:28.270> come<00:02:28.480> in<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.750> variety<00:02:28.930> of

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
your plants will come in a variety of

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.780 
your plants will come in a variety of
sizes<00:02:29.740> but<00:02:30.310> this<00:02:30.520> is<00:02:30.700> this<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.300> typical<00:02:32.790> when

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
sizes but this is this is typical when

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.040 
sizes but this is this is typical when
we're<00:02:33.970> finished<00:02:34.180> we<00:02:34.480> want<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.750> have<00:02:34.840> enough

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
we're finished we want to have enough

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.750 
we're finished we want to have enough
soil<00:02:35.290> on<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.560> bottom<00:02:35.860> of<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.040> pot<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:36.490> when<00:02:36.610> we

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
soil on the bottom of the pot so when we

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.180 
soil on the bottom of the pot so when we
plant<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.210> plants<00:02:37.690> they'll<00:02:37.900> be<00:02:38.110> just<00:02:38.800> about

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
plant the plants they'll be just about

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.840 
plant the plants they'll be just about
flush<00:02:40.000> with<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.360> surface<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.170> container

flush with the surface of the container

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:49.170 
flush with the surface of the container
all<00:02:42.850> right<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.959> then<00:02:47.020> we'll<00:02:47.700> I'll<00:02:48.700> get<00:02:48.940> some

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
all right and then we'll I'll get some

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.380 
all right and then we'll I'll get some
help<00:02:49.360> here<00:02:49.480> so<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:49.990> we<00:02:50.020> can<00:02:50.290> do<00:02:50.470> this<00:02:50.680> right

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
help here so that we can do this right

00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:01.530 
help here so that we can do this right
and<00:02:52.390> faster<00:02:53.080> that's<00:02:53.440> true

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.979 

it<00:03:02.110> does<00:03:02.349> take<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.650> little<00:03:02.890> bit<00:03:03.099> of<00:03:03.450> soil<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.810> do

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
it does take a little bit of soil to do

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.849 
it does take a little bit of soil to do
this<00:03:05.260> with<00:03:05.560> but<00:03:08.909> that's<00:03:09.909> good<00:03:10.500> most<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:11.739> these

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
this with but that's good most of these

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.179 
this with but that's good most of these
soils<00:03:12.370> have<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.269> variety<00:03:13.689> of<00:03:13.930> ingredients<00:03:14.290> in

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:15.189 
soils have a variety of ingredients in

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.270 
soils have a variety of ingredients in
there<00:03:15.459> but<00:03:16.060> one<00:03:16.269> nice<00:03:16.540> thing<00:03:16.569> about<00:03:16.930> them<00:03:17.469> is

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
there but one nice thing about them is

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.020 
there but one nice thing about them is
that<00:03:19.000> they're<00:03:19.359> very<00:03:19.599> light<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:21.040> once<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:21.879> get

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
that they're very light so once you get

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.910 
that they're very light so once you get
the<00:03:22.150> plants<00:03:22.569> planted<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.170> even<00:03:23.409> if<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.650> use<00:03:23.890> a

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
the plants planted and even if you use a

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.780 
the plants planted and even if you use a
very<00:03:24.250> large<00:03:24.519> planter<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:26.680> soil<00:03:26.980> is<00:03:27.250> not<00:03:27.430> going

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
very large planter the soil is not going

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.309 
very large planter the soil is not going
to<00:03:27.909> add<00:03:28.030> a<00:03:28.060> lot<00:03:28.329> of<00:03:28.389> weight<00:03:28.689> to<00:03:28.930> it<00:03:29.079> and<00:03:29.170> that's

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
to add a lot of weight to it and that's

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.920 
to add a lot of weight to it and that's
a<00:03:29.439> good<00:03:29.590> thing<00:03:32.730> but<00:03:33.730> there's<00:03:33.970> an<00:03:34.150> example<00:03:34.689> of

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
a good thing but there's an example of

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.319 
a good thing but there's an example of
what<00:03:35.920> you<00:03:35.950> can<00:03:36.129> do<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:36.609> doesn't<00:03:36.939> take<00:03:37.120> very

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
what you can do it doesn't take very

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.949 
what you can do it doesn't take very
much<00:03:37.450> time<00:03:37.959> but<00:03:38.650> this<00:03:38.799> will<00:03:39.010> add<00:03:39.189> color<00:03:40.000> all

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
much time but this will add color all

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.740 
much time but this will add color all
summer<00:03:41.349> in<00:03:41.470> your<00:03:41.769> garden<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.340> continue<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.180> to

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
summer in your garden and continue to to

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.949 
summer in your garden and continue to to
bloom<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.260> look<00:03:44.379> pretty<00:03:45.030> now<00:03:46.030> one<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.780> the

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
bloom and look pretty now one of the

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.839 
bloom and look pretty now one of the
things<00:03:46.989> about<00:03:47.560> these<00:03:47.769> potting<00:03:48.220> soils<00:03:48.579> is<00:03:48.700> they

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
things about these potting soils is they

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.599 
things about these potting soils is they
dry<00:03:49.180> out<00:03:49.209> quickly<00:03:49.780> so<00:03:50.139> you<00:03:50.739> do<00:03:51.069> have<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.430> pay

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
dry out quickly so you do have to pay

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.390 
dry out quickly so you do have to pay
attention<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.599> watering<00:03:53.040> so<00:03:54.040> it's<00:03:54.189> good<00:03:54.370> to

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
attention to watering so it's good to

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.929 
attention to watering so it's good to
soak<00:03:54.790> them<00:03:55.030> right<00:03:56.019> after<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:56.470> get<00:03:57.189> the<00:03:57.400> plants

00:03:57.929 --> 00:03:57.939 
soak them right after you get the plants

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:00.569 
soak them right after you get the plants
planted<00:03:58.359> give<00:03:58.930> them<00:03:59.049> good<00:03:59.169> soaking<00:03:59.680> and<00:04:00.189> then

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
planted give them good soaking and then

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:01.830 
planted give them good soaking and then
you'll<00:04:00.730> probably<00:04:00.970> if<00:04:01.329> they're<00:04:01.480> out<00:04:01.599> in<00:04:01.629> a

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
you'll probably if they're out in a

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.599 
you'll probably if they're out in a
sunny<00:04:02.079> location<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:02.919> these<00:04:03.040> are<00:04:03.189> plants<00:04:03.430> that

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
sunny location and these are plants that

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.330 
sunny location and these are plants that
will<00:04:03.790> do<00:04:04.000> well<00:04:04.209> in<00:04:04.389> a<00:04:04.480> sunny<00:04:04.720> location<00:04:05.340> you

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
will do well in a sunny location you

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.369 
will do well in a sunny location you
will<00:04:06.519> after<00:04:06.699> water<00:04:07.090> them<00:04:07.269> at<00:04:07.419> least<00:04:07.599> once<00:04:07.900> a

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
will after water them at least once a

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.729 
will after water them at least once a
day<00:04:08.409> and<00:04:08.829> maybe<00:04:09.669> more<00:04:10.000> often<00:04:10.739> depending<00:04:11.739> on

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
day and maybe more often depending on

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.710 
day and maybe more often depending on
this<00:04:12.010> site<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:12.459> and<00:04:13.030> some<00:04:13.329> different

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
this site and and some different

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.439 
this site and and some different
containers<00:04:14.579> also<00:04:15.579> have<00:04:15.699> different<00:04:15.849> water<00:04:16.209> in

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
containers also have different water in

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:17.060 
containers also have different water in
these

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
these

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.310 
these
some<00:04:17.940> you<00:04:18.060> may<00:04:18.210> need<00:04:18.360> the<00:04:18.450> water<00:04:18.600> more<00:04:18.870> often

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
some you may need the water more often

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.930 
some you may need the water more often
some<00:04:19.800> have<00:04:20.040> an<00:04:20.190> ounce<00:04:20.310> of<00:04:20.460> material<00:04:20.910> that

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
some have an ounce of material that

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.470 
some have an ounce of material that
holds<00:04:21.330> water<00:04:21.540> a<00:04:21.780> little<00:04:21.900> better<00:04:22.790> so<00:04:23.790> that<00:04:23.820> you

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
holds water a little better so that you

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.730 
holds water a little better so that you
should<00:04:24.660> be<00:04:24.720> something<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.110> keep<00:04:25.230> a<00:04:25.320> nice<00:04:25.410> right

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
should be something to keep a nice right

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.680 
should be something to keep a nice right
yeah<00:04:25.980> and<00:04:26.190> this<00:04:26.460> this<00:04:26.760> particular<00:04:27.180> type<00:04:27.660> of

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
yeah and this this particular type of

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.960 
yeah and this this particular type of
container<00:04:28.230> you<00:04:29.010> do<00:04:29.160> have<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.490> watch<00:04:29.640> pretty

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
container you do have to watch pretty

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.810 
container you do have to watch pretty
closely<00:04:30.300> they<00:04:31.260> will<00:04:31.470> dry<00:04:31.770> out<00:04:31.820> probably

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
closely they will dry out probably

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.860 
closely they will dry out probably
faster<00:04:33.420> than<00:04:33.630> what<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:34.500> clay<00:04:34.740> pot<00:04:35.040> will<00:04:35.870> the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
faster than what the clay pot will the
