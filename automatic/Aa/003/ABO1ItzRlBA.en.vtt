00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.430 
rough idea of what this place looks like
it's<00:03:07.420> been<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.570> long<00:03:07.840> time<00:03:08.110> since<00:03:08.140> I<00:03:08.410> played

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
it's been a long time since I played

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:16.620 
it's been a long time since I played
though<00:03:09.900> this<00:03:10.900> way<00:03:13.920> maybe<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:15.510> skipped<00:03:16.510> that

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
though this way maybe I skipped that

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.850 
though this way maybe I skipped that
last<00:03:16.870> one<00:03:17.050> sign<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:17.320> just<00:03:17.440> leads<00:03:17.650> back<00:03:17.830> to

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
last one sign it just leads back to

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.770 
last one sign it just leads back to
where<00:03:18.100> we<00:03:18.250> were<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:19.510> would<00:03:19.630> just<00:03:19.660> be

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
where we were that would just be

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.880 
where we were that would just be

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
would have had to go through one

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.580 
would have had to go through one
frequency<00:06:56.880> at<00:06:57.000> a<00:06:57.060> time<00:06:57.240> just<00:06:57.360> to<00:06:57.480> show<00:06:57.720> you<00:06:57.780> so

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
frequency at a time just to show you so

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.470 
frequency at a time just to show you so
it's<00:06:58.710> 745<00:07:01.040> yeah<00:07:02.040> need<00:07:02.790> to<00:07:02.850> tell<00:07:03.030> you<00:07:03.120> that<00:07:03.270> and

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.480 
it's 745 yeah need to tell you that and

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.300 
it's 745 yeah need to tell you that and
then<00:07:03.840> he<00:07:03.930> would<00:07:04.050> have<00:07:04.140> to<00:07:04.230> start<00:07:04.440> over<00:07:04.560> so<00:07:05.070> if

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310 
then he would have to start over so if

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.640 
then he would have to start over so if
you<00:07:05.520> didn't<00:07:05.910> have<00:07:06.150> it<00:07:06.390> you<00:07:07.290> would<00:07:07.440> have<00:07:07.530> to

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.650 
you didn't have it you would have to

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.400 
you didn't have it you would have to
guess<00:07:07.950> and<00:07:08.510> eventually<00:07:09.510> you<00:07:10.020> have<00:07:10.050> to<00:07:10.200> take

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.410 
guess and eventually you have to take

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.830 
guess and eventually you have to take
turns<00:07:10.590> with<00:07:10.860> siblings<00:07:11.310> or<00:07:11.700> friends<00:07:11.840> entering

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 
turns with siblings or friends entering

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.910 
turns with siblings or friends entering
one<00:07:13.080> number<00:07:13.380> of<00:07:13.470> times<00:07:13.650> 0<00:07:13.950> 0<00:07:14.220> 1<00:07:14.400> 0<00:07:14.640> 0<00:07:15.060> 2<00:07:15.300> 0<00:07:15.690> 0<00:07:16.110> 3<00:07:16.560> if

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:16.920 
one number of times 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 3 if

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.560 
one number of times 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 3 if
you<00:07:17.070> started<00:07:17.340> from<00:07:17.370> the<00:07:17.580> bottom<00:07:17.730> you'd<00:07:18.390> go

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:18.570 
you started from the bottom you'd go

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:19.940 
you started from the bottom you'd go
through<00:07:18.600> almost<00:07:18.930> three-quarters<00:07:19.560> of<00:07:19.740> the

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:19.950 
through almost three-quarters of the

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.680 
through almost three-quarters of the
possibilities<00:07:20.580> before<00:07:20.760> you<00:07:20.940> finally<00:07:21.390> hit<00:07:21.540> on

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:21.690
