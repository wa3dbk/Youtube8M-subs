00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.090
 thin layer of plaster is the last 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.160
 layer finish the exterior walls of the building before 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.710
 the beginning of the exterior finishing works 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.580
 extremely important to consider all properties 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.529
 plaster 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.960
 this will allow us to choose the right 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.510
 plaster environmental characteristics 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.239
 medium to base type as well as protect 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.390
 external wall against external effects 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.640
 factors are the company master gender when 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.879
 production of all types of plaster 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.019
 and facade paints are applied 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.780
 high quality encapsulated 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:50.540
 biocide active substances are released 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.489
 gradually due to which for many years 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.320
 reduced risk of unwanted 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.059
 microbial contamination 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.760
 effectiveness of such protection 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.379
 has been repeatedly confirmed 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.869
 laboratory tests should 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.630
 add that biocides used in 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:08.780
 products of the company master floor meet all 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.570
 European Union protection requirements 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.020
 environment as they relate to 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.990
 the newest solution in this area on 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.180
 various types of plaster are available on the market 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.909
 each one has certain 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.039
 properties so before buying 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.740
 a certain kind of need to think about what 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.210
 saving is really important for us 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.700
 wide selection of colors 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.060
 moisture proof or can 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.219
 to be resistant to pollution 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.770
 acrylic plaster minster t 'young on 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:42.619
 styrene acrylic dispersion based 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.350
 this is one of the most common types of plaster 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.450
 willingly selected from the company's offer 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.609
 she is relatively inexpensive 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.069
 but it has good 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.469
 performance characteristics 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.210
 first of all, it has a high 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:59.299
 elasticity ease processing and 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.369
 good adhesion it effectively protects 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.219
 weather resistant walls 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.789
 acrylic plaster is available in full 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.789
 color picker 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.470
 silicone plaster may starting 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.530
 based on silicone resin 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.520
 in connection with which she definitely possesses 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.010
 the best 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.830
 hydrophobic characteristics due to 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.080
 the presence of silicones repel particles 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.750
 water on the surface which they 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.910
 cover water drops are formed 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.459
 balls so when it rains 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.800
 pollution does not penetrate 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.010
 plaster and flow freely with 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.959
 wall surface silicone plaster 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.480
 has a more porous structure 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.120
 thanks to which water vapor can 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.910
 penetrate unhindered through thin 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.890
 silicone plaster coating available 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.959
 in a wide range of resistant colors 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.090
 silicate plaster May starting this 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.670
 product with the best ratio 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.920
 vapor permeability so she 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.860
 perfectly protects against condensation 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.230
 water vapor in the insulating layer 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.769
 this plaster is very durable and resistant 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.329
 to various mechanical damage 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.549
 silicate plaster firmly connected 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.250
 with the base unlike other 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:19.310
 plasters based on gluing 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.780
 the masses to the ground that is from giza and this 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.829
 the effect was achieved thanks to 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.410
 application 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.299
 liquid potassium glass which 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.420
 causes a very strong chemical 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.549
 the reaction between the coating and the base for 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.209
 coding silicate paints and 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.390
 plasters 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.790
 only pigment can be used and 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.829
 inorganic origin 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.290
 silicone silicate plaster master 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.350
 thing is a hybrid stucco 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.980
 it is a good combination 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.680
 top properties 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.489
 silicone and silicate plasters it 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.230
 compromise between very good adhesion 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.570
 shockproof and hydrophobic 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.030
 properties facilitating the content 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.400
 exterior walls clean just like in 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.880
 case of silicate plaster palette 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.319
 colors 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.319

 mineral plaster master teng it 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.150
 traditional product 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.680
 cement-based ri 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.139
 dispersible powders 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.019
 contained in plaster give it 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.350
 elasticity and improve its adhesion to 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.280
 plaster is easy to apply 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.310
 providing very good 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.530
 vapor permeability and besides i don't 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.900
