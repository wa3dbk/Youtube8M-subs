00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:09.660
 hello my family is already sleeping 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.790
 I've just played round with 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.610
 Penny came back and I still wanted to 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.650
 times show how in practice the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.570
 sensation can use everything if 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.500
 The dog tries a bit 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.180
 to pull in front 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.029
 I talk a little hoarsely about the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:30.840
 others already in bed are penny's 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:33.690
 just yet somehow was not looking 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.450
 more really fit in so it's not 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.129
 especially good video because I like that 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.950
 I only wanted to record myself 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.350
 let's show how it is 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.129
 So if the dog runs past one 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.129
 then you just have to go with it 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.329
 just pull back a bit 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.890
 Just let it feel a bit 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.539
 and that is less and less then 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.940
 one would be considered less necessary 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.449
 because he understands us what you do what 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.390
 would like to 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.230
 if you take the small one to the right or 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.300
 pull to the left or up and that 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.400
 then over that it has transferred to him 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.960
 You can do it in a sentence you can 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.159
 already I'll try the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.350
 next day still sometimes other 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.670
 take the camera then holds 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.150
 then I can do a bit better 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.290
 demonstrate 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.860
 ok now first then that cut 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.860
 from just now 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.810
 Here you can see now that I am one 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.480
 bit forward and shut up 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.770
 have stopped and so had 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.890
 the team kicked me again 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.890
 increased 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.390
 the same thing happens a bit 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.690
 run ahead and discovered something on the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.980
 other time then would be a bit 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.980
 to me in which I braids at the long 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.520
 maintal 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.270
 and here the same but now it has become 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.720
 immediately understood and stopped 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:20.640
 pulled a short leash back to me like that 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.560
 that was not very dramatic right now 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.900
 twice or so they forward 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.370
 has to run something 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.180
 looked at what happened on the street 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.030
 was 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.800
 but you could want an example if 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.780
 you can see how it works 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.500
 if you just bring the dog back to yourself 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.620
 get back 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:51.150
 So that's just that of the 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:52.860
 difference to other stars so that 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.260
 that just makes the difference that 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.060
 one then he is easy going and 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.890
 can somehow but can 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.480
 to talk to him and talk to him and him 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.250
 show what we really want but 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.010
 to run with us but do not 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.670
 ahead 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.610
 ok i hope it has a little bit 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.180
 impression conveys and it is with us 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.180
 with good 8
