00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.070
 you are clearly hashtag your spooky 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.070
 neighbors that still have color 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.340
 well guys that was the last time that 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.150
 that intro can be used 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.740
 the team with ronnie is that more but it 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.300
 is time to make a new team 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.400
 and of course i'm not going to be a premier league 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.860
 making squat or being such a spanish came 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.230
 messi neymar and everything you do so often 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.620
 against buy i wanted to win a vision 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.629
 memes evil called wÃ¼st so yes then go 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.580
 you completely think who am i going to be in my 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.590
 doing squat eventually i come to this one 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.970
 with geriatric naturally a unique 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.239
 is used super often 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.340
 and yes I want a medium team there 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.309
 had to deal with a lot of tendon 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.899
 I already have 93 tendons and I have pioche 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.820
 with 86 beast 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.190
 so let's play some more and then 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.079
 so you get this formation with also 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.969
 open family martins and do guyenne 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.830
 in the end I will be completely ready 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.240
 and adjust this completely together 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.680
 defense will go later 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.440
 but this is how we do it 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.479
 start with our piece in terms of real 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.310
 super creative that name of course I'm going 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.869
 effe by the main player is it 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.509
 one of the most important and unique 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.729
 it has 88 p's and it has 90 strings 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.410
 so he quickly and cannot be left of the band 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.979
 in addition, doing is being with again 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.780
 93 tendon is just not to keep then 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.819
 had to be with 93 p's and that 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.560
 80 dribbling also has something 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:34.440
 less ironing but that is really awesome 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.060
 robina with 91 tendon is actually one too 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.679
 pointed injuries had to be do to you 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.259
 inside is really invaluable 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.599
 then have there diet for the passion and 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.220
 for the green chemistry line with a 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:46.200
 unique and then also with vv 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.270
 martine's there and even though there is a lot of market 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.030
 also has 93 p's and that plays in the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.310
 american league de mls and that must 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.289
 between greenland and there you have 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.229
 jaclyn who goes to next 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.149
 years and those pounds of real boss 290 p70 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.860
 it works really well and irons 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.599
 have a special one on the left 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.910
 maybe try out the game 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.259
 of ac milan has 90 shop power and 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.239
 great facts rap so we have one 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.520
 mix from the bucket list american ran 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.020
 the turkish league and the russian look and 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.550
 we have the geriatric film it is 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.640
 really pretty cool it is not said 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.840
 from we can do the game webuser 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.790
 of course like any episode too 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.040
 contests a major and torres 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.629
 for the team so reasonable but yes we 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.340
 now have speed so here is had to said 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.349
 yes it can no longer be overtaken 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.250
 do a front seat and didn't do it through 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.500
 made a zero then I am like that 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.630
 what the fuck that went easy making 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.920
 He immediately scores a minute later then 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.870
 you shouldn't stay there together 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.700
 because then it goes wrong 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.860
 a minute later he is a day later 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.900
 he had to go with the cross again and that 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.120
 princes who goes the a bit in the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.850
 kluts where bleaching can easily finish 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.040
 but what happens to me too often is me 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.260
 so cause a penalty causing him 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.300
 the two can make two and he does 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.730
 and also it has come as so again you 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.010
 first game 2 2 is here then had to 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.750
 with the cross but martins is just possible 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.310
 not with a unique headline means him 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.860
 martine's with the normal 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.080
 making 3 is 2 and three is two 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.100
 also remain the first contest 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.810
 immediately won 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.700
 our speed males are completely 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.980
 glad the next match is t danger 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.320
 Kalou at the something is something 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.880
 speed but it is not too bad 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.160
 we start here in the fifth minute 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.489
 smarties with the boat they make that unique 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.140
 the 101 minutes becomes so valuable 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.820
 the defense that stands at the moments 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.010
 a male jaclyn is for me the 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.390
 excel this right back that now 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.920
 just give a kid a ball 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.840
 this is how Martine's tendon had it 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.360
 all in which we can again 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.420
 attack jed lindy right back is real 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.519
 strong and of course he is super fast you 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.060
 smarties then and with a bit of one 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.920
 You can pry and drip and turn 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.750
 here so space peace and with one 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.459
 got to walk past the games that 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.880
 is super easy and then stood 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.019
 again 2 0 here is do via then with a 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.910
 ball and take me but who goes 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.010
 completely wrong but then he is suddenly there 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.269
 automatically the keeper and then purple that 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.250
 A wrong one is also participating through one 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.840
 walk you can do and then it stood 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.340
 again 3 0 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.200
 He also does things back what 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.820
 you are going to get the ball here and kalou 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.360
 he can always be very easy to use 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.829
 the corner 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.930
 gatlin who also often participates in the 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.519
 attack here you have a high ball 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.169
 to do via and donk very quickly 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.910
 headers cheer ago 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.890
 and then it was already 4 gone 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.870
 of course very much broken than 415 me 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.460
 do not pee everything but I have to 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.830
 again shows nice back header 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.390
 very quiet and what does the keeper there and 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:34.450
 I actually couldn't do these fishermen either 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:36.400
 drop that you need what okay that 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.750
 great week is that the go is also the repeat 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.580
 However, I booked before I got to 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.870
 I also come with a really nice goal 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.850
 here from 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.040
 on the foil in the intersection 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.500
 great goal from my opponent 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.120
 but had forgotten day 93 string land 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.970
 a few minutes later I give this one 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.530
 free goals score 5 2 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.180
 if you do not pay attention for a moment you can 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.950
 with a mine i just run and walk 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.120
 and one thing popping which gives you a moment 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.370
 6 2 can make 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.870
 and yes with such a simple, not too expensive 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.790
 team you can destroy a team completely 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.230
 We also get enough chances here 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.450
 by the way, a nice threshold of one 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.340
 unique and you will study 8 8 to the pc 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.750
 straight up ok only i just go something 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.520
 too much also can not be in him 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.350
 popping farmer also had much higher 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.030
 can be because here is doing you are and 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.100
 he makes the keep come true only clutton 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.930
 just is too far from my foot than stumbling 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.730
 we walked on the bar to slight 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.590
 shoot a nice ball of this 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.050
 Guyenne then Moussa and he had that 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.400
 Also going to the bar and pop 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.350
 then another shot in the last minute 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.570
 of diet but that also goes against it 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.070
 aluminum that is really crazy 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.510
 We will win the competition to 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.700
 the next opponent and who has 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.830
 even though oh and per is something but it has 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.670
 shelf life meao and kevin de bruyne 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.380
 of course 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.240
 I start the match exactly as I do 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.540
 the previous game ended with 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.890
 a lot of accident what I shoot works 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.150
 by the late arrival I was so 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.830
 easy a suddenly stand actually 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.420
 here than emily 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.550
 who puts it in doing but who 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.230
 also goes against the bar inside pole 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.760
 whatever so we actually start 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.740
 just are exactly where we ended up 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.820
 were really literal if you look closely 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.680
 what all happens and how to lead 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.260
 came through is really crazy and then touches 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.360
 also my player got the ball making the 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.950
 goalkeeper can't save son's fall 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.040
 never actually have to sit in it 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.690
 that was really an accident for hours then I let myself 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.040
 fall here giving me a penalty 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.110
 because arrows become like that 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.550
 given immediately makes me one again 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.350
 we also have a mega funny 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.690
 moment here a ball to a unique 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.400
 and he wants to tackle mytek on himself 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.990
 and we are there we tweeted look 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.730
 to someone who determines the cameraman 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.100
 goes very well healthy seas and then 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.730
 he gives yellow for that okay yes completely 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.470
 beautiful 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.330
 Matt Red liked what we did at 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.160
 steam killed while a mine i here 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.200
 just as hard pulling the opponent 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.780
 I get a free kick and it's the 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.520
 90th minute so I'm doing my very best 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.960
 takes steps to choose the right event 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.180
 I come to choose there too but I chose 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.550
 go for diet shot shot with diego 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.410
 and the free kick holes in leaving two
