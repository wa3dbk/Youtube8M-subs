00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.890 
computer in my room and so i have
privacy<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:10.979> clean<00:01:11.189> record<00:01:11.549> but<00:01:12.330> right<00:01:12.689> now

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
privacy and I clean record but right now

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.679 
privacy and I clean record but right now
we<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.470> moved<00:01:13.770> my<00:01:14.159> laptop<00:01:14.640> out<00:01:14.850> basically

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
we have moved my laptop out basically

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.539 
we have moved my laptop out basically
into<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> open<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.490> be

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
into the open and so it's going to be

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.570 
into the open and so it's going to be
next<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.270> impossible<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:19.110> record<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.430> make

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
next to impossible to record to make

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.780 
next to impossible to record to make
videos<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.119> really<00:01:21.799> do<00:01:22.799> progress<00:01:23.640> on

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
videos to really do progress on

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.010 
videos to really do progress on
runescape<00:01:24.270> while<00:01:24.479> recording<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:26.659> so<00:01:27.659> my

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
runescape while recording and so my

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.140 
runescape while recording and so my
family<00:01:28.770> or<00:01:28.979> i<00:01:29.009> guess<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.579> family<00:01:29.909> we<00:01:30.030> have

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
family or i guess the family we have

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.030 
family or i guess the family we have
down<00:01:30.390> here<00:01:30.570> has<00:01:30.720> moved<00:01:30.990> into<00:01:31.259> my<00:01:31.590> room<00:01:31.860> and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040

they're going to be here for about a

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.480 
they're going to be here for about a

record<00:03:36.200> runescape<00:03:36.590> I'm<00:03:36.769> kind<00:03:36.980> of<00:03:37.010> on<00:03:37.190> a<00:03:37.400> cruddy

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
record runescape I'm kind of on a cruddy

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.090 
record runescape I'm kind of on a cruddy
laptop<00:03:38.690> that<00:03:38.900> might<00:03:39.049> it's<00:03:39.590> one<00:03:39.769> of<00:03:39.829> my<00:03:39.920> dad's

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
laptop that might it's one of my dad's

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.860 
laptop that might it's one of my dad's
work<00:03:40.280> laptops<00:03:40.760> that<00:03:40.910> he<00:03:41.060> kind<00:03:41.269> of<00:03:41.329> fixed<00:03:41.720> up

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
work laptops that he kind of fixed up

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.650 
work laptops that he kind of fixed up
and<00:03:42.140> it<00:03:42.650> runs<00:03:42.859> pretty<00:03:43.040> smoothly<00:03:43.430> but<00:03:44.299> because

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
and it runs pretty smoothly but because

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.390 
and it runs pretty smoothly but because
it's<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:44.900> laptop<00:03:45.380> it<00:03:45.530> doesn't<00:03:45.829> really<00:03:45.980> have<00:03:46.160> a

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
it's a laptop it doesn't really have a

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.770 
it's a laptop it doesn't really have a
good<00:03:46.579> graphics<00:03:47.000> card<00:03:47.239> and<00:03:47.390> so<00:03:47.480> it<00:03:47.600> can't

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
good graphics card and so it can't

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.420 
good graphics card and so it can't
really<00:03:47.930> stream<00:03:48.530> very<00:03:48.799> well<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.160> all<00:03:49.280> that

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
more streaming I haven't really been

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.159 
more streaming I haven't really been
streaming<00:04:13.849> a<00:04:14.000> lot<00:04:14.150> because<00:04:14.329> I<00:04:14.780> can't<00:04:15.560> use<00:04:16.040> um

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
streaming a lot because I can't use um

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.420 
streaming a lot because I can't use um
it's<00:04:18.169> called<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.620> oh<00:04:18.769> it's<00:04:19.130> called<00:04:19.489> OBS<00:04:19.970> and

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
it's called the oh it's called OBS and

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.710 
it's called the oh it's called OBS and
that's<00:04:22.430> usually<00:04:22.699> what<00:04:23.030> most<00:04:23.210> people<00:04:23.509> use<00:04:23.690> to

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
that's usually what most people use to

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.930 
that's usually what most people use to
stream<00:04:24.139> with<00:04:24.350> but<00:04:24.620> my<00:04:25.340> laptop<00:04:25.759> isn't

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
stream with but my laptop isn't

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.249 
stream with but my laptop isn't
compatible<00:04:26.240> with<00:04:26.449> that<00:04:26.630> so<00:04:26.780> when<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:26.960> put<00:04:27.229> my

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:27.259 
compatible with that so when I put my

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:28.900 
compatible with that so when I put my
computer<00:04:27.620> together<00:04:27.979> I'll<00:04:28.310> be<00:04:28.460> able<00:04:28.490> to<00:04:28.669> use

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
computer together I'll be able to use

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.450 
computer together I'll be able to use
that<00:04:28.940> and<00:04:29.300> it's<00:04:29.419> a<00:04:29.479> much<00:04:29.630> better<00:04:29.870> program<00:04:30.289> than

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
that and it's a much better program than

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.689 
that and it's a much better program than
the<00:04:31.460> one<00:04:31.610> I<00:04:31.639> use<00:04:31.910> right<00:04:32.120> now<00:04:32.560> so<00:04:33.560> I'll<00:04:34.430> be<00:04:34.669> able
