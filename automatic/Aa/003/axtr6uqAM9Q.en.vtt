00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
very often so this was a bit challenging

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.310 
very often so this was a bit challenging
and<00:02:22.280> usually<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.760> support<00:02:23.270> or<00:02:23.450> engineer<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.260> do

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
there so who that is left now is the the

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.810 
there so who that is left now is the the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
the kill with the dip you later but like

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.840 
the kill with the dip you later but like
I<00:02:53.000> say<00:02:53.269> I<00:02:53.600> actually<00:02:54.290> fell<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.250> do<00:02:55.459> it<00:02:55.580> in<00:02:55.700> this

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
I say I actually fell to do it in this

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.240 
I say I actually fell to do it in this
map<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.450> we<00:02:56.660> will<00:02:56.810> have<00:02:57.110> them<00:02:57.350> roll<00:02:57.680> on<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.130> the

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
map and we will have them roll on to the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.660 
map and we will have them roll on to the
next<00:02:58.459> map<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.320> unfortunately<00:03:00.320> well<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.370> say<00:03:01.640> I

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
next map and unfortunately well I say I

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.729 
next map and unfortunately well I say I
fail<00:03:02.090> to<00:03:02.120> do<00:03:02.420> it<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:03.230> server<00:03:03.470> actually

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
fail to do it the the server actually

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.759 
fail to do it the the server actually
crushed<00:03:04.250> out<00:03:04.489> before<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:06.260> level<00:03:06.620> was

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
crushed out before the the level was

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.910 
crushed out before the the level was
over<00:03:07.340> so<00:03:08.090> we<00:03:08.690> never<00:03:08.930> got<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.230> chance<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.590> find

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
over so we never got a chance to find

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.160 
over so we never got a chance to find
out<00:03:10.100> if<00:03:10.280> I<00:03:10.370> could<00:03:10.790> actually<00:03:11.090> do<00:03:11.570> it<00:03:11.720> or<00:03:11.840> not<00:03:11.870> in

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
out if I could actually do it or not in

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.320 
out if I could actually do it or not in
the<00:03:12.320> same<00:03:12.590> game<00:03:12.890> so<00:03:13.459> unfortunately<00:03:14.000> we'll

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
the same game so unfortunately we'll

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.400 
the same game so unfortunately we'll
have<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.720> wait<00:03:14.900> until<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.560> next<00:03:15.769> match<00:03:16.010> and

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
have to wait until the next match and

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.220 
have to wait until the next match and
hopefully<00:03:18.410> get<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:18.680> in<00:03:18.799> that<00:03:19.040> one<00:03:19.220> but<00:03:20.060> um<00:03:20.299> yeah

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
hopefully get it in that one but um yeah

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.080 
hopefully get it in that one but um yeah
so<00:03:21.440> I've<00:03:22.190> already<00:03:22.850> unlocked<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:24.250> mp7<00:03:25.250> which

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
so I've already unlocked the mp7 which

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.630 
so I've already unlocked the mp7 which
was<00:03:26.299> pretty<00:03:26.750> easy<00:03:26.840> that's<00:03:27.769> basically<00:03:28.100> aunty

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
was pretty easy that's basically aunty

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.600 
was pretty easy that's basically aunty
aunty<00:03:29.440> vehicle<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:30.829> you<00:03:31.160> know<00:03:31.310> that<00:03:31.489> is

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
aunty vehicle and you know that is

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.390 
aunty vehicle and you know that is
basically<00:03:32.180> my<00:03:32.360> er<00:03:32.390> my<00:03:33.040> duty<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.130> battlefield

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
anyway so that was pretty simple there

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.990
