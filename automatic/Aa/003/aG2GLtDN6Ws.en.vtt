00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
that we perform like we did in the first

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.770 
that we perform like we did in the first
off<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.130> 90<00:01:44.430> minutes<00:01:44.610> that's<00:01:45.299> what<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.540> is

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
off for 90 minutes that's what it is

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.240 
off for 90 minutes that's what it is
that's<00:01:46.140> what<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.409> about<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.009> team's

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
that's what it's about is the team's

that's what it's about is the team's
without<00:01:47.610> consistency<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.689> will<00:01:48.950> get<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
without consistency that will get in the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.030 
without consistency that will get in the
shake-up<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.930> an<00:01:51.930> opportunity<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.590> getting

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
shake-up and an opportunity of getting

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.280 
shake-up and an opportunity of getting
out<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.460> league<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:54.020> think<00:01:55.020> on<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
out of this league you think on the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.240 
out of this league you think on the
whole<00:01:55.320> is

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.530 

now<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.280> thought<00:01:59.520> they<00:01:59.640> had<00:01:59.760> better<00:01:59.970> chances<00:02:00.390> in

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
now I thought they had better chances in

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.300 
now I thought they had better chances in
that<00:02:00.659> second<00:02:01.020> off<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.320> thought<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.530> thought<00:02:02.190> my

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
that second off I thought I thought my

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.830 
that second off I thought I thought my
