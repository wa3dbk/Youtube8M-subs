00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:39.650
 despite the throw-in time of 19 o'clock 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.949

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.420

 Table third in the initial phase 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.280

 simple push-off gates wetzlar hanno 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.909
 balitsch spends a lot on the ball 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.229
 easily flensburgs were grabbed 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.330
 the bullet and has no problems 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.820
 to turn on the contrary 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.549
 yet it was the green-and-white ones too 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.600
 had starting more of the partie 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:07.430
 National player is missing thunders the ball 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.170
 only against the post kevin schmidt 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.150
 secures the rebound and jens 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.369
 Pondtke lets at the sun in the box 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.680
 North German no chance in the 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.659
 at the beginning of the first quarter of an hour, hsg 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.730
 playmaker ivano balic his 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.260
 Flash individual class 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.960
 Here he cleverly turns around the 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.900
 defend and hit the 8 7 leadership for 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.270
 the middle hessen with the change of 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.550
 andreas wolf for magnus tal ins tor 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.310
 it was then in minute 20 then 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.110
 suddenly a spectacular seven meters 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.080
 wolf from eggert keeps wolf in 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.840
 world class man also otherwise could 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.180
 the 22 year old multiple times 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.190
 in the front but could the green white 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.050
 rarely so easy against the 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.850
 flensburger defense prevail as still 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.650
 in the initial phase after the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.110
 Substitution of ballack played the 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.390
 hsg suddenly the idea left naked without 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.340
 the necessary patience closes hastily 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.240
 different and holds and directs the same 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.890
 counter 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.530
 Although this chance can not be 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.430
 Flensburg will take you to the break 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.430
 15 12 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.190
 at half past time they seemed to be 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.740
 wetzlarer made some plans 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.990
 have and that are 13 to 15 by tones 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.230
 made courage and hope for one 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.260
 catching up but now followed ten completely 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.150
 weak minutes on sight of the HSG in front 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.340
 went almost nothing and flensburg 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.430
 used in the style of a top team 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.260
 this cold again was right 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.510
 the dane has a perfect evening 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.480
 was caught best with six goals 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.730
 scorer of the lot 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.840
 the North German attracted now to 20 to 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.570
 14 of them 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.500
 The game seemed to be in minute 39 already 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.440
 decided 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.170
 but the hsg proved once more moral 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.450
 and fighting spirit and was fighting in the 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.459
 partie back kevin schmitt jumps in 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.560
 the passport overview lands the ball 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.110
 then at reichmann and the shortened for 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.850
 wetzlar 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.010
 also thanks to an ever-increasing 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.510
 andy wolf in the box noticed the 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.819
 spectators that the game suddenly 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.590
 turned back in favor of the HSG 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.320
 Flensburg was tired now 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.290
 leached impression and as a carlos 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.049
 brito met for 19 to 21 was the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.239
 connection restored 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.910
 but wetzlar wanted too much now 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.130
 the hsg over-motivated performed 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.590
 too many technical mistakes and ran 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.360
 again and again in collisions reinfeldt 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.370
 loses the ball flensburgs mogensen 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.470
 grabs the game machine and leaves 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.840
 the wild ride direction box of the hsg 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.120
 and this time may also goalkeeper wolf 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.650
 nothing to do after a big fight 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:44.510
 the middle hessen lose with 25 to 29 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.200
 yes I think there are hard chunks 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.719
 the door 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.159
 I think we need the positive 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:51.379
 exceptions we fought very well 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:54.680
 have also defended properly and with 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.329
 a bit more luck came up front too 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.319
 get points you must not forget 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.780
 flensburg is champions league 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.239
 participants and already a house number and 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.049
 it was all sold well it was 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.939
 more in it today 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.159
 and otherwise what seems to be playing in the 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:09.739
 have played confidently with 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.109
 a compact defensive and then 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.000
 the games will win as well 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.620
 The super team work one camp 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.690
 very nice hall here are the fans 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.009
 behind the team 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:24.550
 It will always be hot last year 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:24.550
 let in the point and yes that is so
