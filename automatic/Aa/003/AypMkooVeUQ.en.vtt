00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.719

 free stay the rest of the video for 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:16.360
 see him 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.939

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.740
 google a cloud or service 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.570
 internet storage that allows 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.480
 safeguard all our photos and

 videos without limit also has 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.990
 other additions as interesting as 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.640
 be able to save the photos and videos of 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.890
 certain terminal folders like 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.180
 could be whatsapp and even a 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.850
 assistant in charge of creating 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.900
 compositions animations and videos with 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.900
 all these contents 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:50.570
 all this automatically without 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.890
 we have to worry about nothing alone 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.170
 you have to download the application to 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.400
 Android or iphone as usual and it's 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.410
 which is available for these two 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:04.730
 mobile platforms in addition to its 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:06.260
 own web with it any user 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.270
 You can save and recover these 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.700
 documents regardless of the platform 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:19.340
 from which I do that yes always 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:21.110
 using your google account after the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.850
 installation only remains to start the 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.340
 application and carry out a small 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.290
 configuration process all this 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.950
 being guided and with explanations of 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.950
 how it is used 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.150
 After choosing which account 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.920
 user is going to create the copy there is only 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.880
 to select that this process be 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.880
 automatic or not 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.500
 and if you want to do it also 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.170
 through the data connection of the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.030
 user something not recommended if you 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.799
 they keep many photos and videos since 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.439
 You could end his fee and incur 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.840
 in expenses here you get a point 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.940
 important inside google photos and it's 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.799
 that there are two modes of use by a 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.360
 side this high quality that offers 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.190
 limited space and completely 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.509
 free as long as it does not matter 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.209
 compress the size of the photographs 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.200
 what has an almost imperceptible 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.300
 impact on the quality of the photos 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.220
 as well as the quality of the videos that 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.310
 have a resolution greater than 1080 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.200
 pixels on the other hand is the mode 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.299
 original that respects the size and quality 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.100
 of the contents but limited to a 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.769
 space of 15 gigabytes that can 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.209
 be extended by payments taking into 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.940
 account that current mobile phones do not 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.910
 often exceed the 1080p or full standard 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.799
 hd the most logical thing is to choose high quality 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.480
 to not worry about the space of 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.480
 storage or by pocket 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.480
 automatically the 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.989
 images collected from internal memory 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.989
 of the terminal 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.170
 when you open the menu and access settings 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.580
 it is possible to enter the copy menu of 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.950
 security to finish tuning 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.959
 some options 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.180
 issues such as limiting the rise of 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.860
 photos to a wifi network or allow the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.330
 application work with data from 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.330
 roaming abroad 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.129
 It is also interesting the option of 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.230
 activate the upload only when the mobile 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.430
 is loading or even compelling the 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.349
 application to make a copy 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.710
 absolutely of all the photos and 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.510
 videos stored in the terminal 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.130
 we must not lose sight of the 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.870
 possibility to select certain 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.850
 mobile folders to store your 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.470
 contained a useful option to do 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.690
 a backup of the contents 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.110
 from whatsapp instagram or any other 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.110
 application 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.060
 but google photos does not just act with a 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.920
 excellent tool to save 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.959
 automatically all images and 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.420
 videos also allows you to view the 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.849
 comfortably taking advantage of its search engine 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.680
 intelligent that detects and orders all 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.030
 the elements that are on screen like 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.920
 the example of dogs that you see in the 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.790
 video with more or less success in 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.790
 some clear cases 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.889
 this way you have all your photos and 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.690
 your videos in the cloud is to say in 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.699
 internet and it does not matter that you change 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.440
 determined to be broken or stolen 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.060
 because you will always be able to access 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.860
 them from any other always with 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.150
 your google account does not matter what it is 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.370
 Android IOS PC or Mac 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.580
 and you are going to back up 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.090
 all your photos 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.090
 ah
