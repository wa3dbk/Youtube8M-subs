00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.040
 mobile gigs and I'm at hp and have 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.130
 here's the new hp probook 11 that's one 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.550
 11.6 inch chromebook with 366 x 768 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.260
 pixel resolution 2 gb RAM 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.180
 and a 16gb ssd 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.470
 the device is interesting in that 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.960
 it is not an internet based 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.460
 product acts but a poor 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.190
 based device because that is the 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.330
 samsung exynos 53 clock in there so one 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.970
 double core cortex a15 processor with 1.7 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.650
 ghz I think that's the model 52 50th 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.580
 what we already got from the samsung market 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.960
 Chromebook know and should for 299 euro 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.489
 in germany a start will be 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.960
 also distributed via google is one 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.440
 special variant at the on the 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.780
 back 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.269
 google says this is the hp version 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.400
 and you recognize the product of hp below 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.129
 other things that we here on the 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.409
 friend have this imprint very much 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.629
 clearly there is also here to the 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.570
 around the keyboard around this green 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.010
 frame accordingly should that 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.450
 clearly identifiable are here 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.150
 below we have a big clickable 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.500
 trackpad and above there is a whole 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.539
 neat chiclet keyboard itself 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.939
 also not a bit if you are on it 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:21.250
 There are some special buttons for typing 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.500
 chrome os means you can in the 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.880
 browser back and forth navigate here 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.070
 next to it sits the reload 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.070
 Taste and people screen and a few 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.020
 other buttons control the device 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.299
 made a very good impression on top 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.520
 we have a little webcam about it and 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:40.060
 Overall, there is an ips panel in it 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.820
 the resolution is sufficient and the 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.630
 perspective are great extent what 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.859
 is still to say 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.509
 the term will be six and a half 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:49.090
 hours indicated that is certainly the 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.189
 poor cpu owe the weight probably 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.619
 at just under a kilogram and 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.229
 overall very interesting once briefly 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.329
 that's why I have the white version here 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.350
 It is very big 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.689
 There's one more 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.979
 black variant also very 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.590
 attracts many fingerprints 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.200
 but the plastic should stop the prices 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.420
 keep it low, there is a sim 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.660
 card slot so it's a 3d capable 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.150
 that comes on the market and on 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.930
 the back there is this 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.430
 green stripe behind the battery 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.430
 hides and which also ensures that 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.350
 it is stable that it is not kept 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.780
 At the bottom there's no chance 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.730
 the same sitting on the left side 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.890
 here is a headphone jack and two 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.769
 normal usb port as well as a micro usb 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.510
 port in reveals that I have is a 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.160
 arm device acts in this way 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.040
 the device is also loaded so one 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.239
 There is no real power connection 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.280
 total kept very very stupid the 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.440
 might be so one and a half 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.650
 centimeters were made very good 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.569
 impression and identification 1 coburg 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.610
 also contributes this strip up here 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.769
 with the google colors respectively 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.920
 the chrome colors so that everyone knows 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:01.340
 knows what he has in front of him namely that 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.690
 hp probook 11 that along with google 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.220
 comes to market and I was or 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.220
 good mobile gigs goodbye
