starts out right away as soon as you hop

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.229 
starts out right away as soon as you hop
out<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> car<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.460> have<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.820> run<00:00:36.030> up<00:00:36.149> on

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
out of the car you I have to run up on

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.360 
out of the car you I have to run up on
top<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.510> these<00:00:36.660> propane<00:00:37.050> tanks<00:00:37.469> jump<00:00:37.950> over<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
top of these propane tanks jump over the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.590 
top of these propane tanks jump over the
crane<00:00:38.640> now<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.850> might<00:00:39.030> need<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.300> strafe

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
crane now you might need to a strafe

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.000 
crane now you might need to a strafe
jump<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.960> make<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.200> easily<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.680> might<00:00:40.829> build<00:00:40.980> a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
jump to make it easily you might build a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.619 
jump to make it easily you might build a
bagel<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> sprint<00:00:41.700> but<00:00:41.850> try<00:00:42.030> strafing<00:00:42.360> cuz

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
bagel just a sprint but try strafing cuz

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.639 
bagel just a sprint but try strafing cuz
that's<00:00:42.780> just<00:00:42.989> gonna<00:00:43.079> make<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.290> lot<00:00:43.500> easier

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
that's just gonna make a lot easier

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.740 
that's just gonna make a lot easier
after<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.820> run<00:00:45.059> around<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.390> corner<00:00:45.719> of

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
after that you run around the corner of

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.110 
after that you run around the corner of
it<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.320> jump<00:00:46.649> off<00:00:46.770> into<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.129> water<00:00:47.280> once

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
it and just jump off into the water once

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.459 
it and just jump off into the water once
you're<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.329> water<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.320> run

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
you're in the water you have to run

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.979 
you're in the water you have to run
around<00:00:49.559> pretty<00:00:50.039> much<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.520> entire<00:00:50.730> map<00:00:51.660> it's

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
around pretty much the entire map it's

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.810 
around pretty much the entire map it's
not<00:00:52.170> just<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.590> quick<00:00:52.800> little<00:00:52.980> jaunt<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.550> where

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
not just a quick little jaunt to where

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.459 
not just a quick little jaunt to where
you<00:00:53.910> need<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.149> get<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.510> you're<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.260> end

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
you need to get to you're going to end

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.400 
you need to get to you're going to end
up<00:00:55.739> having<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.489> go<00:00:56.640> through<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.230> tanker<00:00:58.230> as

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
up having to go through this tanker as

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.209 
up having to go through this tanker as
well<00:00:58.920> as<00:00:59.250> up<00:01:00.090> quite<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> few<00:01:00.809> cliffs<00:01:01.320> now<00:01:01.859> once

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
well as up quite a few cliffs now once

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.250 
well as up quite a few cliffs now once
some<00:01:02.460> kind<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.120> end<00:01:03.420> goal<00:01:03.750> here<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.080> get

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
some kind of a end goal here is to get

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.530 
some kind of a end goal here is to get
on<00:01:04.350> top<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.769> building<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.850> when<00:01:06.390> you're<00:01:06.479> on

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
on top of a building and when you're on

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.300 
on top of a building and when you're on
top<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> building<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.290> can<00:01:07.439> use<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> turret

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
top of the building you can use a turret

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.219 
top of the building you can use a turret
to<00:01:08.490> kind<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.909> turn<00:01:09.390> around<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.900> see<00:01:10.110> yourself

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
to kind of turn around and see yourself

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.719 
to kind of turn around and see yourself
it's<00:01:10.650> kind<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.830> funky<00:01:11.159> because<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.520> shoot

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
it's kind of funky because you can shoot

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.580 
it's kind of funky because you can shoot
yourself<00:01:12.150> with<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.450> turret<00:01:12.750> although<00:01:13.439> you're

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
yourself with the turret although you're

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.080 
yourself with the turret although you're
Manning<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.070> which<00:01:14.189> doesn't<00:01:14.549> make<00:01:14.610> any<00:01:14.850> sense

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
Manning it which doesn't make any sense

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.310 
Manning it which doesn't make any sense
at<00:01:15.270> all<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.600> kind<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.780> funny<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.200> kind

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
at all so it's kind of funny it's kind

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.780 
at all so it's kind of funny it's kind
of<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.409> cool<00:01:16.530> glitch<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.490> as<00:01:17.610> well

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
of a cool glitch and it as well

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.070 
of a cool glitch and it as well
obviously<00:01:18.000> you're<00:01:18.390> outside<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> map<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.049> you

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
obviously you're outside the map so you

to hop through that wall and drop

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.700 
to hop through that wall and drop
underneath<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.140> map<00:01:40.290> now<00:01:40.470> once<00:01:40.619> you

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
underneath the map now once you

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.690

you're going to pop up back on top of

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.450 
you're going to pop up back on top of
the<00:01:52.079> map<00:01:52.259> here<00:01:52.560> there<00:01:52.890> won't<00:01:53.009> be<00:01:53.189> too<00:01:53.369> many

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.800 
the map here there won't be too many
enemies<00:01:53.670> but<00:01:54.000> occasionally<00:01:54.420> as<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.689> see

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
building now to use the turret like this

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:18.759 
building now to use the turret like this
you<00:02:17.780> need<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.019> start<00:02:18.260> going<00:02:18.349> in<00:02:18.530> your<00:02:18.620> air

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
you need to start going in your air

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.619 
you need to start going in your air
support<00:02:19.219> use<00:02:19.579> the<00:02:19.790> century<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:20.389> then<00:02:20.510> you're

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
support use the century so then you're

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.509 
support use the century so then you're
in<00:02:20.749> the<00:02:20.780> center<00:02:21.200> like<00:02:21.349> this<00:02:21.590> when<00:02:22.189> you're<00:02:22.400> in

in the center like this when you're in
the<00:02:22.670> century<00:02:23.030> then<00:02:23.180> use<00:02:23.510> your<00:02:23.540> air<00:02:23.840> support

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
the century then use your air support

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.259 
the century then use your air support
now<00:02:24.769> once<00:02:25.159> you're<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.459> air<00:02:25.489> support<00:02:25.939> it
