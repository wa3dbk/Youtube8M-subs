00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.230
 my dear friends who 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.329
 accompany the publisher cleufas 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.009
 our books accompany our website and 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.439
 also our blog 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.840
 I wanted to introduce a course that 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.180
 Believe in the Bible 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.699
 You know it's not easy to understand the 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.790
 bible because the bible was written there 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.670
 more or less over a period of 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:47.659
 1200 years ago there certainly started 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.149
 years before Christ until now, already 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:53.600
 It's about 1200 years, you know. 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.850
 that the bible was written in Greek in 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.549
 Hebrew and then translated into 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.470
 atchim for all other lines 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:03.019
 so it's not a very easy thing and 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.869
 another thing you know there is culture 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.450
 Today's Eastern Bible was written there 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.159
 Jews and even a different culture 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.009
 Ours in the West 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.680
 so that's not always the case 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.270
 figures of literature language that 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.210
 they wore there last us 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.869
 understands today just as well as the 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.560
 church that studies deeply 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.960
 life for many centuries the church knows 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.299
 interpret pe 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.869
 then is I recorded a course the course 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:39.049
 fairly long look I spent three years 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:43.100
 three years to record this course 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:48.560
 course is here in a collection of 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:51.709
 selection with 11 cds where is in each one 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.399
 you have many hours of 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.459
 recording 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.579
 to the whole are more or less 100 hours 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:01.100
 recording see well 100 hours 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.779
 It's not a one hour lecture because 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.509
 do not explain this is very important 

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:08.270
 you understand why you know that 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.240
 The Bible has 72 books 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.420
 sometimes we talk to 73 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.220
 is when we consider for example the 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.430
 book of jeremiah the book of 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.900
 Separate regrets of jeremiah 73 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.670
 when we put together 72 good 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.850
 so in this course I did I recorded 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.840
 a course on each 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.320
 one of the 72 flights 73 book agape explaining 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.810
 in detail what the genesis is each 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.270
 of its chapters, which means the 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.100
 deluge the tower of babel the creation of 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.540
 man of woman's creation sin 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.430
 original at last 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.670
 and so I went book by book 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.190
 detailing until arriving in the last book of 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.950
 apocalypse that the most difficult book 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.280
 you understand only from the apocalypse I 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.680
 I recorded about ten hours because you know 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.840
 that the apocalypse for example has things 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.010
 very difficult to understand and figures 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.840
 is that apocalyptic style has a 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.360
 literary style of Jews that is not 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.270
 easy to understand that beast with 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.120
 seven chips from there games 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.360
 I do not know how much wings that means 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.320
 in all this it has a meaning understand 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.990
 those ten years to 24 elders before the 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.180
 lamb worshiped by those four 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.630
 animals that mean the church 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.630
 you know then in this course we detail 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.630
 these explanations of genesis 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.660
 apocalypse so you do not make a 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.850
 wrong media reading because they are pedro 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:48.500
 in the second letter of chapter 3 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:52.280
 verse 16 2 pedro 36 are camilo was 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.100
 very very serious are pedro says that in the 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.740
 letters that are paulo wrote have things 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.810
 difficult to understand and that the 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.760
 ignorant spirits who want 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.190
 interpret on your own without 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.140
 follow the guidance of the church ends 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.030
 wrong interpreter are having said 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.130
 sometimes finding her own 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.240
 damnation 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.670
 look what an interesting thing they are 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.880
 Peter says if the person read the bible of 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.440
 wrong way wrong interpretation 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.790
 because the bible that anyone goes 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.060
 pick up will lead to understand correctly 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.730
 No, she can not go the wrong way. 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.850
 then we must understand and interpret the 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.700
 bible according to joinha so you do not 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.230
 take the wrong teaching then this 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.150
 Bible course and a business of this 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.200
 possible was based on the bible of 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.450
 Jerusalem 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.260
 in Bible study and was not underway 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:44.360
 in several other Catholic books and has 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.710
 the approval of the church over Libya 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.330
 so that you have a teaching 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.250
 correct about it 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.710
 so if you want to do a study 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.960
 of sacred scripture that the 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.720
 Londoners you think a year has to play 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.200
 three years to record the CD at least one 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.490
 year 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.200
 but you have the opportunity to make a 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.890
 home shooting at the time you 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.530
 can you understand then this course is 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:12.470
 being made available by the publisher clÃ©o
