independently suspended get the base the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.620 
independently suspended get the base the
same<00:00:29.390> so<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.420> distance<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.320> wheels<00:00:35.630> and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
same so the distance of the wheels and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.229 
same so the distance of the wheels and
the<00:00:36.840> original<00:00:37.290> car<00:00:37.590> has<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> v8<00:00:38.399> engine<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
back Skyline GTR the newest version has

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.250 
back Skyline GTR the newest version has
a<00:00:46.880> v6<00:00:47.880> engine<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.390> front<00:00:49.820> but<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.030> decided<00:00:51.989> to

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
a v6 engine in front but I decided to

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.200 
a v6 engine in front but I decided to
make<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:53.550> older<00:00:53.910> version<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:55.140> r34<00:00:55.969> and<00:00:56.969> that

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
make the older version the r34 and that

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.950 
make the older version the r34 and that
has<00:00:57.890> 60<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.039> there<00:00:59.190> straight<00:00:59.280> engine<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
has 60 on there straight engine in the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.469 
has 60 on there straight engine in the
front<00:01:01.850> so<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.879> made<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:05.119> remove<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.150> engine

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
front so I made it remove the engine

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.590 
front so I made it remove the engine
from<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.960> back<00:01:10.729> as<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.030> see<00:01:12.210> some

the<00:03:05.450> interior<00:03:06.049> is<00:03:06.760> still<00:03:07.760> same<00:03:08.180> steering

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
the interior is still same steering

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.430 
the interior is still same steering

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
wheel is on the left which it would be

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.690 
wheel is on the left which it would be
more<00:03:12.440> realistic<00:03:12.709> for<00:03:13.160> Skyline<00:03:13.670> Drive

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
more realistic for Skyline Drive

this<00:03:19.630> these<00:03:20.630> panels<00:03:21.140> you<00:03:21.260> can<00:03:21.290> still<00:03:21.709> find<00:03:21.980> the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
this these panels you can still find the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.890 
this these panels you can still find the
hand<00:03:22.340> of<00:03:22.459> growth<00:03:22.670> theory<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:25.690> some<00:03:26.690> empty

area<00:03:27.850> unfortunately<00:03:28.850> I<00:03:29.450> do<00:03:29.720> not<00:03:29.870> have

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
area unfortunately I do not have

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.570

or<00:03:32.510> other<00:03:33.510> equipment<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.379> make<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.830> a<00:03:35.129> radio

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
or other equipment to make it a radio

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.720 
or other equipment to make it a radio
control<00:03:36.530> because<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.739> could<00:03:38.040> always<00:03:38.280> be<00:03:38.459> an

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
control because it could always be an

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.399 
control because it could always be an
option<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.150> make<00:03:39.629> this<00:03:39.810> car<00:03:40.110> remote<00:03:40.829> control

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
option to make this car remote control

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.619 
option to make this car remote control
and<00:03:43.489> what<00:03:44.489> can<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.730> say<00:03:45.000> more
