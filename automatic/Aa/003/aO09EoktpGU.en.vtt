me I think that everyone can really do
that<00:06:40.410> no<00:06:41.010> matter<00:06:41.130> what<00:06:41.460> your<00:06:41.610> background<00:06:41.760> is

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
that no matter what your background is

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.940 
that no matter what your background is
or<00:06:42.390> where<00:06:42.540> you<00:06:42.600> come<00:06:42.780> from<00:06:42.840> and<00:06:43.260> I<00:06:43.530> think

or where you come from and I think

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.300 
or where you come from and I think
that's<00:06:44.130> what<00:06:44.370> we<00:06:44.490> wanted<00:06:45.030> to<00:06:45.150> communicate
