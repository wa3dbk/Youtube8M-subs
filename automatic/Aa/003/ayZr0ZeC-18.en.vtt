people<00:00:06.720> are<00:00:06.779> asking<00:00:06.899> you<00:00:07.230> know<00:00:07.319> what's<00:00:07.560> it

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
people are asking you know what's it

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.220 
people are asking you know what's it
look<00:00:07.799> like<00:00:07.830> in<00:00:08.010> low-light<00:00:08.610> situations<00:00:09.230> you

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
look like in low-light situations you

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.839 
look like in low-light situations you
know<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.469> also<00:00:10.769> you<00:00:11.309> know<00:00:11.400> we<00:00:11.490> get<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.670> pitch

black and a couple couple notes here
first<00:00:15.570> off<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.929> dig<00:00:16.139> I'll<00:00:16.289> also<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.650> lot<00:00:16.800> of

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
first off I dig I'll also a lot of

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.830 
first off I dig I'll also a lot of
comments<00:00:17.310> talking<00:00:17.699> about<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.000> TF<00:00:18.270> O's<00:00:18.480> which

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
comments talking about the TF O's which

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.689 
comments talking about the TF O's which
are<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.199> true<00:00:19.800> glow<00:00:20.660> trinium<00:00:21.660> /<00:00:22.279> fibre<00:00:23.279> optics

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
are the true glow trinium / fibre optics

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.849 
are the true glow trinium / fibre optics
and<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.600> they<00:00:24.750> do<00:00:24.810> actually<00:00:25.109> make<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> set

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
and that they do actually make a set

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.460 
and that they do actually make a set
that<00:00:26.580> some<00:00:26.939> fiber<00:00:27.269> optics<00:00:27.750> with<00:00:28.050> tritium

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
that some fiber optics with tritium

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.529 
that some fiber optics with tritium
files<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.460> inside<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.210> it's<00:00:30.359> actually

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
files on the inside so it's actually

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.269 
files on the inside so it's actually
both<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.170> know<00:00:31.260> during<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.740> day<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
both you know during the day you get the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.360 
both you know during the day you get the
nice<00:00:32.430> bright<00:00:32.750> fiber-optic<00:00:33.750> look<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.559> then<00:00:35.250> at

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
nice bright fiber-optic look and then at

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.430 
nice bright fiber-optic look and then at
night<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.640> get<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.880> trinium<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.719> do<00:00:37.170> want<00:00:37.410> to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
night you get the trinium I do want to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.810 
night you get the trinium I do want to
know<00:00:37.530> what<00:00:37.620> those<00:00:37.739> are<00:00:37.770> more<00:00:38.010> expensive<00:00:38.070> and

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
know what those are more expensive and

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.610 
know what those are more expensive and
at<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.540> time<00:00:39.750> when<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.020> bought<00:00:40.230> these<00:00:40.379> I

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
at the time when I bought these I

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.340 
at the time when I bought these I
actually<00:00:40.770> had<00:00:41.040> no<00:00:41.129> idea<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.460> even<00:00:41.579> offer<00:00:41.879> those

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
actually had no idea to even offer those

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.690 
actually had no idea to even offer those
but<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.559> quick<00:00:43.680> note<00:00:43.950> there<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.579> is

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
but just a quick note there so that is

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.549 
but just a quick note there so that is
probably<00:00:45.210> your<00:00:45.480> best<00:00:45.539> bet<00:00:45.870> because<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.440> get

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
probably your best bet because you get

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.290 
probably your best bet because you get
the<00:00:46.649> best<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.980> both<00:00:47.100> worlds<00:00:47.520> really<00:00:47.940> bright

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
the best of both worlds really bright

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.150 
the best of both worlds really bright
during<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.660> day<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.079> then<00:00:49.649> super<00:00:49.980> bright

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
during the day and then super bright

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.490 
during the day and then super bright
again<00:00:50.460> at<00:00:50.789> night<00:00:51.110> but<00:00:52.110> there<00:00:52.199> are<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> little

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
again at night but there are a little

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.200 
again at night but there are a little
bit<00:00:52.590> more<00:00:52.710> expensive<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.969> set<00:00:54.180> I

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
bit more expensive the this set I

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.810 
bit more expensive the this set I
believe<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.660> paid<00:00:54.840> 50<00:00:55.230> or<00:00:55.320> 60<00:00:55.649> for<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.129> think<00:00:56.550> it's

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
believe I paid 50 or 60 for I think it's

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.450 
believe I paid 50 or 60 for I think it's
80<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.570> TF<00:00:57.840> OS<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.710> well<00:00:58.890> worth<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.280> you

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
80 for the TF OS but well worth it you

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.000 
80 for the TF OS but well worth it you
know<00:00:59.579> it's<00:00:59.699> still<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> great<00:01:00.059> great<00:01:00.600> option

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
know it's still a great great option

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.950 
know it's still a great great option
anyway<00:01:02.010> I'm<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.520> my<00:01:02.699> bedroom<00:01:02.910> here<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.809> my

if<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.229> little<00:01:19.259> fuzzy<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:20.880> see

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
if it's a little fuzzy but you can see

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.630 
if it's a little fuzzy but you can see
as<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.110> light<00:01:22.290> drops<00:01:22.830> down<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.100> little<00:01:23.340> bit<00:01:23.460> on

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
as the light drops down a little bit on

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.429 
as the light drops down a little bit on
the<00:01:23.729> left<00:01:23.939> those<00:01:24.390> night<00:01:24.630> sights<00:01:24.930> are<00:01:25.110> starting

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the left those night sights are starting

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.530 
the left those night sights are starting
to<00:01:25.590> actually<00:01:26.189> brighten<00:01:26.790> up<00:01:26.909> which<00:01:27.360> they're

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
to actually brighten up which they're

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.569 
to actually brighten up which they're
supposed<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.350> light<00:01:28.500> goes<00:01:28.650> down<00:01:28.890> they

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
supposed to as the light goes down they

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.910 
supposed to as the light goes down they
get<00:01:29.729> brighter<00:01:29.970> now<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.320> with<00:01:31.470> my<00:01:31.680> room

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
get brighter now it's just with my room

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.550 
get brighter now it's just with my room
light<00:01:32.130> here<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.520> see<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> fiber<00:01:32.909> optics

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
light here you can see the fiber optics

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.960 
light here you can see the fiber optics
they're<00:01:34.560> not<00:01:34.710> glowing<00:01:35.250> like<00:01:35.759> they<00:01:35.909> were

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
they're not glowing like they were

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.390 
they're not glowing like they were
during<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.509> day<00:01:36.659> when<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:36.960> was<00:01:37.049> brighter<00:01:37.400> they

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
during the day when it was brighter they

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.830 
during the day when it was brighter they
just<00:01:38.610> basically<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:39.150> looked<00:01:39.360> green<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.720> red

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
just basically just looked green and red

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
that front sight is only relying on

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.250

that that front sight even though again
it's<00:02:56.280> relying<00:02:56.550> on<00:02:56.700> light<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:58.320> be<00:02:58.440> visible<00:02:58.740> even

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
it's relying on light to be visible even

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.290 
that front sight which is obviously is a
more<00:03:03.840> important<00:03:04.170> than<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.320> rear<00:03:04.470> sights<00:03:04.710> even

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
more important than the rear sights even

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.970 
more important than the rear sights even
so<00:03:06.300> just<00:03:06.540> want<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:06.930> point<00:03:07.140> that<00:03:07.230> out<00:03:07.470> but<00:03:07.680> the

a little comparison that there's a you

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.450 
a little comparison that there's a you

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
moment almost almost pitch-black so no I

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.020 
moment almost almost pitch-black so no I
just<00:03:34.530> want<00:03:34.800> to<00:03:34.830> do<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:34.950> little<00:03:35.130> another<00:03:35.940> a

just want to do a little another a
little<00:03:36.180> comparison<00:03:36.780> video<00:03:37.140> for<00:03:37.440> everyone<00:03:38.010> who

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
little comparison video for everyone who

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.310 
little comparison video for everyone who
asks<00:03:38.160> or<00:03:38.520> look<00:03:38.640> like<00:03:38.850> in<00:03:39.840> different<00:03:40.170> lighting

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
asks or look like in different lighting

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.440 
asks or look like in different lighting
situations<00:03:40.670> again<00:03:41.670> even<00:03:41.970> though<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.150> can<00:03:42.270> see

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
situations again even though you can see

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.130 
situations again even though you can see
that<00:03:42.570> red<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:43.050> little<00:03:43.530> bit<00:03:43.620> on<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:44.870> I'm<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.960> Glock

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
that red a little bit on the I'm a Glock

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.910 
that red a little bit on the I'm a Glock
17<00:03:46.760> not<00:03:47.760> trusted<00:03:48.240> for<00:03:48.420> nighttime<00:03:48.570> use<00:03:48.960> if<00:03:49.770> you

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
17 not trusted for nighttime use if you

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.680 
17 not trusted for nighttime use if you
like<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.610> idea<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.030> optics<00:03:51.420> or

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
like the the idea of the optics or

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.180 
like the the idea of the optics or
excuse<00:03:51.990> me<00:03:52.020> if<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.320> like<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.560> idea<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.890> the

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
excuse me if you like the idea of the

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.180 
excuse me if you like the idea of the
fiber<00:03:53.400> optic<00:03:53.820> sights<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:54.930> still<00:03:55.800> want<00:03:56.040> on

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
fiber optic sights and you still want on

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.760 
fiber optic sights and you still want on
a<00:03:56.220> carry<00:03:56.520> gun<00:03:56.960> definitely<00:03:57.960> look<00:03:58.080> into<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.410> the

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
a carry gun definitely look into the the

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.130 
a carry gun definitely look into the the
t<00:03:58.920> fos<00:03:59.280> which<00:03:59.790> are<00:03:59.940> both<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.420> fiber<00:04:00.750> optic

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
t fos which are both the fiber optic

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.290 
t fos which are both the fiber optic
sights<00:04:01.950> as<00:04:02.190> well<00:04:02.340> as<00:04:02.490> having<00:04:02.670> tritium<00:04:03.060> in<00:04:03.180> them

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
sights as well as having tritium in them

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.150 
sights as well as having tritium in them
so<00:04:03.810> you<00:04:03.870> do<00:04:03.990> have<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.230> nighttime<00:04:04.560> capability

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
so you do have the nighttime capability

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.130 
so you do have the nighttime capability
but<00:04:06.060> that's<00:04:06.300> all<00:04:06.450> thanks<00:04:06.720> for<00:04:06.750> watching<00:04:07.050> guys

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
but that's all thanks for watching guys
