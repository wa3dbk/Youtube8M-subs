00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello together yes it goes out to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.910
 take pictures and ask all questions 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.370
 What kind of objective do I take on 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.840
 the camera with that out, that's me 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.179
 usually you always have the wrong one 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.309
 objective with it I want to go out 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.109
 to take pictures and taxis 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.930
 Ultra wide angle on it but then I see 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.029
 any animals in far off 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.769
 but I have no big to with it 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.050
 does not work then i have 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.359
 Macro lens on the camera wants 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.220
 take pictures of small things then see 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.660
 I am a horny panorama the clouds 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.660
 I want to be great here and great 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.070
 Panorama does not work either 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.540
 There are different ones for this problem 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.790
 solution that I can offer you 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.320
 on the one hand her header of objective what 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.809
 covers in the large focal length range 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.370
 So from eg 18 to 250 mm 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.950
 you have a bit optically 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.600
 Disadvantage world these lenses up to 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.789
 you can take pictures that are just as sharp 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.379
 Objectives the lesser to the area 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.449
 to have 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.860
 The second chamber backpack was in the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.899
 whole kladderadatsch write grabs 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.640
 has the disadvantage that we always have a lot 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.230
 have weight on the back and you are 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.460
 not so flexible if you are objective 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.100
 wanted to swap constantly the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.439
 rucksack pull off direction rhine out 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.869
 direction I need you so much advantage 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.520
 the third option you just grab 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.110
 someone with one of the whole stuff 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.659
 Of course I wear the best for you 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.430
 solution if you have such a great for 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.600
 I have no one I have to mean 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.100
 whole kladderadatsch always yourself 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.290
 That's why it's for me 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.580
 fourth solution and on the best and how 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.150
 that looks like I'll show you today 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.920
 Have fun with the ideal system 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.290
 What I discovered for myself 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.540
 this dome carry you stand opel 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.220
 is called this broad god here and 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.530
 Wear it , just stand here 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.909
 This shoulder is where you do it 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.710
 can hang it all up 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.450
 that has the advantage that the weight 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.100
 ideally distributed over the whole room 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.840
 I do not have a point of the author 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.329
 shoulder with the backpack but it 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.270
 this whole paddock will also be distributed 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.070
 I have different at the dome 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.540
 to look at things that is so modular 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.310
 to stand and although there are different 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.899
 Towels bags were made according to size 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.079
 Various lenses fit in here 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.520
 For example, quiver bag for small 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.229
 wide-angle lens and fischer here goes 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.049
 there are bigger ones for example 70 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.149
 200mm we have others too 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.530
 functional bags the next one 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.720
 For example, they have to do with objectives 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.310
 here if you go longer 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.590
 for example, setting the bottle or 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.390
 in the back there are also multi functions 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.190
 bags where i am now and lightning in there 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.010
 have or mobile purse 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.530
 the gopro city ​​in it different things 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.850
 just to always have to have it 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.260
 because if you look up, for example 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.090
 The event is bad 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.190
 possibility somewhere his backpack 1 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.720
 to decide to have a yes or a need there 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.580
 I had to do something again 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.170
 pick up the whole day again here 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.820
 I do not have this problem because of me 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.890
 really as in the body what I need 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.930
 and in contrast to the backpack we too 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.700
 really stand to revise the 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.740
 means I can with one hand here 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.390
 rausholen different things when I 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.720
 I can win and rear access 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.530
 memory cards through the things then to 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.820
 bring the camera 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.600
 that just has a huge advantage 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.400
 opposite the backpack of the manufacturer 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.570
 I praise the pro called the suite 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.910
 recommends system 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.350
 You now have your problems getting it 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.850
 to order over the internet because of 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.560
 manufacturer loewe has said next 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.540
 I do not want to do it because of that 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.040
 hard price war will make us the 30 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.810
 broken we love the dear to the 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.120
 Fachhändler out there you have to first 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.670
 look where this system finds the 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.170
 the problem is yes I can 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.250
 Of course, one in front of his advantage 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.440
 be waiting for me problem that we 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.000
 buy this whole stuff yourself together 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.950
 is it says you can not produce so 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.180
 but the dome is easy to buy 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.310
 buy separately 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.450
 the bags shopping so can you 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.760
 your individual system 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.720
 compile 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.360
 the price is not the whole thing 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.910
 cheap sure so in quality coaches 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.620
 always money as it looks here with the 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.760
 different bags 350 to 400 euros 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.920
 you have to expect 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.780
 he said that I'm way too much me 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.670
 maybe I need it now and then 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.200
 also there a cheap alternative of 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:55.650
 yourselves for you and was it me here 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:59.130
 Bundeswehr carry-on system, of course 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.690
 not quite so nice yes you can too 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.220
 Here various bags since anknipsen 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.989
 you just have to go to the army shop 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.760
 look what there is and must be there 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.230
 of course to say that this 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.940
 bag of course not birth ward 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.590
 So I would not be objective like that 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.230
 maybe just put in another one 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.959
 bit with 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.709
 between upholstery material feel that it 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.560
 holds better and the advantage of it is 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.229
 just so cheap 10 euros in each 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.910
 used and the shop is disadvantageous 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.500
 do not stop it is not at all 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.720
 that means all the weight is tested 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.949
 by naturally in the soil have to go in there 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.639
 you yourself the best solution for you 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.440
 Find 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.880
 For one, I would use these systems as well 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.710
 not necessarily at a wedding now 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.389
 want to attract yes a reportage was 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.550
 So there is about the perhaps a 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.800
 a little stupid about it even me with 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.139
 My clothes would be different 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.130
 to take 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.780
 I hope the tip has you again 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.090
 advanced and if you have questions 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.710
 As always, I write message 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.880
 I'm looking forward to see you next time 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.620
 until then job if you already own 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.810
 from this system side I still have 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.310
 two tips for you and that's how it came about 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.380
 always happen that one with these 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.389
 bags hanging somewhere in the strip 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.289
 stay as thorn or both 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:11.210
 witness or whatever it is 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.850
 repaired gets there if so 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.139
 just have a torn tanz t 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.610
 sticking on it keeps wonderful I have 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.710
 Stick this here for a year now 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.110
 just do not go away and it keeps that 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.789
 material also fish together the second one 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.969
 Tip I have such a carbine here 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.219
 Outside 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:28.079
 has brought sports is here 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.599
 this so-called behring to the bearded 

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:32.219
 made fish and has the advantage that 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:34.139
 I here with a hand all the stuff 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:36.149
 then transport from the car 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.679
 or I do not have to stop over here 

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:39.360
 this whole stuff together but me 

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:40.709
 it can be loose on this carbine 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.209
 hold and I have the opportunity 

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:44.069
 there are more 

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:45.569
 equipment then one 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:48.329
 to fasten the carabiner 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:51.239
 the ezb then no longer pass no more space 

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:53.429
 have or lens hood still fresh 

00:05:51.239 --> 00:05:55.529
 make depending on what I hold a field 

00:05:53.429 --> 00:05:59.009
 that is a useful supplement 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:59.819
 material unofficially everything clear that 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:02.269
 That's it 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:02.269
 until then
