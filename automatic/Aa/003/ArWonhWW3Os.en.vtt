00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
and it was a little bit misleading a lot

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.210 
and it was a little bit misleading a lot
of<00:03:05.410> people<00:03:05.530> thought<00:03:05.770> it<00:03:05.890> was<00:03:05.980> going<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.130> be

something to do with gold prices the
market<00:03:08.440> is<00:03:08.560> actually<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.430> second<00:03:10.030> stage<00:03:10.510> in

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
market is actually the second stage in

market is actually the second stage in
this<00:03:11.140> game<00:03:11.380> so<00:03:11.740> it's<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:11.920> one<00:03:12.070> where<00:03:12.160> you

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280

this game so it's the one where you
fight<00:03:12.490> akalitis<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.660> it's<00:03:13.810> got<00:03:13.960> actually<00:03:14.170> got

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
fight akalitis so it's got actually got

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.990 
fight akalitis so it's got actually got
nothing<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.620> do<00:03:14.740> with<00:03:15.070> lowering<00:03:15.460> costs<00:03:15.850> or

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
anything all it was you basically get

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.280 
anything all it was you basically get
double<00:03:17.770> fame<00:03:18.070> in<00:03:18.370> this<00:03:18.580> area<00:03:19.030> which<00:03:20.020> obviously

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
double fame in this area which obviously

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.540 
double fame in this area which obviously
is<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.500> bit<00:03:20.620> pointless<00:03:20.800> for<00:03:21.070> me<00:03:21.130> I'm<00:03:21.310> at<00:03:21.460> level

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
is a bit pointless for me I'm at level

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.270 
is a bit pointless for me I'm at level
50<00:03:22.060> but<00:03:22.209> for<00:03:22.330> other<00:03:22.450> people<00:03:22.870> hina<00:03:23.860> pointless

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
50 but for other people hina pointless

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.320 
50 but for other people hina pointless
as<00:03:24.400> well<00:03:24.580> because<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:24.880> could<00:03:25.060> just<00:03:25.150> go

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
as well because you could just go

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.670 
as well because you could just go
somewhere<00:03:25.690> else<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:26.200> would<00:03:26.260> have<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.470> much

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
somewhere else that would have a much

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.320 
somewhere else that would have a much
higher<00:03:26.920> rating<00:03:27.490> normally<00:03:27.880> so<00:03:28.060> if<00:03:28.120> you've<00:03:28.240> been

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
higher rating normally so if you've been

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.180 
higher rating normally so if you've been
spectacularly<00:03:29.020> going<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.260> get<00:03:29.380> 500<00:03:29.980> for

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
spectacularly going to get 500 for

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.370 
spectacularly going to get 500 for
example<00:03:30.700> but<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.600> good<00:03:31.750> thing<00:03:31.780> is<00:03:31.990> that<00:03:32.140> they

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
example but the good thing is that they

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.199 
example but the good thing is that they
did<00:03:32.560> introduce<00:03:32.950> this<00:03:33.130> new<00:03:33.310> perks<00:03:33.580> route<00:03:33.940> of
