00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.549
 which allows to have the download more 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.170
 quickly his files by combining 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.939
 wifi and mobile data you have the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.610
 ultra power saving mode 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.780
 to see that a fashion 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.150
 so I show you and that all to 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.740
 the time I'm just telling you that there is so 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.920
 to you and all the parameters of the galaxy 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.320
 s 5 you really have or then you 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.220
 already have the application messages had 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.900
 already internet 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.650
 there you have the video application in addition 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.350
 you have a voice recorder in addition 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.850
 after that that's all you have 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:48.689
 in addition then in the settings 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.460
 you said the ultra known mode the 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.070
 ultra pop and energy saving mode 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.270
 so I 'm going to throw it then that's it 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.560
 it's a way that makes it possible to 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.090
 the black and white screen and you have more 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.170
 some functions and it allows to 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.200
 make a tale visible to the shots of 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.929
 battery that's me me then I 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.219
 wait a little bit it's a little slow but 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.160
 I still had to battery hundred I 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.680
 put my lifestyle is as true 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.280
 energy 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:17.379
 so that's it so I knew that it takes away 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.760
 all it bluetooth data 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:23.860
 mobile wifi all that and you can see 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.019
 access to some settings this is a 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.489
 wifi bluetooth mode online networks 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.030
 mobile not to see this battery 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.680
 to be able to use the gps the 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.480
 brightness the sound is all there is 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.799
 from more basic and after you can 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.670
 choose some more apps 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.950
 can use 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.620
 I chose some and after 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.489
 when you use its applications 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.420
 it will be all black and white 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:49.180
 so here I have to be enabled this mode 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.319
 ok there it was also it makes me and 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.180
 it's really convenient when you have 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.599
 more than kind 20% battery or had to 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.239
 hold at five o'clock with 100 of 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:06.910
 charge and it really works it works 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:10.239
 really short as I said that's it 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.989
 walk really here it is 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.989
 so 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.120
 well here it will be everything I believe me I 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.650
 would put the link to download this 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.150
 rom in description 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.850
 so to be for the lady installed 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.020
 on the galaxy s 4 you will have to install 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.000
 recovery mode 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.290
 so you searched the internet because 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.780
 that I can not do that that ace 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.600
 rome is already installed you install this 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.720
 recovery mode you flash the astro 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.740
 is in the link and you make a full 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.910
 wipe before you do a full web and 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.520
 you let go then 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.840
 and there you will have this rom here it is 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.630
 as simple as that it's really not 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.100
 complicated and it's really fluid that 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.470

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.430
