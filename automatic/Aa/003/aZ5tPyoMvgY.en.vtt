that's kind of what what I was looking
for<00:00:29.939> with<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:31.399> this<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> liner-lock

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
for with this one this is a liner-lock

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.620 
for with this one this is a liner-lock
knife<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:34.110> has<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.590> g10<00:00:35.550> scales<00:00:35.850> it's

knife it has the g10 scales it's

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.520 
knife it has the g10 scales it's
fiberglass<00:00:36.960> material<00:00:38.270> full<00:00:39.270> liners<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:40.379> can

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
fiberglass material full liners you can

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.790 
fiberglass material full liners you can
see<00:00:40.710> there<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.730> liners<00:00:42.120> are<00:00:42.410> skeletonized<00:00:43.410> to

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
see there the liners are skeletonized to

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.889 
see there the liners are skeletonized to
save<00:00:44.129> weight<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.879> if<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.210> see<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.570> there<00:00:45.750> you

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
save weight so if we see in there you

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.660 
save weight so if we see in there you
can<00:00:46.050> kind<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.379> see<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.739> little<00:00:46.920> holes<00:00:47.160> drilled

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
can kind of see the little holes drilled

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.639 
can kind of see the little holes drilled
in<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.120> liners<00:00:49.129> that<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:50.550> weight<00:00:50.730> savings

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
in the liners that is for weight savings

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.930 
in the liners that is for weight savings
now<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.710> weight<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.309> knife<00:00:53.520> they<00:00:53.760> do

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
now the weight on this knife they do

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.979 
now the weight on this knife they do
specify<00:00:54.629> at<00:00:55.579> three<00:00:56.579> point<00:00:56.910> three<00:00:57.000> ounces

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
specify at three point three ounces

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.799 
specify at three point three ounces
I<00:00:58.190> just<00:00:59.190> weighed<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.359> weighed<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.660> at

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
I just weighed it and it weighed in at

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.959 
I just weighed it and it weighed in at
three<00:01:01.020> point<00:01:01.289> seven<00:01:01.590> ounces<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.699> think

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
three point seven ounces so I think

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.520 
three point seven ounces so I think
they're<00:01:03.359> fitting<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.930> little<00:01:04.170> bit<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
they're fitting a little bit on the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.789 
they're fitting a little bit on the
weight<00:01:05.840> weight<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.110> range<00:01:07.350> does<00:01:07.560> make<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
weight weight and that range does make a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.310 
weight weight and that range does make a
big<00:01:08.070> difference<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.549> your<00:01:08.580> pocket<00:01:09.030> but<00:01:09.320> three

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
big difference in your pocket but three

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.420 
big difference in your pocket but three
point<00:01:10.530> seven<00:01:10.740> still<00:01:11.070> acceptable<00:01:11.750> I<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:14.130> check

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
point seven still acceptable I to check

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.550 
point seven still acceptable I to check
my<00:01:14.970> scale<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.360> actually<00:01:15.720> weighed<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> knife<00:01:16.290> at

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
my scale I actually weighed a knife at

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.399 
my scale I actually weighed a knife at
weighed<00:01:16.890> 3.7<00:01:17.700> ounces<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.270> was<00:01:18.869> specified

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
weighed 3.7 ounces and was specified

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.340 
weighed 3.7 ounces and was specified
three<00:01:19.590> point<00:01:19.830> seven<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.659> it<00:01:21.659> still<00:01:22.080> says

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
three point seven and it still says

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.020 
three point seven and it still says
three<00:01:22.590> point<00:01:22.830> seven<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.280> scale<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:23.850> so

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
three point seven on the scale but so

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.609 
three point seven on the scale but so
does<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.330> one<00:01:24.540> even<00:01:24.869> though<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.229> respect

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
does this one even though it's respect

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.590 
does this one even though it's respect
lower<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.130> think<00:01:26.400> three<00:01:27.000> point<00:01:27.240> seven<00:01:27.390> is

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
lower so I think three point seven is

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.390 
lower so I think three point seven is
probably<00:01:27.960> accurate<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:30.079> so<00:01:31.400> couple

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
probably accurate for this so couple

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.310 
probably accurate for this so couple
neat<00:01:32.610> things<00:01:32.850> about<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.180> knife<00:01:33.329> I'll<00:01:33.960> flip<00:01:34.229> it

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
neat things about the knife I'll flip it

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.890 
neat things about the knife I'll flip it
up<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.470> we've<00:01:34.680> got<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.979> thumb<00:01:35.720> thumb<00:01:36.720> hole

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
up and we've got the thumb thumb hole

and<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:14.129> thumb<00:02:14.370> ramp<00:02:14.610> here<00:02:14.879> so<00:02:15.599> your<00:02:15.750> hand

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
and a thumb ramp here so your hand

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.440 
and a thumb ramp here so your hand
doesn't<00:02:16.549> slide<00:02:17.549> into<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.909> blade<00:02:18.150> if<00:02:18.299> you're

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
doesn't slide into the blade if you're

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.490 
doesn't slide into the blade if you're
pushing<00:02:18.659> with<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.780> then<00:02:21.780> then<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.319> course

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
pushing with it and then then of course

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.780 
pushing with it and then then of course
the<00:02:22.650> lock<00:02:23.220> here<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:25.440> do<00:02:25.590> have<00:02:25.830> some<00:02:26.129> some

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
the lock here you do have some some

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.520 
the lock here you do have some some
blade<00:02:27.000> retention<00:02:27.480> there's<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.840> detent<00:02:28.290> there

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
blade retention there's a detent there

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.770 
blade retention there's a detent there
so<00:02:29.129> it's<00:02:29.340> it's<00:02:29.670> got<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:29.970> decent<00:02:30.360> amount<00:02:30.599> of

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
so it's it's got a decent amount of

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.330 
so it's it's got a decent amount of
force<00:02:30.989> it's<00:02:31.140> not<00:02:31.319> super<00:02:31.739> hard<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:31.980> open<00:02:32.099> but

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
force it's not super hard to open but

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.559 
force it's not super hard to open but
it's<00:02:32.459> not<00:02:32.579> going<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.790> pop<00:02:32.940> open<00:02:33.180> in<00:02:33.450> your

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
it's not going to pop open in your

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.530 
it's not going to pop open in your
pocket<00:02:33.989> either<00:02:34.129> so<00:02:35.129> really<00:02:35.579> cool<00:02:35.730> blade<00:02:36.030> what

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
pocket either so really cool blade what

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.630 
pocket either so really cool blade what
they<00:02:36.629> call<00:02:36.810> pillar<00:02:37.019> construction<00:02:37.709> so<00:02:38.430> it's<00:02:38.579> an

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
they call pillar construction so it's an

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.819 
they call pillar construction so it's an
open<00:02:38.760> back<00:02:39.090> with<00:02:39.780> little<00:02:40.170> pillars<00:02:40.440> keeping

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
open back with little pillars keeping

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.899 
open back with little pillars keeping
the<00:02:40.980> scales<00:02:41.700> apart<00:02:42.120> there<00:02:43.579> one<00:02:44.579> thing<00:02:44.760> that's

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
the scales apart there one thing that's

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.880 
the scales apart there one thing that's
real<00:02:45.090> neat<00:02:45.299> about<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.959> pocket<00:02:46.379> clip<00:02:46.590> it

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
real neat about it is the pocket clip it

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.339 
real neat about it is the pocket clip it
has<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.280> rounded<00:02:47.760> edge<00:02:47.910> for<00:02:48.239> one<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.290> doesn't

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
has a rounded edge for one so it doesn't

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.319 
has a rounded edge for one so it doesn't
catch<00:02:49.739> on<00:02:49.920> stuff<00:02:50.250> when<00:02:50.459> you're<00:02:50.549> walking<00:02:50.700> by<00:02:51.030> or

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
catch on stuff when you're walking by or

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.880 
catch on stuff when you're walking by or
scratch<00:02:51.810> things<00:02:52.109> when<00:02:52.349> you're<00:02:52.470> walking<00:02:52.769> by

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
scratch things when you're walking by

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.830 
scratch things when you're walking by
I've<00:02:53.609> noticed<00:02:53.970> that's<00:02:54.150> actually<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.599> problem

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
I've noticed that's actually a problem

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.150 
I've noticed that's actually a problem
with<00:02:55.049> some<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.260> them<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.560> are<00:02:55.620> squared<00:02:56.040> off

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
with some of them that are squared off

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.670 
with some of them that are squared off
and<00:02:56.340> if<00:02:56.430> sharp<00:02:56.700> corners<00:02:57.090> here<00:02:57.379> when<00:02:58.379> you<00:02:58.470> walk

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
and if sharp corners here when you walk

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.380 
and if sharp corners here when you walk
by<00:02:58.890> something<00:02:59.190> piece<00:02:59.790> of<00:02:59.940> furniture<00:03:00.120> or

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
by something piece of furniture or

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.750 
by something piece of furniture or
something<00:03:00.599> that<00:03:01.230> will<00:03:01.349> scratch<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.190> that's

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
something that will scratch it so that's

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.080 
something that will scratch it so that's
one<00:03:03.060> thing<00:03:03.299> nice<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.690> note<00:03:04.430> at<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.579> Spyderco

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
one thing nice to note at the Spyderco

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.759 
one thing nice to note at the Spyderco
spider<00:03:06.540> logo<00:03:06.930> there<00:03:07.250> one<00:03:08.250> other<00:03:08.370> thing<00:03:08.700> the

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
spider logo there one other thing the

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.770 
spider logo there one other thing the
some<00:03:10.769> knives<00:03:10.980> are<00:03:11.190> tip<00:03:11.340> up<00:03:11.519> carry<00:03:11.909> tip<00:03:12.599> of<00:03:12.720> the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
some knives are tip up carry tip of the

blade up summer tip down this is

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.140 
blade up summer tip down this is
actually<00:03:16.290> ambidextrous<00:03:17.099> tip<00:03:17.340> up<00:03:17.489> or<00:03:17.730> tip<00:03:17.940> down

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
actually ambidextrous tip up or tip down

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.599 
actually ambidextrous tip up or tip down
because<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:19.139> have<00:03:19.169> mounts<00:03:19.799> for<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.280> pocket

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
because you have mounts for the pocket

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.530 
because you have mounts for the pocket
clip<00:03:20.930> top<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.139> bottom<00:03:22.470> both<00:03:23.069> sides<00:03:23.510> so<00:03:24.510> you

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
clip top and bottom both sides so you

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.089 
clip top and bottom both sides so you
can<00:03:24.810> move<00:03:25.019> that<00:03:25.230> clip<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.620> wherever<00:03:25.829> you<00:03:26.069> want

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
can move that clip to wherever you want

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.030 
can move that clip to wherever you want
it<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.489> suit<00:03:27.180> how<00:03:27.359> you<00:03:27.419> like<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.690> carry<00:03:27.989> so<00:03:28.380> very
