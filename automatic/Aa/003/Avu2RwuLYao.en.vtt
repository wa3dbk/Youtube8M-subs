disinterested in monogamy jezebel bit of
a<00:01:15.060> trap<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.540> see<00:01:15.780> when<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.020> say<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> carbon<00:01:16.470> is

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
a trap I see when I say a carbon is

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.929 
a trap I see when I say a carbon is
small<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> mean<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.310> actually<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.909> know

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
small I mean that it's actually you know

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.749 
small I mean that it's actually you know
as<00:01:18.180> an<00:01:18.600> atom<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.380> relatively<00:01:19.979> small<00:01:20.130> atom

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
as an atom it's a relatively small atom

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.149 
as an atom it's a relatively small atom
it<00:01:20.880> has<00:01:20.909> six<00:01:21.659> protons<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.290> six<00:01:22.380> neutrons<00:01:22.619> for

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
it has six protons and six neutrons for

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.980 
it has six protons and six neutrons for
a<00:01:23.220> total<00:01:23.549> atomic<00:01:23.909> weight<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.119> 12<00:01:24.509> because<00:01:24.900> of

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
a total atomic weight of 12 because of

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.179 
a total atomic weight of 12 because of
that<00:01:25.080> carbon<00:01:25.500> doesn't<00:01:25.650> take<00:01:25.860> up<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.009> lot<00:01:26.040> of

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
that carbon doesn't take up a lot of

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.880 
that carbon doesn't take up a lot of
space<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.729> carbon<00:01:27.150> can<00:01:27.330> form<00:01:27.360> itself<00:01:27.960> into

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
space and so carbon can form itself into

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.270 
space and so carbon can form itself into
weird<00:01:29.310> rings<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.180> sheets<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.380> spirals<00:01:32.100> and

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
weird rings and sheets and spirals and

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.130 
weird rings and sheets and spirals and
double<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.790> even<00:01:32.880> triple<00:01:33.090> bonds<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.079> do

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
double and even triple bonds it can do

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.719 
double and even triple bonds it can do
all<00:01:34.409> sorts<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.860> things<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.189> could<00:01:35.460> never<00:01:35.640> be

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
all sorts of things that could never be

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.870 
all sorts of things that could never be
accomplished<00:01:36.360> by<00:01:36.509> more<00:01:37.320> bulky<00:01:38.220> atoms<00:01:38.729> it

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
accomplished by more bulky atoms it

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.840 
accomplished by more bulky atoms it
basically<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:40.530> know<00:01:40.619> your<00:01:40.890> your<00:01:41.189> atomic

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
basically you know your your atomic

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.420 
basically you know your your atomic
equivalent<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.869> an<00:01:43.320> Olympic<00:01:43.560> gymnast<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.310> can

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
equivalent of an Olympic gymnast it can

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.039 
equivalent of an Olympic gymnast it can
only<00:01:44.549> do<00:01:44.909> all<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.180> those<00:01:45.360> wonderful<00:01:45.840> beautiful

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
only do all of those wonderful beautiful

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.620 
only do all of those wonderful beautiful
elegant<00:01:46.530> things<00:01:46.799> because<00:01:47.520> it's<00:01:47.670> kind<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.240> tiny

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
elegant things because it's kind of tiny

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.020 
elegant things because it's kind of tiny
I<00:01:48.780> also<00:01:48.899> said<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.259> carbon<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.890> kind<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
I also said that carbon is kind and

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.149 
I also said that carbon is kind and
that's<00:01:51.180> an<00:01:51.329> interesting<00:01:51.479> sort<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.200> thing<00:01:52.979> to

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
that's an interesting sort of thing to

know<00:05:20.140> some<00:05:20.440> examples<00:05:20.980> of<00:05:21.100> lipids<00:05:21.580> oh<00:05:21.810> I<00:05:22.810> think

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
know some examples of lipids oh I think

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.710 
know some examples of lipids oh I think
so<00:05:23.350> there<00:05:24.100> was<00:05:24.280> a<00:05:24.310> picture<00:05:24.640> of<00:05:24.790> olive<00:05:25.270> oil<00:05:25.450> and

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
so there was a picture of olive oil and

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.520 
so there was a picture of olive oil and
candles

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530

so<00:05:27.130> maybe<00:05:27.370> waxes<00:05:28.210> and<00:05:28.240> fats<00:05:28.690> but<00:05:29.500> what<00:05:29.740> about

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
so maybe waxes and fats but what about

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.390 
so maybe waxes and fats but what about
natural<00:05:30.250> steroids<00:05:30.940> like<00:05:31.270> cholesterol

exactly<00:05:33.870> steroids<00:05:34.870> are<00:05:35.080> a<00:05:35.110> special<00:05:35.590> group<00:05:35.770> of

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
exactly steroids are a special group of

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.760 
exactly steroids are a special group of
lipids<00:05:36.510> so<00:05:37.510> now<00:05:37.660> can<00:05:37.870> you<00:05:38.050> tell<00:05:38.320> me<00:05:38.530> some

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
lipids so now can you tell me some

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.880 
lipids so now can you tell me some
examples<00:05:39.340> of<00:05:39.460> proteins<00:05:39.670> oh<00:05:40.440> that<00:05:41.440> is<00:05:41.650> easy

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
examples of proteins oh that is easy

proteins<00:05:46.270> but<00:05:47.080> I<00:05:47.140> am<00:05:47.440> really

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
proteins but I am really

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.270 
proteins but I am really
about<00:05:48.490> nucleic<00:05:49.120> acids<00:05:49.600> that<00:05:50.380> seems<00:05:50.800> harder

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
about nucleic acids that seems harder

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.150
