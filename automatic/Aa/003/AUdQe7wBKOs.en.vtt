so you've got the mount right here and

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.540 
so you've got the mount right here and
the<00:00:16.440> gun<00:00:16.590> would<00:00:16.770> go<00:00:16.890> right<00:00:17.070> on<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.340> bow

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
the gun would go right on the bow

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.090 
the gun would go right on the bow
correct<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.300> got<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.570> stand<00:00:18.869> we've<00:00:19.619> also<00:00:19.800> got

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
correct we got the stand we've also got

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.859 
correct we got the stand we've also got
some<00:00:20.130> air<00:00:20.550> line<00:00:20.760> we're<00:00:21.000> gonna<00:00:21.119> we're<00:00:21.660> going<00:00:21.810> to

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
some air line we're gonna we're going to

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.140 
some air line we're gonna we're going to
use<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.560> we<00:00:22.859> need<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.250> tube<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.490> up<00:00:23.939> to

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
use and and we need to tube this up to

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.839 
use and and we need to tube this up to
the<00:00:24.300> gun<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.740> control<00:00:26.160> what<00:00:26.369> all<00:00:26.460> are<00:00:26.820> the

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
the gun and to control what all are the

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.400 
the gun and to control what all are the
controls<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.539> there<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.750> guess<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.230> we<00:00:28.289> have

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
controls on there I guess so we have

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.830 
controls on there I guess so we have
atomization<00:00:28.800> err<00:00:29.279> yep<00:00:29.609> we<00:00:29.760> have<00:00:29.880> fan<00:00:30.150> air<00:00:30.390> okay

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
atomization err yep we have fan air okay

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.840 
atomization err yep we have fan air okay
and<00:00:31.170> also<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> cylinder<00:00:32.130> air<00:00:32.279> for<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> trigger

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
and also a cylinder air for the trigger

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.520 
and also a cylinder air for the trigger
and<00:00:33.059> that's<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.360> trigger<00:00:33.570> okay<00:00:33.840> very<00:00:34.260> good

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
and that's the trigger okay very good

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.229 
and that's the trigger okay very good
and<00:00:34.680> then<00:00:35.070> beyond<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.579> we're<00:00:35.880> also<00:00:36.180> of

course going to need some kind of a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.400 
course going to need some kind of a
fluid<00:00:37.890> line<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.879> then<00:00:39.180> we'll<00:00:39.570> also<00:00:39.750> need<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
fluid line and then we'll also need a

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.950 
fluid line and then we'll also need a
pump<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.219> fluid<00:00:41.550> delivery<00:00:41.700> yep<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.540> then

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960

first<00:02:12.890> we'll<00:02:13.040> add<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.310> atomization<00:02:13.670> err<00:02:15.340> why

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
first we'll add the atomization err why

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.300 
first we'll add the atomization err why
don't<00:02:16.459> we<00:02:16.520> go<00:02:16.610> ahead<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:16.790> trigger<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.300> and

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
don't we go ahead and trigger it and

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.710 
don't we go ahead and trigger it and
then<00:02:19.310> from<00:02:19.490> here<00:02:19.670> we<00:02:19.819> can<00:02:19.970> add<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.240> fan<00:02:20.480> air

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
then from here we can add the fan air

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.960 
then from here we can add the fan air
until<00:02:21.290> we<00:02:21.470> achieve<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.340> desired<00:02:22.670> pattern

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
until we achieve the desired pattern

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.540 
until we achieve the desired pattern
what<00:02:23.270> they<00:02:23.390> were<00:02:23.450> looking<00:02:23.600> for

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.280 

so<00:02:29.550> for<00:02:29.730> air<00:02:29.849> cap<00:02:30.030> alignment<00:02:30.599> there's<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.840> pin

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
so for air cap alignment there's a pin

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.809 
so for air cap alignment there's a pin
in<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:32.760> air<00:02:32.910> cap<00:02:33.680> which<00:02:34.680> hits<00:02:35.220> against<00:02:35.519> a<00:02:35.640> pin

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
in the air cap which hits against a pin

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.550 
in the air cap which hits against a pin
on<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:36.030> gun<00:02:36.180> body<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.599> either<00:02:36.720> set<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.110> vertical

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
on the gun body to either set a vertical

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.559 
on the gun body to either set a vertical
or<00:02:37.650> horizontal<00:02:37.680> position<00:02:38.670> for<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.330> spray

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
or horizontal position for the spray

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.920 
or horizontal position for the spray
pattern<00:02:40.910> so<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.030> switch<00:02:42.269> it<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.480> simply<00:02:42.660> take

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
pattern so to switch it you simply take

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.320 
pattern so to switch it you simply take
the<00:02:43.110> pin<00:02:43.319> out<00:02:43.349> and<00:02:43.790> screw<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.880> into<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.120> other

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
the pin out and screw it into the other

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:58.570 
the pin out and screw it into the other
hole

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.130 

and<00:02:59.580> now<00:02:59.700> it's<00:02:59.849> spring<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.239> horizontal<00:03:00.870> spray

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
and now it's spring a horizontal spray

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.830 
and now it's spring a horizontal spray
pattern

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.260 

okay<00:03:06.530> John<00:03:06.770> so<00:03:06.950> let's<00:03:07.160> just<00:03:07.400> do<00:03:07.520> a<00:03:07.550> quick<00:03:07.850> recap

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
okay John so let's just do a quick recap

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.059 
okay John so let's just do a quick recap
of<00:03:08.540> what<00:03:08.750> we<00:03:09.020> did<00:03:09.050> here<00:03:09.200> this<00:03:09.560> morning<00:03:09.950> and

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
of what we did here this morning and

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.860 
of what we did here this morning and
let's<00:03:10.220> start<00:03:10.490> we<00:03:10.670> we<00:03:11.240> mounted<00:03:11.569> the<00:03:11.720> gun

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
let's start we we mounted the gun

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.750 
let's start we we mounted the gun
correct<00:03:12.319> alright<00:03:12.830> and<00:03:13.040> then<00:03:13.190> we<00:03:13.310> brought<00:03:13.520> in

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
correct alright and then we brought in

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.860 
correct alright and then we brought in
the<00:03:14.209> airlines

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
the airlines

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.350 
the airlines
so<00:03:14.990> we<00:03:15.110> have<00:03:15.319> the<00:03:15.500> atomizing<00:03:16.250> air<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:17.120> fan

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
so we have the atomizing air the fan

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.690 
so we have the atomizing air the fan
shaping<00:03:17.930> air<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:19.310> trigger<00:03:19.520> and<00:03:19.610> the

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
shaping air and the trigger and the

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.699 
shaping air and the trigger and the
trigger<00:03:19.730> yep<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:20.510> then<00:03:21.050> we<00:03:21.200> hooked<00:03:21.440> up<00:03:21.560> a

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
trigger yep and then we hooked up a

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.880 
trigger yep and then we hooked up a
fluid<00:03:21.920> line<00:03:23.140> you<00:03:24.140> mentioned<00:03:24.530> that<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:24.739> have

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
fluid line you mentioned that you have

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.340 
fluid line you mentioned that you have
to<00:03:25.069> use<00:03:25.250> a<00:03:25.280> fluid<00:03:26.060> regulator<00:03:26.510> for<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:26.930> the

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
to use a fluid regulator for the the

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.320 
to use a fluid regulator for the the
gross<00:03:27.620> adjustments<00:03:28.340> are<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.760> main<00:03:28.970> fluid

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
gross adjustments are the main fluid

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.970 
gross adjustments are the main fluid
adjustments<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.230> really<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:30.590> should<00:03:30.800> use<00:03:30.950> a

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
adjustments and really you should use a

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.410 
adjustments and really you should use a
special<00:03:31.430> regulator<00:03:31.790> right<00:03:31.970> can<00:03:32.150> you<00:03:32.180> talk<00:03:32.390> a

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
special regulator right can you talk a

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.820 
special regulator right can you talk a
little<00:03:32.600> bit<00:03:32.720> about<00:03:32.930> that<00:03:33.140> that's<00:03:33.380> right<00:03:33.590> what

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
little bit about that that's right what

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.820 
little bit about that that's right what
we<00:03:33.920> have<00:03:34.069> here<00:03:34.280> is<00:03:34.400> a<00:03:34.430> low<00:03:34.970> flow<00:03:35.270> regulator

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
we have here is a low flow regulator

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.009 
we have here is a low flow regulator
okay<00:03:36.830> so<00:03:37.160> because<00:03:37.700> this<00:03:37.970> gun<00:03:38.180> is<00:03:38.360> a<00:03:38.390> precision

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
okay so because this gun is a precision

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.960 
okay so because this gun is a precision
low<00:03:39.290> flow<00:03:39.530> gun<00:03:39.769> we<00:03:39.980> highly<00:03:40.489> recommend<00:03:40.519> using

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
low flow gun we highly recommend using

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.900 
low flow gun we highly recommend using
this<00:03:41.239> regulator<00:03:42.190> it's<00:03:43.190> designed<00:03:43.580> for<00:03:43.700> low

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
this regulator it's designed for low

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.210 
this regulator it's designed for low
flow<00:03:44.180> and<00:03:44.510> it's<00:03:44.810> available<00:03:45.050> in<00:03:45.500> three

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
flow and it's available in three

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.210 
flow and it's available in three
different<00:03:46.250> ratios<00:03:46.970> a<00:03:47.180> 1<00:03:47.540> 2<00:03:47.690> 1<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:48.050> 2<00:03:48.470> 2<00:03:48.709> 1<00:03:48.980> and<00:03:49.130> a<00:03:49.190> 3

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
different ratios a 1 2 1 a 2 2 1 and a 3

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.680 
different ratios a 1 2 1 a 2 2 1 and a 3
2<00:03:49.550> 1<00:03:50.080> ok<00:03:51.080> all<00:03:51.800> right<00:03:51.920> very<00:03:52.130> good<00:03:52.300> so<00:03:53.300> once<00:03:53.540> we

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
2 1 ok all right very good so once we

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.780 
2 1 ok all right very good so once we
did<00:03:53.840> that<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.170> had<00:03:54.290> everything<00:03:54.530> hooked<00:03:54.890> up<00:03:55.100> we

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
did that and had everything hooked up we

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.430 
did that and had everything hooked up we
put<00:03:56.209> a<00:03:56.239> little<00:03:56.390> fluid<00:03:56.690> pressure<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.260> gun

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
put a little fluid pressure to the gun

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.530 
put a little fluid pressure to the gun
you<00:03:58.010> did<00:03:58.220> some<00:03:58.459> fine<00:03:58.730> adjustments<00:03:58.880> at<00:03:59.450> the

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
you did some fine adjustments at the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.270 
you did some fine adjustments at the
back<00:03:59.690> end<00:03:59.959> of<00:04:00.019> the<00:04:00.110> gun<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.890> then<00:04:01.010> we<00:04:01.130> just

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
back end of the gun and then we just

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.350 
back end of the gun and then we just
played<00:04:01.489> around<00:04:01.610> a<00:04:01.819> little<00:04:01.850> bit<00:04:02.150> with<00:04:02.330> some

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
played around a little bit with some

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.809 
played around a little bit with some
atomizing<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:03.410> some<00:04:03.560> some<00:04:03.860> Fanning<00:04:04.280> fan<00:04:04.610> area

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
atomizing and some some Fanning fan area

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.509 
atomizing and some some Fanning fan area
and<00:04:05.150> got<00:04:05.269> the<00:04:05.450> right<00:04:05.950> shape<00:04:06.950> of<00:04:07.130> the<00:04:07.220> pattern

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
and got the right shape of the pattern

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:08.710 
and got the right shape of the pattern
coming<00:04:07.730> out<00:04:07.880> of<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.030> gun<00:04:08.180> correct

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
coming out of the gun correct

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.110 
coming out of the gun correct
good<00:04:09.709> well<00:04:10.160> Jen<00:04:10.370> thanks<00:04:10.670> so<00:04:10.760> much<00:04:10.820> for<00:04:11.060> your
