super happy because we could have

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.750 
super happy because we could have
potentially<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.859> five<00:00:29.070> game<00:00:29.220> file<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.640> our

potentially a five game file on our
hands<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.240> feel<00:00:30.510> when<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.750> comes<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.109> pick

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
hands I feel when it comes to the pick

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.290 
hands I feel when it comes to the pick
and<00:00:31.380> ban<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.560> feel<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.040> fanatic<00:00:32.850> kind<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.149> set

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
and ban I feel like fanatic kind of set

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.600 
and ban I feel like fanatic kind of set
them<00:00:33.450> up<00:00:33.570> set<00:00:34.380> themselves<00:00:34.530> up<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.860> be<00:00:35.219> very

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
them up set themselves up to be very

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.250 
them up set themselves up to be very
very<00:00:35.850> weak<00:00:36.090> against<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.510> poke<00:00:36.690> composition

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
very weak against the poke composition

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.709 
very weak against the poke composition
victor<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.920> champion<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.399> has<00:00:39.059> like<00:00:39.360> okay

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
victor is a champion that has like okay

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.940 
victor is a champion that has like okay
matchups<00:00:40.079> against<00:00:40.350> everything<00:00:40.620> but<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
matchups against everything but the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.100 
matchups against everything but the
virus<00:00:41.190> does<00:00:41.610> fine<00:00:41.879> against<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.540> there<00:00:43.020> was

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
virus does fine against it and there was

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.200 
virus does fine against it and there was
a<00:00:43.140> lack<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.410> engage<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.489> had<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.910> do

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
a lack of engage and you had to do

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.000 
a lack of engage and you had to do
something<00:00:45.570> very<00:00:45.600> very<00:00:45.899> beautiful<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.649> create

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
something very very beautiful to create

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.830 
something very very beautiful to create
anything<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.460> he<00:00:47.730> also<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.629> middle

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
anything that he also that in the middle

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.900 
anything that he also that in the middle
of<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.020> game<00:00:49.170> but<00:00:49.410> i<00:00:49.620> think<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.730> pick

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
of the game but i think that the pick

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.850 
of the game but i think that the pick
and<00:00:51.030> ban<00:00:51.180> was<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:52.020> biggest<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:52.590> thought

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and ban was the biggest like thought

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.830 
and ban was the biggest like thought
that<00:00:53.309> fanatic<00:00:53.640> did<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:53.940> game<00:00:54.180> whoa<00:00:54.570> I

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
that fanatic did in this game whoa I

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.840 
that fanatic did in this game whoa I
don't<00:00:55.500> know<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.920> pick<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.280> ban<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.640> think

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
don't know the pick and ban I think

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.900 
don't know the pick and ban I think
could<00:00:57.600> go<00:00:57.840> both<00:00:58.050> ways<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.309> really<00:00:59.520> see<00:00:59.699> both

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
could go both ways I can really see both

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.880 
could go both ways I can really see both
sides<00:01:00.090> doing<00:01:00.449> well<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:00.989> once<00:01:01.199> origin<00:01:01.649> got<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
sides doing well but once origin got the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.319 
sides doing well but once origin got the
lead<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.670> one<00:01:02.879> time<00:01:03.059> they<00:01:03.180> make<00:01:03.300> a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
lead and the one time they make a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.000 
lead and the one time they make a
mistake<00:01:03.480> middling<00:01:04.019> they<00:01:04.500> never<00:01:04.710> made<00:01:04.920> it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
mistake middling they never made it

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.250 
mistake middling they never made it
again<00:01:05.100> they<00:01:05.489> never<00:01:05.640> really<00:01:05.909> let<00:01:06.240> yellow<00:01:06.960> star

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
again they never really let yellow star

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.600 
again they never really let yellow star
get<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.619> flank<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> fishery<00:01:08.460> was

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
get that flank like the fishery was

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.700 
get that flank like the fishery was
saying<00:01:08.820> they<00:01:09.270> always<00:01:09.720> word<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.020> up<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.350> they

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
saying they always word it up and they

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.380 
saying they always word it up and they
basically<00:01:11.010> yeah<00:01:11.280> never<00:01:11.640> let<00:01:11.850> phonetic<00:01:12.210> come

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
basically yeah never let phonetic come

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.690 
basically yeah never let phonetic come
back<00:01:12.540> because<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.409> way<00:01:13.530> they<00:01:13.680> played<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.430> I

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
back because of the way they played so I

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.700 
back because of the way they played so I
think<00:01:14.820> pick<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.390> ban<00:01:15.540> was<00:01:16.170> pretty<00:01:16.530> big

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
think pick and ban was pretty big

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.340 
think pick and ban was pretty big
gangplank<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.310> annoying<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.670> hell<00:01:18.290> but<00:01:19.290> I

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
gangplank is annoying as hell but I

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.140 
gangplank is annoying as hell but I
still<00:01:19.560> think<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:20.310> got<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> really<00:01:20.670> good<00:01:20.759> series

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
still think we got a really good series

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.670 
still think we got a really good series
coming<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.509> still<00:01:21.750> yeah<00:01:21.900> for<00:01:22.080> sure<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.439> think

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
coming up still yeah for sure I think

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.800 
coming up still yeah for sure I think
like<00:01:22.970> gangplank<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.090> going<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.360> define<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
like gangplank is going to define the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.690 
like gangplank is going to define the
series<00:01:25.110> for<00:01:25.619> sure<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.070> don't<00:01:26.310> think<00:01:26.369> there's

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
series for sure I don't think there's

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.030 
series for sure I don't think there's
any<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.509> hard<00:01:27.750> counter<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.409> it's<00:01:28.799> kind<00:01:29.009> of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
any like hard counter to it it's kind of

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.679 
any like hard counter to it it's kind of
hard<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.280> stop<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.909> from<00:01:30.030> farming<00:01:30.479> because

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
hard to stop it from farming because

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.240 
hard to stop it from farming because
it's<00:01:30.869> always<00:01:31.079> going<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.229> farm<00:01:31.470> really<00:01:32.130> good

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
it's always going to farm really good

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.950 
it's always going to farm really good
than<00:01:32.340> 1<00:01:32.460> B<00:01:32.579> 2<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:32.850> oh<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.479> mind<00:01:33.659> I

than 1 B 2 as oh and that in mind I

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.780 
than 1 B 2 as oh and that in mind I
think<00:01:34.320> tank<00:01:34.950> plug<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.430> define<00:01:35.670> this

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
think tank plug is going to define this

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.460 
think tank plug is going to define this
entire<00:01:36.119> season<00:01:36.360> maybe<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:36.990> gonna<00:01:37.140> be<00:01:37.259> banned

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
entire season maybe it's gonna be banned

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.200 
entire season maybe it's gonna be banned
every<00:01:37.680> single<00:01:37.920> game<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.490> say<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.119> know

every single game you say it's you know

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.730 
every single game you say it's you know
easy<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.570> get<00:01:39.720> fun<00:01:39.900> but<00:01:40.110> again<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.590> big

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
easy to get fun but again it's a big

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.530 
easy to get fun but again it's a big
change<00:01:40.950> from<00:01:41.100> origin<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.700> spoke<00:01:42.180> about<00:01:42.240> it

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
change from origin I spoke about it

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.899 
change from origin I spoke about it
before<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> first<00:01:43.470> game<00:01:43.590> where<00:01:44.340> normally

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
before the first game where normally

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.730 
before the first game where normally
they<00:01:45.299> don't<00:01:45.450> give<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:45.930> as<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.200> fun<00:01:46.380> they<00:01:46.530> don't

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
they don't give so as the fun they don't

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.950 
they don't give so as the fun they don't
give<00:01:46.890> him<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.130> experience<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.240> time<00:01:48.570> they

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
give him that experience this time they

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.840 
give him that experience this time they
give<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.470> everything<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.310> he<00:01:50.579> takes

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
give so as everything and he takes

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.490 
give so as everything and he takes
everything<00:01:51.149> away<00:01:51.360> from<00:01:51.479> fanatic<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.259> good

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
everything away from fanatic so good

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.960 
everything away from fanatic so good
adaptations<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.280> lane<00:01:53.399> swap<00:01:53.610> yeah

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
adaptations in the lane swap yeah

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.639 
adaptations in the lane swap yeah
looking<00:01:54.570> at<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:54.990> at<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.259> lane<00:01:55.439> swap

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
looking at that so at the lane swap

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.889 
looking at that so at the lane swap
usually<00:01:56.490> even<00:01:56.880> when<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.240> happens<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.750> when

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
usually even when that happens in when

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.480 
usually even when that happens in when
you<00:01:58.140> guys<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.439> gotten<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.680> big<00:01:58.979> lead<00:01:59.189> against

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
you guys have gotten a big lead against

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.219 
you guys have gotten a big lead against
him<00:01:59.610> OG<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> past<00:02:00.360> has<00:02:00.540> gotten<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.840> big<00:02:00.990> lead

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
him OG in the past has gotten a big lead

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.080 
him OG in the past has gotten a big lead
against<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.560> fanatic<00:02:01.950> fights<00:02:02.159> our<00:02:02.369> way<00:02:02.460> back<00:02:02.670> so

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
against a fanatic fights our way back so

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.090 
against a fanatic fights our way back so
what<00:02:03.329> did<00:02:03.570> they<00:02:03.750> not<00:02:04.229> do<00:02:04.530> well<00:02:04.710> let<00:02:04.979> they

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
what did they not do well let they

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.859 
what did they not do well let they
usually<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:05.850> fanatic<00:02:06.240> well<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.689> think

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
usually do in fanatic well I think

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.749 
usually do in fanatic well I think
something<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.290> they<00:02:07.409> really<00:02:07.619> didn't<00:02:08.009> expect

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
something that they really didn't expect

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.639 
something that they really didn't expect
I<00:02:08.940> guess<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.330> when<00:02:09.479> they<00:02:09.629> pick<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.899> support<00:02:10.470> top

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
I guess is when they pick a support top

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.650 
I guess is when they pick a support top
against<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.039> Kerry<00:02:11.220> top<00:02:11.520> what<00:02:12.120> they<00:02:12.270> did<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.569> the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
against a Kerry top what they did in the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.110 
against a Kerry top what they did in the
2v

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
2v

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.509 
2v
give<00:02:13.599> all<00:02:14.170> this<00:02:14.470> farm<00:02:14.769> onto<00:02:15.040> tristana<00:02:15.370> they

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
give all this farm onto tristana they

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.130 
give all this farm onto tristana they
kept<00:02:15.730> funneling<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.360> siphoning<00:02:16.659> all<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.900> XP

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
kept funneling and siphoning all the XP

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.660 
kept funneling and siphoning all the XP
from<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.409> top<00:02:17.560> laner<00:02:17.769> to<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.040> ad<00:02:18.190> carry<00:02:18.459> and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
from the top laner to the ad carry and

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.759 
from the top laner to the ad carry and
this<00:02:19.000> works<00:02:19.239> fine<00:02:19.569> but<00:02:19.870> when<00:02:20.319> you're<00:02:20.440> playing

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
this works fine but when you're playing

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.199 
this works fine but when you're playing
against<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.099> Kerry<00:02:21.340> top<00:02:21.610> on<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.849> other<00:02:21.970> side

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
against a Kerry top on the other side

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.850 
against a Kerry top on the other side
that<00:02:22.780> carry<00:02:23.049> top<00:02:23.200> eventually<00:02:23.560> we'll<00:02:23.650> just<00:02:23.769> be

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
that carry top eventually we'll just be

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.399 
that carry top eventually we'll just be
able<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:24.010> 1v1<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.670> other<00:02:24.819> top<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.450> now<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:25.989> top

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
able to 1v1 the other top so now the top

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.830 
able to 1v1 the other top so now the top
from<00:02:27.129> the<00:02:27.159> initial<00:02:27.640> like<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.239> know<00:02:28.360> siphoning

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
from the initial like you know siphoning

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.380 
from the initial like you know siphoning
of<00:02:29.049> resources<00:02:30.040> now<00:02:30.489> we<00:02:30.549> can<00:02:30.730> never<00:02:31.090> come<00:02:31.269> back

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
of resources now we can never come back

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.020 
of resources now we can never come back
in<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.629> game<00:02:31.720> he<00:02:31.900> was<00:02:31.989> like<00:02:32.079> 30<00:02:32.739> CS<00:02:33.069> down<00:02:33.250> 40<00:02:33.610> 50

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
in the game he was like 30 CS down 40 50

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.240 
in the game he was like 30 CS down 40 50
60<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:34.870> if<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.440> was<00:02:35.500> like<00:02:35.680> Kerry<00:02:35.920> top<00:02:36.069> vers

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
60 so if it was like Kerry top vers

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.399 
60 so if it was like Kerry top vers
carry<00:02:36.459> top<00:02:36.640> maybe<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.180> can<00:02:37.390> see<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.659> but<00:02:38.110> as<00:02:38.230> soon

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
carry top maybe I can see it but as soon

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:39.750 
carry top maybe I can see it but as soon
as<00:02:38.560> they<00:02:38.709> put<00:02:38.950> this<00:02:39.099> like<00:02:39.310> strong<00:02:39.610> like

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
as they put this like strong like

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.490 
as they put this like strong like
gangplank<00:02:40.329> pick<00:02:40.510> in<00:02:40.659> there<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:41.230> can't<00:02:41.379> really

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
gangplank pick in there you can't really

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.319 
gangplank pick in there you can't really
just<00:02:41.709> give<00:02:42.099> them<00:02:42.220> farm<00:02:42.549> over<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.030> other<00:02:43.150> top

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
just give them farm over the other top

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.369 
just give them farm over the other top
laner<00:02:43.540> because<00:02:43.720> you'll<00:02:43.840> never<00:02:44.079> come<00:02:44.260> back

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
laner because you'll never come back

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.349 
laner because you'll never come back
from<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:44.590> like<00:02:45.280> who<00:02:45.430> showed<00:02:45.640> my<00:02:46.090> biggest

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
from that like who showed my biggest

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.240 
from that like who showed my biggest
issue<00:02:46.450> was<00:02:46.720> like<00:02:47.290> imagine<00:02:47.799> if<00:02:47.859> they<00:02:48.010> picked

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
issue was like imagine if they picked

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.979 
issue was like imagine if they picked
for<00:02:48.340> example<00:02:48.670> fist<00:02:48.940> toppling<00:02:49.359> instead<00:02:49.810> of<00:02:49.900> the

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
for example fist toppling instead of the

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.569 
for example fist toppling instead of the
lulu<00:02:50.170> that<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.709> something<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.010> can<00:02:51.250> contest

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
lulu that is something that can contest

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.670 
lulu that is something that can contest
the<00:02:51.670> way<00:02:51.849> we<00:02:51.970> can<00:02:52.090> GP<00:02:52.420> very<00:02:52.629> very<00:02:52.840> well<00:02:53.049> and<00:02:53.260> can

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
the way we can GP very very well and can

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.259 
the way we can GP very very well and can
actually<00:02:54.069> scale<00:02:54.519> into<00:02:54.790> that<00:02:54.910> match<00:02:55.090> up<00:02:55.120> very

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
actually scale into that match up very

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.119 
actually scale into that match up very
well<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.780> i<00:02:55.870> feel<00:02:56.049> like<00:02:56.200> they<00:02:56.560> had<00:02:56.769> weaker

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
well and i feel like they had weaker

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:58.740 
well and i feel like they had weaker
match<00:02:57.310> up<00:02:57.489> all<00:02:57.640> over<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.940> place<00:02:58.120> they<00:02:58.540> had<00:02:58.659> the

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
match up all over the place they had the

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.229 
match up all over the place they had the
weaker<00:02:58.989> composition<00:02:59.590> that's<00:02:59.769> why<00:02:59.890> i<00:02:59.920> put<00:03:00.579> most

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
weaker composition that's why i put most

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.970 
weaker composition that's why i put most
of<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.480> blame<00:03:01.540> on<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.900> picking<00:03:02.140> banner<00:03:02.319> oh<00:03:02.620> I

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
in the mid lane actually thought this is

in the mid lane actually thought this is
one<00:03:25.599> of<00:03:25.630> those<00:03:25.780> moments<00:03:25.840> that<00:03:26.290> fanatic<00:03:26.829> can

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
one of those moments that fanatic can

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.400 
one of those moments that fanatic can
absolutely<00:03:27.489> capitalize<00:03:28.329> on<00:03:28.359> maybe<00:03:28.810> would<00:03:29.109> but

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
absolutely capitalize on maybe would but

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.599 
absolutely capitalize on maybe would but

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
let's blow up the replay because right

mentally resilient so i think this is
actually<00:04:45.039> really<00:04:45.069> really<00:04:45.520> strong<00:04:46.000> for<00:04:46.150> them

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
actually really really strong for them

actually really really strong for them
as<00:04:46.360> a<00:04:46.389> team<00:04:46.479> they're<00:04:46.720> going<00:04:46.840> to<00:04:46.900> know<00:04:47.020> exactly

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
as a team they're going to know exactly

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.379 
as a team they're going to know exactly
like<00:04:47.530> was<00:04:48.009> it<00:04:48.129> like<00:04:48.159> this<00:04:48.340> strategy<00:04:49.150> that<00:04:49.300> was

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
like was it like this strategy that was

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.670 
like was it like this strategy that was
the<00:04:49.479> problem<00:04:49.659> was<00:04:49.870> a<00:04:49.930> communication<00:04:50.379> like

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
the problem was a communication like

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.499 
the problem was a communication like
what<00:04:50.889> actually<00:04:51.370> happened<00:04:51.729> that<00:04:51.759> game<00:04:51.970> it's<00:04:52.360> no

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
what actually happened that game it's no

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.659 
what actually happened that game it's no
longer<00:04:52.690> like<00:04:52.900> oh<00:04:53.020> we<00:04:53.229> won<00:04:53.440> but<00:04:53.740> we<00:04:54.430> could<00:04:54.580> do

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
longer like oh we won but we could do

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.040 
longer like oh we won but we could do
this<00:04:54.789> better<00:04:54.940> it's<00:04:55.090> gonna<00:04:55.150> be<00:04:55.270> like<00:04:55.449> okay<00:04:55.960> this

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
this better it's gonna be like okay this

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.270 
this better it's gonna be like okay this
is<00:04:56.199> just<00:04:56.229> wrong<00:04:56.590> we<00:04:56.740> can<00:04:56.860> never<00:04:56.949> do<00:04:57.129> it<00:04:57.250> again

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
is just wrong we can never do it again

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.499 
is just wrong we can never do it again
so<00:04:57.520> i<00:04:57.550> think<00:04:57.639> it's<00:04:57.759> really<00:04:58.210> big

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
so i think it's really big

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.180 
so i think it's really big
stepping-stone<00:04:58.810> for<00:04:59.139> them<00:04:59.379> I<00:04:59.590> feel<00:05:00.069> like

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
stepping-stone for them I feel like

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.040 
stepping-stone for them I feel like
fanatic<00:05:00.669> as<00:05:00.909> I<00:05:00.940> mentioned<00:05:01.479> earlier<00:05:01.629> in<00:05:01.960> the

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
fanatic as I mentioned earlier in the

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.439 
fanatic as I mentioned earlier in the
broadcast<00:05:02.169> that<00:05:02.669> defined<00:05:03.669> they<00:05:04.180> have<00:05:04.270> found

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
broadcast that defined they have found

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.809 
broadcast that defined they have found
this<00:05:04.629> way<00:05:04.810> to<00:05:04.870> improve<00:05:05.409> regardless<00:05:06.400> o<00:05:06.460> if<00:05:06.639> they

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:06.819 
this way to improve regardless o if they

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:08.999 
this way to improve regardless o if they
lose<00:05:07.000> or<00:05:07.240> win<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:07.569> think<00:05:07.840> this<00:05:08.349> game<00:05:08.620> was<00:05:08.800> more

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:09.009 
lose or win I think this game was more

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.680 
lose or win I think this game was more
about<00:05:09.099> hiding<00:05:09.550> their<00:05:09.879> cards<00:05:10.360> more<00:05:10.569> than

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
about hiding their cards more than

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.200 
about hiding their cards more than
anything<00:05:10.900> else<00:05:11.139> I<00:05:11.379> think<00:05:12.190> one<00:05:12.490> other<00:05:12.639> thing<00:05:13.090> to

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
anything else I think one other thing to

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.939 
anything else I think one other thing to
keep<00:05:13.300> in<00:05:13.449> mind<00:05:13.509> although<00:05:14.169> fanatic<00:05:14.560> themselves

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
keep in mind although fanatic themselves

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:16.379 
keep in mind although fanatic themselves
have<00:05:15.039> said<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.340> streak<00:05:15.610> didn't<00:05:16.000> really

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
have said the streak didn't really

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:17.999 
have said the streak didn't really
matter<00:05:16.539> to<00:05:16.750> them<00:05:16.870> it's<00:05:17.379> a<00:05:17.560> little<00:05:17.830> bit<00:05:17.919> of

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
matter to them it's a little bit of

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:19.559 
matter to them it's a little bit of
pressure<00:05:18.159> release<00:05:18.490> them<00:05:18.729> because<00:05:19.180> you've<00:05:19.360> not

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:19.569 
pressure release them because you've not

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.059 
pressure release them because you've not
got<00:05:19.750> that<00:05:19.780> our<00:05:20.050> man<00:05:20.229> if<00:05:20.349> we<00:05:20.379> lose<00:05:20.650> that's<00:05:20.919> our

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
got that our man if we lose that's our

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.850 
got that our man if we lose that's our
street<00:05:21.280> gun<00:05:21.430> it's<00:05:21.699> got<00:05:21.990> no<00:05:22.990> more<00:05:23.349> chance<00:05:23.620> that

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
street gun it's got no more chance that

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.070 
street gun it's got no more chance that
you<00:05:23.949> stay<00:05:24.159> undefeated<00:05:24.460> so<00:05:25.030> maybe<00:05:25.599> we'll<00:05:25.900> see

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
you stay undefeated so maybe we'll see

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.020 
you stay undefeated so maybe we'll see
them<00:05:26.229> relax<00:05:26.530> it<00:05:26.710> touch<00:05:26.949> I<00:05:27.250> still<00:05:27.699> think<00:05:27.729> though

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
them relax it touch I still think though

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.249 
them relax it touch I still think though
the<00:05:28.180> pressure<00:05:28.360> is<00:05:28.539> on<00:05:28.659> with<00:05:28.840> that<00:05:28.930> spot<00:05:29.139> at
