due to retire you know in the near

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
future he looks like basically he could

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.660 
future he looks like basically he could
carry<00:02:39.540> on<00:02:39.780> past<00:02:40.140> his<00:02:40.380> retirement<00:02:40.770> date<00:02:41.160> even

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
carry on past his retirement date even

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.480 
carry on past his retirement date even
if<00:02:41.970> it's<00:02:42.120> like<00:02:42.330> as<00:02:42.570> an<00:02:42.720> advisement<00:02:43.110> role<00:02:44.100> for

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
if it's like as an advisement role for

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.070 
if it's like as an advisement role for
Nintendo<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.270> I<00:02:45.330> think<00:02:45.510> that's<00:02:45.630> probably<00:02:45.840> the

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
Nintendo and I think that's probably the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.110 
Nintendo and I think that's probably the
most<00:02:46.290> likely<00:02:46.680> thing<00:02:46.890> he'd<00:02:47.550> probably<00:02:47.760> signed

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
most likely thing he'd probably signed

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.540 
most likely thing he'd probably signed
kind<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.540> go<00:02:48.690> part<00:02:49.020> time<00:02:49.290> if<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.620> like<00:02:49.830> once

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
kind of go part time if you like once

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.140 
kind of go part time if you like once
he's<00:02:50.790> past<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.390> retirement<00:02:52.160> age<00:02:53.160> in<00:02:53.640> Japan

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
he's past that retirement age in Japan

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.450 
he's past that retirement age in Japan
and<00:02:55.020> so<00:02:55.320> that's<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.680> for<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.040> earth<00:02:56.160> news

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460
