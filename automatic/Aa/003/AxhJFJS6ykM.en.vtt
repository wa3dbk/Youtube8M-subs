00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.230
 hello here is your rasselbande in 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.789
 Today's video is about the right one 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.830
 betrayed 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.869
 I will be suitable and 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.300
 inappropriate a tax on count and 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.189
 their advantages and disadvantages within the 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.949
 The following 1 drove themselves now 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.470
 should count at the same time 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.780
 really only in the lowest floor and 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.060
 to be used in the toilet data 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.970
 on all other levels you can 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.390
 Newsprint carpets or towels 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.170
 cover as a base use 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.000
 Newsprint can be harmless 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.460
 can be used because the printer blackened 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.980
 today is no longer leaded and 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.020
 thus also awkward ceilings are very 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.240
 but have to be strong as well 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.580
 newsprint to be changed frequently 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.100
 since they themselves through soft and fast 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.380
 can start to stink 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.060
 In addition, covers like to be gnawed and 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.370
 also gladly moved because they are relative 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.650
 I personally recommend it easily 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.480
 Carpets as a base to use there 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.730
 a bit heavier than newsprint 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.310
 ordinary blankets and towels are 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.770
 Moreover , they do not give way quickly 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.750
 because they are thicker they are 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.120
 harder and the rats can not 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.730
 carpets move so easily 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.470
 need to be washed regularly there 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.140
 They too and quickly start to 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.880
 Stinking at patchwork you get in the 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.280
 remaining very cheap in 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.810
 discountern like kik or in online 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.720
 shops ran like Amazon 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.670
 but now we come to the states 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.420
 they may be used betrayed 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.040
 On the one hand we have the hemp scattered 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.260
 this has the advantage that it is as good as 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.780
 not dusty at all and also very odor 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.750
 Tying is a recommended brand 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.150
 hugo is the disadvantage of this 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.720
 It is true that it is very expensive and it is 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.430
 can be relatively hard in winter 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.240
 and thus it is unpleasant for the rats 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.909
 can be 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.190
 A tax is also very dusty on 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.440
 and professionally binding with the difference 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.310
 that it is a little further than hans 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.289
 stoll 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.319
 recommendable brand here is barney 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.730
 and the downside bonds straw is that 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.910
 it also in the upscale 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.670
 Price range is usually suitable 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.500
 that dust and still a professional 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.450
 as hemp and linen stoll 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.310
 the downside is that it's harder 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.860
 is and therefore more uncomfortable for the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.480
 Rat Feet is and also very 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.860
 expensive 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.470
 fine buchholz granules are also 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.910
 suitable that does not dust and also 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.160
 very odor-binding 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.319
 but it can be a foot injury 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.209
 come when it is too coarse and sharp 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.010
 should be 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.500
 Shredded newspaper torn up 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.510
 handkerchiefs and perfumed klopapier 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.549
 or kitchen roll paper can be 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.370
 also as alternative sign stoll 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.989
 Do not use this dust for allergy 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.390
 they are allergic to 1 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.299
 It is also an alternative 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.099
 It is also very suitable 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.560
 cheap most daily newspapers 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.690
 you get already delivered for free 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.519
 the disadvantage is that it is common 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.430
 this does not have to be changed 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.989
 really odor-binding 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.150
 chinchilla sand and foe play out 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.040
 also use the tree ackermann 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.350
 But it is not recommended 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.780
 that starts in the toilets around quickly 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.700
 to stink and they do not guess 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.030
 like chinchillas hamster et cetera and 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.730
 sandbathing also mostly catches sand 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.200
 quick to screw on 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.180
 otherwise you can paper handkerchiefs 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.850
 and newsprint super as well 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.590
 hemp fibers and 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.870
 cotton is a tax as well 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.420
 Nesting material is suitable but mostly 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.130
 not gladly accepted and ignored and 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.410
 that 's what I think it is 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.510
 but a bit too expensive 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.079
 that was all suitable bedding now 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.220
 but now we are coming to rats 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.690
 unfit bedding this is not 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.180
 should be used 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.730
 there we have the normal one 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.889
 sawdust plan table true this is not 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.500
 betrayed that too much dust the 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:05.170
 Most rats can not stand it and 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.350
 It can thus lead to respiratory diseases 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.200
 come 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.900
 hay and straw are off as a shrub too 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.239
 unsuitable there is the risk to one 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.319
 Infestation only increases as too dusty and 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.389
 The rats are so with 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.970
 can draw respiratory illnesses 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.669
 In addition, straw is also often very 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.470
 sharp and hard and can therefore too 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.530
 injuries to the feet of the rat 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.080
 The whole types of pellets contribute 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.870
 also unsuitable because they are too hard 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.210
 Feel the feet and put the ball off 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.220
 can also benefit themselves 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.270
 rats eating these pellets 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.760
 stomach spoil 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.790
 which a stoll never uses 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.710
 should be cat litter that when 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.570
 eat in the stomach of the rat clump 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.780
 can and thus it is the death of the animal 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.760
 also leads alone can the dust 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.770
 of cat litter poisonous for the rates 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.150
 be and when to breathe 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.460
 lead to lung problems 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.310
 Moreover, it is also too hard for the 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.470
 Ratten Feet So that was the last one 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.090
 point I hope you have it again 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.520
 I liked you and I could give you one 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.770
 small insight into the topic 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.320
 in the world of rats announce the year 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.780
 especially for rats 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.550
 pay attention if you have other things 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.650
 get into this good or bad 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.840
 Betrayed then just tell me 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.740

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.750
 comments with 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.729
 that 's it again 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:31.419
