called<00:02:03.060> tempering<00:02:03.829> so<00:02:04.829> what<00:02:04.950> we<00:02:05.070> want<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.340> do

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
called tempering so what we want to do

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.550 
called tempering so what we want to do
is<00:02:05.609> when<00:02:05.789> we<00:02:05.880> get<00:02:06.030> our<00:02:06.149> chocolate<00:02:06.689> we<00:02:07.259> want<00:02:07.469> to

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
is when we get our chocolate we want to

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.169 
is when we get our chocolate we want to
heat<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.890> chocolate<00:02:08.369> up<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.640> about<00:02:08.759> 45

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
heat the chocolate up to about 45

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.240 
heat the chocolate up to about 45
degrees<00:02:09.629> Celsius<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.319> melt<00:02:10.530> all<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.009> fat

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
degrees Celsius and melt all the fat

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.610 
degrees Celsius and melt all the fat
particles<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.060> then<00:02:12.660> what<00:02:12.840> we<00:02:12.930> want<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.230> do<00:02:13.410> is

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
particles and then what we want to do is

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.770 
particles and then what we want to do is
we<00:02:13.800> want<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.190> shrink<00:02:14.489> those<00:02:14.730> fat<00:02:15.030> particles<00:02:15.599> so

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
we want to shrink those fat particles so

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.750 
we want to shrink those fat particles so
right<00:02:16.560> now<00:02:16.739> I'm<00:02:16.799> gonna<00:02:16.920> use<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.250> marble<00:02:17.610> slab

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
right now I'm gonna use the marble slab

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.309 
right now I'm gonna use the marble slab
and<00:02:18.120> there's<00:02:18.269> many<00:02:18.450> different<00:02:18.599> ways<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:18.989> can

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
and there's many different ways you can

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.600 
and there's many different ways you can
tamper<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.769> I<00:02:19.830> mean<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.010> could<00:02:20.129> have<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.310> at

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
tamper it I mean you could have a at

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.789 
tamper it I mean you could have a at
home<00:02:20.970> if<00:02:21.090> you're<00:02:21.180> trying<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.480> do<00:02:21.660> this<00:02:21.840> you

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
home if you're trying to do this you

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.949 
home if you're trying to do this you
could<00:02:22.980> have<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.190> bowl<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:23.940> ice<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.840> then

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
could have a bowl of ice and then

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.259 
could have a bowl of ice and then
another<00:02:25.709> dish<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.190> double<00:02:26.459> boiler<00:02:26.610> system

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
another dish like a double boiler system

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.570 
another dish like a double boiler system
where<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.510> put<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:28.040> bullet<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.129> the<00:02:29.190> ice<00:02:29.340> and

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
where you put the bullet and the ice and

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.640 
where you put the bullet and the ice and
just<00:02:29.670> stir<00:02:30.000> constantly<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.750> get<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.379> quick

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
just stir constantly to get that quick

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.020 
just stir constantly to get that quick
cooling<00:02:33.890> cuff<00:02:34.890> kick<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.549> a<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:35.760> it's

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
cooling cuff kick that is a so it's

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.580 
cooling cuff kick that is a so it's
really<00:02:36.299> hard<00:02:36.630> for<00:02:36.810> me<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.079> work<00:02:37.230> with<00:02:37.380> that

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
really hard for me to work with that

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.740 
really hard for me to work with that
kind<00:02:37.799> of<00:02:37.860> thing<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:40.049> is<00:02:40.349> marble<00:02:40.890> slab

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
kind of thing so this is marble slab

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.920 
kind of thing so this is marble slab
it's<00:02:42.750> about<00:02:42.959> 17<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:44.280> that's<00:02:44.430> nice<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.700> cool<00:02:47.930> so

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
it's about 17 so that's nice and cool so

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.970 
it's about 17 so that's nice and cool so
this<00:02:49.079> will<00:02:49.290> cool<00:02:49.500> really<00:02:50.099> quick<00:02:51.739> so<00:02:52.739> what<00:02:52.860> I'm

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
this will cool really quick so what I'm

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.190 
this will cool really quick so what I'm
going<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.160> do<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.489> just<00:02:53.519> want<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:54.120> mold<00:02:54.989> this

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
tilts but the heat in Orion I said it

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:42.490 
tilts but the heat in Orion I said it
here<00:03:29.500> right<00:03:29.709> that<00:03:29.890> stones<00:03:30.280> gonna<00:03:30.459> make<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:30.880> set

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
we'll smooth that off at the scraper in

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.649 
we'll smooth that off at the scraper in
the<00:03:54.610> end<00:03:56.370> okay<00:03:57.370> what<00:03:57.819> we're<00:03:57.970> just<00:03:58.090> gonna<00:03:58.269> do<00:03:58.510> is
