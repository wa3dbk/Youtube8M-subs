on<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:13.080> study<00:00:13.349> plate<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:14.360> then<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.480> set<00:00:15.890> that

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
on the study plate and then you set that

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.849 
on the study plate and then you set that
way<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.070> can<00:00:17.400> use<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:18.090> tripod<00:00:18.600> on<00:00:18.960> one<00:00:19.199> side<00:00:19.470> and

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
way you can use a tripod on one side and

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.010 
way you can use a tripod on one side and
a<00:00:20.400> light<00:00:20.609> stand<00:00:20.880> on<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.180> other<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.750> is

a light stand on the other this is

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.040 
a light stand on the other this is
actually<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.769> recommended<00:00:23.519> way<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:24.000> mount<00:00:24.869> your

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
actually a recommended way to mount your

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.980 
actually a recommended way to mount your
mighty<00:00:25.350> glide<00:00:25.730> however<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:27.449> recommend<00:00:27.840> that

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
mighty glide however we recommend that

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.150 
mighty glide however we recommend that
instead<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.050> using<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:32.070> 3/8<00:00:32.540> thread<00:00:33.829> you<00:00:34.829> use

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
instead of using the 3/8 thread you use

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.110 
instead of using the 3/8 thread you use
and<00:00:35.989> six<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:37.890> em<00:00:38.190> six<00:00:38.550> through

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
and six and you have em six through

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.180 
and six and you have em six through
holes<00:00:39.420> threaded<00:00:40.879> and<00:00:41.989> then<00:00:43.129> locate<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
holes threaded and then locate the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.459 
holes threaded and then locate the
through<00:00:44.640> holes<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.480> center<00:00:45.870> static<00:00:46.200> plate

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
through holes on the center static plate

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.850 
through holes on the center static plate
or<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.760> static<00:00:48.120> plate<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.660> then<00:00:49.350> use<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
or the static plate and then use the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.069 
or the static plate and then use the
stainless<00:00:50.340> steel<00:00:51.320> m6<00:00:52.320> screws<00:00:52.579> to<00:00:53.579> secure<00:00:53.760> it

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
stainless steel m6 screws to secure it

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.380 
stainless steel m6 screws to secure it
this<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> far<00:00:55.680> better<00:00:55.829> solution<00:00:56.270> that<00:00:57.270> way

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
this is a far better solution that way

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.990 
this is a far better solution that way
it<00:00:57.510> doesn't<00:00:57.719> get<00:00:57.989> loose<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> 3/8<00:00:59.129> it's

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
it doesn't get loose with the 3/8 it's

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.360 
it doesn't get loose with the 3/8 it's
very<00:01:00.390> tight<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.020> also<00:01:01.770> obviously<00:01:01.859> there's

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
very tight and also obviously there's

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.399 
very tight and also obviously there's
three<00:01:02.609> screws<00:01:02.940> instead<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.329> one<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.840> just

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
three screws instead of one and just

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.260 
three screws instead of one and just
give<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.799> quick<00:01:06.680> tightening<00:01:07.680> with<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
give it a quick tightening with the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.270 
give it a quick tightening with the
Allen<00:01:09.600> very<00:01:10.110> easy<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.590> set<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.220> is

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
Allen very easy to set up and this is

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.910 
Allen very easy to set up and this is
actually<00:01:11.729> very<00:01:11.760> strong<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.290> one<00:01:13.560> side<00:01:13.590> we

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
actually very strong so on one side we

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.399 
actually very strong so on one side we
recommend<00:01:14.670> all<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:14.970> center<00:01:15.479> we<00:01:15.720> recommend<00:01:16.259> to

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
recommend all the center we recommend to

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.679 
recommend all the center we recommend to
have<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.979> half<00:01:17.549> wall<00:01:17.729> adapter<00:01:18.210> which<00:01:18.360> could<00:01:18.570> be

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
have a half wall adapter which could be

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.620 
have a half wall adapter which could be
a<00:01:18.720> hundred<00:01:18.930> millimeter<00:01:19.439> or<00:01:19.970> we<00:01:20.970> also<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
a hundred millimeter or we also have the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.510 
a hundred millimeter or we also have the
hundred<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.140> fifty<00:01:22.560> millimeter<00:01:23.009> half<00:01:23.310> wall

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
hundred and fifty millimeter half wall

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.240 
hundred and fifty millimeter half wall
adapter<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.450> tie<00:01:24.750> down<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.830> m6

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
adapter with the tie down you have m6

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.580 
adapter with the tie down you have m6
peppered<00:01:26.670> throughout<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:27.720> 150,000,000

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
peppered throughout the 150,000,000

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.980 
peppered throughout the 150,000,000
better<00:01:28.770> half<00:01:29.100> wall<00:01:29.310> adapter<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.750> use

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
better half wall adapter and you can use

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.840 
better half wall adapter and you can use
the<00:01:31.170> through<00:01:31.409> holes<00:01:31.619> which<00:01:31.860> are<00:01:32.009> located<00:01:32.310> here

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the through holes which are located here

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.350 
the through holes which are located here
here<00:01:33.030> here<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:34.079> here<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.829> here<00:01:35.180> it<00:01:36.180> is

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
here here here here in here it is

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.109 
here here here here in here it is
exactly<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.110> same<00:01:37.380> thing<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:38.729> Mitchell

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
exactly the same thing for the Mitchell

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.840 
exactly the same thing for the Mitchell
adapter<00:01:39.630> which<00:01:40.439> has<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.520> same<00:01:42.049> threaded<00:01:43.049> m6

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
adapter which has the same threaded m6

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.520 
adapter which has the same threaded m6
located<00:01:44.850> throughout<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.149> plate<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.350> is

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
located throughout the plate so this is

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.859 
located throughout the plate so this is
actually<00:01:46.829> very<00:01:47.040> easy<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.340> mount<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.630> can

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
actually very easy to mount and that can

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.770 
actually very easy to mount and that can
be<00:01:49.020> done<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:51.079> the<00:01:52.079> meatman<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:54.149> lodge<00:01:54.329> you

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
be done on the meatman and the lodge you

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.520 
be done on the meatman and the lodge you
can<00:01:54.960> use<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.229> 100<00:01:55.560> 150<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.890> Mitchell<00:01:59.340> map
