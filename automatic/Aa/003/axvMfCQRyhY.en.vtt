00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:18.779
 at stake I find that alcohol is a 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:22.350
 addiction and diction the addiction that 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:26.449
 is not an easy word to pronounce a 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:32.430
 causes speech problems 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:35.850
 but disinhibits and to know 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.750
 as well as fire water has allowed 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.890
 Indian people a bit shy and a speech to 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.250
 limitations 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.250
 introverted to get out of their reserve 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:58.260
 and alcohol is very bad for them 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.190
 couples I think about the explosion of this 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.690
 couple that was coming out on average let's say 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.409
 three times per week 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:15.119
 finally he came out six times and 0 in 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.830
 general couples who love each other but 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.780
 that they drink does not last long 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.460
 on the other hand, the cooks who do not drink 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.240
 and who would not even be but can 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.800
 last a very long time 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:35.549
 and according to some international experts 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:39.590
 bourguignon it is better to live of love 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.630
 and fresh water that hate and 28 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.720
 may for the most part alas for the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.200
 most alcoologists have never 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.750
 frequented the bistrots an alcoologist is 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.720
 a bit of a sinologist who had never 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.000
 set foot in China 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.879
 I heard a little a alcohologist 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.660
 little they bowed him or a supporter of a 

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:06.629
 france without a bistro in a europe without 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.110
 alcohol but on a planet completely 

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:09.110
 round 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:24.030
 - ask this question these young people and 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:26.760
 the night sings very dense bed and drag 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:34.010
 would not it be better all alone at 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:37.310
 them watching TV from the poles and 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.980
 recognize recognizes freedom 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:44.340
 individual of each and I think of 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.859
 choice of this repentant abstinence that is 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.540
 held by the association of sober 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:55.200
 anonymous had the will to recover 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:59.970
 drink and have regrets afterwards 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.019
 stopped drinking so long it takes 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.389

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.560
