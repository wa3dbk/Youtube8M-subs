00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.000
 all mice hi today i want to do 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.120
 waffles and show it to you I already kneaded 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.910
 body mix dough but first before 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.219
 than this thing i was making powdered sugar 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.580
 it's very easy to make an artero mixer i 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.920
 just took the example of 100 grams of sugar 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.689
 more we did not need and all 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.000
 fell asleep thermomix you put on 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:30.890
 speed 10 is literally right here 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.890
 turned it at a speed of 10 literally 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:40.050
 30 and there was sugar powder turned out 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.670
 here it is and then when you will not 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.390
 ready we will sprinkle 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.670
 and the recipe for waffles is also very simple 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.460
 but very tasty, I just read it because 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:56.539
 what did she put out of the recipe 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:01:00.149
 from the bottom of course you need 500 grams of flour 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:05.850
 I'll tell you how I started, and I put 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:10.890
 first there are eggs sugar and butter 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.700
 namely 2 eggs 200 grams of sugar and 250 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.880
 gram of butter 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.840
 who wants no more such sweet waffles 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.960
 can put less than 160 150 grams here 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.360
 well, as the recipe contains 200 grams 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.850
 I also did a little less must say 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.869
 it's 160 I took on 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.920
 one pack of vanilla sugar survived 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:39.090
 a little lemon there is desirable to take 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.450
 fresh lemon they are with this pack 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.020
 so you know bottles so for sale 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.250
 fresh preferably further then i 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:54.850
 put the flour in there 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:58.630
 500 grams what else baking powder 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.960
 Here is such a pack of baking powder project 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:08.100
 I already said vanilla sugar 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:11.650
 poured water on 500 milliliters of water and 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.500
 everything and everyone is just at speed 4 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.970
 put everything mixed up and then 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.560
 added on speed 5 time it even 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.850
 no need to install just 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:28.300
 you see for yourself see what 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.280
 the consistency of the dough and you know when I 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.260
 it turned off she even bubbles there so 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:44.800
 let's go to the fact that itâ€™s as if everyone 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:49.150
 it is well strayed now you can just 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:53.830
 warm up it will be all ovens me so 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.980
 we do not often use but sometimes so 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.130
 I want to be pampered here 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.560
 to put 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:04.840
 I don't even know how to say how much they are 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.000
 dark must be and only as far as 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.519
 much getting they know even you 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.329
 I'll explain now it's included will warm up 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.590
 and then I'll show you what I say 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.989
 preferably if you do here 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.459
 this freeda so first you mix 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:24.160
 all the ingredients that are like butter 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:28.060
 eggs sugar pre 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.090
 first a couple of seconds at speed 4 somewhere 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.450
 so it all mix well maybe 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.810
 get half a minute half a second here seconds 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.690
 half a minute here and then again and then 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.760
 add there already water and others 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:49.510
 products so it will be so better in general 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.370
 that's what before 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.250
 nothing really honestly 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:58.209
 our warms up 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:01.390
 and will bake because to do that peak 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.880
 already in general already like that I fold here 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.430
 such 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.310
 lattice so it cools down because they 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.550
 such know crunchy waffles are obtained 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:14.300
