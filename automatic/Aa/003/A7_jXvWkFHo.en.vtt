show people how easy it is to use we

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.849 
show people how easy it is to use we
thought<00:00:21.660> we'd<00:00:21.810> jump<00:00:22.020> out<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.350> plane<00:00:22.500> and

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
thought we'd jump out of a plane and

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.830 
thought we'd jump out of a plane and
create<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.670> publish<00:00:23.880> your<00:00:24.180> web<00:00:24.330> page<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
create and publish your web page on the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.630 
create and publish your web page on the
way<00:00:24.960> down<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:26.070> we're<00:00:26.160> going<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.340> jump<00:00:26.519> out

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
way down so we're going to jump out

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.730 
way down so we're going to jump out
twice<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.570> first<00:00:27.779> time<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.289> get<00:00:28.410> some<00:00:28.560> footage

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
twice the first time to get some footage

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.040 
twice the first time to get some footage
so<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.369> can<00:00:29.580> use<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.820> footage<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.570> second

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
so we can use that footage in the second

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.690 
so we can use that footage in the second
jump<00:00:31.260> when<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:31.650> actually<00:00:31.800> create<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.550> web

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700
