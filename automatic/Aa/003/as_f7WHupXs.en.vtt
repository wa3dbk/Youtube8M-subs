Vincent<00:01:22.710> Kompany<00:01:22.950> which<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:24.030> see<00:01:24.060> here

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
Vincent Kompany which you can see here

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.710 
Vincent Kompany which you can see here
and<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.320> thought<00:01:25.710> let's<00:01:26.340> get<00:01:26.729> them<00:01:26.970> both<00:01:27.330> on

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
and so I thought let's get them both on

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.990 
and so I thought let's get them both on
the<00:01:28.590> right<00:01:28.740> back<00:01:28.920> position<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.520> Michael

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the right back position we have Michael

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.420 
the right back position we have Michael
Richards<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.570> strong<00:01:31.350> right<00:01:31.740> back<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> very

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
Richards is strong right back a very

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.179 
Richards is strong right back a very
strong<00:01:32.850> player<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.420> really<00:01:34.049> needed<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
strong player I really needed and on the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.370 
strong player I really needed and on the
left<00:01:35.400> back<00:01:35.610> position<00:01:35.820> clichy<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
left back position clichy so we have a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.800 
left back position clichy so we have a
great<00:01:37.650> combination<00:01:38.009> between<00:01:38.630> strength<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
great combination between strength and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.249 
great combination between strength and
paste<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.040> defense<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.450> thought<00:01:42.780> this

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
paste in the defense and I thought this

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.060 
paste in the defense and I thought this
was<00:01:43.500> necessary<00:01:44.390> as<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> striker<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.439> got<00:01:46.649> Luis

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
was necessary as a striker we got Luis

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.120 
was necessary as a striker we got Luis
Suarez<00:01:47.579> as<00:01:47.850> our<00:01:48.090> new<00:01:48.390> striker<00:01:48.740> instead<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.890> ben

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
Suarez as our new striker instead of ben

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.090 
Suarez as our new striker instead of ben
rooney<00:01:50.369> he's<00:01:51.149> much<00:01:51.869> cheaper<00:01:52.439> than<00:01:52.470> Rooney<00:01:52.920> and

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
rooney he's much cheaper than Rooney and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.490 
rooney he's much cheaper than Rooney and
I<00:01:53.520> know<00:01:53.579> I'm<00:01:53.880> from<00:01:54.210> playing<00:01:54.840> with<00:01:55.020> Liverpool

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
I know I'm from playing with Liverpool

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.920 
I know I'm from playing with Liverpool
and<00:01:55.590> head<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.920> head<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.729> thought<00:01:57.210> let's<00:01:57.509> try

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
and head to head so I thought let's try

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.469 
and head to head so I thought let's try
them<00:01:58.049> out<00:01:58.140> an<00:01:58.439> ultimate<00:01:59.040> team<00:01:59.280> then<00:01:59.909> I<00:01:59.939> decided

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
them out an ultimate team then I decided

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.959 
them out an ultimate team then I decided
to<00:02:00.689> do<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> pack<00:02:01.200> opening<00:02:01.740> with<00:02:01.920> opening<00:02:02.490> seven

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
to do a pack opening with opening seven

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.490 
to do a pack opening with opening seven

of the season players are out after the
peg<00:03:39.130> opening<00:03:39.670> I<00:03:39.820> played<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.299> next<00:03:40.570> season<00:03:40.930> but

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
peg opening I played the next season but

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.759 
peg opening I played the next season but
I<00:03:41.680> have<00:03:41.920> to<00:03:42.130> admit<00:03:42.190> I<00:03:42.610> totally<00:03:43.450> failed<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.049> it

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
I have to admit I totally failed and it

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.620 
I have to admit I totally failed and it
wasn't<00:03:45.130> my<00:03:45.220> day<00:03:45.280> I<00:03:45.459> played<00:03:45.850> all<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.209> matches

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
wasn't my day I played all the matches

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.720 
wasn't my day I played all the matches
at<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:47.049> same<00:03:47.290> day<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:47.830> this<00:03:48.160> was<00:03:48.340> maybe<00:03:48.519> my

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
at the same day so this was maybe my

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.330 
at the same day so this was maybe my
mistake<00:03:49.180> but<00:03:49.959> at<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.470> end<00:03:50.500> of<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.830> season<00:03:51.010> I

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
mistake but at the end of the season I

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.150 
mistake but at the end of the season I
managed<00:03:51.880> to<00:03:51.940> safety<00:03:52.660> which<00:03:52.840> one<00:03:53.170> and<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:53.950> the

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
managed to safety which one and so the

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.670 
managed to safety which one and so the
situation<00:03:54.760> hasn't<00:03:55.000> changed<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:55.750> this<00:03:56.500> was

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
situation hasn't changed and this was

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.800 
situation hasn't changed and this was
the<00:03:56.830> reason<00:03:56.980> I<00:03:57.250> decided<00:03:57.670> to<00:03:57.880> left<00:03:58.239> it<00:03:58.450> out<00:03:58.630> of

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
the reason I decided to left it out of
