slush films and Trevor bringing the
tutorial<00:00:20.070> on<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.220> Java<00:00:20.460> programming

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
tutorial on the Java programming

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.910 
tutorial on the Java programming
language<00:00:21.199> so<00:00:22.199> today<00:00:22.529> we're<00:00:22.680> going<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.859> be

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
language so today we're going to be

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.150 
language so today we're going to be
looking<00:00:23.070> at<00:00:23.430> user<00:00:23.820> input<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.920> first<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.099> all

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
looking at user input and first of all

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.310 
looking at user input and first of all
what<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.460> user<00:00:26.910> input<00:00:27.240> user<00:00:27.689> input<00:00:28.140> is

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
what is user input user input is

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.220 
what is user input user input is
anything<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.519> user<00:00:29.760> could<00:00:30.269> type<00:00:30.960> into

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
anything that the user could type into

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.790 
anything that the user could type into
the<00:00:32.070> program<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.550> say<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.600> ask<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.200> user<00:00:34.410> what

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
the program so say I ask the user what

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.190 
the program so say I ask the user what
is<00:00:35.010> your<00:00:35.160> name<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:36.090> user<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:36.540> type<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.930> their

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
is your name the user can type in their

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.940 
is your name the user can type in their
name<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:38.010> that's<00:00:38.160> basically<00:00:38.489> user<00:00:38.730> input<00:00:39.149> and

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
name so that's basically user input and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.709 
name so that's basically user input and
first<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.460> get<00:00:41.640> user<00:00:41.879> input<00:00:41.969> we<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.540> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
first to get user input we have to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.010 
first to get user input we have to
import<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.890> actual<00:00:44.340> thing<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.300> runs<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
import the actual thing that runs the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.440 
import the actual thing that runs the
user<00:00:46.230> input<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:48.030> do<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.270> we're

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
user input and this is to do this we're

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.350 
user input and this is to do this we're
going<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.600> type<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.960> import<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.239> then<00:00:51.239> we're

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
going to type in import and then we're

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.590 
going to type in import and then we're
gonna<00:00:51.449> type<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.960> Java<00:00:52.850> dot<00:00:53.850> util<00:00:54.809> dot<00:00:55.280> scanner

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
gonna type in Java dot util dot scanner

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.590 
gonna type in Java dot util dot scanner
and<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> user<00:00:58.609> input<00:00:59.609> thing<00:01:00.090> that

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
and this is the user input thing that

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.030 
and this is the user input thing that
we're<00:01:00.750> going<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.899> use<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:02.000> to<00:01:03.000> first<00:01:04.040> activate

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
we're going to use and to first activate

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.300 
we're going to use and to first activate
the<00:01:05.659> creat<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.500> create<00:01:07.740> first<00:01:08.189> we

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the creat we have to create first we

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.550 
the creat we have to create first we
have<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.490> create<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.790> new<00:01:09.090> user<00:01:09.689> input<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.290> this

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
have to create a new user input and this

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.050 
have to create a new user input and this
is<00:01:10.740> not<00:01:10.860> actually<00:01:12.530> making<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.799> user<00:01:14.040> input<00:01:14.909> it

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
is not actually making the user input it

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.880 
is not actually making the user input it
we're<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.960> gonna<00:01:16.380> initialize<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.549> scanner

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
we're just gonna initialize the scanner

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.620 
we're just gonna initialize the scanner
so<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.400> do<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.640> with<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.939> type<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.150> scanner

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
so to do this with the type of scanner

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.999 
so to do this with the type of scanner
and<00:01:22.020> then<00:01:22.200> we're<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.439> call<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.830> something

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
and then we're to call it something

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.210 
and then we're to call it something
let's<00:01:23.850> call<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.150> input<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:25.590> could<00:01:25.740> name<00:01:26.189> it

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
let's call it input you could name it

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.950 
let's call it input you could name it
anything<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.850> want<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.270> we're<00:01:27.509> gonna<00:01:27.600> set<00:01:27.869> it

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
anything you want and we're gonna set it

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.899 
anything you want and we're gonna set it
equal<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:29.040> new<00:01:30.049> scanner<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.470> then<00:01:32.460> we're

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
equal to a new scanner and then we're

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.240 
equal to a new scanner and then we're
gonna<00:01:33.030> put<00:01:33.210> round<00:01:34.200> brackets<00:01:34.650> everyone<00:01:35.159> knows

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
gonna put round brackets everyone knows

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.590 
gonna put round brackets everyone knows
-<00:01:35.400> system<00:01:36.060> don't<00:01:36.390> end<00:01:36.829> because<00:01:37.829> since<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
- system don't end because since the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.149 
- system don't end because since the
system<00:01:39.600> has<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.780> take<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.259> something<00:01:40.560> and

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
system has to take in something and

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.130 
system has to take in something and
we're<00:01:41.790> gonna<00:01:41.880> put<00:01:42.060> semicolon<00:01:43.009> so<00:01:44.689> now<00:01:45.689> let's

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
we're gonna put semicolon so now let's

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.940 
we're gonna put semicolon so now let's
ask<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.890> user<00:01:47.520> what<00:01:48.329> what<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.229> your<00:01:49.409> name<00:01:49.590> so

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
ask the user what what is your name so

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.700 
ask the user what what is your name so
to<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.280> we're<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:50.700> gonna<00:01:51.030> do<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.079> standard

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
to this we're just gonna do the standard

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.080 
to this we're just gonna do the standard
system<00:01:53.159> dot<00:01:53.520> print<00:01:53.790> out<00:01:54.030> print<00:01:54.780> align<00:01:55.020> or<00:01:55.829> say

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
system dot print out print align or say

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.910 
system dot print out print align or say
so<00:01:57.090> what<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.869> your<00:01:58.200> name<00:01:59.000> okay<00:02:00.710> so<00:02:01.710> we're<00:02:01.829> gonna

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
put semicolon there and we don't

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.740 
put semicolon there and we don't
actually<00:02:05.399> have<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:07.099> scanner<00:02:08.099> yet<00:02:08.750> since

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
actually have the scanner yet since

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.350 
actually have the scanner yet since
Silla<00:02:10.379> if<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.800> play<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.250> right<00:02:11.340> now<00:02:11.580> it's<00:02:12.180> not

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
Silla if we play this right now it's not

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.210 
Silla if we play this right now it's not
going<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.660> ask

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
going to ask

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.120 
going to ask
anything<00:02:13.550> because<00:02:13.850> we<00:02:14.000> haven't<00:02:14.860> told<00:02:15.860> the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
anything because we haven't told the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.120 
anything because we haven't told the
user<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:17.000> put<00:02:17.510> in<00:02:17.660> something<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.740> do<00:02:18.950> this

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
going to initialize it we're not going

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.060 
going to initialize it we're not going
to<00:02:29.300> actually<00:02:29.660> set<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.260> equal<00:02:30.380> to<00:02:30.620> anything

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
to actually set it equal to anything

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.560 
to actually set it equal to anything
because<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.990> user<00:02:33.320> has<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.830> make<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.760> name

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
because the user has to make the name

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.720 
because the user has to make the name
equal<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.290> something<00:02:36.650> their<00:02:36.890> name<00:02:37.100> honestly

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
equal to something their name honestly

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.720 
equal to something their name honestly
and<00:02:38.120> we're<00:02:39.050> gonna<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.680> activate<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:41.350> scanner

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
and we're gonna to activate the scanner

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.860 
and we're gonna to activate the scanner
we're<00:02:43.730> gonna<00:02:43.910> set<00:02:44.120> name<00:02:44.950> equal<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:47.090> input

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
we're gonna set name equal to the input

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.530 
we're gonna set name equal to the input
which<00:02:48.230> is<00:02:48.260> here<00:02:49.090> dot<00:02:50.090> next<00:02:51.070> lined<00:02:52.180> with<00:02:53.180> empty

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
which is here dot next lined with empty

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.940 
which is here dot next lined with empty
parameters<00:02:53.990> so<00:02:54.980> what<00:02:55.310> this<00:02:55.490> is<00:02:55.700> saying<00:02:55.730> is

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
parameters so what this is saying is

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
parameters so what this is saying is
make<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.280> name<00:02:58.550> which<00:02:59.120> is<00:02:59.330> a<00:02:59.360> string<00:03:00.790> equal<00:03:01.790> to

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
make the name which is a string equal to

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.370 
make the name which is a string equal to
the<00:03:02.060> input<00:03:02.660> which<00:03:03.530> is<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.709> input<00:03:03.800> here<00:03:04.100> and

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
the input which is the input here and

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.760 
the input which is the input here and
then<00:03:06.380> make<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.830> wait<00:03:07.900> make<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:09.050> wait<00:03:09.290> for

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
then make it wait make it wait for

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.580 
then make it wait make it wait for
something<00:03:10.190> make<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.150> wait<00:03:11.480> for<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:12.410> user

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
something make it wait for the user

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.760 
something make it wait for the user
input<00:03:13.040> for<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.370> user<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:13.820> type<00:03:14.030> their<00:03:14.300> name<00:03:14.540> in

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
input for the user to type their name in

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.070 
input for the user to type their name in
so<00:03:15.770> that's<00:03:15.950> basically<00:03:16.850> it<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.480> create<00:03:17.870> user

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
so that's basically it to create user

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.440 
so that's basically it to create user
input<00:03:18.380> and<00:03:18.650> let's<00:03:19.010> save<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.430> first<00:03:19.910> play<00:03:20.180> and

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
input and let's save it first play and

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.080 
input and let's save it first play and
ask<00:03:21.320> what<00:03:21.709> is<00:03:21.860> your<00:03:21.890> name<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:22.430> we<00:03:22.730> could<00:03:22.880> type

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
ask what is your name and we could type

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.750 
ask what is your name and we could type
in<00:03:23.350> Patrick<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:25.959> that's<00:03:26.959> user<00:03:27.260> input<00:03:27.680> so<00:03:27.950> you

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
in Patrick and that's user input so you

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.850 
in Patrick and that's user input so you
can<00:03:29.090> notice<00:03:29.420> that<00:03:29.600> nothing<00:03:30.260> really<00:03:30.380> happened

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
can notice that nothing really happened

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.180 
can notice that nothing really happened
after<00:03:31.370> I<00:03:31.459> typed<00:03:31.760> in<00:03:31.940> Patrick<00:03:32.480> and<00:03:33.010> right<00:03:34.010> now

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
after I typed in Patrick and right now

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.979 
after I typed in Patrick and right now
we're<00:03:34.370> gonna<00:03:34.459> I<00:03:34.820> know<00:03:35.360> this<00:03:35.540> is<00:03:35.690> a<00:03:35.750> little

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
type in system dot out dot print Ln and

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.590 
type in system dot out dot print Ln and
we're<00:03:49.250> gonna<00:03:49.370> put<00:03:49.730> in<00:03:51.670> quotations<00:03:52.670> your<00:03:53.000> name

is space plus the name what you just

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.410 
is space plus the name what you just
typed<00:03:59.690> in<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:00.680> since<00:04:01.070> Java<00:04:01.640> looks<00:04:02.000> from

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
typed in and since Java looks from

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.990 
typed in and since Java looks from
bottom<00:04:03.760> down<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:05.090> started<00:04:05.900> top<00:04:06.170> down<00:04:06.730> it<00:04:07.730> will

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
bottom down I started top down it will

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.600 
bottom down I started top down it will
already<00:04:08.239> have<00:04:08.420> name<00:04:09.080> since<00:04:09.980> we<00:04:10.160> put<00:04:10.370> name

already have name since we put name
equal<00:04:11.239> to<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.959> input<00:04:12.380> which<00:04:12.530> is<00:04:12.560> what<00:04:12.830> you

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
equal to the input which is what you

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.990 
equal to the input which is what you
typed<00:04:13.250> in<00:04:13.510> so<00:04:14.510> we<00:04:14.989> saved<00:04:15.260> it<00:04:15.470> press<00:04:15.890> play<00:04:16.220> what

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
typed in so we saved it press play what

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.140 
typed in so we saved it press play what
is<00:04:17.150> your<00:04:17.299> name<00:04:17.560> Patrick<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:19.070> it<00:04:19.790> says<00:04:19.970> your

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
is your name Patrick and it says your

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.690 
is your name Patrick and it says your
name<00:04:20.269> is<00:04:20.450> Patrick<00:04:20.900> so<00:04:21.709> this<00:04:22.190> was<00:04:22.370> a<00:04:22.400> quick

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
name is Patrick so this was a quick

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.350 
name is Patrick so this was a quick
tutorial<00:04:22.910> on<00:04:23.479> user<00:04:23.840> input<00:04:23.990> let's<00:04:24.770> just<00:04:24.950> review

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
tutorial on user input let's just review

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.860 
tutorial on user input let's just review
we<00:04:27.080> first<00:04:27.860> imported<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.699> Java<00:04:29.030> util<00:04:29.810> dot

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
we first imported the Java util dot

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.390 
we first imported the Java util dot
scanner<00:04:30.020> which<00:04:30.560> we<00:04:30.710> need<00:04:30.860> to<00:04:30.979> create<00:04:31.159> user

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
scanner which we need to create user

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.390 
scanner which we need to create user
input<00:04:31.990> and<00:04:32.990> we<00:04:33.139> did<00:04:33.289> all<00:04:33.470> this<00:04:33.620> class<00:04:34.069> stuff

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
input and we did all this class stuff

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.129 
input and we did all this class stuff
you<00:04:34.580> know<00:04:34.699> you<00:04:34.909> guys<00:04:35.060> you<00:04:35.389> guys<00:04:35.689> already<00:04:35.930> know

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
you know you guys you guys already know

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.399 
you know you guys you guys already know
this<00:04:36.289> and<00:04:37.250> then<00:04:37.490> we<00:04:37.699> created<00:04:38.240> a<00:04:38.479> scanner<00:04:39.080> and

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:39.409 
this and then we created a scanner and

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:42.790 
this and then we created a scanner and
we<00:04:40.129> just<00:04:40.310> call<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:40.520> input<00:04:40.849> and<00:04:41.300> then<00:04:42.199> new

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
we just call it input and then new

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.670 
we just call it input and then new
scanner<00:04:43.159> and<00:04:43.400> then<00:04:43.520> system<00:04:43.939> dot<00:04:43.969> in<00:04:44.330> which<00:04:45.169> the

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
scanner and then system dot in which the

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.740 
scanner and then system dot in which the
system<00:04:46.039> needs<00:04:46.219> something<00:04:46.669> to<00:04:46.969> put<00:04:47.150> in<00:04:47.330> its

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
system needs something to put in its

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.230 
system needs something to put in its
their<00:04:47.900> system<00:04:48.319> and<00:04:48.500> then<00:04:49.099> we<00:04:49.250> create<00:04:49.580> a<00:04:49.610> string

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
their system and then we create a string

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.490 
their system and then we create a string
which<00:04:51.169> is<00:04:51.199> the<00:04:52.300> we<00:04:53.300> create<00:04:53.539> a<00:04:53.599> string<00:04:53.900> so<00:04:54.169> we

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
which is the we create a string so we

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.860 
which is the we create a string so we
could<00:04:54.770> have<00:04:54.949> the<00:04:55.150> we<00:04:56.150> can<00:04:56.300> have<00:04:56.419> it<00:04:56.539> equal<00:04:56.840> to

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
could have the we can have it equal to

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.600 
could have the we can have it equal to
the<00:04:57.020> input<00:04:57.139> and<00:04:57.639> then<00:04:58.639> we<00:04:58.870> just<00:05:00.190> said<00:05:01.190> what<00:05:01.460> is
