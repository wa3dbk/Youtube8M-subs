the<00:00:43.600> box<00:00:43.870> I<00:00:44.379> think<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:44.949> specific<00:00:45.579> model<00:00:46.210> is

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
the box I think the specific model is

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.450 
the box I think the specific model is
the<00:00:47.469> 8900<00:00:48.039> or<00:00:48.430> 8925<00:00:49.230> maybe<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.440> number<00:00:51.219> that<00:00:51.340> I

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
the 8900 or 8925 maybe the number that I

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.509 
the 8900 or 8925 maybe the number that I
actually<00:00:51.730> see<00:00:52.149> on<00:00:52.840> the<00:00:53.079> device<00:00:53.320> itself<00:00:53.519> so

about<00:04:45.070> 4550<00:04:45.880> degrees<00:04:45.910> and<00:04:46.539> you<00:04:46.660> could<00:04:46.780> set<00:04:46.990> it

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
about 4550 degrees and you could set it

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.930 
about 4550 degrees and you could set it
down<00:04:47.199> it<00:04:47.530> would<00:04:47.800> be<00:04:47.919> like<00:04:47.949> in<00:04:48.220> a<00:04:48.280> mini<00:04:48.490> laptop

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
down it would be like in a mini laptop

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.969 
down it would be like in a mini laptop
mode<00:04:49.210> and<00:04:49.600> if<00:04:50.320> you<00:04:50.410> were<00:04:50.470> to<00:04:50.530> come<00:04:50.710> over<00:04:50.860> here

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
mode and if you were to come over here

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.950 
mode and if you were to come over here
on<00:04:51.070> this<00:04:51.190> side<00:04:51.250> you<00:04:51.850> can<00:04:52.000> see<00:04:52.030> how<00:04:52.360> it<00:04:52.509> tilts<00:04:52.810> up

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
on this side you can see how it tilts up

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.409 
on this side you can see how it tilts up
and<00:04:53.650> there<00:04:53.860> it<00:04:53.979> is<00:04:54.070> about<00:04:54.340> probably<00:04:55.150> 50

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
and there it is about probably 50

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.529 
and there it is about probably 50
degrees<00:04:55.720> or<00:04:55.900> so<00:04:56.080> and<00:04:56.759> come<00:04:57.759> on<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:58.120> back<00:04:58.360> you

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
degrees or so and come on the back you

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.480 
degrees or so and come on the back you
probably<00:04:58.810> can't<00:04:59.020> see<00:04:59.080> in<00:04:59.289> this<00:04:59.380> video<00:04:59.590> but

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
probably can't see in this video but

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.969 
probably can't see in this video but
there's<00:05:00.639> a<00:05:00.699> hinge<00:05:01.000> down<00:05:01.270> inside<00:05:01.690> here<00:05:01.990> it's

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
there's a hinge down inside here it's

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.460 
there's a hinge down inside here it's
actually<00:05:03.100> two<00:05:03.460> hinges<00:05:03.850> and<00:05:04.120> they<00:05:04.750> seem<00:05:04.990> really

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
actually two hinges and they seem really

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.100 
actually two hinges and they seem really
sturdy<00:05:06.039> and<00:05:06.280> actually<00:05:06.849> lets<00:05:07.030> you<00:05:07.090> tilt<00:05:07.720> it<00:05:07.870> at

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
sturdy and actually lets you tilt it at

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.890 
sturdy and actually lets you tilt it at
any<00:05:08.470> angle<00:05:08.740> don't<00:05:09.460> have<00:05:09.550> to<00:05:09.639> go<00:05:09.759> for<00:05:10.000> are<00:05:10.509> all

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
any angle don't have to go for are all

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.600 
any angle don't have to go for are all
the<00:05:11.020> way<00:05:11.139> down<00:05:11.349> you<00:05:11.590> can<00:05:11.740> tilt<00:05:12.130> it<00:05:12.220> pretty<00:05:12.490> much

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
the way down you can tilt it pretty much

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.100 
the way down you can tilt it pretty much
any<00:05:12.820> angle<00:05:13.120> you'd<00:05:13.240> like<00:05:13.419> to<00:05:13.660> be<00:05:13.750> comfortable

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
any angle you'd like to be comfortable

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.770 
any angle you'd like to be comfortable
with<00:05:14.289> and<00:05:14.940> use<00:05:15.940> you<00:05:16.090> can<00:05:16.150> see<00:05:16.300> how<00:05:16.389> that<00:05:16.539> holds

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
with and use you can see how that holds

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.390 
with and use you can see how that holds
up<00:05:16.900> over<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.199> years<00:05:17.349> but<00:05:17.650> it's<00:05:17.800> it<00:05:18.099> actually

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
up over the years but it's it actually

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.150 
up over the years but it's it actually
seems<00:05:18.610> pretty<00:05:18.729> stiff<00:05:19.270> and<00:05:19.539> quite<00:05:20.470> durable<00:05:20.710> so

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
seems pretty stiff and quite durable so

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.120 
seems pretty stiff and quite durable so
see<00:05:21.460> how<00:05:21.550> that<00:05:21.699> works<00:05:22.620> interesting<00:05:23.620> on<00:05:23.919> this

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
see how that works interesting on this

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.920 
see how that works interesting on this
device<00:05:24.460> um<00:05:24.789> it's<00:05:25.330> not<00:05:25.389> underneath<00:05:25.720> the

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
device um it's not underneath the
