 Doctor not renewed and Christian Falk

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.070
 wrong with his fifth goal of the season 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.350
 then he returns with Derek 11 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.410
 the artist of toptarif sinks into the gate 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.440
 the cheers too early 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.610
 Referee Dieter Muckenhammer has seen a striker foul 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.640

 for the hosts after only 21 minutes 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.130
 Lustenau only with rare relief attacks Mario Bolter here 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.760
 again with a push 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.680
 In the second 45 minutes comes at Lustenau the tele2 instead of David 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.179
 Witteveen 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.619
 the Lustenauer are better in the game Stefan Rieß 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:15.289
 with the pass on Christian Ritzmaier 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:18.289
 the shot but Zuken placed 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.840

 Flank order Coburg 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:27.570

 then Edo filing for Stefan Rieß and again 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.599
 Bad luck for the FC Lustenau 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.579
 it remains at the 2 0 for the value they have the Carinthians last in five games 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.419
 The Lavanttaler defense keeps tight twelve goals this time 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:57.999
 if something does not work then you have to 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:01.900
 to try something and today we have again given the opportunity to 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:04.879
 Superman "Do not play Zyla from the beginning" That's it 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.400

 they did not have a chance now we have so many goals scored over it 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.609
 we tried to change something that worked well today 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.659
 we are satisfied that we have of course played to zero 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.790
 Jochum the death and everyone in our industry stay regular Becker we 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.699
 want 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.759
 From the first to the last minute more or less chance 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.589
 maybe too good of Marco Mader 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:37.369
 OZ that may perhaps only with the one since the ride xetra-dax the opposite side 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:38.859
 Man less wine sovereignty

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.079
 Hopper being more 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.269
 but it was spokeswoman for the section for his and Kane storm but 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.319
 It was not surprising that Marko com and the principle was one 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.739
 chance 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.450
 Tony Pulis year, Google 7700 fans earned the prestigious 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.139
 Do not miss city derby

 five regular players are missing 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.149

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.019
 Henrique yellow 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.549
 Harald Unverdorben until then 4 08 38 seconds 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.569
 sixth goal of the season already four and photo albums 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:22.599
 he is completely free he pushed the markets too hesitantly 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.629
 a prelude to measure for the LASK 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:28.009
 some blue and white are even more fun that is not yet 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:29.469
 in the stadium 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:32.729
 one almost has the impression that the LASK literally wants local rivals 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:33.909
 devour 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:35.120
 Brolin of the interventions 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.120
 Hannes Zeltner from the left 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.430
 and by Henry always felt playable everywhere and Daimler 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.550
 Of course, the following corner will be a case for the new Last game 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.189
 marker 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:55.599
 Florian hard good try from the second row after five minutes 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.690
 Blue-white coach Thomas Weissenböck should not be the servant 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.180
 presented 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.180
 Weather a lot of traffic in the blue and white penalty area 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.819
 and again the new lask coach quite strong performance in his first 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:12.259
 second game in the city 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.850
 blue-white from early arrears as paralyzed after 29 minutes the first 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.089
 Offensive signs of life Manuel Hartl environment in a duel with Robert Schellander 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.280
 no penalty satite judge Dominik Laux look 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.699
 a wrong decision 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.699
 as the slow motion shows 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:33.409
 the local of the top league many emotions in the game 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.849
 EB for this, the children must henceforth playmaker colleagues Nikolov 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.589
 the same applies to military 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:47.809
 the idea for the blue and white Seeler Svetozar Nikolov platform Brazilian 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:53.710
 and a third time the participation in the 36 minutes of play and 

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:55.150
 now there's yellow-red 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.249
 but not for the citizen it is for some Luis Enrique Tel 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:00.889
 Referee Rawschan Quartet a swallow 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.610
 a slow motion has not changed which 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.000
 and that will be refuted 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.190
 The light bulb is clearly titled "The Last One of the Best Awning" 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.879
 pretend 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:14.809
 the feasible at Sustanon Irish outnumber not much we are 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:17.809
 already shortly before the break whistle Pecina with the long pass 

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:23.229
 Dominic Hassler and that is also the same trailer with the Krallerhof Russia 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:23.999
 firmly 

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:28.429
 However, under vigorous help with the help of the young larvae defend place of 

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:29.990

 the LASK after side change with the anger in the stomach 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:41.499
 Panis relief by shot doing equally well parried by children 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:47.539
 then the working day for Nico is prematurely over 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:52.389
 Hiltrud also for the Bulgarians the most intuitive personal tie after 51 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.389
 Restored minutes 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.210
 Both teams neutralized in the episode against Celtic 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.050
 once again blue-white Linz 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.050
 so try it out 

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:12.930
 on the opposite side 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.870
 Fabian Bimmer the 18-year-old center-back but whistled because 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:17.760
 offside 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.760
 it remains fierce at the 1 1 in a heated Dhabi's optional one after that 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.490
 is discussed above all about the alleged swallow is a 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.710
 Exclusion from us in the way 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.880
 Social presented as one is based and not a swallow tight and even more 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.599
 in the way 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:36.229
 Werlte Munich put on by that time the best man in the square was 

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:39.399
 and when the referee plays football 

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:43.339
 it looks like it's in special schools you have to apply it that way it was not 

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:45.169
 Mattern holds in the penalty area 

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:48.600
 the referee the eleven thousand spectators men nationwide 

00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:51.900

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.939
 the missed penalty 

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:57.020
 The bottom line is by the first 16 is so happy 

00:07:57.679 --> 00:08:02.249
 Meeting points of the then second season at the left along with many emotions and 

00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:02.889
