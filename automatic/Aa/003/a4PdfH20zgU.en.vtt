00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
batteries don't take as is dim but it is

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.590 
batteries don't take as is dim but it is
that<00:00:29.800> is<00:00:29.920> low<00:00:30.070> now<00:00:30.310> see<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:30.789> galaxies<00:00:31.180> to<00:00:31.360> can

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
that is low now see the galaxies to can

pretty light as you can see it has a
gray<00:01:11.830> side<00:01:12.160> I<00:01:13.200> suppose<00:01:14.200> from<00:01:14.410> the<00:01:14.620> side<00:01:14.800> it<00:01:15.010> has

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
gray side I suppose from the side it has

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.100 
gray side I suppose from the side it has
the<00:01:15.310> volume<00:01:15.730> which<00:01:16.270> I<00:01:16.390> would<00:01:16.510> appreciate<00:01:16.720> like
