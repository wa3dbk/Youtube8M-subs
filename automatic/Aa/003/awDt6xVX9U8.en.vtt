00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello to all me it is jeremy and for my 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.440
 first video I was talking to you about a 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.309
 we all have 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:15.299
 finally I think it's obviously a bed 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.130
 but above all a bed what is a bed 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.859
 is a piece of furniture with which one can 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.930
 to rest but above all we can and 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.769
 to sleep 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:28.170
 ok ok in a bed you can sleep but 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:40.379
 we go back to hide it we can not think 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:42.450
 in bed without thinking for a moment it's because 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.840
 that you think a game play at the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.170
 hopscotch 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.600
 but otherwise except sleep and play at the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.070
 hopscotch it must be said that our high school 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.289
 rossi to glander but very often when 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.079
 we plant which our customers have either 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:04.199
 annie smartphones ah yeah you think 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:07.710
 to have me like that is holding a stand or so 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.070
 we watch TV usually when we 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.979
 gland watching TV after midnight we 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.090
 can fall on more or less ads 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.689

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.259

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.799
 monster we thought we had on our 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:34.350
 reads when we were little now the 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.030
 monster disappeared but he left 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.030
 an eat kart 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.080
 when we sleep we also do a lot of 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.540
 very very weird positions 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.970
 and yeah we can avoid a very good 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.350
 part of the animals I'm not you but 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.490
