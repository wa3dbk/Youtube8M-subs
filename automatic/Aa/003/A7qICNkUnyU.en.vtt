00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.799
 I do not know how I do that 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.830
 The shoe that these people see 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:17.460
 originated by ninth in fact when 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:19.410
 making it happen so that's the tc 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.170
 dinho 100% cotton 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.840
 Then I'll molly you and I'll do it. 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.510
 Leo class kz I'll leave here at 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.179
 description of this video link to video 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.260
 that teaches when resenting of molina 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.620
 that application usage ends thereafter 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:42.059
 I hope to dry make the iron then the fabric 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.610
 so it is a deserved it will work 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.289
 and it gets more like this 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.390
 harder and more technical 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.510
 so come on, this colorado that I'm 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.960
 using here is 15 by 15 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.780
 you can do too you think better 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.980
 how does it get that side covered 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.980
 This is the name of the time only. 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.320
 so this first work that I go 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:26.810
 do 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:26.810
 the stamping time learning is in 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:45.299
 again opens 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:02:03.090
 then we're moving in that direction and 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:02:18.390
 Now we're going to go and then the fold. 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:38.100
 up there will pulling here is to have it 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:42.829
 that I had taken that mark was 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.829
 here is this sadness to me 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:03:03.660
 still and now this tip works the 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:20.480
 people go in this marking that 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:20.480
 and it's not who comes again 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:56.280
 this goal has made the movie people fail 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:59.209
 how to do other side is also here 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.209
 now 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:29.380
 Petrobras and the agency are not 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:33.780
 Missing the finishing traffic so they 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.780
 do not have to see that the top 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:05:03.400
 There we go and continue here and I come 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:05:24.130
 here with which those 200 plus one 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:27.210
 bit to be very firm and now it 's 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.210
 just take 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:50.499
 and he is right and he is ready 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:52.979
 Then I'll give you an infected tooth like 

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:52.979
 like this 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:13.659
 This is it before I hope you have 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.789
 liked the tip they do also had 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:18.219
 an illness that leaves a comment from the 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:21.969

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:24.879
