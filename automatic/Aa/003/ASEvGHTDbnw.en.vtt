00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.670 
comments on another video was a kind of
a<00:04:01.180> statement<00:04:01.480> but<00:04:01.780> it's<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:02.019> good<00:04:02.169> question<00:04:02.319> I

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
a statement but it's a good question I

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.009 
a statement but it's a good question I
guess<00:04:02.829> to<00:04:02.980> take<00:04:03.129> a<00:04:03.159> look<00:04:03.370> at<00:04:03.519> is<00:04:04.019> quality

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
guess to take a look at is quality

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.800 
guess to take a look at is quality
versus<00:04:05.469> quantity<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:06.430> do<00:04:07.239> you<00:04:07.329> really<00:04:07.629> want

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
versus quantity and do you really want

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.309 
versus quantity and do you really want
to<00:04:07.870> work<00:04:07.989> on<00:04:08.939> getting<00:04:09.939> good<00:04:10.269> skill<00:04:10.629> sets<00:04:10.930> or<00:04:11.230> do

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
to work on getting good skill sets or do

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.509 
to work on getting good skill sets or do
you<00:04:11.379> want<00:04:11.530> to<00:04:11.590> work<00:04:11.739> on<00:04:11.859> a<00:04:11.889> lot<00:04:12.040> of<00:04:12.069> dwellers

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
you want to work on a lot of dwellers

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.390 
you want to work on a lot of dwellers
and<00:04:12.790> I<00:04:13.720> think<00:04:14.169> it<00:04:14.290> takes<00:04:14.470> a<00:04:14.650> certain<00:04:14.979> skill<00:04:15.250> in

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
and I think it takes a certain skill in

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.039 
and I think it takes a certain skill in
the<00:04:15.489> game<00:04:15.699> to<00:04:16.120> get<00:04:16.359> a<00:04:16.419> lot<00:04:16.599> of<00:04:16.720> dwellers

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
the game to get a lot of dwellers

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.240 
the game to get a lot of dwellers
because<00:04:17.380> you're<00:04:17.500> always<00:04:17.680> going<00:04:17.979> to<00:04:18.009> be

because you're always going to be

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.360 
because you're always going to be
chasing<00:04:19.060> additional<00:04:19.659> resources<00:04:20.079> but<00:04:21.009> keep<00:04:21.220> in

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
chasing additional resources but keep in

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.040 
chasing additional resources but keep in
