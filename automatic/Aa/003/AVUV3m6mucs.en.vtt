warping I did

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.660 
warping I did
and<00:02:31.629> the<00:02:31.750> shading<00:02:32.110> I<00:02:32.200> did<00:02:32.379> and<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:33.310> reason<00:02:33.459> for

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
and the shading I did and the reason for

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.030 
and the shading I did and the reason for
that<00:02:33.849> is<00:02:34.299> the<00:02:34.569> warping<00:02:34.930> was<00:02:35.110> done<00:02:35.349> as<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.620> smart

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
that is the warping was done as a smart

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.360 
that is the warping was done as a smart
object<00:02:36.189> and<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:37.060> shading<00:02:37.540> was<00:02:37.689> done<00:02:37.900> as<00:02:38.140> a

object and the shading was done as a

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.979 
object and the shading was done as a
separate<00:02:39.370> layer<00:02:39.549> so<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:40.269> shading<00:02:40.689> wasn't

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
separate layer so the shading wasn't

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
change the coloring of the top just as

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.780 
change the coloring of the top just as
easily<00:03:10.659> I've<00:03:10.989> got<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.590> hue/saturation<00:03:11.950> layer

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
easily I've got a hue/saturation layer

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.819 
easily I've got a hue/saturation layer
in<00:03:13.239> here<00:03:13.269> you<00:03:13.900> can<00:03:14.049> see<00:03:14.200> I've<00:03:14.290> already<00:03:14.439> done<00:03:14.590> it

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
in here you can see I've already done it

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.369 
in here you can see I've already done it
once<00:03:15.040> my<00:03:15.459> original<00:03:15.970> top<00:03:16.180> was<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:16.659> mustard<00:03:17.169> color

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
once my original top was a mustard color

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.250 
once my original top was a mustard color
and<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:18.189> changed<00:03:18.609> it<00:03:18.760> out<00:03:18.879> to<00:03:19.060> red<00:03:19.269> but<00:03:19.900> now<00:03:20.049> that

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
and I changed it out to red but now that

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.020 
and I changed it out to red but now that
we're<00:03:20.379> using<00:03:20.530> this<00:03:20.889> fabric<00:03:21.189> I<00:03:21.579> think<00:03:21.879> a

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
we're using this fabric I think a

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.119 
we're using this fabric I think a
turquoise<00:03:22.480> might<00:03:22.840> be<00:03:23.019> more<00:03:23.230> in<00:03:23.349> order<00:03:23.560> so

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
turquoise might be more in order so

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.390 
turquoise might be more in order so
let's<00:03:24.280> double<00:03:24.459> click<00:03:24.639> on<00:03:24.970> hue/saturation<00:03:25.930> and

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
let's double click on hue/saturation and

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.250 
let's double click on hue/saturation and
play<00:03:27.400> with<00:03:27.579> the<00:03:27.700> saturation<00:03:28.419> slider<00:03:28.599> until<00:03:29.230> I

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
play with the saturation slider until I

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.240 
play with the saturation slider until I
get<00:03:29.560> into<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:30.700> turquoise<00:03:31.120> range<00:03:31.919> maybe<00:03:32.919> about

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
get into the turquoise range maybe about

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.849 
get into the turquoise range maybe about
there<00:03:33.609> to<00:03:34.540> make<00:03:34.720> it<00:03:34.750> just<00:03:34.930> a<00:03:35.260> little<00:03:35.319> less

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
there to make it just a little less

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.449 
there to make it just a little less
saturated<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:37.319> it's<00:03:38.319> that<00:03:38.739> easy

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
saturated and it's that easy

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.550 
saturated and it's that easy
to<00:03:39.760> change<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.329> colors<00:03:40.659> and<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:41.079> change<00:03:41.349> your

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
to change the colors and to change your

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.830
