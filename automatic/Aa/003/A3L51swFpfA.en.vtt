watch this is the white and gold version
I<00:00:12.750> don't<00:00:13.349> know<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.440> just<00:00:13.559> thought<00:00:13.830> it'd<00:00:13.980> be<00:00:14.009> a

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
I don't know I just thought it'd be a

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.129 
I don't know I just thought it'd be a
bit<00:00:14.370> cooler<00:00:14.580> than<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.000> all<00:00:15.269> black<00:00:15.599> version

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
bit cooler than the all black version

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.960 
bit cooler than the all black version
and<00:00:16.350> it'll<00:00:17.039> be<00:00:17.130> one<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.490> haven't<00:00:17.699> seen

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
and it'll be one that you haven't seen

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.700 
and it'll be one that you haven't seen
yet<00:00:18.000> because<00:00:18.840> they<00:00:18.960> didn't<00:00:19.230> give<00:00:19.350> away<00:00:19.529> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
yet because they didn't give away the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.200 
yet because they didn't give away the
white<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.789> white<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.050> gold<00:00:22.199> version<00:00:22.439> at

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
white and the white and gold version at

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.670 
white and the white and gold version at
Google<00:00:24.210> i/o<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.900> let's<00:00:25.050> go<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.320> open<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.619> up

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
Google i/o so let's go and open this up

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.859 
Google i/o so let's go and open this up
here<00:00:27.949> so<00:00:28.949> now<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.189> I've<00:00:29.279> broken<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.699> seal<00:00:29.910> on

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
here so now that I've broken the seal on

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.209 
here so now that I've broken the seal on
the<00:00:31.080> back<00:00:31.260> here<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.650> tells<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.070> it's

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
the back here it tells you that it's

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.270 
the back here it tells you that it's
ip67<00:00:33.059> water<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.719> dust-resistant<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.100> mean

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
ip67 water and dust-resistant so I mean

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.340 
ip67 water and dust-resistant so I mean
you<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.460> wash<00:00:35.670> your<00:00:35.850> hands<00:00:36.239> with<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.719> you

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
you can wash your hands with it you

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.780 
you can wash your hands with it you
could<00:00:37.469> probably<00:00:37.710> go<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> light<00:00:38.340> swim<00:00:38.610> with

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
could probably go for a light swim with

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.250 
could probably go for a light swim with
it's<00:00:39.000> not<00:00:39.270> going<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.450> hurt<00:00:39.570> I'm<00:00:39.809> pretty<00:00:40.079> sure

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
it's not going to hurt I'm pretty sure

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.729 
it's not going to hurt I'm pretty sure
ip67<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.550> something<00:00:41.940> like<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.469> thought<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.649> to

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
ip67 is something like I thought have to

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:44.869 
ip67 is something like I thought have to
check<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:43.950> it's<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.219> couple<00:00:44.399> meters<00:00:44.610> i'm

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
check but it's a couple meters i'm

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.520 
check but it's a couple meters i'm
pretty<00:00:45.059> sure<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.930> can<00:00:46.050> be<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.260> there<00:00:46.410> and

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
pretty sure that it can be in there and

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.160 
pretty sure that it can be in there and
it's<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.980> like<00:00:47.100> 30<00:00:47.340> minutes<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.170> it's

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
it's for up to like 30 minutes so it's

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.350 
it's for up to like 30 minutes so it's
got<00:00:49.320> an<00:00:49.440> always-on<00:00:49.890> screen<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.850> not<00:00:51.059> all<00:00:51.210> of

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
got an always-on screen but not all of

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.910 
got an always-on screen but not all of
the<00:00:51.480> screen<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.870> always<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.500> that's<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.739> bit

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
the screen is always on so that's a bit

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.090 
the screen is always on so that's a bit
it's<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> bit<00:00:53.850> misleading<00:00:54.590> annoying<00:00:55.590> accent

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
it's a bit misleading annoying accent

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.720 
it's a bit misleading annoying accent

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
million battery which is bigger than the

million battery which is bigger than the
gear<00:01:01.890> live<00:01:03.199> battery<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.589> hopefully<00:01:05.040> we'll<00:01:05.159> get

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
gear live battery so hopefully we'll get

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.310 
gear live battery so hopefully we'll get
a<00:01:05.309> little<00:01:05.549> bit<00:01:05.640> better<00:01:05.930> battery<00:01:06.930> life<00:01:06.960> out<00:01:07.290> of

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
a little bit better battery life out of

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.219 
a little bit better battery life out of
it<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:08.100> only<00:01:09.090> difference<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.780> gear<00:01:09.960> live

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
it the only difference is the gear live

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.510 
it the only difference is the gear live
actually<00:01:10.650> comes<00:01:10.830> with<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.979> heart<00:01:11.159> rate<00:01:11.310> sensor

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
actually comes with a heart rate sensor

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.090 
actually comes with a heart rate sensor
where<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.150> does<00:01:12.299> not<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:13.110> let's<00:01:14.010> go

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
where this one does not so let's go

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.190 
where this one does not so let's go
ahead<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.250> open<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.580> up<00:01:14.729> here<00:01:15.000> um<00:01:15.570> when<00:01:16.080> you

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
ahead and open it up here um when you

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.429 
ahead and open it up here um when you
open<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.680> get<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.040> box<00:01:17.820> here<00:01:18.439> like

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
open it up you get the box here like

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.170 
open it up you get the box here like
this<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.009> face<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.610> really<00:01:20.909> nice-looking

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180

the band feels extremely rubbery it

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.280 
the band feels extremely rubbery it
doesn't<00:01:36.060> feel<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.180> cheap<00:01:36.689> or<00:01:36.869> anything<00:01:37.140> but

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
rubbery feeling it's got this nice

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.940 
rubbery feeling it's got this nice
texture<00:01:42.810> on<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.020> back<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.500> right<00:01:43.770> there's

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
texture on the back of it right there's

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.310 
texture on the back of it right there's
where<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.520> see<00:01:44.670> where<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.880> charges<00:01:45.360> it

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
where you can see where it charges it

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.609 
where you can see where it charges it
doesn't<00:01:47.159> look<00:01:47.280> too<00:01:48.240> big<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:49.200> probably<00:01:49.380> about

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
doesn't look too big it's probably about

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.580 
doesn't look too big it's probably about
the<00:01:49.829> same<00:01:50.159> thickness<00:01:50.610> as<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.030> pebble<00:01:51.270> steel<00:01:51.689> so

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the same thickness as a pebble steel so
