00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
battlefield 4 una so give me the idea of

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.400 
battlefield 4 una so give me the idea of
doing<00:00:21.860> sort<00:00:22.099> of<00:00:22.160> a<00:00:22.279> little<00:00:22.990> little<00:00:23.990> miniseries

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
doing sort of a little little miniseries

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.859 
doing sort of a little little miniseries
going<00:00:25.039> through<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:26.090> different<00:00:26.390> classes<00:00:26.840> of

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
going through the different classes of

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.720 
going through the different classes of
weapons<00:00:27.230> and<00:00:27.380> which<00:00:27.500> I<00:00:27.619> preferred<00:00:28.009> in<00:00:28.550> each

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
weapons and which I preferred in each

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.249 
weapons and which I preferred in each
class<00:00:29.059> and<00:00:29.239> which<00:00:29.390> I<00:00:29.540> ultimately<00:00:30.020> thought

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
class and which I ultimately thought

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.030 
class and which I ultimately thought
we're<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:30.649> best

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
we're the best

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.920 
we're the best
now<00:00:31.579> what<00:00:32.090> you<00:00:32.149> need<00:00:32.239> to<00:00:32.360> appreciate<00:00:32.599> it

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
now what you need to appreciate it

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.310 
now what you need to appreciate it
obviously<00:00:33.200> best<00:00:33.800> is<00:00:34.070> largely<00:00:34.760> subjective

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
obviously best is largely subjective

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.350 
obviously best is largely subjective
depends<00:00:36.320> on<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:36.829> person<00:00:37.219> depends<00:00:37.879> how<00:00:38.180> that

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
depends on the person depends how that

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.880 
depends on the person depends how that
person<00:00:38.719> wants<00:00:39.260> to<00:00:39.290> play<00:00:40.300> so<00:00:41.499> some<00:00:42.499> people<00:00:42.620> may

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
person wants to play so some people may

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.910 
person wants to play so some people may
agree<00:00:43.089> many<00:00:44.089> people<00:00:44.390> probably<00:00:44.570> won't<00:00:45.019> they'll

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
agree many people probably won't they'll

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.259 
agree many people probably won't they'll
agree<00:00:46.100> probably<00:00:46.609> agree<00:00:46.789> with<00:00:46.820> one<00:00:47.059> of<00:00:47.179> them

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
agree probably agree with one of them

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:48.579 
agree probably agree with one of them
but<00:00:47.420> they<00:00:47.510> definitely<00:00:47.660> won't<00:00:48.140> agree<00:00:48.320> with<00:00:48.499> the

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
but they definitely won't agree with the

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:51.279 
but they definitely won't agree with the
other<00:00:48.800> because<00:00:49.480> I'm<00:00:50.480> kind<00:00:50.749> of<00:00:50.780> one<00:00:50.929> of<00:00:51.019> a<00:00:51.079> kind

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
other because I'm kind of one of a kind

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.560 
other because I'm kind of one of a kind
with<00:00:51.440> one<00:00:51.589> of<00:00:51.679> these<00:00:51.739> guns<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.309> first<00:00:52.850> goods<00:00:53.300> I

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
with one of these guns the first goods I

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.779 
with one of these guns the first goods I
want<00:00:53.929> to<00:00:53.989> cover<00:00:54.109> though<00:00:54.350> are<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:55.399> assault

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
want to cover though are the assault

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.040 
want to cover though are the assault
rifles<00:00:56.089> I<00:00:56.210> think<00:00:56.420> these<00:00:56.480> are<00:00:56.539> probably<00:00:56.749> the

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
rifles I think these are probably the

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.369 
rifles I think these are probably the
mainstay<00:00:57.499> of<00:00:58.690> battlefields<00:00:59.690> for<00:00:59.899> weaponry

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
mainstay of battlefields for weaponry

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.169 
mainstay of battlefields for weaponry
that<00:01:00.409> they<00:01:00.800> tend<00:01:01.010> to<00:01:01.069> be<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:01.309> class<00:01:01.489> with<00:01:01.729> the

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
that they tend to be the class with the

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.790 
that they tend to be the class with the
most<00:01:02.359> easy<00:01:03.079> to<00:01:03.469> use<00:01:04.190> in<00:01:05.089> my<00:01:05.269> opinion<00:01:05.560> and<00:01:06.560> the

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
most easy to use in my opinion and the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.010 
most easy to use in my opinion and the
first<00:01:07.070> one<00:01:07.520> I<00:01:07.760> pick<00:01:08.150> basically<00:01:08.600> two<00:01:08.780> for<00:01:08.960> each

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
first one I pick basically two for each

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.899 
first one I pick basically two for each
class<00:01:09.229> but<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:09.470> first<00:01:09.680> one<00:01:09.890> is<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.990> ace23<00:01:11.990> I

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
class but the first one is the ace23 I

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.130 
class but the first one is the ace23 I
don't<00:01:13.909> really<00:01:14.090> take<00:01:14.329> those<00:01:14.540> anybody<00:01:14.990> can

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
don't really take those anybody can

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.550 
don't really take those anybody can
argue<00:01:15.229> with<00:01:15.619> how<00:01:16.100> good<00:01:16.310> this<00:01:16.610> gun<00:01:16.850> is<00:01:17.000> now<00:01:17.780> what

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
argue with how good this gun is now what

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.980 
argue with how good this gun is now what
makes<00:01:18.740> it<00:01:18.860> interesting<00:01:18.920> is<00:01:19.630> this<00:01:20.630> weapons

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
makes it interesting is this weapons

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.260 
makes it interesting is this weapons
actually<00:01:21.320> not<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.710> best<00:01:21.740> at<00:01:22.189> anything<00:01:22.340> but

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
actually not the best at anything but

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.500 
actually not the best at anything but
it's<00:01:23.420> good

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
it's good

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
it's good
ever<00:01:25.820> close<00:01:26.820> range<00:01:27.210> mid<00:01:27.450> range<00:01:27.480> long<00:01:28.080> range

not a problem you got this gone you can

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.010 
not a problem you got this gone you can
fight<00:01:31.170> anybody<00:01:31.710> anywhere<00:01:32.640> without<00:01:33.600> too<00:01:33.900> much

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
fight anybody anywhere without too much

trouble<00:01:34.230> and<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:35.430> lot<00:01:35.760> of<00:01:35.790> people<00:01:36.030> call<00:01:36.120> it<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
trouble and a lot of people call it a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.060 
trouble and a lot of people call it a
new<00:01:36.390> gun<00:01:36.630> because<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.200> relatively<00:01:37.590> easy<00:01:37.860> to

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
new gun because it's relatively easy to

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.730 
new gun because it's relatively easy to
use<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.760> to<00:01:39.660> those<00:01:39.810> people<00:01:40.050> who<00:01:40.290> refer<00:01:40.620> to

guns as new guns why would you choose a

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.110 
guns as new guns why would you choose a
gun<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.650> gives<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.010> disadvantage<00:01:44.820> as

opposed to a gun that gives you an
advantage<00:01:47.810> I've<00:01:48.810> used<00:01:49.170> all<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.440> guns<00:01:49.620> in<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
advantage I've used all the guns in the

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.800 
advantage I've used all the guns in the
game<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.670> tend<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.910> gravitate<00:01:51.120> back<00:01:51.360> to

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
game but I tend to gravitate back to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.310 
game but I tend to gravitate back to
this<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.820> most<00:01:53.820> games<00:01:54.210> obviously<00:01:54.630> real

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
this one for most games obviously real

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.510 
this one for most games obviously real
close<00:01:55.620> range

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
close range

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.220 
close range
closer<00:01:57.150> interactions<00:01:57.600> are<00:01:57.660> cool<00:01:57.810> with

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
closer interactions are cool with

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.230 
closer interactions are cool with
different<00:01:59.070> one<00:01:59.190> but<00:01:59.430> you'll<00:01:59.640> there<00:01:59.880> you'll

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
different one but you'll there you'll

see<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.480> later<00:02:00.950> my<00:02:01.950> attachments<00:02:02.460> on<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.670> gun

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
see that later my attachments on the gun

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.540 
see that later my attachments on the gun
I<00:02:03.030> tend<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.390> run<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.690> with<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.430> angled<00:02:05.430> grip

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
I tend to run it with the angled grip

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
opinion but I tend to naturally

aim-down-sights<00:03:23.330> pretty<00:03:23.660> much<00:03:23.840> all<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:24.349> time

hipfire I can normally turn ABS and kill
with<00:03:30.319> them<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:31.000> so<00:03:32.000> that's<00:03:32.959> that's<00:03:33.290> pretty

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
with them and so that's that's pretty

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.320 
with them and so that's that's pretty
much<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.800> for<00:03:33.890> my<00:03:34.010> assault<00:03:34.250> rifles<00:03:34.610> and<00:03:34.760> but

burst of both bullets but in exactly the
same<00:04:12.260> place<00:04:12.560> so<00:04:13.010> if<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:13.400> are<00:04:13.579> accurate<00:04:14.120> and

it<00:04:28.490> was<00:04:28.940> a<00:04:28.970> great<00:04:29.210> weapon<00:04:29.360> in<00:04:29.570> battlefield<00:04:29.870> 3

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
it was a great weapon in battlefield 3

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.219 
it was a great weapon in battlefield 3
but<00:04:30.650> it'll<00:04:30.830> be<00:04:31.180> really<00:04:32.180> really<00:04:32.450> interested<00:04:32.990> so

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
but it'll be really really interested so

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.580 
but it'll be really really interested so
it<00:04:33.410> translates<00:04:33.860> into<00:04:34.100> battlefield<00:04:34.850> 4<00:04:35.240> but<00:04:35.450> I'm

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
it translates into battlefield 4 but I'm

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.080 
it translates into battlefield 4 but I'm
I'm<00:04:36.590> really<00:04:36.740> excited<00:04:37.070> about<00:04:37.220> it<00:04:37.430> but<00:04:37.940> the

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
I'm really excited about it but the

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.310 
I'm really excited about it but the
other<00:04:38.210> weapon<00:04:38.539> I'm<00:04:38.720> excited<00:04:39.139> about<00:04:39.169> that

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
other weapon I'm excited about that

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.710 
other weapon I'm excited about that
they're<00:04:39.590> testing<00:04:39.889> on<00:04:39.979> to<00:04:40.070> see<00:04:40.220> CT<00:04:40.880> is<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.060> the

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
they're testing on to see CT is the the

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.200 
they're testing on to see CT is the the
mayor's<00:04:41.930> leg<00:04:42.200> if<00:04:42.470> you've<00:04:42.620> not<00:04:42.800> seen<00:04:42.860> it<00:04:43.070> it's<00:04:43.940> a

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
mayor's leg if you've not seen it it's a

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.050 
mayor's leg if you've not seen it it's a
it's<00:04:44.240> basically<00:04:44.750> a<00:04:45.080> sidearm<00:04:45.880> it's<00:04:46.880> like<00:04:47.030> a

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
it's basically a sidearm it's like a

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.900 
it's basically a sidearm it's like a
pistol<00:04:47.450> but<00:04:48.410> it's<00:04:48.560> basically<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.610> sawn-off

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
pistol but it's basically a sawn-off

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.420 
pistol but it's basically a sawn-off
sniper<00:04:50.479> rifle<00:04:50.930> if<00:04:51.560> that<00:04:51.770> makes<00:04:51.950> sense<00:04:52.070> it's

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
sniper rifle if that makes sense it's

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.969 
sniper rifle if that makes sense it's
got<00:04:52.550> a<00:04:52.580> sort<00:04:53.270> of<00:04:53.330> a<00:04:53.419> scope<00:04:53.720> on<00:04:53.870> it<00:04:54.020> by<00:04:54.650> default

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
got a sort of a scope on it by default

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.610 
got a sort of a scope on it by default
so<00:04:55.220> you<00:04:55.310> can<00:04:55.490> quit<00:04:56.240> long<00:04:56.810> range<00:04:57.020> scope<00:04:57.289> to<00:04:57.500> it

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
so you can quit long range scope to it

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.650 
so you can quit long range scope to it
and<00:04:57.979> it<00:04:58.190> works<00:04:58.669> kind<00:04:58.970> of<00:04:59.030> like<00:04:59.090> a<00:04:59.240> bolt-action

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
and it works kind of like a bolt-action

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.510 
and it works kind of like a bolt-action
but<00:05:00.139> instead<00:05:00.349> of<00:05:00.410> it<00:05:00.530> being<00:05:00.590> a<00:05:00.979> bolt-action

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
but instead of it being a bolt-action

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.520 
but instead of it being a bolt-action
it's<00:05:01.820> got<00:05:01.940> a<00:05:01.970> lever<00:05:02.270> action<00:05:02.389> to<00:05:02.690> it<00:05:02.810> if<00:05:03.169> you're

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
it's got a lever action to it if you're

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.320 
it's got a lever action to it if you're
interested<00:05:03.919> looking<00:05:04.160> at<00:05:04.250> it<00:05:04.340> just<00:05:04.520> stim<00:05:04.789> just

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
interested looking at it just stim just

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.490 
interested looking at it just stim just
go<00:05:05.419> look<00:05:05.570> at<00:05:05.690> some<00:05:05.810> of<00:05:05.900> the<00:05:05.960> main<00:05:06.110> youtube
