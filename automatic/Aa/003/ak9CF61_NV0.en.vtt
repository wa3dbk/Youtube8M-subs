00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.990
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.059
 my name is franziska lukas today 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.820
 something for a short time 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.009
 solution-oriented view because of me 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.660
 a malheur over a week ago 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.990
 it happened or 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.539
 out of a carelessness I have 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.090
 me in the darkness my little toe 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.550
 triggered so hard that one 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.140
 was really bad and I knew I was 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.330
 he is not broken broken he was 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.400
 definitely blue and it came already 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.350
 Such thoughts are great 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.520
 to the clients says they should 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.890
 be mindful 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.260
 you should watch them in here 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.899
 and be now and you run like that 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.890
 violently against the bed that the blue c 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.410
 hate the embossed or broken super 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.500
 a moment he came this thought 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.230
 and I grabbed him right away 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.379
 said okay there you are but that is one 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.120
 old programming an old pattern and 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.580
 I do not have to dwell on it 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.560
 I could have pulled myself down 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.590
 could have said at every pain 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.210
 you were right you were inattentive 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.840
 and so on 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.600
 give your attention to what 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.850
 positive towards solution orientation 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.670
 which means what I did in that 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.420
 case okay i have the pain is so 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.430
 how it is 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.320
 i hope the best i will be 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.140
 spare themselves cool 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.619
 I can do this here and now 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.570
 comes away from problem-oriented thinking 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.869
 towards solution-oriented thinking 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.090
 This pain reminds me now 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.990
 to be aware of here and now 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.500
 to be aware of breathing consciously 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.630
 consciously consciously listening to the ground below 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.979
 Feel the feet as well as practical 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.390
 taken the pain 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:00.030
 I turned it over and used it for 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.299
 a solution-oriented view and way 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.280
 do it the same way if it somehow 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.860
 it is possible to catch with smaller ones 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.579
 things with things that maybe 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.590
 not as painful as my toe and 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:16.080
 look what can I do with it 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.380
 is already the way it is I have 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.780
 still hurt 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.200
 what do I do with it is a signal 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.420
 my body and I thought up 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.420
 my body reminds me of it 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.580
 I need more breaks again 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.750
 more to the nature walk more on themselves 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.570
 Be aware of being aware of the breath 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.210
 my thoughts are watching me 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.740
 do not let them in there say and 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.210
 that still has to be done and that 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.250
 still needs to be done and the 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.080
 short description and there is still an e 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.590
 send mail and the bill still has to 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.160
 away and before the holiday you have to and 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:57.370
 What's more important is your health 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.980
 or what your thoughts tell them 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.020
 try to find your middle between 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.660
 what your thoughts say 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.140
 in virtually listening to the requirements 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.790
 your life and your health 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.350
 what you really are these examples 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.760
 they should make the number clear 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.380
 do not have to be perfect 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.730
 Do not let yourself be distracted by your thoughts 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.740
 control and take on adversity 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.170
 situation in their lives that is not so 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.140
 great running as with my c spin 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.790
 sedation for you use the for 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.370
 a solution orientation for one 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.380
 solution-oriented view me 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.540
 wish you the courage and the 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.350
 stay tuned to the persistence 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.350
 next time bye
