00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
I get a little bit more than intended

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.290

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
power of this liquefier and kind of get

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.070 
power of this liquefier and kind of get
an<00:03:59.580> idea<00:03:59.670> of<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.180> amount<00:04:00.450> of<00:04:00.570> zombies<00:04:00.960> this

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
an idea of the amount of zombies this

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.200
