00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 Hello, how are you? I am Rodrigo and in this 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.830
 episode let's talk about the speed 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.460
 shutter 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.460
 two 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.379
 the speed duration as we see in the 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.879
 previous video is the time that the 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.230
 camera leaves exposed sensor for 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.180
 capture them when taking a 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.060
 photography giving us total control over 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.830
 how to capture the movement as barely 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.539
 we are learning we will still use the mode 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.309
 manual but we will use the mode of 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.470
 shutter priority these modes in 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:30.079
 automatic that some cameras have in 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.149
 canons tve and with is the s mode in the 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.290
 which we select the time 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.329
 that the camera will last taking the 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.920
 photography and the camera automatically 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.500
 calculate all other parameters 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.940
 to achieve a correct exposure the 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.470
 Exposure time is measured in seconds 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.240
 in case of exposure time 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.130
 less than one second is measured in 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.170
 fractions of a second this is pretty 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.460
 practical and simple at the time of being 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.280
 doing the calculations to adjust the 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.540
 light had understood this we will see some 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.640
 effects that are achieved with different 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.560
 Freeze exposure times 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.090
 movement when we use a speed 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.190
 fast shutter the action will 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.600
 freezes simple if the action that 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.860
 we want to take is very very fast 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.750
 then we continue testing with 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.060
 faster speeds still makes 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.619
 let's get our photo the speed more 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.750
 fast that a SLR camera varies 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.750
 between 1 over 4000 and 1 over 8000 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.490
 the sweeps consist of using a 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.220
 average speed between 1 between 61 between 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.180
 an eighth and follow the subject the objective 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.490
 is to show the subject in movement 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.880
 sharp and the background blurred reflecting the 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.880
 speed 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.390
 long exposure when we use a 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.219
 slow shutter speed the 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.109
 movement is captured in the photo and it 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.670
 creates a motion blur which can be 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:39.890
 translate as a blur by 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.569
 movement the slowest speed that 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.140
 they handle the cameras is usually 30 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.790
 seconds 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.680
 you have to keep in mind that the more 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.020
 slow to speed our photo runs 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.630
 more risk of leaving moved so if 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.040
 we want to use very slow speeds 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.450
 we will need a tripod or leave it 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.520
 resting somewhere so that the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.080
 camera does not move an old tip to 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.160
 when we do not have a tripod is to use a 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.160
 rice bag as a base 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.430
 la and pain when making an exhibition 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.610
 long we can paint the light with some 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.610
 lamp 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.379
 when the girl 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.520
 have 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.700
 ok when you're starting to tell 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.700
 to draw 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.350
 starts 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.590
 up photography glasses with a lot 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.239
 opening and long exposures can 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.239
 capture excellent night photos 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.690
 now that we have as the time of 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.610
 exhibition modifies the way in which 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.110
 we take pictures we can play with the 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.460
 lens opening to achieve even more 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.580
 effects but the next system 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.590
 video thank you very much 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.200
 SLR cameras by definition are 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.580
 the cameras quite enough 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.580
 small which makes
