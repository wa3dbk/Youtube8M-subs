that's<00:02:56.650> amazed<00:02:57.040> me<00:02:57.220> here<00:02:57.430> is<00:02:57.520> just<00:02:57.700> how

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
that's amazed me here is just how

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.880 
that's amazed me here is just how
uniform<00:02:58.510> these<00:02:58.690> are<00:02:58.870> why<00:02:59.260> is<00:02:59.320> that<00:02:59.470> that's

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
uniform these are why is that that's

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.250 
uniform these are why is that that's
because<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.760> European<00:03:01.330> design<00:03:01.660> coupled<00:03:02.050> with

because the European design coupled with

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.140 
because the European design coupled with
German<00:03:02.739> engineering<00:03:03.250> has<00:03:03.400> produced<00:03:03.820> blades

German engineering has produced blades

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.600 
German engineering has produced blades
that<00:03:04.630> will<00:03:04.810> never<00:03:05.170> dull<00:03:05.830> not<00:03:06.220> only<00:03:06.430> that

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
that will never dull not only that

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.449 
that will never dull not only that
there's<00:03:07.030> no<00:03:07.180> need<00:03:07.360> for<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.570> cutting<00:03:07.900> board<00:03:08.020> and

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
there's no need for a cutting board and
