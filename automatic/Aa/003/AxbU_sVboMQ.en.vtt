00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
very first take you'll end up with a

very first take you'll end up with a
beer<00:00:54.570> bottle<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:55.140> actually<00:00:55.469> pulls<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
whole cap off and some of the glass too

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.290 
whole cap off and some of the glass too
you<00:00:58.379> can<00:00:58.500> see<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.070> that's<00:00:59.760> obviously<00:00:59.910> not

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
you can see that so that's obviously not

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.510 
you can see that so that's obviously not
good<00:01:00.449> there<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.649> was<00:01:01.739> at<00:01:01.890> work<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.250> would<00:01:02.430> have

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
good there if I was at work I would have

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.390 
good there if I was at work I would have
just<00:01:02.670> wasted<00:01:02.850> one<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.390> my<00:01:03.480> owners<00:01:03.750> beers<00:01:04.400> so

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
that's never acceptable practice it

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.530 
that's never acceptable practice it
enough<00:01:08.010> at<00:01:08.220> home<00:01:08.490> get<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> case<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.030> beer<00:01:09.180> and

do<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.610> right<00:01:12.390> at<00:01:12.659> least<00:01:12.869> 90%<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.650> time<00:01:13.830> if

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
do it right at least 90% of the time if

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.859 
do it right at least 90% of the time if
not<00:01:14.520> more<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:14.820> since<00:01:15.180> when<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.450> screw<00:01:15.840> up

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
not more so since when you screw up

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.660 
not more so since when you screw up
you'll<00:01:16.320> end<00:01:16.439> up<00:01:16.530> wasting<00:01:16.740> some<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
you'll end up wasting some of the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.210 
you'll end up wasting some of the
product<00:01:18.259> really<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.439> way<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.560> move<00:01:19.710> works<00:01:19.979> is

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
product really the way to move works is

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.780 
product really the way to move works is
taking<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.750> bottle<00:01:21.990> like<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:22.950> some

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
taking the the bottle like so some

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.249 
taking the the bottle like so some
people<00:01:23.880> come<00:01:24.119> from<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> inside<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:25.080> this

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
people come from the inside like this

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.950 
people come from the inside like this

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
pulling up I'm pulling straight up don't

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.550 
pulling up I'm pulling straight up don't
worry<00:01:45.329> about<00:01:45.390> trying<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.780> come<00:01:45.930> over<00:01:46.140> at<00:01:46.439> it

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
worry about trying to come over at it

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.350 
worry about trying to come over at it
and<00:01:46.770> trying<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.189> actually<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:47.610> lift<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.149> top

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
and trying to actually like lift the top

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.120 
and trying to actually like lift the top
off<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.899> it's<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:49.799> more<00:01:50.070> about

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
off like this it's really more about

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.179 
off like this it's really more about
pulling<00:01:50.909> straight<00:01:51.320> straight<00:01:52.320> at<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.649> it's

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
pulling straight straight at you it's

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.950 
pulling straight straight at you it's
just<00:01:53.399> pulling<00:01:53.549> straight<00:01:54.030> up<00:01:54.090> towards<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.689> and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
just pulling straight up towards you and

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.069 
just pulling straight up towards you and
what<00:01:55.409> it'll<00:01:55.560> do<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:56.390> this<00:01:57.390> will<00:01:57.719> catch

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
what it'll do is this this will catch

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.679 
what it'll do is this this will catch
right<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.890> lid<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.250> pop<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.299> top<00:02:00.450> right

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
right on the lid and pop the top right

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.440 
right on the lid and pop the top right
off<00:02:00.829> so<00:02:01.829> practice<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.460> one<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.969> careful<00:02:03.329> if

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
off so practice that one be careful if

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.300 
off so practice that one be careful if
the<00:02:03.540> bottle<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> little<00:02:04.200> shaken<00:02:04.469> up<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.770> lot

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
the bottle is a little shaken up a lot

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.219 
the bottle is a little shaken up a lot
of<00:02:05.399> people<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:06.390> will<00:02:06.450> foam<00:02:06.630> over<00:02:06.869> give<00:02:07.110> them<00:02:07.200> a

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
of people it will foam over give them a

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.139 
of people it will foam over give them a
little<00:02:07.409> bit<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.560> more<00:02:07.680> head<00:02:07.829> than<00:02:07.860> you'd<00:02:08.099> like

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
little bit of more head than you'd like

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.040 
little bit of more head than you'd like
sometimes<00:02:09.149> if<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.300> hit<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.539> wrong<00:02:09.840> it'll

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
sometimes if you hit it just wrong it'll

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.020 
sometimes if you hit it just wrong it'll
actually<00:02:10.170> foam<00:02:10.470> out<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.649> lot<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.910> can

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
actually foam out a lot so you can

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.550 
actually foam out a lot so you can
either<00:02:12.209> put<00:02:12.660> your<00:02:12.780> speed<00:02:12.959> open<00:02:13.170> over<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.410> top

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
either put your speed open over the top

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.730 
either put your speed open over the top
of

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
of

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.740 
of
it<00:02:13.800> usually<00:02:14.100> stops<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.730> or<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:14.970> guess<00:02:15.600> that

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
it usually stops it or I guess that

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.060 
it usually stops it or I guess that
practice<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.260> practice<00:02:16.470> until<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.010> can

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
practice and practice until you can

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.670 
practice and practice until you can
avoid<00:02:17.460> having<00:02:17.790> those<00:02:18.240> problems<00:02:18.690> but<00:02:19.440> again

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
avoid having those problems but again

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.320 
avoid having those problems but again
the<00:02:19.830> way<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:19.950> works<00:02:20.220> is<00:02:20.460> let's<00:02:20.700> grab<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.120> with<00:02:21.300> a

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
the way it works is let's grab it with a

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.320 
the way it works is let's grab it with a
bottle<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.840> has<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.380> cap<00:02:22.860> on<00:02:23.070> here<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:24.060> pull

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
bottle that has a cap on here is I pull

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.220 
bottle that has a cap on here is I pull
up<00:02:24.740> from<00:02:25.740> here<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.220> just<00:02:26.250> lift<00:02:26.940> straight

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
up from here and just lift straight

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.000 
up from here and just lift straight
straight<00:02:28.230> up<00:02:28.380> like<00:02:28.590> that

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
straight up like that

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.100 
straight up like that
practice<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:30.390> may<00:02:30.480> seem<00:02:30.690> difficult<00:02:30.720> at

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
practice it it may seem difficult at

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.150 
practice it it may seem difficult at
first<00:02:31.140> like<00:02:31.500> you're<00:02:31.620> doing<00:02:31.800> something<00:02:31.980> wrong

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
first like you're doing something wrong

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.140 
first like you're doing something wrong
like<00:02:32.340> you're<00:02:32.460> not<00:02:32.580> going<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.790> get<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.000> right

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
like you're not going to get it right

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.750 
like you're not going to get it right
really<00:02:34.080> just<00:02:34.110> comes<00:02:34.470> down<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.670> practicing<00:02:35.670> it

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
really just comes down to practicing it

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.270 
really just comes down to practicing it
and<00:02:36.120> like<00:02:36.240> I<00:02:36.270> said<00:02:36.390> try<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.290> inside<00:02:37.680> and

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
and like I said try to the inside and

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.490 
and like I said try to the inside and
pull<00:02:38.610> up<00:02:38.790> like<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:39.960> going<00:02:40.140> here<00:02:40.320> and

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
pull up like that so it's going here and

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.890 
pull up like that so it's going here and
pull<00:02:40.710> up<00:02:40.860> or<00:02:41.340> try<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.090> upside<00:02:42.420> see<00:02:42.630> which<00:02:42.750> one

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
pull up or try the upside see which one

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.870 
pull up or try the upside see which one
works<00:02:42.990> better<00:02:43.200> for<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.560> two<00:02:44.340> other<00:02:44.520> things<00:02:44.700> to

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
works better for you two other things to

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.450 
works better for you two other things to
note<00:02:45.030> one<00:02:45.890> make<00:02:46.890> sure<00:02:47.010> you're<00:02:47.130> not<00:02:47.190> pointing

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
note one make sure you're not pointing

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.830 
note one make sure you're not pointing
this<00:02:47.520> in<00:02:47.670> anybody<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.240> seems<00:02:48.510> like<00:02:48.660> common

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
this in anybody it seems like common

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.780 
this in anybody it seems like common
sense<00:02:48.990> but<00:02:49.320> when<00:02:49.530> you're<00:02:49.650> at<00:02:49.770> work<00:02:49.950> if<00:02:50.670> it's

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
sense but when you're at work if it's

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.730 
sense but when you're at work if it's
