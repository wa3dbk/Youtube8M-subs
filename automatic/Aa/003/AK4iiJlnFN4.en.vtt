 cars including the mazda rx-7 th 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:27.049
 speed or the 1500 later everything should be 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:32.250
 wrong I do not fight with cars 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:36.079
 but four new cars and costs 5 euros 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.110
 So what is beautiful for fans 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.579
 we start to start that's one 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.270
 big topic too for me i am very 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.000
 in a hurry 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.450
 that was very much on kickstarter 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.220
 supported with ten million dollars 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.140
 and there was now known how 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.720
 Expensive is actually for the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.380
 Develop a ship and 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.560
 Although that is so wrong in such ships 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.560
 the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.479
 so many polygons are developed 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.489
 get so much details that a ship 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.690
 to make a small ship only one 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:15.580
 small little fighter costs about 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.400
 35,000 US dollars as a small model 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.530
 because he has so much detail 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.180
 There are many moving parts in it 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.040
 and so on and the bigger ships like that 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.350
 battleship or so it is there 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.380
 even cost up to 150,000 us dollars 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.190
 that's gross you can do it that way 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.709
 imagine such a normal character 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.480
 game character model of any 08 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.030
 50 game call of duty what he is 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.370
 consists of about 10,000 polishes 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.160
 and a vehicle model from about 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.450
 30,000 polygons here is a small one 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.630
 hunter installation is approximately out 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.860
 300,000 polygons that's gross that 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.110
 I just wanted to bring purely as news 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.030
 because that's me very much 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.769
 I find it very blatantly simple and 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.360
 think that's great too because it's us 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.239
 the in is interested in the game that 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.880
 me personally super so that 's me 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.630
 I'm so keen that it does not exist 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.970
 and I already have a few videos 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.140
 to see and you can see in the 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.019
 Models what a job 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.760
 I 'm glad and there I am 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.760
 very much at stake and that is 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.859
 now always such a fact of me right 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.840
 umhaut and well could my comment 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:29.859
 Write constanze whose hero or 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.420
 Holds will now be interested and to 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.940
 finalize a short message about 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.739
 days at, and that is where it was 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.600
 release of the release period again 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.660
 was more limited and indeed was 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.709
 first said no later than mid-august 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.260
 will build what so the alpha and 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.489
 now it's even a bit earlier 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.590
 Internally white apparently rocks already 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.100
 modest about the release date white halt 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.370
 not announce yet and the skirts great 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.290
 just said at the press conference 2013 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.079
 that the release at about 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.549
 So one week was limited to 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.459
 a certain week which week that 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.140
 is 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.319
 but probably apparently 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.180
 before august or before mid august 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.670
 So maybe even the end of 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.109
 months or who knows 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.510
 they are very mysterious, I think 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.579
 and I think slowly we are 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.590
 bit guilty that they are us 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.320
 at least a rough one as if he were good 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.760
 it's rough but a little one already 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.650
 At least we can do this week 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.419
 say 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.610
 but well they want that then seems 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.470
 not yet and I'm just curious 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.169
 I hope it comes at the end of this month 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.360
 out the first were already for 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.949
 announced at the end of 2012 that's also true 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.080
 very funny that is now seven months 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.560
 but still took what you should 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.190
 do 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.460
 I hope the game will be over in the end and 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.139
 you are welcome to comment on days at 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.030
 the standalone and all the 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.660
 Schnickschnack like in the comments 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.190
 Post 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.300
 I would be happy and of course 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.490
 I would also be thumbs up 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.830
 happy and otherwise I would say yes 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.280
 just fold it in and by then 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.280
 Zschau
