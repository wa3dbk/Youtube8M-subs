things and he had the hard reset the
system<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.980> then<00:00:41.610> once<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.210> loaded<00:00:42.840> up<00:00:42.960> at

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
system and then once it loaded up at

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.110 
system and then once it loaded up at
first<00:00:43.440> went<00:00:43.710> into<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> safe<00:00:44.190> mode<00:00:44.460> but<00:00:44.789> one

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
first went into a safe mode but one

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.069 
first went into a safe mode but one
thing<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.300> was<00:00:45.480> kind<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.870> little

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
thing that was kind of a little

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.410 
thing that was kind of a little
disconcerting<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.829> after<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.730> went<00:00:48.030> past<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
disconcerting is after it went past the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.600 
disconcerting is after it went past the
safe<00:00:48.629> mode<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.140> actually<00:00:49.800> then<00:00:49.950> rebooted<00:00:50.520> and

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
safe mode and actually then rebooted and

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.479 
safe mode and actually then rebooted and
loaded<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.360> took<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.870> long<00:00:52.140> time<00:00:52.500> um<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:53.100> can't

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
loaded it took a long time um I can't

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.479 
loaded it took a long time um I can't
wait<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.789> get<00:00:53.910> back<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.920> actually<00:00:55.920> time<00:00:56.190> how

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
wait to get back to actually time how

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.240 
wait to get back to actually time how
long<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.899> took<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.289> mean<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> was<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:59.219> a

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
long it took but I mean it was it's a

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.189 
long it took but I mean it was it's a
lot<00:00:59.430> longer<00:00:59.579> than<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.940> was<00:01:00.030> expecting<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.780> then

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
lot longer than I was expecting and then

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.470 
lot longer than I was expecting and then
on<00:01:01.410> top<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.920> once<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.820> actually<00:01:02.850> boots<00:01:03.270> up

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
on top of that once it actually boots up

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.539 
on top of that once it actually boots up
it<00:01:03.660> even<00:01:03.930> took<00:01:04.140> even<00:01:04.589> longer<00:01:04.619> for<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.220> system

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
it even took even longer for the system

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.969 
it even took even longer for the system
to<00:01:05.700> recognize<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.330> DualShock<00:01:06.659> 4<00:01:06.900> controller

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
to recognize the DualShock 4 controller

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.140 
to recognize the DualShock 4 controller
so<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.729> little<00:01:09.119> little<00:01:09.510> minor<00:01:10.250> annoyances<00:01:11.250> I

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
so just little little minor annoyances I

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.210 
so just little little minor annoyances I
know<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.930> DualShock<00:01:13.320> 4<00:01:13.590> controller<00:01:13.619> is

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
know on the DualShock 4 controller is

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.270 
know on the DualShock 4 controller is
hands<00:01:14.670> down<00:01:14.820> loving<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.900> feels<00:01:16.200> great<00:01:16.530> it's

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
hands down loving it it feels great it's

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.420 
hands down loving it it feels great it's
it's<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.210> huge<00:01:18.540> improvement<00:01:19.100> but<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> little

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
it's a huge improvement but the little

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.550 
it's a huge improvement but the little
touch<00:01:20.610> pad<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.810> were<00:01:21.900> using<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.320> swipe

touch pad that we were using the swipe
left<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.009> right<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.670> just<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.150> wasn't<00:01:24.390> as

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
left and right it just it wasn't as

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.140 
left and right it just it wasn't as
precise<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.439> reminds<00:01:25.920> me<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.340> Xbox<00:01:26.610> 360

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150
