00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.869
 I will say this clearly not only this 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.150
 is the worst and of the game since I've 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.550
 played and not only is the worst game based 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.710
 in a green box franchise this 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.840
 colossal diarrheal shit is one of the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.150
 worst games I've ever played in my 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.400
 putrid existence and one of the worst 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.710
 fighting games never created by no 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.660
 say that it is the worst of this type and that 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.629
 makes shaq fu look like a fucking work 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.699
 master of universal worship let's finish this 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.430
 the sooner I want to start what 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:54.210
 inevitable 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:56.550
 we started the game with surprises the pp 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.649
 the colossal piece of Shrek shit is one 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.989
 card speedway game that we analyze 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.690
 previously giving me called thorn 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.840
 now let's be wait a moment 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.640
 because there is an English language and a language 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.560
 American yes I know that the language of 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.990
 shakespeare has some differences in 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.149
 words but fuck was not necessary 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.920
 apart from that I have not seen a single 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.540
 significant difference in both 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.860
 languages and for the record that I have 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.860
 checked here the test 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.890
 for that they would have put another language and 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.160
 had not copypaste has given another 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.410
 because if we finally start this thing 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.570
 selecting the character of shrek and 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.110
 we started criticizing the gameplay of 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.840
 this game I will say it clearly the 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.610
 gameplay is terrible it's about a 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.190
 one-on-one battle of a round in 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.770
 different scenarios sounds good not so 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.690
 it's not like that your character just has 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.690
 four attacks two normal and two 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.760
 specials in quotes this I say 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.710
 since almost all the fucking characters 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.869
 they have a special attack using their 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.300
 body and another throwing a projectile that 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.310
 by the way they are difficult to control anymore 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.440
 that aside the control is something hard 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.330
 those attacks are slow to take over 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.910
 that you will be easily attacked by the 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.100
 enemy I do not recommend using the attack 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.200
 weak normal that each character has already 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.240
 that almost does not hurt so use the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.270
 normal strong attack as much as possible 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.490
 can you apart from that there is like a 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.680
 kind of quotes between bonus 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.959
 specials that allow you to have the 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.090
 abilities to be invincible to run more 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.930
 fast or be stronger for a period 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.909
 of time 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.250
 and I say it's in quotes because it's 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.019
 almost impossible to activate it whenever 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.269
 I activated has been random and not 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.670
 I find guides on the internet to activate 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.950
 those things and the worst thing is that the cp uses 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.010
 almost always this shit automatically 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.959
 the very cheating son of a bitch a thing of 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.549
 that I have to complain is that the game 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.159
 it's too easy to pass and 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.230
 you can perfectly pass it to 100% 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.650
 in less than 20 minutes including 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.049
 characters blocked and I mean it 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.909
 this is due to the following factors 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.950
 in case you lose a battle in 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.049
 instead of a screen to continue with 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.939
 credits or something like that the video game you 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.560
 rebuilds the battle and so 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:18.919
 successively until the end of the 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.079
 times the artificial intelligence is 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:23.060
 made a shit because if you get away from the 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.370
 enemy this one will abuse his attack of 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.079
 projectile that is easy to dodge with 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.239
 what you can jump to dodge 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.709
 make your special projectile attack 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.230
 so that it gives to the enemy and thus 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.239
 successively until winning separately the 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.340
 final intelligence of the final boss is 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.319
 disgustingly ridiculous he spends his time 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.510
 protecting yourself from your attacks but it's 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.680
 useless since if you spawn the button 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.629
 strong normal attack 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.450
 the same will hurt you and almost never 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:49.579
 defend also I must emphasize that the 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.620
 fight has no time limit you can 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.540
 be like more than 10 minutes and the game 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.670
 will not stop the battle until there is a 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.620
 winner something that I should complain about 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.659
 it's also that there are times when you 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.670
 they have taken away all of life and still you or 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.560
 the enemy keep battling as if 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.420
 nothing and you only have one more blow and 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.400
 you die when in most 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.370
 combats when life is at zero and 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.530
 You have won or lost after spending 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.510
 this colossal piece of shit just 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.759
 you have left the training mode 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.430
 which is very boring because your adversary 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:21.320
 it does absolutely nothing or options 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.050
 to practice the strategies of the 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.509
 adversaries or anything and the worst of all 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.030
 this is that this game does not have a mode 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.949
 multiplayer who is the one who thought that 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.139
 not have multiplayer in a game of 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.210
 fights is a good idea should 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.199
 give the prize to the biggest asshole of the 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.180
 century 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.910
 perhaps they did not know of the existence of 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.099
 link cable and the worst thing is that this game 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.660
 is with shit passwords are 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.520
 long and they are only because the 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.289
 developers of this cancer do not 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.790
 they deigned to put something to save the 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.460
 departure 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.710
 automatically for a short game that 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.530
 you can pass it very easily to me 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.080
 It does a shit over the most part 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.050
 shit of the game now let's go to the 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.520
 graphics and sound graphics of this 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.590
 game are well mediocre 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.630
 the design of the menu makes me passable 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.280
 but the designs of the scenarios and of 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.650
 the spirits are very bad 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.170
 even the animation of the characters 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.390
 is terrible and that this game was launched 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.670
 in 2001 and what had already been seen 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.460
 best animations in game games 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.160
 boy color dragon a looks very small and 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.800
 it's seriously like a whore the graphic 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.280
 giant talking about dragon here what 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.900
 named as the dragon the dragon is 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.360
 the film did not see that 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.370
 they worked on this video game or is that 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.430
 they translated his name literally from 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.290
 English in that case would not surprise me anymore 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.450
 that on the cover from behind we see a 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.450
 meaningless phrase and is re champion 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.610
 absolute the effects of sounds some 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.490
 almost can not hear and some are heard 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.980
 too loud the music is nothing of the 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.360
 another Thursday is very bad and unmemorable and 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.689
 I only liked the 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.580
 when the character tender before 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:03.219
 I forgot for some strange reason 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.550
 the characters of shrek fiona and lord 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:08.349
 Farquaad have a registered trademark 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.520
 let's finish this and giving him the verdict 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:11.520
 end this shit 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:18.290
 one no better I'm not going to do it it's so 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.630
 bad that the verdict deserves this is 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.270
 the worst licensed game that ever 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.420
 taught this without counting on the already 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.160
 famous ete de atari 2600 is the lowest 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.260
 what a company can do 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.050
 in order to try that your game sells 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.880
 million is so atrocious that the only thing that 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.280
 has done is to waste time of my 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.380
 life recording testing and criticizing this 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.870
 shit and it almost left me a mark of 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.820
 life of the atrocious that is up to the colossal 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.650
 piece of shrek shit is one card 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.810
 speedway was more fun than this 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:51.230
 dirty, at least that 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:53.870
 multiplayer without further delay this game 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.180
 he deserves the score of 0.5 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.460
 cataloging it as a colossal piece of 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.430
 fuck out of a fucking ogre asshole 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.530
 and believe it or not, this is the second 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.420
 worse and the game boy game color the 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.490
 worst game boy game color not what 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.950
 I would like to point out that apart from not 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.110
 I want to kill the other boredom 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.670
 what whole criticized this game and I 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.650
 I refrain from criticizing games and 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.540
 criticized for what integers or games 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.230
 that everyone criticizes like this one 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.260
 atari 2 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:23.780
 600 howitzer and 3d 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:26.210
 finally all this torture is over 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.400
 the truth feels comfortable after 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.710
 end all this suffering of game 

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.570
 fuck n thousands of h 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:35.330
 I think you've forgotten something very 

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:37.640
 important today or hello my assistant

 ending with a criticism a colossal 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.260
 piece of shit you could remind me what 

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.910
 day you created your YouTube channel 

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:50.240

 2010 and you could tell me what day it is today
