they're waterskiing a bit but we usually

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.380 
they're waterskiing a bit but we usually
park<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.220> out<00:01:46.340> in<00:01:46.429> the<00:01:46.490> middle<00:01:46.729> of<00:01:46.819> the<00:01:47.210> lake

park it out in the middle of the lake
and<00:01:47.569> just<00:01:47.630> just<00:01:48.020> turn<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.350> off<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:48.819> put<00:01:49.819> some

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
and just just turn it off and put some

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.710 
and just just turn it off and put some
music<00:01:50.090> on

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.270 

hockey's<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.560> furthest<00:01:53.860> thing<00:01:53.890> from<00:01:54.040> your

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
hockey's the furthest thing from your

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.770 
hockey's the furthest thing from your
mind<00:01:54.340> sometimes<00:01:54.850> when<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.120> out<00:01:55.240> here<00:01:55.420> and<00:01:55.570> and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
mind sometimes when it out here and and

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.270 
mind sometimes when it out here and and
for<00:01:56.410> me<00:01:56.530> I<00:01:56.560> think<00:01:56.770> that's<00:01:56.920> where<00:01:57.040> you<00:01:57.100> need<00:01:57.250> a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
for me I think that's where you need a

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.240 
for me I think that's where you need a
lot<00:01:57.490> in<00:01:57.640> summer<00:01:58.650> especially<00:01:59.650> after<00:01:59.860> a<00:02:00.160> long

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
lot in summer especially after a long

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.820 
lot in summer especially after a long
season<00:02:00.820> that<00:02:01.390> ended<00:02:01.420> through<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.290> game<00:02:02.500> five

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
season that ended through the game five

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.980 
season that ended through the game five
loss<00:02:03.130> in<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.850> Stanley<00:02:04.090> Cup<00:02:04.390> final

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
loss in the Stanley Cup final

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.920 
loss in the Stanley Cup final
our<00:02:05.800> team<00:02:06.160> think<00:02:06.700> is<00:02:06.820> such<00:02:07.000> a<00:02:07.030> young<00:02:07.300> team<00:02:07.330> and

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
our team think is such a young team and

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.169 
our team think is such a young team and
I<00:02:08.890> think<00:02:09.070> we<00:02:09.160> learned<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.460> lot<00:02:09.580> two<00:02:09.790> years<00:02:09.970> ago

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
I think we learned a lot two years ago

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.730 
I think we learned a lot two years ago
losing<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.690> Buffalo<00:02:11.020> in<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.110> second<00:02:11.500> round<00:02:11.590> I

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
losing the Buffalo in the second round I

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.980 
losing the Buffalo in the second round I
think<00:02:11.800> we<00:02:12.010> learned<00:02:12.190> on<00:02:12.670> what<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.000> took<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.240> to

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
think we learned on what it took to to

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.510 
think we learned on what it took to to
beat<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.260> team<00:02:14.410> like<00:02:14.590> Buffalo<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.220> think<00:02:15.370> we

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
beat a team like Buffalo and I think we

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.710 
beat a team like Buffalo and I think we
were<00:02:15.580> better<00:02:15.730> prepared<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.270> do<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.420> this

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
were better prepared to do that this

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.980 
were better prepared to do that this
year<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.320> go<00:02:18.220> longer<00:02:18.520> and<00:02:18.700> then<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.270> know<00:02:19.360> the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
year and go longer and then you know the

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.570 
year and go longer and then you know the
finals<00:02:20.350> was<00:02:20.470> another<00:02:20.710> great<00:02:20.950> experience<00:02:21.160> and

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
finals was another great experience and

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.270 
finals was another great experience and
I<00:02:21.610> think<00:02:21.640> we<00:02:21.910> took<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.150> lot<00:02:22.420> away<00:02:22.450> from<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:23.280> you

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
I think we took a lot away from that you

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.370 
I think we took a lot away from that you
lost<00:02:24.460> to<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.700> great<00:02:24.940> team<00:02:25.180> but<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.660> think<00:02:26.050> most<00:02:26.230> of

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
lost to a great team but I think most of

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.040 
lost to a great team but I think most of
us<00:02:26.530> feel<00:02:26.590> in<00:02:27.400> our<00:02:27.610> room<00:02:27.850> that<00:02:28.090> we<00:02:28.810> could<00:02:28.959> have

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
us feel in our room that we could have

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.810 
us feel in our room that we could have
played<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.230> lot<00:02:29.410> better<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:30.010> think<00:02:30.700> the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
played a lot better I think the

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.430 
played a lot better I think the
experience<00:02:31.209> of<00:02:31.480> being<00:02:31.630> in<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.840> finals<00:02:32.290> and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
experience of being in the finals and

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.949 
experience of being in the finals and
and<00:02:32.680> everything<00:02:33.310> surrounding<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.150> think<00:02:34.420> we

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
and everything surrounding it I think we

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.110 
and everything surrounding it I think we
know<00:02:35.110> what<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.350> expect<00:02:35.380> now<00:02:35.950> but<00:02:36.490> there's<00:02:37.000> a

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
know what to expect now but there's a

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.720 
know what to expect now but there's a
lot<00:02:37.270> of<00:02:37.390> fun<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.630> be<00:02:37.690> around<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:39.459> know<00:02:39.580> we

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
lot of fun to be around and you know we

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.820 
lot of fun to be around and you know we
just<00:02:39.760> want<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.150> get<00:02:40.209> back<00:02:40.360> there<00:02:40.570> this<00:02:40.720> year
