first<00:00:43.860> we're<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.160> start<00:00:44.430> off<00:00:44.579> with<00:00:44.610> our

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
first we're going to start off with our

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.490 
first we're going to start off with our
5.8<00:00:45.809> gig<00:00:46.079> receiver<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.250> LCD<00:00:47.700> screen<00:00:48.350> this<00:00:49.350> is

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
5.8 gig receiver and LCD screen this is

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.380 
5.8 gig receiver and LCD screen this is
a<00:00:49.530> standard<00:00:49.950> dipole<00:00:50.280> antenna<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.300> is

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
a standard dipole antenna and this is

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.850 
a standard dipole antenna and this is
the<00:00:51.480> actual<00:00:51.719> receiver<00:00:52.170> over<00:00:52.350> here<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.800> it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the actual receiver over here and it

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.160 
the actual receiver over here and it
actually<00:00:53.010> quick<00:00:53.460> detaches<00:00:54.239> from<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.629> LCD

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
actually quick detaches from the LCD

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.680 
actually quick detaches from the LCD
screen<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.489> were<00:00:56.640> winding<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.030> fly<00:00:57.210> fpv

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
screen so if you were winding a fly fpv

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.750 
screen so if you were winding a fly fpv
and<00:00:57.899> not<00:00:58.079> fly<00:00:58.410> from<00:00:58.680> an<00:00:58.829> LCD<00:00:59.129> screen<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.640> could

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
and not fly from an LCD screen you could

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.119 
and not fly from an LCD screen you could
actually<00:00:59.940> we<00:01:00.870> left<00:01:01.140> an<00:01:01.260> AV<00:01:01.410> out<00:01:01.590> port<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.100> you

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
actually we left an AV out port so you

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.950 
actually we left an AV out port so you
could<00:01:02.309> plug<00:01:02.460> your<00:01:02.609> goggles<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.840> little

to<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> handle<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.130> your<00:01:41.220> transmitter<00:01:41.700> and

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
to the handle of your transmitter and

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.249 
to the handle of your transmitter and
the<00:01:42.570> 5.8<00:01:43.880> receiver<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.210> LCD<00:01:45.780> screen<00:01:46.049> will

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the 5.8 receiver and LCD screen will

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.389 
the 5.8 receiver and LCD screen will
mount<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.070> could<00:01:47.250> actually

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
mount to this so you could actually

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.120 
mount to this so you could actually
mount<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.000> whole<00:01:48.329> system<00:01:48.810> right<00:01:49.590> on<00:01:49.860> top<00:01:50.100> of

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
mount this whole system right on top of

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.560 
mount this whole system right on top of
your<00:01:50.399> transmitter<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.149> when<00:01:51.299> you're<00:01:51.390> flying

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
your transmitter so when you're flying

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.539 
your transmitter so when you're flying
fpv<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.439> look<00:01:52.590> right<00:01:52.740> through<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.040> LCD

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
fpv you can look right through the LCD

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.340 
fpv you can look right through the LCD
screen<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.060> at<00:01:54.540> your<00:01:54.689> transmitter<00:01:55.140> at<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
screen and at your transmitter at the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.780 
screen and at your transmitter at the
same<00:01:55.530> time<00:01:55.770> which<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.009> cool<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.729> don't

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
same time which is cool if you don't

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.310 
same time which is cool if you don't
want<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.060> do<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.360> we<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.810> little<00:01:57.990> pop-out

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
want to do that we have a little pop-out

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.870 
want to do that we have a little pop-out
stand<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:58.920> can<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.250> set<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.640> table

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
stand so you can just set it on a table

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.820 
stand so you can just set it on a table
or<00:02:00.149> set

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
or set

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.790 
or set
something<00:02:01.190> like<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:01.970> fly<00:02:02.240> from<00:02:02.420> there

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
something like that and fly from there

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.980

have a two cell lipo and I have a B EC

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.470 
have a two cell lipo and I have a B EC
I've<00:02:31.130> stepped<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.490> voltage<00:02:31.940> down<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.270> five

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
I've stepped a voltage down to five

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.330 
I've stepped a voltage down to five
volts<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:33.050> do<00:02:33.620> not<00:02:33.740> want<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.010> put<00:02:34.160> any<00:02:34.280> more

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
volts you do not want to put any more

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.120 
volts you do not want to put any more
than<00:02:34.670> six<00:02:35.000> volts<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:36.290> five<00:02:36.470> or<00:02:36.620> six<00:02:36.800> is<00:02:36.920> fine

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
than six volts so five or six is fine

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.280 
than six volts so five or six is fine
for<00:02:37.340> this<00:02:37.490> guy<00:02:37.640> through<00:02:38.270> this<00:02:38.480> transmitter

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
for this guy through this transmitter

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.260 
for this guy through this transmitter
otherwise<00:02:40.220> you're<00:02:40.460> probably<00:02:40.640> gonna<00:02:40.850> cook<00:02:41.120> it

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
otherwise you're probably gonna cook it

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.660 
otherwise you're probably gonna cook it
and<00:02:41.420> void<00:02:41.660> your<00:02:41.810> warranty<00:02:42.340> so<00:02:43.340> basically

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
it will do recording and live fpv out at

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.950 
it will do recording and live fpv out at
the<00:03:01.520> same<00:03:01.700> time<00:03:01.970> which<00:03:02.180> is<00:03:02.210> really<00:03:02.330> cool<00:03:02.720> so

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
the same time which is really cool so

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.560 
the same time which is really cool so
not<00:03:03.560> only<00:03:03.680> can<00:03:03.950> you<00:03:04.010> see<00:03:04.370> what<00:03:05.000> your<00:03:05.120> flight<00:03:05.420> is

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
not only can you see what your flight is

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.970 
not only can you see what your flight is
doing<00:03:05.840> but<00:03:05.959> you<00:03:06.050> can<00:03:06.170> actually<00:03:06.440> record<00:03:06.739> it<00:03:06.890> and

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
doing but you can actually record it and

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.640 
doing but you can actually record it and
capture<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.520> use<00:03:07.940> that<00:03:08.150> later<00:03:08.750> another

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650

you have so you can just plug the

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.180 
you have so you can just plug the
transmitter<00:04:02.209> into<00:04:02.390> that<00:04:02.690> empty<00:04:02.870> Channel<00:04:03.350> so

basically<00:04:04.519> what<00:04:04.760> I'm<00:04:04.850> going<00:04:04.970> to<00:04:05.000> do<00:04:05.150> now<00:04:05.300> is

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
basically what I'm going to do now is

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.570 
basically what I'm going to do now is
I'm<00:04:05.540> going<00:04:05.660> to<00:04:05.720> power<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:06.019> system<00:04:06.200> up<00:04:06.580> first

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
I'm going to power the system up first

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.360 
I'm going to power the system up first
I'm<00:04:07.850> going<00:04:07.970> to<00:04:08.030> turn<00:04:08.209> my<00:04:08.330> camera<00:04:08.360> on<00:04:08.870> and<00:04:09.560> the

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
I'm going to turn my camera on and the

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.780 
I'm going to turn my camera on and the
nice<00:04:10.490> thing<00:04:10.520> about<00:04:10.700> the<00:04:10.910> camera<00:04:11.210> is<00:04:11.360> it's<00:04:11.540> got

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
nice thing about the camera is it's got

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.850 
nice thing about the camera is it's got
chargeable<00:04:12.329> lipo<00:04:12.629> in<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:12.870> also<00:04:13.019> so<00:04:13.439> it<00:04:13.560> doesn't

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
chargeable lipo in it also so it doesn't

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.170 
chargeable lipo in it also so it doesn't
need<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:13.980> power<00:04:14.189> supply<00:04:14.549> you<00:04:14.610> just<00:04:14.879> make<00:04:15.030> sure

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
and then I'm going to turn my

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.349 
and then I'm going to turn my
transmission<00:04:18.750> system<00:04:19.109> on<00:04:19.970> we'll<00:04:20.970> start<00:04:21.150> with

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
transmission system on we'll start with

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.150 
transmission system on we'll start with
the<00:04:21.539> transmitter<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.320> you<00:04:22.650> just<00:04:22.800> notice<00:04:23.130> the

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
the transmitter and you just notice the

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.920 
the transmitter and you just notice the
red<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.669> blue<00:04:23.850> indicator<00:04:24.330> indicating<00:04:24.900> that

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
red the blue indicator indicating that

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.490 
red the blue indicator indicating that
it's<00:04:25.169> transmitting<00:04:25.770> I'm<00:04:26.280> gonna<00:04:26.460> turn<00:04:26.699> on<00:04:27.030> my

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
it's transmitting I'm gonna turn on my

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.740 
it's transmitting I'm gonna turn on my
receiver<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.889> I'm<00:04:29.430> gonna<00:04:29.550> power<00:04:29.789> on<00:04:30.030> my<00:04:30.180> LCD

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
receiver and I'm gonna power on my LCD

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.219 
receiver and I'm gonna power on my LCD
screen<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:32.300> this<00:04:33.300> is<00:04:33.360> going<00:04:33.600> to<00:04:33.660> look<00:04:33.870> bright

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
screen and this is going to look bright

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:35.960 
screen and this is going to look bright
it's<00:04:34.530> really<00:04:34.800> not<00:04:34.949> as<00:04:35.130> bright<00:04:35.370> as<00:04:35.490> it<00:04:35.520> does<00:04:35.789> to

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
it's really not as bright as it does to

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.850 
it's really not as bright as it does to
the<00:04:36.030> camera<00:04:36.509> see<00:04:37.139> if<00:04:37.169> I<00:04:37.320> can<00:04:37.470> put<00:04:37.680> it<00:04:37.710> on

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
the camera see if I can put it on

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.350 
the camera see if I can put it on
something<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.310> little<00:04:38.550> bit<00:04:38.669> darker<00:04:39.590> basically

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
something a little bit darker basically

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.839 
something a little bit darker basically
this<00:04:42.360> is<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.720> video<00:04:42.990> signal<00:04:43.699> that<00:04:44.699> you're

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
this is the video signal that you're

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.580 
this is the video signal that you're
gonna<00:04:44.970> get<00:04:45.270> which<00:04:45.840> is<00:04:45.870> actually<00:04:46.349> really

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
gonna get which is actually really

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.890 
gonna get which is actually really
really<00:04:46.949> clear<00:04:47.550> I<00:04:47.759> know<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.330> doesn't<00:04:48.509> look<00:04:48.660> like

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
really clear I know it doesn't look like

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.870 
really clear I know it doesn't look like
that<00:04:48.930> on<00:04:49.259> the<00:04:49.380> camera<00:04:49.620> but<00:04:49.889> it<00:04:50.009> really<00:04:50.280> is<00:04:50.580> it's

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
that on the camera but it really is it's

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.999 
that on the camera but it really is it's
beautiful<00:04:51.270> so<00:04:52.020> this<00:04:52.169> works<00:04:52.440> really<00:04:52.530> nice

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
beautiful so this works really nice

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:54.529 
beautiful so this works really nice
you're<00:04:53.220> basically<00:04:53.669> like<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.180> said<00:04:54.210> you<00:04:54.449> would

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
you're basically like I said you would

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.270 
you're basically like I said you would
take<00:04:54.690> this<00:04:54.810> whole<00:04:54.990> system<00:04:55.229> and<00:04:55.620> you<00:04:56.130> would

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
take this whole system and you would

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.920 
take this whole system and you would
mount<00:04:56.520> it<00:04:56.699> directly<00:04:56.849> onto<00:04:57.389> your<00:04:57.690> radio

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
mount it directly onto your radio

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.409 
mount it directly onto your radio
controller<00:04:58.349> and<00:04:58.650> you're<00:04:58.860> flying<00:04:59.130> fpv<00:04:59.729> so

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
controller and you're flying fpv so

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:01.939 
controller and you're flying fpv so
there's<00:05:00.630> nothing<00:05:00.810> crazy<00:05:01.199> it's<00:05:01.590> really

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
there's nothing crazy it's really

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:03.680 
there's nothing crazy it's really
straightforward<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:02.580> simple<00:05:02.789> and<00:05:03.180> I<00:05:03.630> know

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
straightforward and simple and I know

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.480 
straightforward and simple and I know
that<00:05:04.020> some<00:05:04.440> of<00:05:04.500> you<00:05:04.590> guys<00:05:04.620> already<00:05:05.190> have

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
that some of you guys already have

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.550 
that some of you guys already have
GoPros<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.330> we've<00:05:06.660> actually<00:05:07.050> considered

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
GoPros and we've actually considered

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.810 
GoPros and we've actually considered
that<00:05:07.590> so<00:05:07.949> what<00:05:08.099> we<00:05:08.220> did<00:05:08.340> was<00:05:08.490> we<00:05:08.639> made<00:05:08.669> a

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
that so what we did was we made a

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.920 
that so what we did was we made a
separate<00:05:09.750> RCA<00:05:10.139> mount<00:05:10.580> just<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.669> wire<00:05:12.330> jumper<00:05:12.810> so

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
separate RCA mount just a wire jumper so

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.270 
separate RCA mount just a wire jumper so
you<00:05:13.020> could<00:05:13.169> plug<00:05:13.380> that<00:05:13.410> into<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.889> back<00:05:14.039> of<00:05:14.070> the

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
you could plug that into the back of the

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.640 
you could plug that into the back of the
transmission<00:05:14.699> system<00:05:15.030> and<00:05:15.449> plug<00:05:16.050> your<00:05:16.080> GoPro

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
transmission system and plug your GoPro

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.129 
transmission system and plug your GoPro
right<00:05:17.010> into<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.400> RCA's<00:05:17.880> here<00:05:18.300> and<00:05:18.630> you<00:05:18.960> can

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
right into the RCA's here and you can

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:20.930 
right into the RCA's here and you can
fly<00:05:19.320> via<00:05:19.560> that<00:05:19.770> as<00:05:19.949> well<00:05:20.190> well<00:05:20.610> the<00:05:20.729> nice<00:05:20.909> thing

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
fly via that as well well the nice thing

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.600 
fly via that as well well the nice thing
about<00:05:21.180> this<00:05:21.630> solution<00:05:21.900> is<00:05:22.650> you<00:05:23.430> could

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
about this solution is you could

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.750 
about this solution is you could
basically<00:05:24.620> snag<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:25.830> wireless<00:05:26.280> transmission

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
basically snag the wireless transmission

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.080 
basically snag the wireless transmission
set<00:05:27.120> I<00:05:27.150> think<00:05:27.240> it<00:05:27.510> runs<00:05:27.659> at<00:05:27.930> 229<00:05:28.500> and<00:05:28.949> you<00:05:29.909> could

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
set I think it runs at 229 and you could

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.659 
set I think it runs at 229 and you could
snag<00:05:30.360> the<00:05:30.539> RC<00:05:30.900> logger<00:05:31.110> Pro<00:05:31.380> which<00:05:31.620> runs<00:05:31.830> at<00:05:32.010> 150

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
snag the RC logger Pro which runs at 150

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.360 
snag the RC logger Pro which runs at 150
