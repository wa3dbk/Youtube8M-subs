 tv in this case another facet was more 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.110

 appears after a long silence of 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.420
 decades 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.800
 after 31 years later you are 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.050
 saying the provision of the movie 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.330
 that the cinema is abandoned by 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.680
 city ​​to a form before itself yes that I have 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.300
 commented always that I do not abandon 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.100
 versions but as it happens with the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.230
 women who sent the woman and the gold 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.030
 then as I did well going without 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.589
 appeared in more that will come even 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.749
 I want to introduce myself to things about the new 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.089
 director because I say communicating well 

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:47.399
 after 30 years match of being another 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.320
 Once we like it, give me to do a blur 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.780
 and a new account have not been given today 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.149
 precisely some people then 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.739
 yes after 31 years after the 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.469
 recovery of the value of my films 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.989
 that last year the sevilla festival 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.320
 us the complete cycle all in seminars 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.450
 of diversity in Seville with 7 hours 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.070
 movies that were incredible because more 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.560
 the seven conferences that the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.510
 properly the movies almost then 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.220
 I felt very encouraged and over 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.290
 all the invitation he made to the cycle 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.450
 complete his seville the festival of 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.280
 vienna that is the festival considered 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.740
 as the maximum exponent 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.270
 there are no more guards than hundreds of them 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.909
 catch it retrospectively then 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.250
 then we have rediscovered the tomb of 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.290
 our big bed to see if we take out is 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.200
 able to carry something made by the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.390
 so that it was not just everything 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.820
 archeology not then it is run 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.530
 a lot for during this year will end 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.690
 a movie to get there too 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.310
 alive and kicking I wait for the festival of 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.679
 comes with five films of thirty and 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.619
 so many years and renew one that has 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.240
 months that is quality joy is not 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.160
 a small synopsis and the joy of 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.509
 Cadiz almost like living in Seville but 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.950
 there is a time when there is a sign 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.659
 of the movie that living in Cali could 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.420
 be the title also of the movie 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.649
 living in Cádiz is still to answer 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.270
 things of the level would be almost the 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.980
 same emblematic movie that is 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.410
 placed in the 900 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.170
 in the history of world cinema and that in 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.150
 this moment what helps me to try 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.810
 back to the cinema then it's not a remake 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.150
 but if the same is inspired where 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.860
 the characters have a kind of 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.270
 unfolding of the characters lives in 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.310
 sevilla also present in this list 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.750
 in a very important idea in that year 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.040
 78 when I made the movie and then 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.380
 obviously sevilla is replaced 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.240
 by cádiz and the folkloric atmosphere of 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.790
 sevilla health with the sale is whole 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.730
 they were here replaced by the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.390
 chirigotas of first line of romancero 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.600
 first line chelu name 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.920
 the cracks in gómez number one decade 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.600
 and for me every day I have a lot of interest 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.819
 throughout this period of thirty-somethings 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.010
 years in the movie me everything what I 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.930
 I think of the woman what I think of 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.270
 my children are all made me the 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.760
 film what I think of cadiz for 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.140
 My caddy has been a kind of retirement 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.220
 spiritual that he did all year in the 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.780
 channel the smartest the most original 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.450
 the most innovative thing that has moved me the most 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.340
 my head and all these last 25 years 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.350
 it has been the things of the carnival of cádiz 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.480
 and what has not appeared the logical thing is 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.730
 mention those who fill my life 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.170
 this time that and the week that passes in 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.600
 the first week half the one I was 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.000
 seeing not the first thing for me I was two 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.709
 Sometimes that also seemed to me that it was so 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.420
 strong as of the carnival of cádiz but 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.769
 they are white Anglo-Saxon 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.080
 more work to print on the 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.910
 movies about something that is had a 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.430
 little of my culture are lacking lobitos 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.930
 legalism then the movie I do not want 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.160
 I want to have I remember a lot 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.750
 when they dress them in every 10 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.280
 representing that song of 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.100
 let 's talk about love says let's talk about 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.799
 ham once more than the last time 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.420
 we ate it exactly gonzalo has been 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.610
 I was not a movie but 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.500
 he wanted that first of all it seemed to me that 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.440
 I had understood it wrong but you more 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.270
 confirmed that this is the character 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.310
 feminine what would be the protagonist 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.770
 is interpreted by four actresses 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.110
 different this seems to me inside of me 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.140
 little cinematographic culture really 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.510
 new thing I remember it a movie with 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.130
 four acts or there may be that there 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.410
 an actor that is when the protagonist 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.359
 of children and then it 's older finally those 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.370
 things in the movie points the first 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.410
 very important is dark object to be 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.610
 from a high level your level one 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.990
 movie that I have them between ten 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.220
 best in history because he told me 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.350
 also make list as they have done 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.720
 with mine sales forces will lose 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.270
 everything nothing else and you something bent your 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.919
 same thanks him and fundamentally 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.450
 because when we did the castle I knew 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.340
 that they were going to come wonderful women of 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.960
 cadiz and then where to give more 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.669
 all fit all of 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.560
 it seemed the wonderful ones had to the 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.810
 movie and where are four because 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.090
 there were seven and if there was no business 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.380
 but half with seven and that we follow 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.290
 without end that would have been a month 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.610
 a bit of exaggeration but that same 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.190
 that the number of the Seville not me 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.560
 doubted whether three or four-four 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.870
 the end it seems to me that no girl to 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.220
 three other supporting roles in mind 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.050
 that the woman is the movie and she feels 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.600
 female protagonists and a chorus of 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.190
 girls that are other 8 are 15 if that 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.830
 we add rose that you do not know that 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.480
 she is also a movie star 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.400
 earlier that these also appear 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.900
 fables go the make-up artist almost 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.920
 tell me that he talks about the movies in my 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.600
 movies also appear as 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.180
 character that like remembers where 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.660
 live in sevilla because they would be in that case 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.850
 7 and 8 15 2 17 17 number blacks 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.710
 central left you right and that all the 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.780
 society I will systematically with 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.380
 great hopes in the movie it 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.900
 they premiere festivals in the circuit I do not know 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.690
 if you call it traditional commercial light 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.250
 If there is something planned, I am sure that 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.620
 they will remove on our feet that we 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.880
 they're going to throw the phone down asking 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.800
 a movie inside the movies 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.540
 when that happens immediately they will go to 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.650
 the commercial halls that is the spirit 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.650
 and many thanks to a phallus
