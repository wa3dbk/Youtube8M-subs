 Moritz Leuenberger and welcome to another issue of the 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.849
 Videoportals hbz on the way 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.449
 because just being completely different from the sun why do we drive into life 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.149
 attend the parade my parents 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.000
 it is 11 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.170
 24 steglitz-zehlendorf 2008 and 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.160
 I'm a bit sad that you make such a fuss every year 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.380
 does not make any parts of it 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.310
 2000 years a wall 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.680
 should have lived 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.659
 I think there are thousands of Iceland 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.659
 bring the park daily finite round shape 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.250
 as that Jesus should have done then 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.610
 in the morning at 7 o'clock Bremen ots otherwise well served 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.240
 But I am also the energy prices reveal 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.310
 do not have a helper syndrome and they do not need to mend that 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.960
 fast enough on the trees it also comes out times to say my 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.210
 rather 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.690
 not ready is a fundamental right 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.980
 and if you are not ready then I can just measure your fate 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.150
 by the way is also one 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.050
 Disease's fate was hoping for something right 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.870
 exciting trip brings how many times have I experienced that someone has told me 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.400
 I never choose to punish animals at a seminar. "If I do not 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.450
 that this and that disease would have me on one quasi 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.590
 Visitor skill stood 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.040
 "When it's so warm and of course I can tell every disease that one 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.880
 Access as well as nowhere a random generator around three liters ill 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.460
 and not others 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.940
 but you can also see it differently you can say 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.480
 Cronkite and other strokes of fate that is the only way ours 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.400
 Even sons of it sample of the universe proteins 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.340
 so you do not get out of this old man with a beard that you give them 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.899
 Nonsense of the special school have visited 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.079
 to draw 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.019
 it is the only way that he himself out 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.059
 Somehow to move bohmtes 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:25.289
 One day sometimes I have to ask myself year what do we actually need 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:29.949
 a world that is alright a world pro and just a higher one 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:34.829
 Intelligence above all is the cure or is it already 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:35.719
 healed 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.819
 I personally do not see myself healing. I am looking forward to seeing you in Tyler 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.869
 open there people come to rent 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:44.719
 they know there's a door somewhere 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.909
 who are ready to go through the door and they just are not at the moment 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.519
 I can see and what I do there is I show them where the trains are and the 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.189
 You have to open the door and go through it yourself 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.389
 That's how I see the profession of salvation 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.279
 I wish you all the best with the eighth and a happy new year 

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:05.799
