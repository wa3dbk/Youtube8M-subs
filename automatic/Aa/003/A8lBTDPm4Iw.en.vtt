either side sit that one all the way
down<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.780> side<00:03:24.990> as<00:03:25.110> well<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.800> opens<00:03:26.160> up<00:03:26.340> very

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
down this side as well it opens up very

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.190 
down this side as well it opens up very
much<00:03:26.820> like<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.150> suitcase<00:03:27.420> design<00:03:27.870> as<00:03:27.990> you<00:03:28.080> can

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
much like a suitcase design as you can

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.610 
much like a suitcase design as you can
see<00:03:28.410> so<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.730> idea<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.150> basically<00:03:30.360> that<00:03:30.570> got<00:03:31.350> a

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
see so the idea is basically that got a

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.070 
see so the idea is basically that got a
nice<00:03:32.100> big<00:03:32.340> open<00:03:32.459> area<00:03:32.820> here<00:03:32.850> it's<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.570> cord<00:03:33.840> tie

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
nice big open area here it's a cord tie

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.650 
nice big open area here it's a cord tie
at<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.260> top<00:03:34.320> you<00:03:35.100> just<00:03:35.190> open<00:03:35.490> up<00:03:35.520> like<00:03:35.700> so<00:03:35.970> so

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
at the top you just open up like so so

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.970 
at the top you just open up like so so
you<00:03:36.720> basically<00:03:36.840> put<00:03:37.200> everything<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.860> you've
