00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.990
 i 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.460
 you remember the lemon that I asked you to 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.010
 freeze 'aces' i am what are we going 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.620
 start using 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.869
 scary do something simple something that 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.060
 it's going to be a dessert is going to be a snack 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.410
 it's going to be a snack and it's something 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.030
 super simple 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.240
 until a port with ranches is able to 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.240
 do 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.470
 267 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:44.730
 for that postcard and you know that I am a 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.070
 total geek of the embers but they do 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.090
 perfectly to the maximum 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:54.830
 of the lemon grove is pure lemon 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.830
 widely work and so too 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.449
 to children 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.160
 ours 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.860
 nitin was a damn that from the leaves of 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.860
 lemon tree that is stingy 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.900
 with warm ones use sugar panela 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.220
 panela is the healthiest sugar that 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.220
 you would have processed that exists 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.200
 Y 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.310
 a chorretÃ³n of the best spirit of 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.310
 find with this what you try is 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.310
 our av 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.470
 and this that there are classes on a 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.840
 striped freezer to the beast if with 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.300
 all striped white or yellow all 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.120
 so then the lemon homeless in 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.590
 this is triple power and to remove some 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.690
 leaflets of the trip that will win or 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.220
 the proposals will take me to color 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.520
 also cinnamon from websites put mint 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.030
 tarragon fennel whatever you want try and 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.030
 you tell me 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.599
 refreshing acid 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.170
 everything in the basil that gives a touch 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:30.890
 special 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.890
 to eat in it 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.020
 on the ground one day 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.020
 who sings and dreams to me
