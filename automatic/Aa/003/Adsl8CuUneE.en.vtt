00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.810
 good 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.840
 hello youtube friends android guys at 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.210
 day 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.340
 today I bring neither more nor less than 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.410
 the meeting and end to use it 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.350
 on your device if you want 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.719
 change it or change it or not 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.489
 you know how to change the rom or what have you 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.829
 had some problems with the rom 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.600
 new to install either google 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.190
 google edition be it the pac man 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.579
 etcetera etcetera 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.979
 well here I have a rom that is the rom 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:10.929
 not original when the engine just came out 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:14.649
 or the motorcycle gp 4.4 point 2 and ready to 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:17.500
 be updated as it is a rom of the usa 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.770
 good that we are going to do to change the 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.509
 rom we have to have the bootloader 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.330
 unlocked it 's obvious that when someone 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.490
 wants to change the error that already changed the 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.259
 rom for once for the first time 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.510
 can do again how many times 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.340
 want 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:38.160
 here I have the rom let's start here 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.410
 come the steps of how are we going to 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.460
 make the process very simple 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.920
 well as we know we have to put the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.370
 commands we have to download the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.390
 vedetÃ³n that you must have yes yes yes 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:57.420
 already mentioned the bootloader and the roma what 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.200
 we want to do first is to copy 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.930
 all these files 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.700
 let's copy them to the bird folder of 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.519
 we all copy and paste them already 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.970
 they are stuck here once done that 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:18.010
 process us with the shift key and 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.250
 with the mouse 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.250
 line right click let's go 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.830
 let's go and let's open the window 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.280
 command 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.980
 It's so simple, I'm not going to do it 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.410
 the process is my cell phone because I finish it 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.900
 of doing some some weeks ago 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.850
 but I wanted to share it because there 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.280
 people who want to return to their 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.560
 original 'stock' of the engine or motorbike 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.450
 people because they spend a lot of battery 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.220
 of the others after others rom but here 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.000
 I bring you the original round so that 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.880
 install and ready to install the 4.4 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.360
 point 3 this rom will receive 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:07.350
 updates as well as with the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:10.520
 bootloader unlocked so what 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.730
 let's do here we open the file 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.410
 let's copy what is the first thing 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.970
 what we see here 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.520
 this method is to return to the rom of 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.210
 factory 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:28.330
 for ron stop here we are 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:31.770
 let's go first 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:37.140
 I had passed this step 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:41.150
 let's go we turn off our cell phone and 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.150
 we put it to invoice mode 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.650
 you already know what is the key to pay and key 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.560
 volume down we leave it three seconds and 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.710
 in three seconds let's see what's going 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.650
 let go of it and let's go into mode 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.110
 easy that I would recommend that you should 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.620
 to have the drives because if it is not going to 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.720
 to be able to update their phones and to 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.740
 Once done, we connect our cell phone 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.620
 to the computer and you follow the process now 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:16.410
 I stuck the first 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:20.370
 and so on we have to go 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.560
 pasting one by one until you reach 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.740
 facebook bounce where we already 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:30.590
 we will have our cell phone ready to 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:33.300
 use and with a next update 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.949
 automatically some say that already 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.199
 they will not be able to receive updates 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.820
 with the point to see but with this rom 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.040
 you will be able to receive everything that you 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.100
 want the phone is registered 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.729
 you will automatically have android 4.4 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.710
 official points of motorola good friends 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.360
 this is a small video 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.180
 tutorial for those people who 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.300
 they want to return to the stock rom 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.270
 factory of your motorcycle the motorcycle that 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.910
 I previously did a video tutorial very 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.430
 similar but it 's for people who 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.900
 they want to receive updates in 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.940
 reality today I do it 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.430
 mainly by people who do not 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.870
 They find the stock rom and they want 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.460
 continue also receiving the 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.560
 updates with the return 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.240
 unlocked 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.510
 but this has been my video tutorial 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.360
 friends these simple steps I'm going to 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.669
 leave the file here also so that 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.730
 so you have it and download it 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:32.030
 I will also leave the rom and what they are 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:34.639
 the drivers so they do not fight anything and 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.669
 the bird of tool will also let you 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.910
