00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
that would to be doing these crisscross

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.779 
that would to be doing these crisscross
wings<00:00:42.899> why<00:00:43.230> because<00:00:44.160> when<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.340> throw<00:00:44.640> these

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
wings why because when I throw these

I'm doing a be split I will get out mid

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.600 
I'm doing a be split I will get out mid
and<00:00:52.140> take<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.530> control<00:00:52.800> or<00:00:53.039> wanna<00:00:53.190> get<00:00:53.520> up

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
and take that control or wanna get up

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.910 
and take that control or wanna get up
mid<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:53.910> hold<00:00:54.090> big<00:00:54.329> control<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.590> arrows

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
mid and hold big control so the arrows

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.439 
mid and hold big control so the arrows
here<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.160> gonna<00:00:56.280> rotate<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.730> mid<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.090> try<00:00:57.390> to

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
here is gonna rotate the mid and try to

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.979 
here is gonna rotate the mid and try to
maintain<00:00:58.079> mid<00:00:59.070> control<00:00:59.399> or<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:00.600> mid<00:01:00.809> player

maintain mid control or the mid player

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.380 
maintain mid control or the mid player
for<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:02.399> counter<00:01:02.670> Terrace<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.059> gonna<00:01:03.210> rotate

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
for the counter Terrace is gonna rotate

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.960 
for the counter Terrace is gonna rotate
to<00:01:03.690> be<00:01:03.840> anticipating<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.589> be<00:01:04.739> hit<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.220> right

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
to be anticipating a be hit so right

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.690 
to be anticipating a be hit so right
here<00:01:06.150> doing<00:01:06.360> these<00:01:06.510> smokes<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.960> flashes<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
here doing these smokes and flashes and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.830 
here doing these smokes and flashes and
making<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.760> heavy<00:01:08.939> distraction<00:01:09.540> over<00:01:09.750> at

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
making a heavy distraction over at

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.570 
making a heavy distraction over at
middle<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.290> gonna<00:01:10.530> pull<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.890> eight<00:01:11.010> rotator

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
middle is gonna pull the eight rotator

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.700 
middle is gonna pull the eight rotator
it<00:01:11.700> away<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.090> its<00:01:12.990> gonna<00:01:13.110> make<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> bomb

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
it away on its gonna make the a bomb

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.940 
it away on its gonna make the a bomb
site<00:01:13.920> really<00:01:14.159> weak<00:01:14.630> so<00:01:15.630> if<00:01:16.170> I'm<00:01:16.409> going<00:01:16.680> out<00:01:16.740> a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
site really weak so if I'm going out a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.160 
site really weak so if I'm going out a
now<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.430> know<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.119> forklift<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.780> highway<00:01:19.049> is

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
now I know that forklift and highway is

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.140 
now I know that forklift and highway is
probably<00:01:19.560> clear<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.400> probably<00:01:20.520> don't<00:01:20.880> have

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
probably clear so I probably don't have

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.270 
probably clear so I probably don't have
to<00:01:21.330> worry<00:01:21.600> about<00:01:22.140> throwing<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.650> smoke<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.100> this

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
to worry about throwing a smoke in this

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.730 
to worry about throwing a smoke in this
area<00:01:23.580> reason<00:01:24.390> being<00:01:24.570> if<00:01:24.840> there's<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.470> player<00:01:25.650> at

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
area reason being if there's a player at

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.780 
area reason being if there's a player at
spawn<00:01:25.979> truck<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.369> I'm<00:01:26.430> throwing<00:01:26.549> all<00:01:26.670> this

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
spawn truck and I'm throwing all this

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.730 
spawn truck and I'm throwing all this
mid<00:01:27.000> stuff<00:01:27.240> well<00:01:28.080> he's<00:01:28.200> not<00:01:28.290> gonna<00:01:28.409> be<00:01:28.500> worried

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
mid stuff well he's not gonna be worried

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.770 
mid stuff well he's not gonna be worried
about<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.920> surely<00:01:29.579> he's<00:01:29.790> gonna<00:01:29.939> go<00:01:30.390> back<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.630> Z

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
about a surely he's gonna go back to Z

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.440 
about a surely he's gonna go back to Z
and<00:01:30.900> watch<00:01:31.110> mid<00:01:31.380> or<00:01:31.619> he's<00:01:32.310> gonna<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:33.329> know

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
come over here and get to quad box to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.550 
come over here and get to quad box to
look<00:01:35.369> over<00:01:35.579> at<00:01:35.700> highway<00:01:35.850> right<00:01:36.540> those<00:01:37.380> are<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
look over at highway right those are the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.569 
look over at highway right those are the
two<00:01:37.710> plays<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.100> make<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.369> don't<00:01:38.490> really

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
two plays that you make you don't really

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.120 
two plays that you make you don't really
sit<00:01:39.299> here<00:01:39.479> watching<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.350> there's<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.009> whole

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
sit here watching a if there's a whole

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.249 
sit here watching a if there's a whole
bunch<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.400> pressure<00:01:41.579> at<00:01:41.790> mid<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.540> doesn't<00:01:42.810> make

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
bunch of pressure at mid it doesn't make

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.060 
bunch of pressure at mid it doesn't make
sense<00:01:43.290> really<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.810> ok<00:01:46.590> I've<00:01:46.770> already

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
sense really so ok I've already

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.770 
sense really so ok I've already
identified<00:01:47.280> eight<00:01:47.970> rotators<00:01:48.390> are<00:01:48.420> down
