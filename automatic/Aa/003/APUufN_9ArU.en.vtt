00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
we said similar to the xbox 360

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.549 
we said similar to the xbox 360
controller<00:00:53.449> so<00:00:54.449> everything's<00:00:54.809> within<00:00:55.050> graphs

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
controller so everything's within graphs

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
and it's easy to hold very ergonomic so

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.200 
and it's easy to hold very ergonomic so
our<00:00:58.230> hand<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:58.980> wraps<00:00:59.190> around<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.030> we

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
our hand just wraps around it and we

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.029 
our hand just wraps around it and we
also<00:01:00.390> appreciate<00:01:00.750> some<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> other<00:01:01.649> subtle

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
things they put on for example the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.420 
things they put on for example the
rubbery<00:01:03.960> surface<00:01:04.739> right<00:01:04.890> here<00:01:04.920> towards<00:01:05.339> the

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
but if you do it also comes included

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.560

with the nifty stand here so the stand

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.690 
with the nifty stand here so the stand
actually<00:03:21.049> will<00:03:21.380> accommodate<00:03:21.860> larger<00:03:22.340> devices

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.539 
actually will accommodate larger devices
like<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.269> tablet<00:03:23.870> so<00:03:24.079> 10<00:03:24.350> inch<00:03:24.500> tablets<00:03:24.980> which

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
Windows Phone or even blackberry but

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.970 
Windows Phone or even blackberry but
hopefully<00:03:41.989> down<00:03:42.109> the<00:03:42.170> road<00:03:42.320> they<00:03:42.560> kind<00:03:42.769> of<00:03:42.829> do

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
hopefully down the road they kind of do

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.039 
hopefully down the road they kind of do
that<00:03:43.160> just<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.459> broaden<00:03:43.760> its<00:03:44.030> worth<00:03:44.299> so<00:03:44.900> this

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
that just to broaden its worth so this

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.710 
that just to broaden its worth so this
is<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.290> Moga<00:03:45.709> pearl<00:03:46.010> Moga<00:03:46.609> pivot<00:03:47.090> application

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
is the Moga pearl Moga pivot application

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.090 
is the Moga pearl Moga pivot application
for<00:03:47.900> Android<00:03:48.290> and<00:03:48.410> basically<00:03:48.799> it's<00:03:49.010> the

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
for Android and basically it's the

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.009 
for Android and basically it's the
centralized<00:03:49.549> hub<00:03:49.760> which<00:03:50.329> either<00:03:50.510> gets<00:03:50.780> all

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
centralized hub which either gets all

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.680 
centralized hub which either gets all
the<00:03:51.230> content<00:03:51.769> that<00:03:51.829> all<00:03:52.579> the<00:03:52.730> gaming<00:03:53.120> content

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
the content that all the gaming content

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.240 
the content that all the gaming content
that<00:03:53.870> it's<00:03:54.109> compatible<00:03:54.590> to<00:03:54.890> work<00:03:55.010> with<00:03:55.160> the

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
that it's compatible to work with the

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.520 
that it's compatible to work with the
Moga<00:03:55.519> pro<00:03:55.549> but<00:03:55.940> they've<00:03:56.090> been<00:03:56.239> optimized<00:03:56.900> so

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
Moga pro but they've been optimized so

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.380 
Moga pro but they've been optimized so
instead<00:03:57.769> of<00:03:57.829> using<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:58.220> on-screen<00:03:58.489> touch

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
instead of using the on-screen touch

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.449 
instead of using the on-screen touch
controls<00:03:59.840> you<00:04:00.049> could<00:04:00.200> rely<00:04:00.380> on<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.650> gamepad

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
controls you could rely on the gamepad

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.849 
controls you could rely on the gamepad
itself<00:04:02.049> so<00:04:03.049> right<00:04:03.170> now<00:04:03.290> I'm<00:04:03.350> going<00:04:03.500> to<00:04:03.590> demo

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
itself so right now I'm going to demo

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.039 
itself so right now I'm going to demo
some<00:04:04.130> of<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.340> titles<00:04:05.000> that<00:04:05.120> are<00:04:05.359> optimized<00:04:06.019> to

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
some of the titles that are optimized to

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.750 
some of the titles that are optimized to
work<00:04:06.200> with<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.680> Moga<00:04:06.980> pro<00:04:07.010> we'll<00:04:07.430> start<00:04:07.640> off

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
work with the Moga pro we'll start off

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.849 
work with the Moga pro we'll start off
with<00:04:07.790> some<00:04:08.030> of<00:04:08.299> the<00:04:08.510> older<00:04:08.959> classic<00:04:09.500> titles

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
with some of the older classic titles

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.970 
with some of the older classic titles
for<00:04:10.370> example<00:04:10.790> here<00:04:10.970> pac-man<00:04:11.600> very<00:04:12.590> simple

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
for example here pac-man very simple

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.860 
for example here pac-man very simple
easy<00:04:13.160> and<00:04:13.489> of<00:04:13.730> course<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.120> Moga<00:04:14.299> pro<00:04:14.390> it's

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
easy and of course the Moga pro it's

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.750 
easy and of course the Moga pro it's
great<00:04:15.170> just<00:04:15.350> because<00:04:15.530> you<00:04:15.769> can<00:04:15.950> use<00:04:16.549> the

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
great just because you can use the

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.360 
great just because you can use the
analog<00:04:17.209> stick<00:04:17.600> it<00:04:17.840> kind<00:04:18.169> of<00:04:18.289> acts<00:04:18.890> as<00:04:19.220> the

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
analog stick it kind of acts as the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.250 
analog stick it kind of acts as the
usual<00:04:19.880> joystick<00:04:20.510> you<00:04:20.539> find<00:04:20.900> with<00:04:21.079> the

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
usual joystick you find with the

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.680 
usual joystick you find with the
irregular<00:04:21.739> classic<00:04:22.280> arcade<00:04:22.669> game

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
irregular classic arcade game

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.240 
irregular classic arcade game
and<00:04:23.780> it<00:04:24.140> works<00:04:24.350> pretty<00:04:24.410> well<00:04:24.650> but<00:04:25.010> are<00:04:25.190> you

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
and it works pretty well but are you

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.400 
and it works pretty well but are you
simply<00:04:25.580> not<00:04:25.760> doing<00:04:25.910> much<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.480> just<00:04:27.200> move

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
simply not doing much to just move

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.900 
simply not doing much to just move
around<00:04:27.500> and<00:04:27.890> that's<00:04:28.100> pretty<00:04:28.280> much<00:04:28.460> it<00:04:28.700> there

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
around and that's pretty much it there

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.810 
around and that's pretty much it there
now<00:04:29.720> here's<00:04:29.900> another<00:04:30.200> classic<00:04:30.620> game<00:04:31.130> or<00:04:31.430> type

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
now here's another classic game or type

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.640 
now here's another classic game or type
you<00:04:32.090> haven't<00:04:32.330> played<00:04:32.540> it<00:04:32.690> space<00:04:33.080> shooter<00:04:33.440> game

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
you haven't played it space shooter game

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.620 
you haven't played it space shooter game
and<00:04:33.920> of<00:04:34.190> course<00:04:34.430> you<00:04:34.550> could<00:04:34.640> use<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:35.120> analog

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
and of course you could use the analog

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.650 
and of course you could use the analog
the<00:04:36.050> analog<00:04:36.560> stick<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:36.920> actually<00:04:37.250> maneuver

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
the analog stick to actually maneuver

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.480 
the analog stick to actually maneuver
the<00:04:38.660> ship<00:04:38.690> here<00:04:39.230> and<00:04:39.740> it<00:04:39.920> works<00:04:40.100> fairly<00:04:40.280> well

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
the ship here and it works fairly well

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.030 
the ship here and it works fairly well
again<00:04:41.150> nothing<00:04:41.480> too<00:04:41.690> much<00:04:41.930> with<00:04:42.530> the<00:04:42.650> control

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
again nothing too much with the control

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.130 
again nothing too much with the control
scheme<00:04:43.310> pretty<00:04:43.700> basic<00:04:44.420> as<00:04:44.540> it<00:04:44.570> goes<00:04:44.840> just

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
scheme pretty basic as it goes just

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.020 
scheme pretty basic as it goes just
being<00:04:45.830> able<00:04:45.980> to<00:04:46.100> actually<00:04:46.280> maneuver<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:47.000> ship

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
being able to actually maneuver the ship

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.900 
being able to actually maneuver the ship
and<00:04:47.570> of<00:04:47.690> course<00:04:47.990> dodge<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.890> enemies<00:04:49.160> and<00:04:49.670> it's

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
and of course dodge the enemies and it's

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.190 
and of course dodge the enemies and it's
just<00:04:50.090> not<00:04:50.270> just<00:04:50.450> because<00:04:50.750> you<00:04:50.930> have<00:04:50.960> an

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
just not just because you have an

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.260 
just not just because you have an
uncluttered<00:04:51.680> look<00:04:52.070> of<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.370> interface<00:04:52.880> itself

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
uncluttered look of the interface itself

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.200 
uncluttered look of the interface itself
and<00:04:54.140> finally<00:04:54.470> we<00:04:54.590> have<00:04:54.800> here<00:04:55.190> yet<00:04:55.400> another<00:04:55.730> 2d

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210

and finally we have here yet another 2d
classic<00:04:56.840> title<00:04:57.140> in<00:04:57.260> another<00:04:57.590> world<00:04:57.860> and<00:04:58.220> I

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
classic title in another world and I

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.360 
classic title in another world and I
prefer<00:04:59.030> using<00:04:59.210> the<00:04:59.600> the<00:05:00.320> directional<00:05:00.830> pad<00:05:00.890> as

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
prefer using the the directional pad as

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.910 
prefer using the the directional pad as
opposed<00:05:01.820> to<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.300> analog<00:05:02.870> stick<00:05:03.260> to<00:05:03.560> actually

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
opposed to the analog stick to actually

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.680 
opposed to the analog stick to actually
move<00:05:04.520> around<00:05:04.640> the<00:05:04.910> character<00:05:05.330> just<00:05:05.510> seems

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
move around the character just seems

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.540 
move around the character just seems
more<00:05:05.960> appropriate<00:05:06.080> and<00:05:06.710> again<00:05:06.950> it<00:05:07.400> just

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
more appropriate and again it just

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.670 
more appropriate and again it just
reminds<00:05:07.880> that<00:05:08.030> old<00:05:08.450> school<00:05:08.900> type<00:05:09.140> gameplay

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
reminds that old school type gameplay

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.100 
reminds that old school type gameplay

example we have Nova 3 here and it's

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.360 
example we have Nova 3 here and it's
just<00:05:23.420> great<00:05:23.870> because<00:05:24.110> unlike<00:05:24.800> before<00:05:24.920> we've

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
just great because unlike before we've

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.830 
just great because unlike before we've
relied<00:05:25.640> on<00:05:25.700> touch<00:05:26.000> controls<00:05:26.450> we<00:05:26.780> were

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
relied on touch controls we were

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.990 
relied on touch controls we were
basically<00:05:27.140> covering<00:05:27.770> up<00:05:27.920> our<00:05:28.310> field<00:05:28.610> of<00:05:28.730> view

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
basically covering up our field of view

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.210 
basically covering up our field of view
but<00:05:29.060> with<00:05:29.390> this<00:05:29.660> we<00:05:30.560> have<00:05:30.740> the<00:05:30.860> entire

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
but with this we have the entire

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.400 
but with this we have the entire
interface<00:05:31.610> you<00:05:32.060> know<00:05:32.120> available<00:05:32.720> to<00:05:32.930> us<00:05:33.140> and

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
interface you know available to us and

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.200 
interface you know available to us and
of<00:05:33.920> course<00:05:33.950> with<00:05:34.370> the<00:05:34.490> dual<00:05:34.700> analog<00:05:34.940> sticks

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
of course with the dual analog sticks

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.720 
of course with the dual analog sticks
it's<00:05:35.780> just<00:05:36.080> great<00:05:36.410> just<00:05:36.860> because<00:05:37.160> we're<00:05:37.460> able

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
it's just great just because we're able

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.780 
it's just great just because we're able
to<00:05:37.940> maneuver<00:05:38.840> around<00:05:39.020> a<00:05:39.470> character<00:05:39.740> with<00:05:40.340> ease

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
to maneuver around a character with ease

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.270 
to maneuver around a character with ease
and<00:05:41.120> it's<00:05:41.510> just<00:05:41.750> more<00:05:42.050> deal<00:05:42.260> and<00:05:42.500> very<00:05:42.530> similar

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
and it's just more deal and very similar

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.640 
and it's just more deal and very similar
to<00:05:43.550> what<00:05:43.820> we<00:05:43.910> find<00:05:44.150> with<00:05:44.450> a<00:05:44.930> traditional<00:05:45.500> home

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
to what we find with a traditional home

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.700 
to what we find with a traditional home
console<00:05:46.540> so<00:05:47.540> just<00:05:47.780> like<00:05:47.990> the<00:05:48.680> other

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
console so just like the other

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.659 
console so just like the other
first-person<00:05:49.220> shooter<00:05:49.910> a<00:05:49.940> dead<00:05:50.690> trigger<00:05:50.960> also

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
first-person shooter a dead trigger also

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.640 
first-person shooter a dead trigger also
benefits<00:05:52.669> with<00:05:52.970> the<00:05:53.270> Moga<00:05:53.870> pro<00:05:53.900> controller

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
just because we're able to actually use

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:58.840 
just because we're able to actually use
one<00:05:57.470> button<00:05:57.710> to<00:05:57.860> move<00:05:58.100> around<00:05:58.400> and<00:05:58.640> the<00:05:58.730> other

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
one button to move around and the other

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
shoulder triggers the analog shoulder

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.409 
shoulder triggers the analog shoulder
buttons<00:06:03.860> it's<00:06:04.610> great<00:06:04.820> because<00:06:04.970> you<00:06:05.150> could<00:06:05.270> use

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
buttons it's great because you could use

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.450
