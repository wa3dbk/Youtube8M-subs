organic and I'm going to give that a
spin<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.580> see<00:03:59.790> how<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.060> turns<00:04:00.330> out

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.900

so you really want to get a dense sticky

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.520 
so you really want to get a dense sticky
texture<00:04:15.300> so<00:04:15.600> that<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.870> ingredients<00:04:16.350> are<00:04:16.440> all

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
texture so that the ingredients are all

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.120 
texture so that the ingredients are all
sticking<00:04:16.980> together<00:04:17.130> like<00:04:17.549> that<00:04:18.829> so<00:04:19.829> you<00:04:19.980> can

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
sticking together like that so you can

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.900 
sticking together like that so you can
see<00:04:20.310> that<00:04:20.489> it's<00:04:21.420> a<00:04:21.510> really<00:04:22.070> incredible<00:04:23.070> kind

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910

the<00:05:27.330> freezer<00:05:27.630> for<00:05:28.080> about<00:05:28.200> I<00:05:28.530> would<00:05:28.680> say<00:05:28.830> maybe

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
the freezer for about I would say maybe

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.370
