 bill and I come with this video tutorial 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.210
 about the play ground which consists of 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.240
 Easy way is a game of poker with 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.380
 all the characters that are in anime 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.710
 spirits 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.590
 there is not a different function that right now 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.980
 I'll explain it to you first it's in 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.849
 events that are clear we have for 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:35.820
 get the points and redeem them 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:39.510

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.440
 this item that allows us to get what 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.950
 that is being garbage is a fruit of 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.950
 Devil 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.310
 and then it's being a skiff 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.650
 then the treasure items 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.690
 then we also have if to glass that 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.410
 is to go this is very necessary for 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.750
 transmit the attributes of an element 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.580
 treasure to another for example if you get 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.250
 very good ones and you do not want to lose them 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:14.800
 get it this not that 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.800
 let's participate once 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.070
 well now let's click on match 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.350
 We are going to send a random opponent 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.270
 I am not ready 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.270
 we are waiting here 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.640
 Reply in 10 seconds 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.640
 Oh 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.640
 8 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:57.590
 it is ready we are going to appear 5 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.950
 letters in the center and two letters that are 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.030
 Yours that you read them you have to use 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.070
 now 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.740
 you're going to do a combination of 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.050
 formation with those five letters and the 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.940
 two letters that you have we have what 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.190
 they are being 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.350
 the hit that I think is a 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.910
 contribution to improve certain 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:22.780
 characteristics of the blues 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.860
 that here is what you want to bet what 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.080
 that does not post 25 I'll confirm ready already 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.590
 I have 225 right now I explain the 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.520
 next part is up to the opponent 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.520
 make your bet 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:41.560
 call it return open if I'm already 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:45.790
 agree or I'll bet everything and more 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.190
 risk or hip hop that is being for 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.220
 get out and retire and the points the 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.970
 you lose so I'm going to bet other 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.970
 25 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.750
 oops 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.480
 uff 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.480
 then I will bet another 25 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.500
 I click on open 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.190
 I will not bet gold 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.380
 in itself it is complicated 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.050
 I'm going to put a support because I'm going to 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.440
 need 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.800
 and I think that our training is not 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.800
 I like it 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.730
 you do your training and we 're going to fight 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:32.249
 good here shows us combat many 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:36.049
 it will affect them not to know 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:39.599
 characters that you have not used but I 

00:04:36.049 --> 00:04:42.329
 now if it takes you the opposite it's going to 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:45.899
 see how they work and see if it suits you 

00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:48.989
 and then put them so right now 

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:52.999
 I show you combat to see how it went 

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:52.999
 nothing else I try 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.550
 Now I'm seeing that I'm going 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.090
 of the scrubbing but but it's not 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.090
 answering 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:55.200
 in the moment as we start right now 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:59.610
 I'm finishing well who knows how 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.610
 I finished it looks like I'm going to win 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:05.650
 everything looks like I'm winning is going 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.400
 best 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:12.460
 and let's make me think I was going to lose 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:16.680
 well we give you click shows us that 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.680
 we won 275 points 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.710
 and that's all ready, friends, see you later
