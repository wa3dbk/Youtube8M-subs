00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.430
 very good to all friends of 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.870
 youtube how are you here one more day 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.780
 as always your friend brad pitt or 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.810
 commenting on one of the ones that has come out 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.470
 new fifa 15 trailer yesterday or before 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:18.259
 yesterday came agility and control of fifa 15 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.869
 and the truth is that it's pretty good 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:23.749
 but I've seen a part of the video 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.179
 this video that is pure gameplay and 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:30.349
 I really do not notice too many differences 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:32.119
 in regards to fifa 14 it's worth so 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.000
 that I could see that little piece that 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.070
 that drives month if the ball is going to let 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.960
 the video in the description of the trailer and 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.180
 the truth has not observed too many 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.860
 differences not but but apart from this 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.500
 in this new fifa trailer 15 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.660
 basically focuses on showing a 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.330
 greater agility and a much more detail 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.400
 polished in the struggle for possession of 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.920
 value on the other hand friends is said to 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.630
 a new system of physics of the ball 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.140
 add a greater variety of 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.930
 movements when a pass is made 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.610
 so the spherical will show a 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.280
 much more behavior 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.500
 aspect that is nothing unusual in a 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.960
 sports simulator like fifa whose 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.610
 trend is always to offer a scheme 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.510
 of improved play in all its 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.210
 modalities 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.240
 year after year she in this case 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.710
 shows the progress of fifa 15 in the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.530
 movement mostly of the players 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.160
 what provides a superior level of 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.690
 response and fluency to the gameplay a 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.630
 new physics system on the ball 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.780
 Add more variety to the passes and 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.110
 control of it generating more turns 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.100
 precise in this new feef in order to 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.310
 intercept other players too 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.310
 is rated as more rewarding and 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.440
 physical than previous games with 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.220
 new traction push effects 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.410
 mechanical and physical fall while 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.840
 It is also visible when the shirts 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.270
 they are thus caught for example so 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.740
 friends, what do you think about this new trailer? 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.680
 from fifa 15 the truth that they have already taken 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.960
 a few and I think that fifa does not fear 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.479
 to nothing I do not know to know you have a game 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.210
 solid and that's why they are showing trailer 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.310
 after trailer no and good friends 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.560
 I hope you liked this video , 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.700
 he really paints very well he 's here patient 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.490
 it really looks great but I think 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.530
 it's a continuation of fruit 14 with 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.020
 Improved things obviously not with 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.420
 new and good things and overweight 2015 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.250
 Well I do not have much to say yet 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.010
 because almost nothing has come out 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.660
 No news like that has left news 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.380
 but he has not left always he has not left 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.020
 of trailer let's hope that shortly 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.530
 we can already see a trailer in conditions 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.050
 not a good trailer 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.970
 where they show us the positive things 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.560
 of the game all the news and so on 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.390
 it's not what we all want 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.130
 so nothing friends for this has been 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.900
 I hope we liked the video 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.240
 Comment subscribe if you want to be at 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.580
 day of both fifa 15 and of page 2015 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.100
 lay the video support it for more 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.660
 information and nothing we see in a
