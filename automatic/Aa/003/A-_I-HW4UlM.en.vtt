00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.569 

Oh<00:01:07.630> separate<00:01:08.630> controllers<00:01:08.990> down<00:01:09.110> here<00:01:09.170> me

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
Oh separate controllers down here me

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:14.200 
Oh separate controllers down here me

access<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:14.780> garage<00:01:15.170> level<00:01:15.470> -<00:01:18.040> that's<00:01:19.040> grammar

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
access to garage level - that's grammar

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.660 
access to garage level - that's grammar
okay<00:01:20.869> it's<00:01:21.380> just<00:01:21.590> a<00:01:21.710> spare<00:01:21.950> button<00:01:22.280> where<00:01:22.640> you

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
okay it's just a spare button where you

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.499 
okay it's just a spare button where you
should<00:01:23.090> be<00:01:23.590> -<00:01:24.909> this<00:01:25.909> is<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.090> new<00:01:26.240> tower

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
should be - this is the new tower

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.070 
should be - this is the new tower
believe<00:01:26.899> that<00:01:27.140> I<00:01:27.170> would<00:01:27.320> have<00:01:27.439> built<00:01:27.530> it<00:01:29.080> they

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
believe that I would have built it they

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.760 
believe that I would have built it they
had<00:01:30.229> to<00:01:30.380> retrofit<00:01:30.560> in<00:01:31.070> between<00:01:31.520> you<00:01:32.000> know<00:01:32.770> I'll

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
had to retrofit in between you know I'll

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.469 
had to retrofit in between you know I'll
let<00:01:33.860> you<00:01:33.979> take<00:01:34.159> that<00:01:34.189> space<00:01:34.580> there's<00:01:35.270> a<00:01:35.330> pretty

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
let you take that space there's a pretty

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.090 
let you take that space there's a pretty
stupid<00:01:35.840> though<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.259> other<00:01:36.439> setup

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
stupid though the other setup

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.609 
stupid though the other setup
yeah<00:01:37.369> and<00:01:37.789> the<00:01:38.630> foundation<00:01:39.140> call<00:01:39.380> them<00:01:39.530> in

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
yeah and the foundation call them in

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.680 
yeah and the foundation call them in
between

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.290 

here<00:01:45.260> the<00:01:45.410> machine

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
here the machine

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.130 
here the machine
actually<00:01:48.170> if<00:01:48.320> we<00:01:48.470> want<00:01:48.680> to<00:01:48.740> switch<00:01:49.610> we<00:01:50.120> need<00:01:50.570> to

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
actually if we want to switch we need to

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.650 
actually if we want to switch we need to
so<00:01:51.680> second<00:01:52.490> floor<00:01:52.700> yeah<00:01:53.120> so<00:01:53.270> we<00:01:53.450> have<00:01:53.540> to

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
so second floor yeah so we have to

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.990 
so second floor yeah so we have to
switch<00:01:53.840> elevators<00:01:54.310> one<00:01:55.310> keep<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.640> rolling

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
switch elevators one keep it rolling

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
switch elevators one keep it rolling
sure<00:01:57.130> yeah<00:01:58.130> okay

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
sure yeah okay

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.560 
sure yeah okay
it's<00:02:00.260> a<00:02:00.350> crazy<00:02:00.770> yeah<00:02:03.790> please<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:04.970> twos<00:02:05.270> I

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
it's a crazy yeah please you twos I

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.420 
it's a crazy yeah please you twos I
think<00:02:06.320> so<00:02:07.270> so<00:02:08.270> now<00:02:08.420> there<00:02:08.570> are<00:02:08.690> controllers

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
think so so now there are controllers

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.940 
think so so now there are controllers
and<00:02:10.430> here<00:02:10.880> understand<00:02:11.300> I<00:02:11.420> guess<00:02:11.690> I<00:02:11.960> guess<00:02:12.500> this

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
and here understand I guess I guess this

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.240 
and here understand I guess I guess this
button<00:02:13.370> will<00:02:13.550> call<00:02:14.500> but<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:15.650> one<00:02:15.830> serves<00:02:16.040> all

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
button will call but this one serves all

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.740 
button will call but this one serves all
the<00:02:16.340> floors<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:16.760> one's<00:02:16.940> missing<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.390> floor<00:02:17.600> so

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
the floors that one's missing a floor so

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.240 
the floors that one's missing a floor so
I<00:02:17.780> guess<00:02:17.930> Winton<00:02:18.230> doubted<00:02:18.560> this<00:02:18.650> ones<00:02:18.890> here

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
I guess Winton doubted this ones here

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:37.030 
I guess Winton doubted this ones here
and<00:02:19.850> let<00:02:20.060> you<00:02:20.150> take<00:02:35.260> these<00:02:36.260> are<00:02:36.380> nice<00:02:36.530> though

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
and let you take these are nice though

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.270 
and let you take these are nice though
very<00:02:37.580> nice<00:02:40.750> let's<00:02:41.750> see<00:02:41.870> there's<00:02:42.080> a<00:02:42.280> mystery

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
very nice let's see there's a mystery

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:55.720 
very nice let's see there's a mystery
floor<00:02:46.600> with<00:02:47.600> construction

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.600 

yes<00:02:56.240> that's<00:02:56.450> it
