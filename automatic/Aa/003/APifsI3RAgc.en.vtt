00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
thinking it's a Scruggs I think it's

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.759 
thinking it's a Scruggs I think it's
that<00:04:10.150> exfoliating<00:04:10.989> it<00:04:11.139> sounds<00:04:11.440> like<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:11.739> just

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
that exfoliating it sounds like you just

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.210 
that exfoliating it sounds like you just
apply<00:04:12.639> it<00:04:12.730> like<00:04:13.090> a<00:04:13.120> normal<00:04:13.359> face<00:04:13.720> mask<00:04:14.079> and<00:04:14.440> I'm

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
apply it like a normal face mask and I'm

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.580 
apply it like a normal face mask and I'm
guessing<00:04:15.760> let<00:04:15.940> it<00:04:16.060> dry<00:04:16.329> for<00:04:16.720> 10<00:04:17.169> minutes<00:04:17.380> and

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
guessing let it dry for 10 minutes and

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.680 
guessing let it dry for 10 minutes and
