because they're not my kids I I

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.040 
because they're not my kids I I
understand<00:00:45.820> what<00:00:45.940> you're<00:00:46.059> doing<00:00:46.300> or<00:00:46.899> what

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
understand what you're doing or what

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.020 
understand what you're doing or what
you'd<00:00:47.140> like<00:00:47.260> to<00:00:47.410> do<00:00:47.559> and<00:00:47.829> on<00:00:48.190> some<00:00:48.399> level<00:00:48.430> I

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
you'd like to do and on some level I

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
whether or not they're real and that is

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.109 
whether or not they're real and that is

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
completely honest it's not underhanded

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.150 
completely honest it's not underhanded
it<00:01:10.240> helps<00:01:10.509> them<00:01:10.690> deal<00:01:10.869> with<00:01:10.990> life<00:01:11.200> and<00:01:11.440> you

kind<00:01:12.369> of<00:01:12.429> gotta<00:01:12.580> trust<00:01:12.850> that<00:01:13.090> eventually<00:01:13.390> once

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
kind of gotta trust that eventually once

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.719 
kind of gotta trust that eventually once
they<00:01:14.590> start<00:01:14.890> putting<00:01:15.130> their<00:01:15.340> critical

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
thinking skills to use and find out how

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.240 
thinking skills to use and find out how
reliable<00:01:19.479> they<00:01:19.659> are<00:01:19.869> once<00:01:20.409> they've<00:01:20.650> dispensed

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
reliable they are once they've dispensed

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.590

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
Bunny etc that there's a strong

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.070 
Bunny etc that there's a strong
possibility<00:01:24.759> that<00:01:25.240> they<00:01:25.479> may<00:01:25.630> be<00:01:25.689> able<00:01:25.990> to

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
possibility that they may be able to

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.870 
possibility that they may be able to
