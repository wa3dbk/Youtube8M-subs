00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.260
 But 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.260
 But 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:22.070
 Sell 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.800
 When I came to oil in a short term, I knew what it all meant 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.390
 It was 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.849
 It's really about spending time when there is no longer 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.109
 Expressed the stone of Japan 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.969
 It gets darker because 99.8% is fired or not 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.620
 It is serious 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.690
 It is more than just not being able to live as rich as you are now 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.800
 In the worst case, we will be told that our lives will not come 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.380
 Mr. Nukaga struggled with the country's civil war on the air for two minutes 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.910
 is not it 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.679
 But one in the Middle East has appeared 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:55.069
 Japan is more enviable gui base cargo is water 

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:56.640
 I was told that there is abundant 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.320
 8 days sent out 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.930
 Yamazaki Nao Cola has an objection to the result in the voice of approaching men 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:02.620
 Man 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.250
 The thing that is actually abundant was reproduced without understanding 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.250
 But if you are walking with a scarce point and maybe 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.750
 I think that there is no new water in the green waterfront 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.310
 Because water is the origin of life 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.670
 Really 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.460
 About twenty-five years ago 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.150
 It is said that life was born from the sea 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.619
 Our bodies are also up to 60% water 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.010
 First statement 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.010
 The somatic cell that I was born in the sea 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.380
 I floated in the water of the sea from 15 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.930
 Our cells are initially supervised by blood vessels and lymph vessels 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.360
 I would like to do the best set of Mizuno 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.130
 Long time ago 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.880
 The statement is floating in the water, it is important to continue 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.910
 What 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.670
 It means close to our sea area 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.140
 In order to maintain the same health as others 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.670
 That's why
