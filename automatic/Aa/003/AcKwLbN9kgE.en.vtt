00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:01.170 
we'll show you just a little trick with

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.820 
we'll show you just a little trick with
the<00:00:01.410> m9<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:02.010> lot<00:00:02.610> of<00:00:02.700> people<00:00:03.470> have<00:00:04.470> problems

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
the m9 a lot of people have problems

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.179 
the m9 a lot of people have problems
with<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.370> fact<00:00:05.640> that<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:06.210> looper<00:00:07.189> when

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
with the fact that the looper when

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.440 
with the fact that the looper when
you're<00:00:08.309> in<00:00:08.400> looper<00:00:08.670> mode<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:09.000> have<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.210> go<00:00:09.330> out

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
you're in looper mode you have to go out

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.379 
you're in looper mode you have to go out
of<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.840> turn<00:00:10.139> on<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.500> off<00:00:10.590> effects<00:00:11.389> but

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
of it to turn on and off effects but

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.020 
of it to turn on and off effects but
there<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> little<00:00:12.840> trick<00:00:13.230> around<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.040> what's

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
there is a little trick around it what's

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.220 
there is a little trick around it what's
your<00:00:15.120> trick<00:00:15.269> if<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.509> know<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.719> unit<00:00:15.990> but

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
your trick if you know the unit but

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.200 
your trick if you know the unit but
because<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.130> can<00:00:17.279> use<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.550> expression<00:00:17.850> pedals

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
because you can use to expression pedals

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.179 
because you can use to expression pedals
with<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.390> unit<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:19.380> basically<00:00:19.740> right<00:00:19.949> now<00:00:19.980> I'm

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
with the unit so basically right now I'm

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.529 
with the unit so basically right now I'm
in<00:00:20.310> blue<00:00:20.460> promote<00:00:20.760> but<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:20.970> have<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.150> delay<00:00:21.510> on

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
in blue promote but I have a delay on

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.420 
in blue promote but I have a delay on
and<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.800> have<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> drive<00:00:23.189> on<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:23.730> I'm<00:00:23.820> clean

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
and I have a drive on but I'm clean

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.810 
and I have a drive on but I'm clean
because<00:00:26.430> both<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.699> expression<00:00:27.300> settings<00:00:27.630> are

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
because both the expression settings are

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.440 
because both the expression settings are
too<00:00:29.820> kind<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.420> bypass<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.900> effect<00:00:31.730> i<00:00:32.730> only

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
too kind of bypass the effect i only

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.060 
too kind of bypass the effect i only
have<00:00:33.570> one<00:00:33.719> expression<00:00:34.020> pedal<00:00:34.559> X<00:00:34.710> right<00:00:34.860> now

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
have one expression pedal X right now

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.220 
have one expression pedal X right now
the<00:00:35.130> other<00:00:35.250> one's<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.489> knob<00:00:35.840> so<00:00:36.840> you're<00:00:37.110> gonna

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
the other one's a knob so you're gonna

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.280 
the other one's a knob so you're gonna
see<00:00:37.440> me<00:00:37.530> twisted<00:00:37.829> with<00:00:37.920> my<00:00:38.010> hand<00:00:38.600> but<00:00:39.600> keep<00:00:40.200> in

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
see me twisted with my hand but keep in

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.810 
see me twisted with my hand but keep in
mind<00:00:40.350> if<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.680> had<00:00:40.829> two<00:00:41.070> foot<00:00:41.370> expression

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
mind if you had two foot expression

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.119 
mind if you had two foot expression
pedals<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.780> would<00:00:42.899> be<00:00:42.989> doing<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.379> very

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
pedals you would be doing this very

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.700 
pedals you would be doing this very
quickly<00:00:44.550> without<00:00:45.090> your<00:00:45.360> hands<00:00:45.690> without<00:00:46.350> going

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
quickly without your hands without going

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.920 
quickly without your hands without going
out<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.039> loop<00:00:47.190> remote<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:48.480> I'm<00:00:48.719> going<00:00:48.870> to

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
out of the loop remote so I'm going to

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.229 
out of the loop remote so I'm going to
basically<00:00:49.140> do<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> couple<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.860> settings<00:00:50.239> just

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
basically do a couple of settings just

00:00:51.239 --> 00:01:04.759 
basically do a couple of settings just
kind<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.539> right<00:00:52.440> here<00:00:52.620> for<00:00:52.770> you

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:59.310 

you

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:33.480 

you

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:51.530 

Oh

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:08.660 

Oh

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670
