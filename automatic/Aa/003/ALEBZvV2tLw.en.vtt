00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
and here I am demonstrating the tones

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.600 
and here I am demonstrating the tones
available<00:00:07.140> from<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.470> brand<00:00:07.770> new<00:00:07.980> diesel

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
available from the brand new diesel

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.870 
available from the brand new diesel
Haugen<00:00:09.360> amplifier<00:00:09.990> now<00:00:10.580> you<00:00:11.580> look<00:00:11.730> at<00:00:11.820> the

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
Haugen amplifier now you look at the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.490 
Haugen amplifier now you look at the
front<00:00:12.120> panel<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.750> looks<00:00:12.929> quite<00:00:13.139> scary

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
front panel and it looks quite scary

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.959 
front panel and it looks quite scary
because<00:00:13.679> there<00:00:13.889> are<00:00:13.980> lots<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.250> controls<00:00:14.639> going

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
because there are lots of controls going

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.000 
because there are lots of controls going
on<00:00:15.089> but<00:00:15.240> it's<00:00:15.360> very<00:00:15.420> simply<00:00:15.990> laid<00:00:16.170> out<00:00:16.379> so

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
on but it's very simply laid out so

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.710 
on but it's very simply laid out so
we've<00:00:17.160> got<00:00:17.310> four<00:00:17.580> channels<00:00:18.060> we've<00:00:18.630> got

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
we've got four channels we've got

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.150 
we've got four channels we've got
channel<00:00:19.080> one<00:00:19.230> which<00:00:19.470> goes<00:00:19.650> across<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.130> top

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
channel one which goes across the top

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.310 
channel one which goes across the top
here<00:00:20.550> which<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.850> our<00:00:20.970> clean<00:00:21.210> channel<00:00:21.600> channel

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
here which is our clean channel channel

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.500 
here which is our clean channel channel
2<00:00:22.560> crunch<00:00:23.340> which<00:00:23.550> goes<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:24.240> underneath

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
2 crunch which goes just underneath

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.140 
2 crunch which goes just underneath
channel<00:00:25.410> 3<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.189> mega<00:00:26.460> channel<00:00:26.789> and

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
channel 3 is the mega channel and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.060 
channel 3 is the mega channel and
channel<00:00:27.510> 4<00:00:27.779> runs<00:00:28.170> across<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.650> bottom<00:00:28.800> and

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
channel 4 runs across the bottom and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.550 
channel 4 runs across the bottom and
that's<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.460> lead<00:00:29.760> channel<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.869> very<00:00:31.109> simple

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
that's the lead channel so very simple

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.950 
that's the lead channel so very simple
and<00:00:31.859> then<00:00:32.520> there<00:00:32.940> are<00:00:33.030> four<00:00:33.300> toggle<00:00:33.719> switches

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
and then there are four toggle switches

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.750 
and then there are four toggle switches
here<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.440> toggle<00:00:34.649> between<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.730> different

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
here to toggle between the different

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.130 
here to toggle between the different
channels<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.540> don't<00:00:36.719> have<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> foot

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
channels if you don't have the foot

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.400 
channels if you don't have the foot
switch<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.680> we've<00:00:37.800> got<00:00:37.920> channel<00:00:38.250> 1<00:00:38.809> 2<00:00:39.809> 3<00:00:40.800> &amp;<00:00:41.280> 4

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
switch so we've got channel 1 2 3 &amp; 4

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.020 
switch so we've got channel 1 2 3 &amp; 4
and<00:00:43.410> then<00:00:43.620> over<00:00:44.040> here<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> master

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
and then over here we have the master

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.150 
and then over here we have the master
section<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.050> master<00:00:46.500> deep<00:00:46.710> control

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
section we have a master deep control

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.700 
section we have a master deep control
and<00:00:47.370> presence<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.539> then<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> master<00:00:49.350> 2

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
and presence and then we have a master 2

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.680 
and presence and then we have a master 2
which<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.280> engage<00:00:50.399> for<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> volume<00:00:51.480> boost

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
which you can engage for a volume boost

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.420 
which you can engage for a volume boost
for<00:00:52.020> your<00:00:52.170> solos<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.770> things<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:53.190> that

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
for your solos and things like that

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.860 
for your solos and things like that
and<00:00:53.579> then<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.210> an<00:00:54.300> overall<00:00:54.539> master

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
and then we have an overall master

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.160 
and then we have an overall master
volume<00:00:55.469> 1<00:00:56.120> we<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> standby<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.050> off

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
volume 1 we have a standby and off

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.290 
volume 1 we have a standby and off
switch<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.739> under<00:00:58.949> here<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.399> also<00:00:59.550> have<00:00:59.789> some

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
switch and under here we also have some

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.660 
switch and under here we also have some
more<00:01:00.449> toggle<00:01:00.780> switches<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.829> one<00:01:02.070> activates

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
more toggle switches this one activates

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.149 
more toggle switches this one activates
the<00:01:03.059> master<00:01:03.629> 2<00:01:03.780> section<00:01:04.290> we've<00:01:04.650> got<00:01:04.830> one<00:01:05.010> to

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
the master 2 section we've got one to

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.160 
the master 2 section we've got one to
activate<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.729> effects<00:01:06.030> loop<00:01:06.240> we've<00:01:06.930> got<00:01:07.049> our

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
activate the effects loop we've got our

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.230 
activate the effects loop we've got our
mute<00:01:07.350> control<00:01:07.830> which<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.549> very<00:01:08.729> useful<00:01:08.939> and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
mute control which is very useful and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.700 
mute control which is very useful and
when<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:09.510> goes<00:01:09.659> into<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.080> mode<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
when there goes into that mode the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.230 
when there goes into that mode the
lights<00:01:10.979> are<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.280> flashing<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.880> let<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.090> know

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
lights are just flashing to let you know

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.760 
lights are just flashing to let you know
that<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.659> mute<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.200> take<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.470> off<00:01:13.590> you

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
that it's on mute and to take it off you

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.830 
that it's on mute and to take it off you
just<00:01:13.799> flick<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.250> switch<00:01:14.460> again<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.000> lastly

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
just flick that switch again and lastly

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.130 
just flick that switch again and lastly
we<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> store<00:01:16.880> switch<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.750> if<00:01:18.990> you're

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
we have a store switch so if you're

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.289 
we have a store switch so if you're
using<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.920> midi<00:01:20.100> foot<00:01:20.369> control<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.150> want

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
using the midi foot control and you want

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.330 
using the midi foot control and you want
to<00:01:21.420> store<00:01:21.630> some<00:01:21.869> certain<00:01:22.650> presets<00:01:23.130> when

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
to store some certain presets when

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.609 
to store some certain presets when
you're<00:01:23.460> using<00:01:23.780> context<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.020> conjunction<00:01:25.409> with

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
you're using context in conjunction with

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.499 
you're using context in conjunction with
the<00:01:25.830> amplifier<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:27.060> create<00:01:27.299> your

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
the amplifier you can create your

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.660 
the amplifier you can create your
patches<00:01:27.990> by<00:01:28.409> doing<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.009> long<00:01:29.250> with<00:01:29.490> what's

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
patches by doing that long with what's

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.899 
patches by doing that long with what's
going<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.329> back<00:01:30.479> panel<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:32.070> I'm<00:01:32.759> not

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
going on on the back panel so I'm not

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.280 
going on on the back panel so I'm not
going<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.150> bore<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.479> with<00:01:33.509> too<00:01:33.780> much<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.079> the
