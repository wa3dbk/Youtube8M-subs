00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.920 
like that and the chopper since we've
gotten<00:01:42.090> everything<00:01:42.240> else<00:01:42.479> out<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> way

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
gotten everything else out of the way

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.190 
gotten everything else out of the way
the<00:01:43.380> chopper<00:01:43.710> itself<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.670> fuselage<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.659> very

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
the chopper itself the fuselage is very

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.560 
the chopper itself the fuselage is very
well<00:01:46.470> built<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:47.189> very<00:01:47.790> very<00:01:48.210> very<00:01:48.420> tough<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
well built it's very very very tough and

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.880 
well built it's very very very tough and
assembly<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.630> very<00:01:51.930> simple<00:01:52.409> all<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.649> have<00:01:52.680> to

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
assembly is very simple all you have to

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.670 
assembly is very simple all you have to
do<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.280> push<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.030> little<00:01:54.210> thing<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.750> push<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
do is push this little thing in push the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.660 
do is push this little thing in push the
rotor<00:01:56.270> rotor<00:01:57.270> folder<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.460> attach<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
rotor rotor folder in and attach the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.569 
rotor rotor folder in and attach the
rotors<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.869> my<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.409> problem<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.250> mate

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
rotors but my one problem like that mate

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.179 
rotors but my one problem like that mate
and<00:02:02.790> also<00:02:03.180> attach<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.930> rear<00:02:04.079> propeller<00:02:04.770> here

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
and also attach the rear propeller here

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.910 
and also attach the rear propeller here
but<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.719> may<00:02:06.899> have<00:02:06.990> been<00:02:07.079> my<00:02:07.320> fault<00:02:07.590> I'm

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
but and this may have been my fault I'm

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.139 
but and this may have been my fault I'm
not<00:02:08.129> sure<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.429> happened<00:02:08.700> with<00:02:08.819> all<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
not sure this happened with all the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.600 
not sure this happened with all the
shoppers<00:02:09.539> but<00:02:09.750> some<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.649> my<00:02:10.830> rotors<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.370> this

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
shoppers but some of my rotors on this

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.400 
shoppers but some of my rotors on this
particular<00:02:12.120> chopper

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
particular chopper

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.500

our meaning down and drooping out a
little<00:02:15.660> bit<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:15.870> I'm<00:02:16.230> not<00:02:16.350> sure<00:02:16.410> if<00:02:16.560> you'll

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
little bit so I'm not sure if you'll

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.010 
little bit so I'm not sure if you'll
hear<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.070> when<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.220> spins<00:02:17.640> they<00:02:18.570> hit<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
hear it when it spins they hit the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.350 
hear it when it spins they hit the
fuselage<00:02:19.560> which<00:02:19.800> slows<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.580> propellers<00:02:21.030> flat

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
fuselage which slows the propellers flat

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.840 
fuselage which slows the propellers flat
which<00:02:21.600> slows<00:02:22.170> rappel<00:02:22.500> down<00:02:22.710> slightly<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:23.820> not

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
which slows rappel down slightly but not

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.630 
which slows rappel down slightly but not
too<00:02:24.180> much<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.600> one<00:02:25.260> more<00:02:25.890> issue<00:02:26.070> with<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.490> I

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
too much and one more issue with it I

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.490 
too much and one more issue with it I
wanted<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.090> use<00:02:27.270> this<00:02:27.510> machine<00:02:27.780> gunner<00:02:28.170> like

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
wanted to use this machine gunner like

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.180 
wanted to use this machine gunner like
to<00:02:28.620> be<00:02:28.740> a<00:02:28.770> gutter

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
to be a gutter

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.670 
to be a gutter
in<00:02:30.030> one<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.270> my<00:02:30.330> movies<00:02:30.690> because<00:02:31.080> if<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.440> saw

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
in one of my movies because if you saw

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.740 
in one of my movies because if you saw
my<00:02:32.100> first<00:02:32.280> episode<00:02:32.490> of<00:02:32.700> world<00:02:33.030> war<00:02:33.180> P<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
my first episode of world war P the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.400 
my first episode of world war P the
unexpected<00:02:34.380> weapon<00:02:35.180> my<00:02:36.180> plan<00:02:36.480> was<00:02:36.810> initially

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
unexpected weapon my plan was initially

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.710 
unexpected weapon my plan was initially
to<00:02:37.560> have<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.860> tan<00:02:38.130> shoppers<00:02:38.670> swoop<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.300> and

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
to have the tan shoppers swoop in and

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.140 
to have the tan shoppers swoop in and
take<00:02:40.380> out<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.740> zombies<00:02:41.220> with<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.820> machine

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
take out the zombies with the machine

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.620 
take out the zombies with the machine
gunner<00:02:42.420> but<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.780> problem<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.640> that<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.940> move<00:02:45.480> it

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
gunner but the problem is that I move it

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.060 
gunner but the problem is that I move it
slightly<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.290> machine<00:02:46.530> gunner<00:02:46.770> falls

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
slightly and the machine gunner falls

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.120 
slightly and the machine gunner falls
back<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.570> have<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.110> get<00:02:49.230> him<00:02:49.350> out<00:02:49.470> make<00:02:49.980> him

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
back so I have to get him out make him

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.470 
back so I have to get him out make him
shoot<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.430> zombies<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:50.940> stuff<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:51.270> that

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
shoot the zombies and stuff like that

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.150 
shoot the zombies and stuff like that
but<00:02:51.990> I<00:02:52.200> mean<00:02:52.230> if<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.650> just<00:02:52.830> want<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.040> do<00:02:53.130> a

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
but I mean if you just want to do a

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.090 
but I mean if you just want to do a
flying<00:02:53.610> scene<00:02:54.060> that's<00:02:54.750> perfectly<00:02:55.230> fun<00:02:55.650> he'll

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
flying scene that's perfectly fun he'll

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.770 
flying scene that's perfectly fun he'll
stay<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.490> there<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:56.910> can<00:02:57.090> just<00:02:57.120> move<00:02:57.630> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
stay in there and you can just move the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.240 
stay in there and you can just move the
camera<00:02:57.900> slowly<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.590> he'll<00:02:58.740> stay<00:02:58.890> in<00:02:58.920> there

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
camera slowly and he'll stay in there

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.210 
camera slowly and he'll stay in there
but<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.240> know<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:01.320> guys<00:03:01.470> haven't<00:03:01.770> really<00:03:02.010> seen

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
but I know you guys haven't really seen

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.430 
but I know you guys haven't really seen
this<00:03:02.460> as<00:03:02.700> much<00:03:03.300> as<00:03:03.690> some<00:03:04.020> of<00:03:04.050> my<00:03:04.230> other<00:03:04.380> stuff

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
this as much as some of my other stuff

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.840 
this as much as some of my other stuff
such<00:03:04.920> as<00:03:05.060> tanks<00:03:06.060> or<00:03:06.360> man<00:03:06.870> or<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:08.220> gunship

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
such as tanks or man or the gunship

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.200 
such as tanks or man or the gunship
which<00:03:09.270> is<00:03:09.450> probably<00:03:09.750> displayed<00:03:10.110> up<00:03:10.260> there<00:03:10.530> or

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
which is probably displayed up there or

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.670 
which is probably displayed up there or
anything<00:03:12.210> else<00:03:12.450> like<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:12.960> but<00:03:13.350> this<00:03:13.620> is

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
anything else like that but this is

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.650 
anything else like that but this is
still<00:03:13.950> just<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.340> really<00:03:14.580> interesting<00:03:14.790> item<00:03:15.390> it

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
still just a really interesting item it

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.090 
still just a really interesting item it
costs<00:03:16.880> $26.40<00:03:17.880> uh<00:03:18.410> which<00:03:19.410> may<00:03:19.709> seem<00:03:19.770> a<00:03:19.980> little

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
costs $26.40 uh which may seem a little

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.820 
costs $26.40 uh which may seem a little
bit<00:03:20.280> pricey<00:03:20.459> but<00:03:20.730> in<00:03:21.270> my<00:03:21.480> opinion<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.140> think<00:03:22.170> it

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
bit pricey but in my opinion I think it

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.740 
bit pricey but in my opinion I think it
was<00:03:22.950> worth<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.459> may<00:03:23.580> just<00:03:23.880> be<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.060> dollar<00:03:24.390> to

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
was worth it it may just be a dollar to

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.050 
was worth it it may just be a dollar to
you<00:03:24.840> over<00:03:25.260> but<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.280> mean<00:03:26.490> you<00:03:26.760> can't<00:03:26.970> really

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
you over but I mean you can't really

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.660 
you over but I mean you can't really
complain<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.900> much<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:28.740> as<00:03:28.890> usual<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:29.430> will

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
complain that much and as usual I will
