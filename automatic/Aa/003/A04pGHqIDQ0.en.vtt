00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
acrylic and they put it on your nail now

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.149 
acrylic and they put it on your nail now
this<00:02:33.659> isn't<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.139> be<00:02:34.230> confused<00:02:34.769> with<00:02:34.829> hump

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
this isn't to be confused with hump

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.729 
this isn't to be confused with hump
nails<00:02:35.459> which<00:02:36.030> are<00:02:36.150> essentially<00:02:36.689> that<00:02:37.230> bubble

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
nails which are essentially that bubble

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.589 
nails which are essentially that bubble
thing<00:02:37.980> but<00:02:38.189> they're<00:02:38.340> longer<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.150> maybe

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
thing but they're longer and maybe

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.660 
thing but they're longer and maybe
pointy<00:02:40.170> or<00:02:40.290> square<00:02:40.620> but<00:02:40.859> that<00:02:40.889> guess<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.549> can

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
pointy or square but that guess that can

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.399 
pointy or square but that guess that can
happen<00:02:41.790> on<00:02:41.969> both<00:02:42.090> but<00:02:42.480> still<00:02:42.750> discuss<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
happen on both but still discuss the

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.890 
happen on both but still discuss the
long<00:02:43.739> ones<00:02:44.099> are<00:02:44.340> actually<00:02:44.909> better<00:02:45.239> for<00:02:45.659> you

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
long ones are actually better for you

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.890 
long ones are actually better for you
then<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.980> bubble<00:02:47.340> nails<00:02:47.549> because<00:02:48.359> the<00:02:48.540> bubble

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
then the bubble nails because the bubble

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.800 
then the bubble nails because the bubble
nails<00:02:49.109> where<00:02:49.319> they<00:02:49.379> have<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.739> put<00:02:49.889> the<00:02:50.069> acrylic

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
nails where they have to put the acrylic

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.259 
nails where they have to put the acrylic
that's<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:52.019> an<00:02:52.139> area<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.590> your<00:02:52.799> nail<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:54.000> adds

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
that's in an area of your nail that adds

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.990 
that's in an area of your nail that adds
stress<00:02:54.989> where<00:02:55.260> your<00:02:55.409> nail<00:02:55.620> bed<00:02:55.859> is<00:02:55.889> not<00:02:56.579> like

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
stress where your nail bed is not like

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.300 
stress where your nail bed is not like
built<00:02:57.419> to<00:02:57.629> handle<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.109> so<00:02:58.260> they<00:02:58.799> tell<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.189> you

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
built to handle it so they tell you you

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.039 
built to handle it so they tell you you
can<00:02:59.489> only<00:02:59.700> have<00:03:00.000> bubble<00:03:00.389> nails<00:03:00.569> for<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.900> while

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
can only have bubble nails for a while

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.319 
can only have bubble nails for a while
and<00:03:01.260> hopefully<00:03:01.769> that<00:03:02.310> amount<00:03:02.730> of<00:03:02.849> time<00:03:03.060> is

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
and hopefully that amount of time is

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.209 
and hopefully that amount of time is
just<00:03:03.359> as<00:03:03.750> long<00:03:03.900> as<00:03:04.109> hopefully<00:03:04.560> this<00:03:04.709> terrible

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:05.219 
just as long as hopefully this terrible

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:06.709 
just as long as hopefully this terrible
trend<00:03:05.519> will<00:03:05.730> last<00:03:05.849> the<00:03:06.120> worst<00:03:06.359> part<00:03:06.629> about

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:06.719 
trend will last the worst part about

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.720 
trend will last the worst part about
this<00:03:07.139> isn't<00:03:07.590> even<00:03:07.650> necessarily<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.579> they

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
this isn't even necessarily that they

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.640 
this isn't even necessarily that they
look<00:03:08.969> bad<00:03:09.239> it's<00:03:09.540> how<00:03:09.689> expensive<00:03:10.109> they<00:03:10.469> are

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650
