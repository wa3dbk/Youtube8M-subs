00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
think it's not something we tackle up

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.279 
think it's not something we tackle up
from<00:02:02.910> certainly<00:02:03.539> we<00:02:03.690> know<00:02:03.720> I'd<00:02:03.929> like<00:02:04.050> to<00:02:04.140> play

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:07.739 
today I think the pleasing thing is in

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:09.410 
today I think the pleasing thing is in
that<00:02:07.860> last<00:02:08.009> 5-10<00:02:08.489> minutes<00:02:08.789> with<00:02:08.970> customer

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
that last 5-10 minutes with customer

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.029 
that last 5-10 minutes with customer
becomes<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:09.869> our<00:02:09.959> life<00:02:10.200> anyway<00:02:10.530> all<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.920> and

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
know without being disrespectful thought

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.420 
know without being disrespectful thought
well<00:03:08.640> with<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.060> chase<00:03:09.629> missing<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.430> Owens

missing and you know we probably thought

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.900 
missing and you know we probably thought
well<00:03:13.560> if<00:03:13.620> we<00:03:13.739> can<00:03:13.890> score<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.190> few<00:03:14.519> then<00:03:14.730> we'll
