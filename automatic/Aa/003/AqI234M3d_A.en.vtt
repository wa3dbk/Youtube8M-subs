probably four or five six years old so
making<00:04:03.409> sure<00:04:03.620> that<00:04:03.799> the<00:04:03.949> elasticized<00:04:04.459> has

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
making sure that the elasticized has

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.280 
making sure that the elasticized has
worked<00:04:04.970> right<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.329> way<00:04:05.419> through<00:04:05.449> to<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.900> ends

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
worked right the way through to the ends

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.039 
worked right the way through to the ends
a<00:04:06.530> little<00:04:07.459> bit<00:04:07.609> goes<00:04:07.790> a<00:04:07.819> long<00:04:07.970> way<00:04:08.329> really<00:04:08.870> just

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
a little bit goes a long way really just

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.539 
a little bit goes a long way really just
a<00:04:09.169> small<00:04:09.319> scoop<00:04:09.859> on<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.129> ends<00:04:10.340> of<00:04:10.400> your

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
a small scoop on the ends of your

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.759 
a small scoop on the ends of your
fingers<00:04:10.909> obviously<00:04:11.870> if<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.049> hairs<00:04:12.260> thicker

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
fingers obviously if the hairs thicker

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.219 
fingers obviously if the hairs thicker
or<00:04:13.220> longer<00:04:13.659> you're<00:04:14.659> going<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.810> need<00:04:14.959> a<00:04:14.989> bit

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:15.229 
or longer you're going to need a bit

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:17.020 
or longer you're going to need a bit
more<00:04:15.260> product<00:04:15.680> but<00:04:16.010> i<00:04:16.130> think<00:04:16.459> if<00:04:16.609> your<00:04:16.760> hair's

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
more product but i think if your hair's

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.150 
more product but i think if your hair's
quite<00:04:17.450> wet<00:04:17.840> then<00:04:18.769> you

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
quite wet then you

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160 
quite wet then you
use<00:04:19.310> less<00:04:19.610> product<00:04:19.940> and<00:04:20.330> it<00:04:20.480> will<00:04:20.600> go<00:04:20.840> further

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
use less product and it will go further

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.120 
use less product and it will go further
so<00:04:21.920> don't<00:04:22.280> use<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.750> elasticized<00:04:23.750> on<00:04:24.200> dry<00:04:24.830> hair

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
so don't use the elasticized on dry hair

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.650 
so don't use the elasticized on dry hair
make<00:04:25.400> sure<00:04:25.430> really<00:04:25.790> the<00:04:25.940> hair<00:04:26.090> is<00:04:26.180> quite<00:04:26.330> wet

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
make sure really the hair is quite wet

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.170 
make sure really the hair is quite wet
and<00:04:27.050> work<00:04:27.620> it<00:04:27.770> all<00:04:27.890> the<00:04:28.010> way<00:04:28.100> through<00:04:28.130> even<00:04:29.090> if

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
and work it all the way through even if

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.400 
and work it all the way through even if
you<00:04:29.240> just<00:04:29.390> concentration<00:04:30.110> on<00:04:30.200> the<00:04:30.260> mid

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
you just concentration on the mid

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.630 
you just concentration on the mid
lengths<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:30.830> ends<00:04:30.980> that's<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.490> most

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
lengths and ends that's the most

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.270 
lengths and ends that's the most
important
