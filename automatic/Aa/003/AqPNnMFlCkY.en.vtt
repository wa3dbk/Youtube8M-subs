humbucker but it allows you to kind of

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.900 
humbucker but it allows you to kind of
find<00:00:34.290> your<00:00:34.380> place<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.740> a<00:00:34.980> band<00:00:35.250> mix<00:00:35.490> and<00:00:35.700> really

find your place in a band mix and really

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.970 
find your place in a band mix and really
cut<00:00:36.150> a<00:00:36.180> little<00:00:36.540> bit<00:00:36.660> better<00:00:36.840> you'll<00:00:37.740> see

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
cut a little bit better you'll see

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.020 
cut a little bit better you'll see
though<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.220> you're<00:00:38.730> not<00:00:38.760> really

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
though that you're not really

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.210 
though that you're not really
compromising<00:00:39.780> anything<00:00:39.990> because<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.680> 3/4

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
compromising anything because it's a 3/4

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.740 
compromising anything because it's a 3/4
size<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.970> still<00:00:42.240> a<00:00:42.270> hundred<00:00:42.660> percent

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
size it's still a hundred percent

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.590 
size it's still a hundred percent
humbucker<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.400> that<00:00:44.520> position<00:00:44.670> one<00:00:45.150> it's

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
humbucker so in that position one it's

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.170 
humbucker so in that position one it's
the<00:00:45.810> bridge<00:00:46.020> by<00:00:46.260> itself

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:00.920 

with<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.080> little<00:00:52.230> bit<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.470> overdrive

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.530 

if<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:01.890> go<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> position<00:01:02.400> number<00:01:02.580> two<00:01:03.030> that's

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
if we go to position number two that's

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.940 
if we go to position number two that's
going<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.810> give<00:01:03.960> us<00:01:04.050> some<00:01:04.200> splitting<00:01:04.559> options

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:04.950 
going to give us some splitting options

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.650 
going to give us some splitting options
it's<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.520> to<00:01:05.610> give<00:01:05.700> us<00:01:05.730> the<00:01:05.940> two<00:01:06.090> inside

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
it's going to give us the two inside

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.240 
it's going to give us the two inside
coils<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.260> these<00:01:07.380> humbuckers<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.040> it's<00:01:08.160> going

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
coils of these humbuckers but it's going

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.550 
coils of these humbuckers but it's going
to<00:01:08.340> wire<00:01:08.550> them<00:01:08.730> in<00:01:08.790> series<00:01:08.850> which<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.990> fat<00:01:10.350> and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
to wire them in series which is fat and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:33.340 
to wire them in series which is fat and
wooly

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.390 

position<00:01:34.350> number<00:01:34.560> three<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.010> going<00:01:35.190> to<00:01:35.250> give

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
position number three is going to give

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.950 
position number three is going to give
us<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.640> really<00:01:35.790> cool<00:01:36.060> switching<00:01:36.480> option<00:01:36.810> then

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
us a really cool switching option then

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.230 
us a really cool switching option then
it<00:01:37.050> gives<00:01:37.260> us<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.560> neck<00:01:37.800> on<00:01:38.010> full<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.090> also

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
it gives us the neck on full but it also

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.690 
it gives us the neck on full but it also
adds<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.930> inside<00:01:40.260> coil<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.770> bridge<00:01:41.070> now

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
adds the inside coil of the bridge now

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.400 
adds the inside coil of the bridge now
what's<00:01:41.880> unique<00:01:42.030> about<00:01:42.330> that<00:01:42.510> is<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.960> gives<00:01:42.990> us

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
now if we go to position number four

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.960 
now if we go to position number four
that's<00:02:05.620> going<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:05.950> give<00:02:06.130> us<00:02:06.250> these<00:02:06.400> two<00:02:06.640> inside

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
coils in parallel now now what's cool

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.680 
coils in parallel now now what's cool
about<00:02:09.100> parallel<00:02:09.670> wiring<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.149> it<00:02:10.270> really

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
about parallel wiring is it really

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.660 
about parallel wiring is it really
really<00:02:10.929> cleans<00:02:11.200> up<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.500> guitar<00:02:11.830> so<00:02:12.400> without

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
really cleans up the guitar so without

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.520 
really cleans up the guitar so without
any<00:02:12.820> overdrive<00:02:13.360> on<00:02:13.570> it<00:02:13.750> can<00:02:13.870> almost<00:02:14.080> give<00:02:14.410> you

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
any overdrive on it can almost give you

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.170 
any overdrive on it can almost give you
an<00:02:14.650> acoustic<00:02:15.100> sound<00:02:15.340> if<00:02:15.520> you<00:02:15.550> really<00:02:15.970> lean

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
an acoustic sound if you really lean

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:30.660 
an acoustic sound if you really lean
back<00:02:16.420> on<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.660> guitar

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.970 

and<00:02:31.870> finally<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.990> fifth<00:02:33.140> position<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.830> the
