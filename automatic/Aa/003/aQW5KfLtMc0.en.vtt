00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
ton of feet on the back so we got a

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:57.319 
ton of feet on the back so we got a
little<00:00:24.150> bit<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.420> weight

slow<00:01:01.110> down<00:01:01.370> because<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.579> trailer<00:01:03.149> gets<00:01:03.360> a

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450
