00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.180 

I<00:03:48.690> think<00:03:49.690> I<00:03:49.720> got<00:03:49.900> more<00:03:50.080> Therese<00:03:50.440> last<00:03:50.709> year<00:03:50.980> or

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
I think I got more Therese last year or

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.940 
I think I got more Therese last year or
yet<00:03:51.580> its<00:03:51.730> last<00:03:51.910> year<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:53.620> old<00:03:53.770> one

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
yet its last year and the old one

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.070 
yet its last year and the old one
trusted<00:03:54.459> me<00:03:54.610> more<00:03:54.640> running<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.180> ball<00:03:55.360> they

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
trusted me more running the ball they

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.360 
trusted me more running the ball they
knew<00:03:56.200> that<00:03:56.290> I<00:03:56.319> could<00:03:56.530> take<00:03:56.680> a<00:03:56.709> blow<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.220> I

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
knew that I could take a blow and I

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.680 
knew that I could take a blow and I
could<00:03:57.580> get<00:03:57.700> back<00:03:57.849> up<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.180> just<00:03:58.360> not<00:03:58.540> be

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
could get back up and just not be

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.809 
could get back up and just not be
another<00:03:58.900> speed<00:03:59.500> back<00:03:59.709> so<00:04:00.370> I<00:04:00.430> think<00:04:00.520> they'd

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
another speed back so I think they'd

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.670 
another speed back so I think they'd
mind<00:04:00.940> trusted<00:04:01.420> more<00:04:01.599> trusting<00:04:02.200> me<00:04:02.290> more<00:04:02.319> and

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
mind trusted more trusting me more and

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:15.099 
mind trusted more trusting me more and
so<00:04:02.830> they<00:04:02.920> block<00:04:03.099> better<00:04:03.370> for<00:04:03.519> me
