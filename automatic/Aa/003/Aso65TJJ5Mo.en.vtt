 tools to be effective in 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:05.040
 the work of the Lord has changed our

 way or at least my way of 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.610

 knowing more 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.600
 and the word approach is different 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.660
 and obviously it's different when you do not 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.140
