the pictures you don't need to explain

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.800 
the pictures you don't need to explain
this<00:03:29.440> but<00:03:29.680> they<00:03:29.829> do<00:03:29.889> so<00:03:30.880> it<00:03:30.970> makes<00:03:31.239> it<00:03:31.420> a<00:03:31.480> little

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
this but they do so it makes it a little

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.990 
this but they do so it makes it a little
off-putting<00:03:32.019> um<00:03:32.620> I<00:03:32.889> thought<00:03:33.099> the<00:03:33.250> only<00:03:33.609> reason

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
off-putting um I thought the only reason

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.030 
off-putting um I thought the only reason
they<00:03:34.209> could<00:03:34.510> be<00:03:34.660> doing<00:03:34.810> that<00:03:35.019> was<00:03:35.349> they<00:03:35.980> were

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
they could be doing that was they were

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.500 
they could be doing that was they were
trying<00:03:36.370> to<00:03:37.560> mimic<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.950> daily<00:03:39.459> planets<00:03:39.880> new<00:03:40.150> TV

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
trying to mimic the daily planets new TV

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.039 
trying to mimic the daily planets new TV
show<00:03:40.750> because<00:03:41.260> it's<00:03:41.500> also<00:03:41.650> narrating<00:03:42.489> as<00:03:42.730> well

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
show because it's also narrating as well

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.539 
show because it's also narrating as well
of<00:03:44.049> the<00:03:44.470> things<00:03:44.799> that<00:03:44.950> are<00:03:45.040> going<00:03:45.160> on<00:03:45.400> because

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
of the things that are going on because

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.069 
of the things that are going on because
they're<00:03:45.790> filming<00:03:46.000> Superman<00:03:46.540> in<00:03:46.720> this<00:03:46.840> news

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
they're filming Superman in this news

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.289 
they're filming Superman in this news
show<00:03:47.319> and<00:03:47.590> showing<00:03:48.280> it<00:03:48.370> live<00:03:48.549> to<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.000> people

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
show and showing it live to the people

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:50.370 
show and showing it live to the people
so<00:03:49.419> I<00:03:49.450> thought<00:03:49.690> maybe<00:03:49.870> they're<00:03:50.139> trying<00:03:50.349> to

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
so I thought maybe they're trying to

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.500 
so I thought maybe they're trying to
like<00:03:50.560> bring<00:03:51.069> in<00:03:51.190> an<00:03:51.310> aspect<00:03:51.760> of<00:03:51.970> like<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.150> news

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
like bring in an aspect of like a news

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.150 
like bring in an aspect of like a news
show<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:53.049> sort<00:03:53.230> of<00:03:53.290> make<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:53.709> feel<00:03:53.950> like<00:03:53.980> the

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
show and sort of make it feel like the

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.059 
show and sort of make it feel like the
whole<00:03:54.519> comic<00:03:54.940> is<00:03:55.090> about<00:03:55.389> the<00:03:55.599> Daily<00:03:55.900> Planet

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
whole comic is about the Daily Planet

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.860 
whole comic is about the Daily Planet
but<00:03:57.069> um<00:03:57.400> it<00:03:57.730> just<00:03:57.970> felt<00:03:58.180> too<00:03:58.239> off-putting<00:03:58.540> for

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
but um it just felt too off-putting for

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.629 
but um it just felt too off-putting for
me<00:03:59.079> it<00:03:59.410> could<00:03:59.590> be<00:03:59.709> if<00:03:59.950> they<00:04:00.099> would<00:04:00.250> try<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.489> do

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
me it could be if they would try and do

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:01.860 
me it could be if they would try and do
that<00:04:00.790> they<00:04:00.940> should<00:04:01.090> have<00:04:01.180> down<00:04:01.329> toned<00:04:01.599> it<00:04:01.780> a

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
that they should have down toned it a

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.990 
that they should have down toned it a
little<00:04:02.079> bit<00:04:02.260> but<00:04:02.859> it<00:04:03.370> was<00:04:03.430> just<00:04:03.579> a<00:04:03.700> bit<00:04:03.849> too

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
little bit but it was just a bit too

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.449 
little bit but it was just a bit too
much<00:04:04.150> it's<00:04:04.480> like<00:04:04.590> telling<00:04:05.590> us<00:04:05.680> exactly<00:04:06.190> what's

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459

well I think so what happens is these

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.870 
well I think so what happens is these
monsters<00:06:24.980> that<00:06:25.070> has<00:06:25.250> been<00:06:25.400> fighting<00:06:25.640> the

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.090 
fiery demon the cyclone girl
the<00:06:28.330> invisible<00:06:29.470> monster<00:06:30.470> thing<00:06:30.710> they're<00:06:30.920> all

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
the invisible monster thing they're all

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.160 
the invisible monster thing they're all
connected<00:06:31.430> to<00:06:31.910> this<00:06:32.150> nano<00:06:32.600> bike<00:06:32.900> that<00:06:33.080> was

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170 
connected to this nano bike that was

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.990 
connected to this nano bike that was
found<00:06:33.410> on<00:06:33.500> his<00:06:33.680> costume<00:06:34.160> this<00:06:34.370> nano<00:06:34.700> bait

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
found on his costume this nano bait

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.730 
found on his costume this nano bait
thing<00:06:35.210> that<00:06:35.360> could<00:06:35.510> clone<00:06:35.900> and<00:06:36.200> copy<00:06:36.410> things

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
thing that could clone and copy things

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.680 
thing that could clone and copy things
so<00:06:37.190> in<00:06:37.340> this<00:06:37.520> volume<00:06:37.730> these<00:06:38.090> nano<00:06:38.390> bytes

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
so in this volume these nano bytes

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.830 
so in this volume these nano bytes
actually<00:06:39.290> take<00:06:39.830> parts<00:06:40.190> of<00:06:40.310> Superman<00:06:40.700> and<00:06:40.910> copy

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
actually take parts of Superman and copy

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.860 
actually take parts of Superman and copy
him<00:06:42.260> so<00:06:42.770> they<00:06:42.890> create<00:06:43.250> another<00:06:43.940> Superman<00:06:44.600> and

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
him so they create another Superman and

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.720 
him so they create another Superman and
they<00:06:45.080> basically<00:06:45.470> take<00:06:45.980> the<00:06:46.220> original

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:46.730 
they basically take the original

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.730 
they basically take the original
Superman<00:06:47.060> they've<00:06:47.750> got<00:06:47.990> him<00:06:48.170> in<00:06:48.200> orbit<00:06:48.620> and

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
Superman they've got him in orbit and

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.230 
Superman they've got him in orbit and
they're<00:06:48.980> just<00:06:49.220> sort<00:06:49.340> of<00:06:49.490> using<00:06:49.880> all<00:06:49.970> the<00:06:50.060> Nano

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
they're just sort of using all the Nano

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.850 
they're just sort of using all the Nano
bytes<00:06:50.510> to<00:06:50.720> copy<00:06:50.930> him<00:06:51.230> and<00:06:51.380> he's<00:06:51.500> in<00:06:51.650> like<00:06:51.830> a

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
bytes to copy him and he's in like a

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
bytes to copy him and he's in like a
coma<00:06:52.000> so<00:06:53.000> this<00:06:53.260> this<00:06:54.260> clone<00:06:54.860> Superman<00:06:55.580> that's

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880 
coma so this this clone Superman that's

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.320 
coma so this this clone Superman that's
this<00:06:56.060> nano<00:06:56.360> buy<00:06:56.630> thing<00:06:57.910> axis<00:06:58.910> sort<00:06:59.120> of<00:06:59.180> like<00:06:59.300> a

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
this nano buy thing axis sort of like a

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.630 
this nano buy thing axis sort of like a
warden<00:06:59.840> of<00:06:59.960> the<00:07:00.110> city<00:07:00.320> and<00:07:00.590> he<00:07:00.920> decides<00:07:01.490> he
