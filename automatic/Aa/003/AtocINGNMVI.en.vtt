00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
these numbers you don't really have any

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.550 
these numbers you don't really have any
any<00:02:39.430> names<00:02:39.760> for<00:02:39.909> that<00:02:40.150> so<00:02:40.569> I<00:02:40.599> prefer<00:02:41.230> them

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
any names for that so I prefer them

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.690 
any names for that so I prefer them
calling<00:02:41.859> you<00:02:41.980> know<00:02:42.159> 1<00:02:42.400> 2<00:02:42.760> 3<00:02:43.120> 4<00:02:43.629> 5<00:02:43.959> 6<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:45.430> that's

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
calling you know 1 2 3 4 5 6 so that's

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.920 
calling you know 1 2 3 4 5 6 so that's
pretty<00:02:46.120> much<00:02:46.209> about<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:47.549> so<00:02:48.549> you<00:02:49.209> first<00:02:49.510> of<00:02:49.750> all

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
pretty much about it so you first of all

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.640 
pretty much about it so you first of all
zero<00:02:50.349> on<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.280> second<00:02:51.670> string<00:02:52.260> actually<00:02:53.260> feels

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
zero on the second string actually feels

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.009 
zero on the second string actually feels
like<00:02:53.769> as<00:02:53.920> if<00:02:54.010> I'm<00:02:54.129> teaching<00:02:55.030> somebody<00:02:55.269> let's

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
like as if I'm teaching somebody let's

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.680 
like as if I'm teaching somebody let's
just<00:02:56.170> start<00:02:56.409> it<00:02:56.590> so<00:02:57.120> don't<00:02:58.120> take<00:02:58.209> my<00:02:58.269> word<00:02:58.540> on

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
just start it so don't take my word on

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.509 
just start it so don't take my word on
it

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
it

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:37.500 
it
so<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:28.299> and<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.870> second<00:03:29.410> one<00:03:29.560> is<00:03:36.269> tune<00:03:37.269> in

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
so so and and the second one is tune in

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.360 
so so and and the second one is tune in
eternal<00:03:37.930> yeah<00:03:38.139> it's<00:03:38.859> pretty<00:03:39.160> much

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
eternal yeah it's pretty much

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.860 
eternal yeah it's pretty much
straightforward<00:03:39.699> now<00:03:40.180> but<00:03:40.389> once<00:03:40.599> you<00:03:40.690> know

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
straightforward now but once you know

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.720 
straightforward now but once you know
how<00:03:41.019> to<00:03:41.049> follow<00:03:41.379> the<00:03:41.680> tabs<00:03:41.949> pretty<00:03:42.579> much

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
how to follow the tabs pretty much

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:51.949 
how to follow the tabs pretty much
straightforward

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:04:01.680 

cd20<00:03:57.900> so<00:03:58.900> for<00:03:59.080> for<00:03:59.410> I<00:03:59.739> count<00:04:00.730> one<00:04:00.910> two<00:04:01.510> three

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
cd20 so for for I count one two three

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.180 
cd20 so for for I count one two three
and<00:04:02.380> then<00:04:02.560> four

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
and then four

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.360 
and then four
so<00:04:03.400> this<00:04:03.550> is<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.760> fourth<00:04:04.030> fourth<00:04:04.390> fret<00:04:04.690> and

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
so this is the fourth fourth fret and

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:13.110 
so this is the fourth fourth fret and
which<00:04:07.290> string<00:04:08.290> is<00:04:08.470> this<00:04:08.650> 1<00:04:09.280> 2<00:04:10.239> 3<00:04:10.900> 4<00:04:11.940> is<00:04:12.940> the

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
which string is this 1 2 3 4 is the

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.900 
which string is this 1 2 3 4 is the
fourth<00:04:13.300> string<00:04:13.690> isn't<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.050> yeah<00:04:14.610> this<00:04:15.610> is<00:04:15.730> how

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
fourth string isn't it yeah this is how

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.990 
fourth string isn't it yeah this is how
I<00:04:15.940> know<00:04:16.810> very<00:04:17.410> exactly<00:04:18.010> to<00:04:18.130> have<00:04:18.250> to<00:04:18.370> press<00:04:18.700> and

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
I know very exactly to have to press and

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.950 
I know very exactly to have to press and
then<00:04:19.600> I<00:04:19.720> pluck<00:04:20.190> so<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.340> thing<00:04:21.549> is<00:04:21.840> when<00:04:22.840> I'm

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
then I pluck so the thing is when I'm

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.620 
then I pluck so the thing is when I'm
picking<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.530> strings<00:04:23.770> like<00:04:24.070> this<00:04:24.130> I<00:04:24.790> have

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
picking the strings like this I have

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.590 
picking the strings like this I have
this<00:04:25.810> thumb<00:04:26.350> here<00:04:26.770> I<00:04:27.240> have<00:04:28.240> this<00:04:30.270> thumb<00:04:31.270> here

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
this thumb here I have this thumb here

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.960 
this thumb here I have this thumb here
and<00:04:31.990> I<00:04:32.290> do<00:04:32.350> not<00:04:32.590> move<00:04:32.860> this<00:04:33.130> never

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
and I do not move this never

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.629 
and I do not move this never
so<00:04:34.450> once<00:04:34.720> minute<00:04:35.229> and<00:04:35.470> then<00:04:35.889> and<00:04:36.280> then<00:04:36.400> I'm

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
so once minute and then and then I'm

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.950 
so once minute and then and then I'm
doing<00:04:36.880> this<00:04:37.090> I<00:04:37.270> know<00:04:37.300> this<00:04:37.570> is<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.810> first

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
doing this I know this is the first

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.480 
doing this I know this is the first
string<00:04:38.229> right<00:04:38.410> I<00:04:38.770> cannot<00:04:39.040> miss<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.430> don't

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
string right I cannot miss I don't

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.280 
string right I cannot miss I don't
really<00:04:39.790> have<00:04:39.910> to<00:04:40.000> look<00:04:40.180> into<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.540> mirror<00:04:40.990> or

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
really have to look into the mirror or

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.350 
really have to look into the mirror or
look<00:04:41.530> here<00:04:41.740> so<00:04:42.460> once<00:04:42.669> I<00:04:42.820> know<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.150> first

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
look here so once I know the first

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.719 
look here so once I know the first
things<00:04:43.630> so<00:04:44.200> now<00:04:44.380> if<00:04:44.560> I<00:04:44.680> don't<00:04:44.740> move<00:04:45.130> this<00:04:45.370> thumb

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
things so now if I don't move this thumb

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.450 
things so now if I don't move this thumb
from<00:04:46.090> here<00:04:46.389> I<00:04:46.570> know<00:04:47.110> this<00:04:47.680> is<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:47.979> second<00:04:48.400> this

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
from here I know this is the second this

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.159 
from here I know this is the second this
is<00:04:48.669> a<00:04:48.700> third<00:04:49.030> this<00:04:49.210> is<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.389> fourth<00:04:49.479> else's

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
is a third this is the fourth else's

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.880 
is a third this is the fourth else's
right<00:04:50.800> it's<00:04:51.729> it's<00:04:52.630> how<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:52.870> do<00:04:53.139> it<00:04:53.440> normally

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
right it's it's how I do it normally

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.650 
right it's it's how I do it normally
people<00:04:54.070> do<00:04:54.370> it<00:04:54.460> like<00:04:54.490> this<00:04:54.910> or<00:04:55.300> something<00:04:55.600> I

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
people do it like this or something I

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.960 
people do it like this or something I
don't<00:04:55.900> know<00:04:55.960> how<00:04:56.140> they<00:04:56.860> do<00:04:56.919> it<00:04:57.220> but<00:04:57.250> this<00:04:57.910> is

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
don't know how they do it but this is

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.040 
don't know how they do it but this is
how<00:04:58.120> I<00:04:58.300> do<00:04:58.539> it

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
how I do it

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.110 
how I do it
so<00:04:59.500> I<00:04:59.560> put<00:04:59.830> one<00:04:59.860> light<00:05:00.250> like<00:05:00.520> you<00:05:00.700> know<00:05:00.820> in<00:05:01.030> the

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
so I put one light like you know in the

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.150 
so I put one light like you know in the
keyboard<00:05:01.539> if<00:05:01.870> you<00:05:02.050> know<00:05:02.229> where<00:05:02.410> F<00:05:02.620> is<00:05:02.800> because

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
keyboard if you know where F is because

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.930 
keyboard if you know where F is because
there's<00:05:03.700> a<00:05:03.760> small<00:05:03.940> thought<00:05:04.330> on<00:05:04.570> this<00:05:05.080> is<00:05:05.260> how<00:05:05.350> I

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
there's a small thought on this is how I

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.310 
there's a small thought on this is how I
managed<00:05:06.940> to<00:05:07.000> get<00:05:07.240> this<00:05:07.390> out<00:05:07.600> you<00:05:07.810> know<00:05:07.930> this

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
managed to get this out you know this

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.890 
managed to get this out you know this
theory<00:05:08.860> that<00:05:09.010> if<00:05:09.220> I<00:05:09.400> put<00:05:09.610> my<00:05:09.729> thumb<00:05:09.970> here<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.870> I

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
theory that if I put my thumb here and I

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.900 
theory that if I put my thumb here and I
won't<00:05:11.560> really<00:05:11.800> have<00:05:12.010> to<00:05:12.100> look<00:05:12.250> over<00:05:12.490> here

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
won't really have to look over here

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.850 
won't really have to look over here
where<00:05:13.120> plucking<00:05:13.600> I<00:05:13.720> can<00:05:13.900> only<00:05:14.080> look<00:05:14.289> here<00:05:14.620> once

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
where plucking I can only look here once

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.770 
where plucking I can only look here once
as<00:05:15.460> I<00:05:15.610> don't<00:05:15.669> know<00:05:15.970> the<00:05:16.120> course<00:05:16.390> you<00:05:16.630> know<00:05:16.750> I

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
as I don't know the course you know I

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.170 
as I don't know the course you know I
have<00:05:16.900> to<00:05:17.050> look<00:05:17.229> in<00:05:17.470> here<00:05:17.770> what<00:05:18.039> I'm<00:05:18.220> doing<00:05:18.580> and

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
have to look in here what I'm doing and
