 famous of the three called error 12

 that this occurs when wanting to save 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.359
 a game while the game is in 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:22.240
 course then what you have to do 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.240

 program is worth making it 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.310
 expand then 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.520
 the store is worth to save the 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:44.490

 well, it will be downloaded 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.149
 when the file appears here 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:58.000
 you give to the selection is and you give 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.579
 to show to show in folder is worth here 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.230
 show in folder then when you 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.230
 appear cortÃ©is 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.439
 you stick on the desk it's worth more 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.149
 ease to be able to extract it vale 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.880
 so what we have to do is 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.290
 extract it here and you will be shown the 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.960
 program is worth that you have to use 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.750
 then you double click on this 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.759
 executable and good we will appear a 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.149
 blank cell and what you have to 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.580
 do is select the executable from the 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.470
 game of the sims 3 that appears to you in 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.000
 where I installed it I have it in 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.130
 origin game but you surely what 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.039
 c will have on local disk files 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.850
 program and electronics is worth it and me but I 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.720
 in this case I have it in all in game 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.940
 so what you have to do is 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.830
 give 2003 double click to game bean 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.360
 and now you have to look for the executable 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:58.210
 of ts www you give once and open or two 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.460
 Sometimes know directly and do not remove 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.870
 this option because it is important to 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.650
 precise of it is worth so that this 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.500
 work 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.410
 then you give to save and you get 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.320
 this message that has been satisfactory 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.590
 the update then good now 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.910
 comes another thing that is to start the 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.240
 Start button to all programs 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.100
 accessories system symbol and now 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.670
 here you have to put a code according to 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.820
 your ram memory is worth I will leave you the 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.360
 options in the description are worth they are 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.690
 these 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.500
 according to the ram memory that you have 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.580
 you have to copy this code 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.630
 and paste it here good 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.520
 sorry that can not be pasted here in 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.640
 this executable we say of the system 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.830
 so you have to do it in 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.990
 once of edit space bar set 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.069
 space 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:02.319
 and be created 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:05.139
 usher I had room in the numbers that you 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:10.719
 you correspond to your ram memory by 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:14.349
 example 10 72 25 60 30 72 is worth then 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:17.319
 you give interest and say that you have 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.599
 happened good that has been completed 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.650
 correctly then what you have to 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:26.889
 to do is to close it ok and restart the 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.569
 computer and I'm supposed to have you 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:30.730
 solve vale there are some people that 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.069
 they do not solve them but this is because of 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.560
 unfortunately this is the only way 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.500
 ok and if you reappear then 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.750
 that more remedy than doing it good 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.430
 being during the game is worth when 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.939
 you want to save the game if it disappears 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:49.000
 the error 12 then it is to leave the game not 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:52.719
 leaving not closing the executable of 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.510
 the sims 3 is worth but to control escape or to 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:58.510
 control when suppressing at start 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.189
 task manager is worth and comes out 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.509
 to the desktop then what is 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.610
 you have to do is this same process 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:06.460
 but obviously without restarting 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.580
 I do not think there's a need to say it and 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:12.040
 then you go back to the game and 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.750
 you try again to save then 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.810
 it will have been saved and you will not know 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.579
 lost nothing and well this is all for 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.519
 today I hope you have served this 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.380
 tutorial is my first one that I do and good 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.780
 that you do well in this really 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.480
 and well here I say goodbye, you guys 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.140
 goodbye I will come back with another video very soon 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.140
 goodbye
