vibrations<00:02:18.350> can<00:02:18.560> go<00:02:18.740> up<00:02:18.890> into<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.280> microphone

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
vibrations can go up into the microphone

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.610 
vibrations can go up into the microphone
and<00:02:20.000> there<00:02:20.390> are<00:02:20.450> such<00:02:20.600> low<00:02:20.840> frequencies<00:02:21.410> that

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
and there are such low frequencies that

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.070 
and there are such low frequencies that
if<00:02:21.770> you<00:02:21.890> turn<00:02:22.220> on<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.490> low-cut<00:02:22.880> you'll<00:02:23.570> you'll

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
if you turn on the low-cut you'll you'll

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.480 
if you turn on the low-cut you'll you'll
record<00:02:24.620> less<00:02:24.890> of<00:02:25.070> that<00:02:26.020> also<00:02:27.020> in<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.830> box<00:02:28.100> here

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
record less of that also in the box here

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.540 
record less of that also in the box here
then<00:02:29.060> you<00:02:29.120> have<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:31.060> foam<00:02:32.060> windscreen<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:33.560> it

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
then you have a foam windscreen and it

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.980 
then you have a foam windscreen and it
looks<00:02:34.730> like<00:02:34.850> it<00:02:34.940> has<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.060> little<00:02:35.209> cutout<00:02:35.630> there

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
looks like it has a little cutout there

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.170 
looks like it has a little cutout there
or<00:02:36.440> maybe<00:02:36.590> it's<00:02:36.800> ripped<00:02:37.100> I<00:02:37.370> don't<00:02:37.850> know

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
or maybe it's ripped I don't know

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.500 
or maybe it's ripped I don't know
nope<00:02:39.140> it's<00:02:39.440> not<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.620> rip<00:02:40.090> it's<00:02:41.090> got<00:02:41.239> a<00:02:41.270> little

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
nope it's not a rip it's got a little

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.949 
nope it's not a rip it's got a little
notch<00:02:41.780> here<00:02:42.200> for<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.530> cable<00:02:42.709> that<00:02:42.950> drops<00:02:43.280> then

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:53.949 

yep<00:02:47.959> just<00:02:48.410> like<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.680> little<00:02:49.989> notch<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:52.959> let's

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
yep just like a little notch and let's

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:00.390 
yep just like a little notch and let's
see<00:02:54.170> I<00:02:55.390> imagine<00:02:56.390> this<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:56.540> experience<00:02:59.110> yep

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
see I imagine this is experience yep

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:13.600 
see I imagine this is experience yep
there<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.489> go<00:03:12.040> now<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:13.070> believe<00:03:13.459> this

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
there you go now I believe this

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.289 
there you go now I believe this
microphone<00:03:14.150> runs<00:03:14.720> off<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:16.790> doesn't<00:03:17.180> need<00:03:17.269> a

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
microphone runs off of it doesn't need a

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.960 
microphone runs off of it doesn't need a
battery<00:03:17.720> it<00:03:17.959> runs<00:03:18.320> off<00:03:18.620> of<00:03:18.730> what's<00:03:19.730> called

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
battery it runs off of what's called

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.070 
battery it runs off of what's called
plug-in<00:03:20.570> power<00:03:20.840> which<00:03:21.680> is<00:03:21.860> sort<00:03:22.070> of<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:23.080> similar

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
plug-in power which is sort of a similar

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.960 
plug-in power which is sort of a similar
to<00:03:24.320> phantom<00:03:24.920> power<00:03:25.130> if<00:03:25.310> you've<00:03:25.459> ever<00:03:25.640> heard<00:03:25.880> of

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
to phantom power if you've ever heard of

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.690 
to phantom power if you've ever heard of
that<00:03:26.170> some<00:03:27.170> microphones<00:03:27.500> you<00:03:28.070> plug<00:03:28.340> them<00:03:28.489> into

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
that some microphones you plug them into

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.699 
that some microphones you plug them into
the<00:03:29.000> mic<00:03:29.269> input<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:30.350> device<00:03:30.680> that

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
the mic input and the device that

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.140 
the mic input and the device that
they're<00:03:31.040> plugged<00:03:31.280> into<00:03:31.459> sends<00:03:31.850> a<00:03:31.910> little

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
they're plugged into sends a little

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.390 
they're plugged into sends a little
charge<00:03:32.450> through<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.959> cable<00:03:33.290> which<00:03:33.799> goes<00:03:34.070> and

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
charge through the cable which goes and

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.180 
charge through the cable which goes and
powers<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.940> microphone<00:03:35.420> and<00:03:35.709> Nikon<00:03:36.709> cameras

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
powers the microphone and Nikon cameras

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.640 
powers the microphone and Nikon cameras
have<00:03:37.430> what's<00:03:37.790> called<00:03:37.940> plug-in<00:03:38.480> power<00:03:38.660> which

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
have what's called plug-in power which

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.650 
have what's called plug-in power which
you<00:03:39.680> just<00:03:40.070> stick<00:03:40.549> this<00:03:40.670> into<00:03:40.880> your<00:03:41.030> mic<00:03:41.209> input

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
you just stick this into your mic input

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.080 
you just stick this into your mic input
and<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.709> camera<00:03:43.040> sends<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.340> little<00:03:43.430> charge<00:03:43.790> and

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
and the camera sends a little charge and

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.210 
and the camera sends a little charge and
it<00:03:44.180> turns<00:03:44.420> on<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.720> mic<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:45.140> you<00:03:45.799> don't<00:03:45.950> have<00:03:46.100> to

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
it turns on the mic so you don't have to

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.560 
it turns on the mic so you don't have to
feed<00:03:46.430> this<00:03:46.549> thing<00:03:46.760> batteries<00:03:47.209> which<00:03:47.420> is

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
feed this thing batteries which is

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.340 
feed this thing batteries which is
really<00:03:47.810> nice<00:03:47.930> I<00:03:49.090> know<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.360> canon<00:03:50.660> 5d<00:03:50.930> mark<00:03:51.140> ii

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
really nice I know the canon 5d mark ii

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.449 
really nice I know the canon 5d mark ii
has<00:03:51.920> plug-in<00:03:52.400> power<00:03:52.640> and<00:03:53.380> obviously<00:03:54.380> all<00:03:55.250> of

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
has plug-in power and obviously all of

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.300 
has plug-in power and obviously all of
the<00:03:55.640> nikon<00:03:56.150> cameras<00:03:56.540> have<00:03:56.720> it<00:03:56.900> Sony<00:03:57.829> cameras

knew for sure that have that so this mic

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.710 
knew for sure that have that so this mic
will<00:04:06.140> be<00:04:06.260> compatible<00:04:06.890> with<00:04:07.160> all<00:04:07.400> those

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
will be compatible with all those

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.800 
will be compatible with all those
cameras<00:04:08.739> and<00:04:09.739> that's<00:04:10.340> about<00:04:10.579> it<00:04:10.790> if<00:04:11.420> you<00:04:11.600> want
