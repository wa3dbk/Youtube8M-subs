00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.549
 i 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.850
 nobody said that social issues 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.520
 they will be easy we live in a world 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.540
 complex but sociology falls in love and 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.540

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.210
 we are located for that reason to do studies

 with the development of the city the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.820
 sociology has endowed me with the 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.369
 analytical tools to be able 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.470
 face successfully the resolution of 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.840
 different problems both in the field 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.910
 personal as in the professional we have 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.100
 treated as if because some 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.690
 communities react in a more 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.239
 positive than others to an installation 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.560
 technological or what the 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.370

 the world from a new perspective 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.540
 criticism on the one hand but empathic to the 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.050
