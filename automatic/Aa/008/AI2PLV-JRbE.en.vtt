00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
the way of course and then that would be

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.999 
the way of course and then that would be
absolutely<00:02:00.750> also<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.229> i<00:02:01.259> can<00:02:01.409> get<00:02:01.469> stream<00:02:01.799> done

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.529 
me I leggett vide done as well which we
absolutely<00:02:06.899> awesome<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.069> hopefully<00:02:08.640> we<00:02:09.360> can

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
have some luck tomorrow as well and I

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.550 
have some luck tomorrow as well and I
think<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.000> plan<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.690> open<00:02:12.870> 100k

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
think the plan is just to open 100k

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.210 
think the plan is just to open 100k
and<00:02:13.950> then<00:02:14.220> go<00:02:14.430> for<00:02:14.700> these<00:02:14.849> 7.5<00:02:15.660> maybe<00:02:16.170> maybe<00:02:17.069> a

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
and then go for these 7.5 maybe maybe a

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.040 
and then go for these 7.5 maybe maybe a
couple<00:02:17.459> of<00:02:17.610> 25<00:02:17.970> case<00:02:18.270> just<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.599> get<00:02:18.810> another

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
couple of 25 case just to get another

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.110 
couple of 25 case just to get another
way<00:02:19.230> because<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.860> does<00:02:20.280> burn<00:02:20.580> through<00:02:21.000> them

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
way because it does burn through them

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.180 
way because it does burn through them
quite<00:02:21.360> quickly<00:02:21.630> which<00:02:22.380> will<00:02:22.680> obviously<00:02:22.890> make

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
quite quickly which will obviously make

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.070 
quite quickly which will obviously make
it<00:02:23.550> much<00:02:23.730> more<00:02:23.970> enjoyable<00:02:24.150> for<00:02:24.599> you<00:02:24.720> guys<00:02:24.900> to

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
it much more enjoyable for you guys to

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.540 
it much more enjoyable for you guys to
watch<00:02:25.170> now<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.440> plan<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.980> obviously<00:02:26.250> go

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
watch now the plan is to obviously go

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.729 
watch now the plan is to obviously go
through<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.880> entire<00:02:26.970> thing<00:02:27.270> on<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.530> live

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
through the entire thing on the live

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.740 
through the entire thing on the live
stream<00:02:28.770> with<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.700> video<00:02:29.910> i<00:02:29.970> plan<00:02:30.300> on<00:02:30.330> making

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
stream with the video i plan on making

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.270 
stream with the video i plan on making
it<00:02:30.840> will<00:02:30.989> probably<00:02:31.200> be<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.650> highlights<00:02:32.130> of

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
it will probably be the highlights of

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.160 
it will probably be the highlights of
the<00:02:32.370> best<00:02:32.640> bits<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.030> best<00:02:33.239> packs<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.989> most

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
the best bits the best packs the most

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.199 
the best bits the best packs the most
interesting<00:02:34.830> ones<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:35.340> then<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.819> guys<00:02:36.000> can

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
interesting ones and then you guys can

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.550 
interesting ones and then you guys can
see<00:02:36.269> it<00:02:36.480> in<00:02:36.599> like<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.750> little<00:02:36.959> four<00:02:37.290> or<00:02:37.380> five

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.250 
till now 600 k that's ridiculous for a
94<00:04:10.500> rated<00:04:11.160> defender<00:04:11.880> with<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.810> incredible

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
94 rated defender with the incredible

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.039
