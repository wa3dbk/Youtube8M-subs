00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
4-door now one of the things that I

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.940 
4-door now one of the things that I
always<00:00:19.450> do<00:00:19.990> on<00:00:20.349> a<00:00:20.619> new<00:00:20.890> car<00:00:21.189> is<00:00:21.460> get<00:00:21.910> rid<00:00:22.149> of<00:00:22.210> the

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
always do on a new car is get rid of the

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.339 
always do on a new car is get rid of the
factory<00:00:23.950> floor<00:00:24.399> mats<00:00:24.669> the<00:00:25.599> reason<00:00:25.899> I<00:00:25.989> do<00:00:26.050> this

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
factory floor mats the reason I do this

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.580 
factory floor mats the reason I do this
is<00:00:26.970> because<00:00:27.970> the<00:00:28.419> factory<00:00:28.779> floor<00:00:29.020> mats<00:00:29.259> don't

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
is because the factory floor mats don't

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.120 
is because the factory floor mats don't
give<00:00:29.770> enough<00:00:29.890> cover<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:31.779> the<00:00:31.989> carpet<00:00:32.410> as<00:00:32.890> you

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
give enough cover of the carpet as you

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.750 
give enough cover of the carpet as you
can<00:00:33.309> see<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:34.530> edge<00:00:35.530> of<00:00:35.890> this<00:00:36.100> doesn't<00:00:36.430> even

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
can see the edge of this doesn't even

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.900 
can see the edge of this doesn't even
remotely<00:00:37.390> go<00:00:37.720> close<00:00:38.080> to<00:00:38.320> where<00:00:38.500> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
remotely go close to where the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.690 
remotely go close to where the
accelerator<00:00:39.910> pedal<00:00:40.180> is<00:00:41.130> it<00:00:42.130> doesn't<00:00:42.370> have<00:00:42.670> a

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
accelerator pedal is it doesn't have a

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.540 
accelerator pedal is it doesn't have a
lot<00:00:42.910> of<00:00:43.030> protection<00:00:43.210> to<00:00:43.810> the<00:00:44.200> carpet<00:00:44.710> going<00:00:45.340> up

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
lot of protection to the carpet going up

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.450 
lot of protection to the carpet going up
on<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:45.760> sides<00:00:46.060> here<00:00:46.650> it's<00:00:47.650> not<00:00:47.830> as<00:00:48.100> bad<00:00:48.400> on

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460

on the sides here it's not as bad on
this<00:00:48.850> side<00:00:50.700> but<00:00:52.170> factory<00:00:53.170> floor<00:00:53.380> mats<00:00:53.620> look

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
this side but factory floor mats look

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.200 
this side but factory floor mats look
great<00:00:54.130> when<00:00:54.310> they're<00:00:54.430> brand<00:00:54.640> spanking<00:00:55.180> new

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
great when they're brand spanking new

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.490 
great when they're brand spanking new
like<00:00:55.720> these<00:00:55.960> are<00:00:56.170> but<00:00:57.130> over<00:00:57.520> time<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:59.050> carp<00:00:59.290> it

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
like these are but over time the carp it

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.650 
like these are but over time the carp it
picks<00:00:59.739> up<00:00:59.890> stains<00:01:00.250> and<00:01:00.640> dirt<00:01:00.700> especially<00:01:01.600> if

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
picks up stains and dirt especially if

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.530 
picks up stains and dirt especially if
you<00:01:01.810> live<00:01:02.079> in<00:01:02.290> an<00:01:02.410> area<00:01:02.680> that's<00:01:02.829> got<00:01:03.100> a<00:01:03.130> lot<00:01:03.370> of

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
you live in an area that's got a lot of

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.310 
you live in an area that's got a lot of
moisture<00:01:04.540> whether<00:01:05.079> it's<00:01:05.290> snow<00:01:05.560> sleet<00:01:06.430> or<00:01:06.700> rain

moisture whether it's snow sleet or rain

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.800 
moisture whether it's snow sleet or rain
these<00:01:08.320> will<00:01:08.650> start<00:01:09.010> to<00:01:09.310> degrade<00:01:09.850> and<00:01:10.300> and<00:01:10.600> not

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
these will start to degrade and and not

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.920 
these will start to degrade and and not
look<00:01:11.050> their<00:01:11.229> best<00:01:11.260> anymore<00:01:12.630> besides<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.750> fact

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
look their best anymore besides the fact

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.219 
look their best anymore besides the fact
I<00:01:14.110> like<00:01:14.260> the<00:01:14.440> look<00:01:14.860> of<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.130> WeatherTech<00:01:16.229> now

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
I like the look of the WeatherTech now

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:18.810 
I like the look of the WeatherTech now
the<00:01:17.350> last<00:01:17.680> vehicle<00:01:17.979> that<00:01:18.280> I<00:01:18.310> had<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.520> set<00:01:18.729> of

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
the last vehicle that I had a set of

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.370 
the last vehicle that I had a set of
weathertech<00:01:19.240> on<00:01:19.420> them<00:01:19.570> was<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:19.840> Jeep<00:01:20.229> Wrangler

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
weathertech on them was a Jeep Wrangler

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.670 
weathertech on them was a Jeep Wrangler
and<00:01:20.979> they<00:01:21.430> were<00:01:21.490> far<00:01:22.030> far<00:01:22.780> far<00:01:23.200> better<00:01:23.440> than

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
and they were far far far better than

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.270 
and they were far far far better than
the<00:01:23.830> factory<00:01:24.159> mats<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.590> pattern<00:01:27.100> was

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
the factory mats and the pattern was

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.789 
the factory mats and the pattern was
similar<00:01:27.610> to<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:27.880> way<00:01:28.000> it<00:01:28.120> is<00:01:28.210> here<00:01:28.620> they<00:01:29.620> just

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
similar to the way it is here they just

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.850 
similar to the way it is here they just
didn't<00:01:30.100> fit<00:01:30.370> very<00:01:31.030> well<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:32.290> factory<00:01:32.650> mats

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
didn't fit very well the factory mats

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.789 
didn't fit very well the factory mats
didn't<00:01:33.190> fit<00:01:33.369> very<00:01:33.430> well<00:01:33.790> over<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.150> carpet<00:01:34.540> so

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
didn't fit very well over the carpet so

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.399 
didn't fit very well over the carpet so
I<00:01:35.799> am<00:01:36.670> going<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.210> pull<00:01:37.630> this<00:01:37.780> mat<00:01:38.020> out<00:01:38.200> in<00:01:38.320> the

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
I am going to pull this mat out in the

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.820 
I am going to pull this mat out in the
way<00:01:38.530> that<00:01:38.680> I'm<00:01:38.740> going<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:38.979> do<00:01:39.100> that<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:40.830> there

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
way that I'm going to do that is there

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.330 
way that I'm going to do that is there
are<00:01:42.040> two<00:01:42.760> little<00:01:42.970> tabs<00:01:43.330> here<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:45.100> you<00:01:45.310> just

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
are two little tabs here that you just

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:53.010 
are two little tabs here that you just
turn<00:01:45.729> them<00:01:48.030> just<00:01:49.030> like<00:01:49.210> that<00:01:50.369> and

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
turn them just like that and

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.250 
turn them just like that and
the<00:01:53.260> format<00:01:53.740> will<00:01:53.920> pull<00:01:54.190> right<00:01:54.550> out<00:01:55.080> now<00:01:56.080> these

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
the format will pull right out now these

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:03.140 
the format will pull right out now these
are<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.920> factory<00:01:57.580> Honda<00:01:59.010> Accord<00:02:00.010> formats<00:02:00.640> I

show you the difference in the profile
of<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.980> factory<00:02:39.520> drivers<00:02:40.470> floor<00:02:41.470> mat

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
of the factory drivers floor mat

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.160 
of the factory drivers floor mat
compared<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:43.590> WeatherTech<00:02:44.590> digi<00:02:45.430> fit

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170

compared to the WeatherTech digi fit
floor<00:02:47.170> liner<00:02:49.200> there<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.320> a<00:02:50.350> significant

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
floor liner there is a significant

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.000 
floor liner there is a significant
difference<00:02:51.700> around<00:02:52.239> where<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:53.010> accelerator

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
difference around where the accelerator

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.310 
difference around where the accelerator
pedal<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.550> up<00:02:54.790> under<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.300> brake<00:02:56.140> in<00:02:56.290> the

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
pedal is up under the brake in the

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.509 
pedal is up under the brake in the
clutch<00:02:56.620> pedal<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.299> up<00:02:58.299> around<00:02:58.720> where<00:02:59.019> the

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
clutch pedal and up around where the

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.280 
clutch pedal and up around where the
footrest<00:03:00.519> is<00:03:00.760> as<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.209> can<00:03:01.360> see<00:03:01.540> this<00:03:01.690> goes<00:03:01.989> up

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
footrest is as you can see this goes up

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.130 
footrest is as you can see this goes up
much<00:03:02.799> further<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:04.420> protect<00:03:04.780> more<00:03:04.959> of<00:03:05.019> the

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
much further to protect more of the

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.060 
much further to protect more of the
carpet<00:03:05.910> than<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.180> factory<00:03:07.720> floor<00:03:08.590> mat<00:03:08.799> does

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
carpet than the factory floor mat does

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.220 
carpet than the factory floor mat does
and<00:03:10.000> you'll<00:03:10.330> be<00:03:10.480> able<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.720> see<00:03:10.840> this<00:03:10.959> a<00:03:11.019> little

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
and you'll be able to see this a little

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.750 
and you'll be able to see this a little
bit<00:03:11.410> more<00:03:11.530> dramatically<00:03:12.070> when<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.430> put<00:03:12.670> it

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
bit more dramatically when I put it

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.180 
bit more dramatically when I put it
inside<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.239> car<00:03:16.650> alright<00:03:17.650> so<00:03:17.830> I've<00:03:17.920> placed

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
inside the car alright so I've placed

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.800 
inside the car alright so I've placed
the<00:03:19.110> WeatherTech<00:03:20.110> liner<00:03:20.350> inside<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.450> car<00:03:22.450> as

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
the WeatherTech liner inside the car as

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.360 
the WeatherTech liner inside the car as
you<00:03:22.989> can<00:03:23.230> see<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:26.799> only<00:03:26.950> thing<00:03:27.130> that<00:03:27.310> I

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
you can see and the only thing that I

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.949 
you can see and the only thing that I
don't<00:03:27.430> like<00:03:27.730> is<00:03:28.000> that<00:03:28.030> they<00:03:28.450> should<00:03:28.510> have<00:03:28.690> made

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
don't like is that they should have made

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.890 
don't like is that they should have made
this<00:03:29.170> go<00:03:29.440> up<00:03:29.620> all<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:29.890> way<00:03:30.160> here

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
this go up all the way here

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.449 
this go up all the way here
that<00:03:32.769> would've<00:03:32.950> been<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.070> little<00:03:33.160> bit<00:03:33.280> nicer

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
that would've been a little bit nicer

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.250 
that would've been a little bit nicer
but<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:33.820> can<00:03:34.030> tell<00:03:34.239> how<00:03:34.450> much<00:03:34.510> more

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
but you can tell how much more

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.750 
but you can tell how much more
protection<00:03:35.829> that<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.160> carpet<00:03:36.489> is<00:03:36.549> going<00:03:36.700> to

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
protection that the carpet is going to

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.800 
protection that the carpet is going to
get<00:03:37.620> where<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.709> accelerator<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.660> brake<00:03:40.660> and

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
get where the accelerator the brake and

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.520 
get where the accelerator the brake and
the<00:03:40.930> clutch<00:03:41.170> are<00:03:43.079> it<00:03:44.079> fits<00:03:44.500> very<00:03:44.680> nice<00:03:46.530> seems

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
the clutch are it fits very nice seems

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.810 
the clutch are it fits very nice seems
to<00:03:47.680> be<00:03:47.860> of<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.010> nice<00:03:48.519> high<00:03:48.760> quality

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
to be of a nice high quality

to be of a nice high quality
construction<00:03:49.630> just<00:03:49.959> like<00:03:50.110> all<00:03:50.290> the

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
construction just like all the

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.130 
construction just like all the
WeatherTech<00:03:50.890> products<00:03:51.280> are<00:03:51.459> and<00:03:52.360> this<00:03:52.959> is

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
WeatherTech products are and this is

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.690 
WeatherTech products are and this is
very<00:03:53.320> simple<00:03:53.709> once<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.070> put<00:03:54.340> this<00:03:54.459> in<00:03:54.670> here

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.339 
front passenger and let you see the
difference<00:04:12.190> over<00:04:12.430> there<00:04:12.580> alright<00:04:13.420> so<00:04:13.480> here's

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
difference over there alright so here's

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:20.159

fit<00:05:13.030> I<00:05:14.310> am<00:05:15.310> a<00:05:15.400> little<00:05:15.880> disappointed<00:05:16.539> that

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
fit I am a little disappointed that

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.590 
fit I am a little disappointed that
these<00:05:16.870> don't<00:05:17.080> go<00:05:17.260> up<00:05:17.350> a<00:05:17.470> little<00:05:17.560> further<00:05:18.600> they

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
these don't go up a little further they

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.409 
these don't go up a little further they
do<00:05:19.660> have<00:05:20.050> a<00:05:20.289> little<00:05:20.500> bit<00:05:20.620> more<00:05:21.000> protection<00:05:22.000> on

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
do have a little bit more protection on

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.150 
do have a little bit more protection on
this<00:05:22.570> side<00:05:22.840> but<00:05:23.050> again<00:05:23.320> just<00:05:23.740> like<00:05:23.889> on<00:05:24.070> the

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
this side but again just like on the

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.550 
this side but again just like on the
other<00:05:24.190> side<00:05:24.610> I<00:05:24.849> think<00:05:25.419> WeatherTech<00:05:25.930> should

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
other side I think WeatherTech should

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.990 
other side I think WeatherTech should
have<00:05:26.770> brought<00:05:27.070> this<00:05:27.370> out<00:05:27.639> a<00:05:28.000> little<00:05:28.419> bit<00:05:28.660> more

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
have brought this out a little bit more

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.159 
have brought this out a little bit more
this<00:05:31.000> side<00:05:31.360> has<00:05:31.630> got<00:05:31.840> a<00:05:31.870> little<00:05:32.050> bit<00:05:32.139> more

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
this side has got a little bit more

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.210 
this side has got a little bit more
protection<00:05:32.500> than<00:05:32.860> the<00:05:33.039> factory<00:05:33.460> of<00:05:33.550> course

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
protection than the factory of course

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.250 
protection than the factory of course
but<00:05:36.220> overall<00:05:36.580> the<00:05:37.270> fit<00:05:37.539> and<00:05:37.690> finish<00:05:37.810> of<00:05:38.110> these

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
but overall the fit and finish of these

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.580 
but overall the fit and finish of these
are<00:05:38.470> outstanding<00:05:38.970> I<00:05:40.020> think<00:05:41.020> especially<00:05:41.169> if

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
are outstanding I think especially if

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.879 
are outstanding I think especially if
you<00:05:41.710> live<00:05:41.889> in<00:05:41.950> a<00:05:42.300> northern<00:05:43.300> climate<00:05:43.889> where

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
you live in a northern climate where

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.920 
you live in a northern climate where
you've<00:05:45.039> got<00:05:45.280> a<00:05:45.310> lot<00:05:45.550> of<00:05:45.580> snow<00:05:46.270> and<00:05:46.300> you've<00:05:46.810> got

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
you've got a lot of snow and you've got

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.210 
you've got a lot of snow and you've got
a<00:05:46.960> lot<00:05:47.110> of<00:05:47.139> sleet<00:05:47.470> and<00:05:47.500> all<00:05:47.740> that<00:05:47.919> during<00:05:48.160> the

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
a lot of sleet and all that during the

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.890 
a lot of sleet and all that during the
winter<00:05:48.460> months<00:05:48.729> that<00:05:48.910> these<00:05:49.599> would<00:05:49.780> be

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
winter months that these would be

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.600 
winter months that these would be
excellent<00:05:50.260> to<00:05:51.160> to<00:05:51.550> keep<00:05:51.700> your<00:05:52.000> carpet<00:05:52.539> clean

excellent to to keep your carpet clean
