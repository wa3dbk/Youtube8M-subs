00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the brush and then start working in the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.360 
the brush and then start working in the
inner<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.210> outer<00:00:42.360> corners<00:00:42.870> first<00:00:43.290> then<00:00:44.190> I'll

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
inner and outer corners first then I'll

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.160 
inner and outer corners first then I'll
connect<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.760> lines<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.239> run<00:00:45.510> my<00:00:45.660> brush<00:00:45.870> over

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
the entire upper lash line I find that

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.450 
the entire upper lash line I find that
it's<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.930> easiest<00:00:49.200> way<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.739> put<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.309> eyeliner

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it's the easiest way to put on eyeliner

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.069 
it's the easiest way to put on eyeliner
and<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.390> don't<00:00:51.570> want<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.719> draw<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.020> straight

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
and you don't want to draw a straight

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.720 
and you don't want to draw a straight
line<00:00:52.350> through<00:00:52.500> because<00:00:53.039> that's<00:00:53.190> when<00:00:53.489> most

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
line through because that's when most

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.970 
line through because that's when most
accidents<00:00:54.390> happen<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:55.199> take<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.559> slow<00:00:55.770> and

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
accidents happen so take it slow and

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.450 
accidents happen so take it slow and
work<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.610> small<00:00:56.910> sections

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.750 

and<00:01:02.140> once<00:01:03.140> I've<00:01:03.290> done<00:01:03.440> that<00:01:03.500> I<00:01:03.950> always<00:01:04.309> like<00:01:04.640> to

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
and once I've done that I always like to

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.310 
and once I've done that I always like to
tightline<00:01:05.089> my<00:01:05.150> eyes<00:01:05.300> to<00:01:05.690> make<00:01:05.810> it<00:01:05.960> really

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
tightline my eyes to make it really

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.380 
tightline my eyes to make it really
stand<00:01:06.530> out<00:01:06.800> and<00:01:07.100> this<00:01:07.460> is<00:01:07.700> my<00:01:07.940> natural

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
stand out and this is my natural

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.950 
stand out and this is my natural
everyday<00:01:08.750> eyeliner<00:01:10.240> when<00:01:11.240> it<00:01:11.360> comes<00:01:11.540> to<00:01:11.690> wind

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
everyday eyeliner when it comes to wind

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.050 
everyday eyeliner when it comes to wind
eyeliner<00:01:12.470> it<00:01:12.710> can<00:01:12.830> get<00:01:13.010> a<00:01:13.160> little<00:01:13.370> tricky<00:01:13.610> so

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
eyeliner it can get a little tricky so

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.940 
eyeliner it can get a little tricky so
my<00:01:14.180> best<00:01:14.450> tip<00:01:14.720> is<00:01:14.870> to<00:01:15.050> follow<00:01:15.260> your<00:01:15.590> bottom

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
my best tip is to follow your bottom

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.550 
my best tip is to follow your bottom
lash<00:01:16.160> line<00:01:16.190> up<00:01:16.760> naturally<00:01:17.210> this<00:01:18.200> way<00:01:18.380> your

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
lash line up naturally this way your

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.500 
lash line up naturally this way your
wing<00:01:18.800> will<00:01:19.010> look<00:01:19.160> most<00:01:19.490> natural<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:20.210> it<00:01:20.330> will

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
wing will look most natural and it will

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.140 
wing will look most natural and it will
flow<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.650> when<00:01:21.800> drawing<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.160> wing<00:01:22.400> I<00:01:22.610> use<00:01:22.880> soft

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
flow so when drawing the wing I use soft

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.880 
flow so when drawing the wing I use soft
strokes<00:01:23.540> to<00:01:23.780> create<00:01:24.050> about<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.290> half<00:01:24.590> an<00:01:24.770> inch

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
strokes to create about a half an inch

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.190 
strokes to create about a half an inch
wing<00:01:25.220> I<00:01:25.520> first<00:01:26.240> draw<00:01:26.390> a<00:01:26.420> straight<00:01:26.780> line<00:01:26.990> that

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
wing I first draw a straight line that

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.840 
wing I first draw a straight line that
follows<00:01:27.590> my<00:01:27.770> bottom<00:01:28.130> lash<00:01:28.310> line<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.790> then

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
follows my bottom lash line and then

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.450 
follows my bottom lash line and then
I'll<00:01:29.540> fill<00:01:29.750> in<00:01:29.930> a<00:01:29.990> space<00:01:30.290> between<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:31.070> connect

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
I'll fill in a space between to connect

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.609 
I'll fill in a space between to connect
them<00:01:31.670> and<00:01:31.850> this<00:01:32.390> is<00:01:32.510> my<00:01:32.630> go-to<00:01:32.869> way<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.229> create
