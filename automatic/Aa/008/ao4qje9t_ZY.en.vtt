00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.470
 hello girls arrivals today I will just 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:10.590
 niquet 2 of the urban decay inside 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.780
 12 colors have a dual brush from a 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.599
 part from nuance and from the other instead 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.529
 I hear the cat lice is to sit 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.570
 flat and inside there was also a 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.189
 micro gloss which is not this but similar 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.470
 to this as size perhaps a little more 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.650
 small but I do n't know where to go 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.650
 to finish 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.420
 this small stick as well as the naked one 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.290
 it's really good quality maybe 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.210
 Only those who are a little less kind 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.860
 foxy this butter-colored here actually 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.690
 when you put it with a brush you don't 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.610
 puts with the fingers turns out a little 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.420
 you can hardly see it is transparent 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.680
 even those who are not easy to apply 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.870
 then colors or parts of this palette 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.090
 I'm a little poor compared to the others 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.699
 opaque colors tricolor parts of the other 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.770
 palettina instead bright colors are 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.479
 very beautiful even though they are very similar to 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.130
 those of me ask me why anyway 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.310
 we really have multicolored yes 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.310
 look like 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.240
 if in fact you have many colors that 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.130
 the two palettes are similar 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.570
 price of this palette always 43 euros 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.390
 90 per palettina gloss and brush those 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.430
 always however a price of 3 euros 50 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:36.650
 to my eyeshadow my vote for this 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:38.330
 palette here like the nic one is 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.250
 that this gives a slightly higher rating 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.300
 low and noose colors are that is the multi 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.970
 when I am too similar to 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.970
 they therefore require in my opinion if you have to 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.850
 choose between the two I would choose them naked 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.380
 they absolutely require it and if you have 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.850
 the hard net and that you are thinking of 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.659
 buy it mind two if I were you not 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.270
 I would do that I almost never use much 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.490
 much more often the only hard and are 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.200
 glad the only color that really me 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.800
 like in LegaDue that there is neither 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.590
 naked one that there is nothing like it 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.080
 measure on which it must hold a little more 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.430
 to the gray pens the tones of brown on 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.590
 almost all the like these two on the 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.500
 gray since there is no legal one already 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.870
 part 2 dark grays in the interior 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.120
 of a friend and one are those who you 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.500
 like the younger two nothing 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.500
 I hope it is a loan review
