it's<00:01:02.080> like<00:01:02.200> an<00:01:02.320> icy<00:01:02.710> carwash<00:01:05.340> okay<00:01:06.340> we've<00:01:06.490> got

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
it's like an icy carwash okay we've got

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.670 
it's like an icy carwash okay we've got
a<00:01:06.610> nice<00:01:06.850> sheen<00:01:07.180> of<00:01:07.210> ice<00:01:07.450> on<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:07.810> car<00:01:08.050> we've<00:01:08.560> got

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
a nice sheen of ice on the car we've got

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.500 
a nice sheen of ice on the car we've got
the<00:01:08.770> temperature<00:01:09.190> down<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.550> about<00:01:09.670> 15<00:01:10.360> degrees

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
the temperature down to about 15 degrees

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.650 
the temperature down to about 15 degrees
below<00:01:10.720> zero<00:01:11.440> but<00:01:12.220> you<00:01:12.310> know<00:01:12.430> what<00:01:12.640> I<00:01:13.180> think<00:01:13.570> the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
below zero but you know what I think the

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.170 
below zero but you know what I think the
TDI<00:01:13.990> can<00:01:14.320> take<00:01:14.530> it<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:14.800> little<00:01:15.160> bit<00:01:15.370> colder

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
TDI can take it a little bit colder

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.140 
TDI can take it a little bit colder
so<00:01:17.010> let's<00:01:18.010> crank<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.400> temperature<00:01:18.610> down<00:01:19.090> a

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
so let's crank the temperature down a

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.750 
so let's crank the temperature down a
little<00:01:19.420> bit<00:01:19.600> and<00:01:19.750> see<00:01:19.930> how<00:01:20.020> low<00:01:20.260> we<00:01:20.440> can<00:01:20.619> go<00:01:20.800> Ted

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
little bit and see how low we can go Ted

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.969 
little bit and see how low we can go Ted
you're<00:01:21.970> okay<00:01:22.300> in<00:01:22.450> there<00:01:22.600> right<00:01:25.020> good<00:01:26.020> okay<00:01:26.830> I'm
