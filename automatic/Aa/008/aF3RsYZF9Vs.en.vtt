00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
to prepare the file system as it always

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.930 
to prepare the file system as it always
does<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:18.800> you<00:02:18.860> do<00:02:19.190> want<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.400> make<00:02:19.550> sure<00:02:19.580> that

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
does so you do want to make sure that

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.440 
does so you do want to make sure that
you'd<00:02:20.060> have<00:02:20.500> your<00:02:21.500> Wi-Fi<00:02:22.310> turned<00:02:22.370> back<00:02:22.880> on<00:02:22.910> so

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
you'd have your Wi-Fi turned back on so

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.050 
you'd have your Wi-Fi turned back on so
we're<00:02:23.750> just<00:02:23.780> going<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.110> turn<00:02:24.770> that<00:02:24.830> on<00:02:25.130> for

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
we're just going to turn that on for

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.090 
we're just going to turn that on for
this<00:02:26.240> portion<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.870> jailbreak<00:02:27.680> here<00:02:27.950> and

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
this portion of the jailbreak here and

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.500 
this portion of the jailbreak here and
then<00:02:28.520> we're<00:02:28.610> going<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.880> go<00:02:29.000> ahead<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.180> speed

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
then we're going to go ahead and speed

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.000 
then we're going to go ahead and speed
up<00:02:29.540> through<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:29.930> process<00:02:30.170> as<00:02:30.560> well<00:02:30.740> because

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010
