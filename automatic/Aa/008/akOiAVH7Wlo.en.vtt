00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.649
 This is a real new Porsche turbo s 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.599
 560 ps 10 piece more than that 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.380
 predecessor he gets out of the six-cylinder 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.500
 biturbo from 0 to 100 in 3 1 second 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.190
 on 200 in 10 3 seconds 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.070
 Baumax 318 km / h 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.900
 the interior porsche typically sporty 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.200
 but still comfortable with everyone 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.200
 amenities 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.440
 and we know this key 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.910
 It makes the pulse beat faster 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.970
 promises goose bumps and causes 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.730
 twitch in the gasfoot aerodynamic curves 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.080
 including technique of a purebred 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.670
 Super athletes that is sex on wheels 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.950
 just in time for the fiftieth birthday of 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.540
 new elvers there is that here the 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.990
 turbo s behind grumble quite comfortably 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.440
 560 ps 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.130
 he has all-wheel drive all-wheel steering 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.670
 active spoiler 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.830
 The whole costs here about 200,000 euros 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.350
 it rains a bit but this one 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.150
 Porsche faster than ever before 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.990
 and I'm really hot on it 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.990
 to drive here now 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.380
 At the wheel of turbo s you just have to 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.960
 have the tachometer in mind 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.979
 2000 turns 3000 and then the 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.500
 l was the driver to bed that 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.190
 standard seven-speed 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.470
 double- clutch transmission sets the gears 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:42.149
 menu seconds in sprint he is not 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.429
 much faster than its predecessor 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.670
 what makes up the new answer 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.960
 can be found in the curves straight ahead 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.119
 driving and driving fast is not 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.160
 great art it's about handling and there 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.890
 This turbo s is a real talent 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.869
 this allrad steering the spoiler the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.450
 make sure that the car really up 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.210
 the asphalt sticks to brakes 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.610
 and it's like in the kart directly to the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.229
 turn a real hammer so the people 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.600
 the car and not just mulching 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.100
 get used but actually 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.900
 sometimes go on a race track 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.760
 they will love that , I have to say 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.510
 really absolutely the hammer 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.240
 top speed reached the aero 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.819
 dynamic abrasion 150 kilograms 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.190
 in less than seven minutes 30 should 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.250
 the turbo s orbits the nordschleife 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.110
 four seconds faster than that but around 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.720
 needs to accomplish excellence 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.550
 the turbo s no profi on the handlebars that 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.310
 bitchy driving behavior from past 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.050
 days are over and thrills 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.160
 entertainment value may enter 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.870
 piece far lost 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.910
 but you can still do that 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.280
 Turn off electronic helper 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.060
 the normal dose of adrenaline is not 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.060
 should be enough 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.849
 as 1974 the first porsche turbo 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.760
 was presented for the already been 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:02.959
 big eyes and open mouths as well 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.120
 like the 2013 model a car was the one 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.250
 splits between everyday life and 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.159
 race track masters like no other 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.359
 a really near perfect car i 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.980
 must give it back soon 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:18.439
 That's why I'm happy to have another one 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:20.780
 It is allowed to turn a few rounds with it 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:23.530
 a small round but the shows like that 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.689
 all-wheel steering up to 50 km / h works 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.459
 28 degrees hit the rear wheels 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:31.099
 opposite to the front wheels 1 1 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.599
 unlikely small turning circle at 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.280
 higher speeds will be the 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.709
 then back wheels parallel to the 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.469
 steered at the front and so are curves 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.230
 for real pleasure next to the straight ones 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:44.569
 the incredible acceleration of the 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.760
 grippy brakes the lingering grin 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.900
 enjoy being in this porsche 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.900
 Is on the way
