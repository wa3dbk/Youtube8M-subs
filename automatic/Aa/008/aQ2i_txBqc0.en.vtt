00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
of everything and you can see i'm

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.799 
of everything and you can see i'm
dropping<00:00:35.670> everything<00:00:35.969> don't<00:00:36.329> even<00:00:36.539> if<00:00:36.690> you

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
dropping everything don't even if you

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.060 
dropping everything don't even if you
it's<00:00:36.989> probably<00:00:37.289> better<00:00:37.440> if<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.649> have<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> full

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
it's probably better if you have a full

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.560 
it's probably better if you have a full
inventory<00:00:38.339> i<00:00:38.640> did<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:38.969> halfway<00:00:39.149> through<00:00:39.510> it

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
inventory i did that halfway through it

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.029 
inventory i did that halfway through it
because<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.839> started<00:00:40.079> taking<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.440> lot<00:00:40.620> longer<00:00:40.649> i

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039 
because it started taking a lot longer i

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:42.619 
because it started taking a lot longer i
just<00:00:41.219> picked<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.489> everything<00:00:41.969> exited<00:00:42.420> joined

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
just picked up everything exited joined

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.840 
just picked up everything exited joined
back<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.230> saves<00:00:43.440> what<00:00:43.710> i<00:00:43.739> have<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.609> then

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
back and so it saves what i have so then

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.970 
back and so it saves what i have so then
after<00:00:45.690> i<00:00:45.929> have<00:00:46.079> everything<00:00:46.320> there<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.890> you

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
after i have everything there that you

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.860 
after i have everything there that you
want<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.489> doesn't<00:00:47.999> matter<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.210> can<00:00:48.329> if<00:00:48.719> you

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
want and doesn't matter you can if you

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.180 
want and doesn't matter you can if you
have<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.170> three<00:00:49.350> people<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:49.859> this<00:00:49.980> who

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
have like three people to do this who

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.470 
have like three people to do this who
this<00:00:50.399> would<00:00:50.519> probably<00:00:50.609> be<00:00:50.850> better<00:00:51.089> so<00:00:51.449> uh

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
this would probably be better so uh

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.779 
this would probably be better so uh
anyway<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.649> i'm<00:00:52.859> going<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.100> go<00:00:53.159> the<00:00:53.309> dashboard

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
anyway so i'm going to go the dashboard

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:54.979 
anyway so i'm going to go the dashboard
as<00:00:53.879> soon<00:00:53.999> as<00:00:54.089> job<00:00:54.300> everything<00:00:54.600> then<00:00:54.749> speed

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
as soon as job everything then speed

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.119 
as soon as job everything then speed
this<00:00:55.109> up<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.559> guys<00:00:55.679> don't<00:00:55.800> need<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> watch

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
this up so you guys don't need to watch

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.149 
this up so you guys don't need to watch
them<00:00:56.339> go<00:00:56.429> through<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.699> whole<00:00:56.789> process<00:00:57.769> and<00:00:58.769> I

00:00:59.149 --> 00:00:59.159 
them go through the whole process and I

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.309 
them go through the whole process and I
doing<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.579> actually<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.390> recorded

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:01.319 
doing this actually it recorded

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:03.020 
doing this actually it recorded
registers<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:02.069> you<00:01:02.219> still<00:01:02.460> have<00:01:02.640> your<00:01:02.819> stuff

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
registers as you still have your stuff

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.549 
registers as you still have your stuff
but<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.569> still<00:01:03.749> in<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.960> game<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.440> can

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
but it's still in the game so you can

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.900 
but it's still in the game so you can
actually<00:01:04.680> duplicate<00:01:05.190> your<00:01:05.280> items<00:01:05.550> with<00:01:05.730> this

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
actually duplicate your items with this

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.450 
actually duplicate your items with this
and<00:01:06.120> you<00:01:06.690> can<00:01:06.720> also<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.620> starts<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.010> leg<00:01:08.280> to

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
and you can also it starts like leg to

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.950 
and you can also it starts like leg to
game<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.850> overloads<00:01:09.330> everything<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.810> makes

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
game and overloads everything and makes

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.290 
game and overloads everything and makes
everything<00:01:10.200> really<00:01:10.470> really<00:01:10.940> glitchy<00:01:11.940> and

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
everything really really glitchy and

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.970 
everything really really glitchy and
framerate<00:01:12.600> issues<00:01:12.930> start<00:01:13.470> popping<00:01:13.770> up<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
framerate issues start popping up and

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.790 
framerate issues start popping up and
just<00:01:14.130> gets<00:01:14.370> really<00:01:15.050> really<00:01:16.050> glitchy<00:01:16.350> after<00:01:16.740> a

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
just gets really really glitchy after a

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.250 
just gets really really glitchy after a
while<00:01:16.980> so<00:01:17.310> uh<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.820> see<00:01:18.120> as<00:01:18.510> you<00:01:18.690> can<00:01:18.810> see<00:01:18.960> even

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
while so uh and see as you can see even

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.810 
while so uh and see as you can see even
though<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.890> selecting<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> game<00:01:20.550> device

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
though the selecting the game device

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.510 
though the selecting the game device
starts<00:01:20.970> slow<00:01:21.480> up<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.470> there<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.770> i<00:01:22.890> did

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
starts slow up to so there it is i did

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.460 
starts slow up to so there it is i did
that<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.730> i<00:01:24.330> joined<00:01:24.690> and<00:01:24.900> gifs<00:01:25.080> keep<00:01:25.230> feeling

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
that and i joined and gifs keep feeling
