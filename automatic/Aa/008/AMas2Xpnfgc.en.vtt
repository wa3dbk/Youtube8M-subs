00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the smallest amount of time how do i

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.560 
the smallest amount of time how do i
like<00:01:13.590> how<00:01:13.770> tough<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.610> only<00:01:14.850> point<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.390> from

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
like how tough is only point is from

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.820 
like how tough is only point is from
when<00:01:15.780> they<00:01:15.900> win<00:01:16.049> against<00:01:16.259> Real<00:01:16.470> Madrid
