hey<00:00:06.850> what<00:00:07.060> we're<00:00:07.210> doing<00:00:07.480> now<00:00:07.660> is<00:00:07.689> after<00:00:08.320> this

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.440 
hey what we're doing now is after this

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.940 
hey what we're doing now is after this
has<00:00:08.620> been<00:00:08.740> cured<00:00:09.160> is<00:00:09.850> scraping<00:00:10.299> back<00:00:10.950> the

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950 
has been cured is scraping back the

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.930 
has been cured is scraping back the
epoxy<00:00:12.840> with<00:00:13.840> a<00:00:13.869> little<00:00:14.549> actually<00:00:15.549> a<00:00:15.580> small

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
epoxy with a little actually a small

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.070 
epoxy with a little actually a small
plane<00:00:16.420> blade<00:00:16.810> that<00:00:17.440> uses<00:00:17.860> a<00:00:17.890> scraper<00:00:19.020> it's<00:00:20.020> a

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
plane blade that uses a scraper it's a

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.050 
plane blade that uses a scraper it's a
lot<00:00:20.289> more<00:00:20.470> efficient<00:00:21.130> than<00:00:21.250> using<00:00:21.550> a<00:00:21.820> piece<00:00:22.030> of

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
lot more efficient than using a piece of

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.270 
lot more efficient than using a piece of
sandpaper<00:00:22.420> which<00:00:23.140> will<00:00:23.320> just<00:00:23.530> clogged<00:00:23.800> up<00:00:24.040> on

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:24.280 
sandpaper which will just clogged up on

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.529 
sandpaper which will just clogged up on
ya<00:00:24.460> this<00:00:24.700> gets<00:00:24.940> a<00:00:25.030> lot<00:00:25.390> of<00:00:25.450> the<00:00:25.690> material<00:00:26.320> law

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
ya this gets a lot of the material law

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:37.500 
ya this gets a lot of the material law
quite<00:00:28.539> quickly<00:00:32.910> make<00:00:33.910> short<00:00:34.300> order<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:37.180> doing

quite quickly make short order and doing

00:00:37.510 --> 00:01:50.000 
quite quickly make short order and doing
a<00:00:37.540> fairly<00:00:38.079> large<00:00:38.440> surface

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.190 

you<00:01:51.010> can<00:01:51.160> see<00:01:51.400> the<00:01:51.580> shavings<00:01:51.850> of<00:01:52.330> boxee<00:01:53.050> it

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
you can see the shavings of boxee it

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.750 
you can see the shavings of boxee it
picked<00:01:53.500> up<00:01:53.680> some<00:01:53.920> of<00:01:54.010> the<00:01:54.070> color<00:01:54.340> from<00:01:54.730> the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
picked up some of the color from the

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.300 
picked up some of the color from the
wood<00:01:55.050> and<00:01:56.050> that's<00:01:56.350> one<00:01:56.560> of<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.710> reasons<00:01:57.100> you

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
wood and that's one of the reasons you

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.280 
wood and that's one of the reasons you
don't<00:01:57.340> want<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:58.000> leave<00:01:58.210> a<00:01:58.240> whole<00:01:58.660> bunch<00:01:59.020> of<00:01:59.170> it

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
don't want to leave a whole bunch of it

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.810 
don't want to leave a whole bunch of it
on<00:01:59.410> top<00:01:59.650> of<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.890> surface<00:02:00.310> is<00:02:00.430> that<00:02:00.610> it's<00:02:00.730> going

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
on top of the surface is that it's going

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.030 
on top of the surface is that it's going
to<00:02:00.910> end<00:02:01.030> up<00:02:01.210> making<00:02:01.600> it<00:02:01.690> look<00:02:01.870> cloudy<00:02:02.140> what<00:02:02.920> you

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
to end up making it look cloudy what you

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.070 
to end up making it look cloudy what you
really<00:02:03.310> want<00:02:03.610> to<00:02:03.700> end<00:02:03.820> up<00:02:03.970> with<00:02:04.180> is<00:02:04.330> just<00:02:04.840> the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
epoxy filling the pores itself that will

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.350 
epoxy filling the pores itself that will
give<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:09.009> nice<00:02:09.250> clear<00:02:09.880> clean<00:02:10.410> finish<00:02:12.360> once

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
give you a nice clear clean finish once

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:38.390 
give you a nice clear clean finish once
you've<00:02:13.510> got<00:02:13.690> your<00:02:13.720> lacquer<00:02:14.020> on

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.740 

you<00:02:39.400> know<00:02:39.550> after<00:02:39.700> I've<00:02:39.970> assessed<00:02:40.330> this<00:02:40.600> I

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
you know after I've assessed this I

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
you know after I've assessed this I
don't<00:02:40.960> think<00:02:41.200> it's<00:02:41.320> going<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.650> require

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
don't think it's going to require

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.690 
don't think it's going to require
another<00:02:42.430> filling<00:02:43.000> session<00:02:43.480> there's<00:02:44.470> just

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
another filling session there's just

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.970 
another filling session there's just
barely<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:46.240> little<00:02:46.570> bit<00:02:46.720> there<00:02:46.990> and<00:02:47.230> as<00:02:47.920> i

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
barely a little bit there and as i

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.620 
barely a little bit there and as i
continue<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.640> scrape<00:02:48.940> i<00:02:49.090> think<00:02:49.300> i'll<00:02:49.450> have

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
continue to scrape i think i'll have

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.230 
continue to scrape i think i'll have
those<00:02:49.960> all<00:02:50.230> cleaned<00:02:50.590> up<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:51.100> then<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.030> little

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
those all cleaned up and then a little

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.750 
those all cleaned up and then a little
bit<00:02:52.390> of<00:02:52.510> ass<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:52.840> afterwards<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.740> she'll<00:02:54.430> be

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
bit of ass and afterwards and she'll be

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.140 
bit of ass and afterwards and she'll be
right<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.600> start<00:02:55.810> spraying
