00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.299
 vacuum prosthesis attachment system 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.040
 shins are most often prescribed to patients 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.050
 vascular pathologies in a patient 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.849
 initially disturbed circulation this 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:27.130
 the system allows at the expense of such countries 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:32.050
 massage effect and such treatment when 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:34.680
 walking improve plus here is another module 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.480
 harmony such a pump 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.420
 is located that regulates the vacuum 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.580
 inside-shaped culture sleeves 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.200
 required therapeutic effect 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.350
 prosthesis with a vacuum mount gives 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.620
 just being properly put on the process 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.989
 putting on the prosthesis begins with a boot in 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.410
 In this case, it is not silicone, but 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.840
 made of polyurethane it is turned out 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.540
 inside out and sort of untwisting in 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:11.790
 we put on the back now 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:14.340
 put on stockings and such movements 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.410
 usually the patient feels himself to eat 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.020
 there is air inside there is not all air from there 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.430
 expelled because the air will 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.920
 reason well for profuse perspiration 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.220
 when will be put on cult sleeves 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:35.340
 stocking canada turn outward edge 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:38.820
 trample on a little bit yes he comes in 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:43.409
 time in the offensive pump 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:48.390
 pump out the air and the system is sealed 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.670
 it is very important to touch on his knees to 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.530
 was with the skin so that there was no 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.700
 chelochku us brow tag will be conductor 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.280
 air and bottom is also very important to 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.340
 also the kneecap was in contact with 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.290
 plastic with a sleeve over the air 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.320
 dropped out of here then the system will 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.450
 hermetically not vacuum tightness 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.030
 fastening systems will result in strong 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.959
 by the piston movement they provoke 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.549
 education Mings and scuffs 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.610
 prosthetic handling will deteriorate a 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:23.030
 liner and knee pad will quickly come in 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.030
 worthlessness
