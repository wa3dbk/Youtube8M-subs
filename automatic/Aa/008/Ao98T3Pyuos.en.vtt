00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
last round game and which ended in a

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.310 
last round game and which ended in a
draw<00:00:11.030> could<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.179> describe<00:00:12.660> what<00:00:13.080> happened

yeah<00:00:13.920> actually<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.370> was<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.929> lucky<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.289> survive

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
yeah actually I was a lucky to survive

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.410 
yeah actually I was a lucky to survive
after<00:00:17.640> all<00:00:18.390> because<00:00:18.600> okay<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.170> mean<00:00:19.410> after<00:00:19.529> like

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
after all because okay I mean after like

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.660 
after all because okay I mean after like
let's<00:00:21.420> say<00:00:21.510> when<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:22.080> played<00:00:22.859> Queen<00:00:23.070> 84<00:00:23.430> I

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
let's say when I played Queen 84 I

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.439 
let's say when I played Queen 84 I
thought<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.420> will<00:00:24.570> have<00:00:24.720> some<00:00:25.519> attack<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:26.730> of

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
thought I will have some attack but of

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.460 
thought I will have some attack but of
course<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.810> was<00:00:27.949> laughing<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.519> was<00:00:30.480> just

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
course it was laughing and I was just

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.319 
course it was laughing and I was just
worse<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.009> then<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.820> well<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:34.130> assume<00:00:35.149> it<00:00:36.149> was

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
worse and then this well I assume it was

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.100 
worse and then this well I assume it was
just<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.829> almost<00:00:39.050> lost<00:00:40.050> at<00:00:40.230> some<00:00:40.890> point<00:00:41.100> but

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
just the almost lost at some point but

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.590 
just the almost lost at some point but
okay<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.140> mean<00:00:43.379> he<00:00:45.110> probably<00:00:47.480> missed<00:00:48.480> this

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
okay I mean he probably missed this

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.369 
okay I mean he probably missed this
exchange<00:00:49.260> sacrifice<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.820> then<00:00:51.809> okay<00:00:52.079> i<00:00:52.110> mean

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
exchange sacrifice and then okay i mean

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.830 
exchange sacrifice and then okay i mean
at<00:00:53.100> least<00:00:53.160> i<00:00:53.399> had<00:00:54.210> some<00:00:54.739> sort<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:56.570> play<00:00:57.570> and

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
at least i had some sort of play and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.270 
at least i had some sort of play and
okay<00:00:58.559> after<00:00:59.309> all<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.579> survived<00:01:00.980> this<00:01:01.980> year<00:01:02.250> I

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
okay after all I survived this year I

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.119 
okay after all I survived this year I
you<00:01:02.489> couldn't<00:01:02.969> retain<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.049> title<00:01:04.409> which<00:01:04.890> was

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
you couldn't retain the title which was

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.160 
you couldn't retain the title which was
of<00:01:05.400> course<00:01:05.460> tastic<00:01:06.090> result<00:01:06.360> last<00:01:06.630> year<00:01:06.930> but

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
of course tastic result last year but

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.359 
of course tastic result last year but
how<00:01:07.439> do<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.650> look<00:01:07.770> back<00:01:07.799> at<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> tournament

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
how do you look back at the tournament

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.820 
how do you look back at the tournament
as<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> whole<00:01:08.820> for<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.060> whole<00:01:09.210> team<00:01:09.740> last<00:01:10.740> year

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
as a whole for the whole team last year

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.719 
as a whole for the whole team last year
of<00:01:11.400> course<00:01:11.549> was<00:01:11.760> something<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:13.400> mean<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.610> was

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
of course was something I mean it was

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.749 
of course was something I mean it was
just<00:01:14.760> out<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:17.220> sky<00:01:17.659> this<00:01:18.659> time<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.900> was<00:01:19.020> I

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
just out of the sky this time it was I

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:26.030 
just out of the sky this time it was I
mean<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:21.180> will<00:01:21.330> still<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.970> probably<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:25.040> second

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
mean we will still be probably a second

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.940 
mean we will still be probably a second
which<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.250> still<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.479> course<00:01:27.799> I<00:01:29.150> mean<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
which is still of course I mean the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:38.080 
which is still of course I mean the
result<00:01:31.950> which<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.159> would<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:33.060> kinda<00:01:35.060> okay<00:01:36.060> with

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
result which we would be kinda okay with

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.160 
result which we would be kinda okay with
it<00:01:38.600> is<00:01:39.109> again<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:39.799> pretty<00:01:40.250> good<00:01:40.429> result<00:01:40.789> and

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
it is again a pretty good result and

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.410 
it is again a pretty good result and
maybe<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:42.619> will<00:01:42.740> again<00:01:43.460> stay<00:01:43.939> ahead<00:01:44.060> of<00:01:44.179> the

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
maybe you will again stay ahead of the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.749 
maybe you will again stay ahead of the
many<00:01:44.899> strong<00:01:45.170> Russian<00:01:45.530> teams<00:01:45.770> what<00:01:46.579> is<00:01:46.700> the

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
many strong Russian teams what is the

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.099
