 the channel by igor and in a gameplay of 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.769
 promotion that first before the gameplay 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.929

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.650
 youtubers that we are small that still 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.380
 we have not made much progress in the community 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.980
 and the truth is one of the few great 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.750
 so to speak it helps us to take out 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.910
 go ahead our channels and the truth is 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.910
 thank you very much 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.630
 and well, I do not know, it also has a 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.059
 incredible channel I do not know the truth a 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.930
 thanks and a hug for you and for 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.360
 igor and you deserve it 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.830
 and well I'll walk to explain 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.570
 first always and then we will go to the 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.010
 presentation of my channel not because this 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.210
 it's a promotion gameplay and obviously 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.170
 I have to explain what I upload in my 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.940
 channel and good at is primarily a 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.760
 gameplay entered the root map in 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.120
 terrestrial warfare with the pwc silencer 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.900
 and butt only two accessories not three 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.330
 silencer and butt that the truth is going 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.340
 very well and the pet w as you know it is 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.530
 a cheto although the last one in the last 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.300
 update the truth has been removed 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.930
 much the removed much strength and power 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.810
 and it is not the same as it was before the pwc 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.640
 and good in a gameplay of 115 low has 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.100
 caught respawn in root as you know 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.080
 the map that never touches root 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.570
 in game mode you will ask me 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.530
 playing on earth the truth 9 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.939
 against 9 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.400
 it is easier to remove the gameplays from 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.270
 115 casualties of more than 115 casualties or 115 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.780
 getting off and good 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.329
 as you can see the typical gusts of casualties 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.329
 v sad dogs and the swarm the truth 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.610
 they kill a lot those are the typical gusts 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.619
 or not maybe they can be where the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.179
 swarm dog but you most 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.189
 I recommend you go up swarming dogs 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.979
 according to the level you have in call of 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.020
 duty you can use those those streaks 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.659
 I recommend you if you have confidence in 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.659
 yeah you think you can 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.909
 take out the gusts put the swarm 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:08.039
 and if you think that you can not reach 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.619
 so much that you can not get it out 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.540
 on the run or that you did not take it out 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:21.030
 never and you are so to speak novices 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:23.190
 put a guardian and uve sato missile 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.079
 extreme something that can be linked a lot 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.310
 better and good then good I continue this is a 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.470
 gameplay russian dow like me always 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.269
 game I always play russia no no me 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.700
 like for half a minute 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.500
 I run all over the map and on one side 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.010
 to another look for the enemies to catch them 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.060
 by the backs of the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.120
 lack forgive and I 'm not caught 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.920
 unawares and good as I have already said 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.260
 I will move on to the presentation of my 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.030
 channel and you may wonder what I'm doing I 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.250
 right here I asked him for a gameplay of 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.769
 promotion to polidori and here I am and 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.950
 Well, I'm going to explain myself now 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.440
 I have 200 almost 250 subscribers I do not know if 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.760
 when I upload to the video if it is that 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.000
 goes up 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.110
 and I'll have the 250 subscribers 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.110
 I would really like a lot 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.810
 well, I currently have two hundred 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.070
 450 subscribers sorry 450 subscribers 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.960
 and I have almost 150 videos as I said 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.580
 150 videos that the truth was a video 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.530
 every two days and the truth that's a lot 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.150
 effort even if you do not believe it render 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.400
 go up and all that because I have a 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.220
 4 gigabytes ram's computer 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.470
 I think and an internet that they take me 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.910
 they arrive to me a mega arrives me simply 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.260
 and good that usually goes up call of duty that 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.320
 It is rare for people to climb face tuti not 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.120
 but good clear that useful the typical not 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.710
 I upload the same gameplays as all the 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.540
 world that has difference to my channel 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.080
 because my channel has the difference that I 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.850
 I deal with important issues dealt with issues 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.490
 Juicy did not address issues that could 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.560
 interest people for example is 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.880
 this time of this fashion that is being 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.500
 taking with the bots that have left 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.910
 some great I will not explain more 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.430
 because it's the igor channel and it does not 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.430
 I want to put shit 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.799
 and this is a good new channel as you see 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.500
 I deal with important issues of 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.629
 currently in the channel not simply a 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.079
 temple and commented comment gameplay 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:22.019
 I already talk about topics 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.400
 controversial is so to speak yes and I do not know 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.259
 that's what differs from my channel 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.210
 from other channels because I think there are 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.280
 few of those I do not usually comment on the field 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.150
 and commented to rajatabla because the truth 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:37.490
 I do not like it and I think it does not entertain 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:39.340
 and good as many people ask me 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.610
 just play russian do as I said 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:48.380
 without stopping not looking for the enemies 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:50.810
 behind catching them from behind and I do not know 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.060
 go a little unnoticed among the 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.980
 enemies and well I'm going to make you a 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.290
 small day since I'm here and the 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.180
 gameplay is very long of what kind it 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.220
 uses of classes I recommend you then I 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.680
 I recommend it of course the double p 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.060
 with silencer and cylinder head or put on now 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.490
 after the update does not 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.620
 I also recommend the pw with the butt and 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.450
 quick charger because the muffler will 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.720
 It puts a lot of recoil to the weapon and the truth 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:17.720
 that they have spoiled it enough I believe and 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.090
 I also recommend that of smc with 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.890
 silencer or without silencer depends on 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.390
 every taste if you want to catch them 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.400
 behind and you are more stealthy the 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:30.020
 one hundred percent silencer or if not the 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.880
 cylinder head and the quick and good charger 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.760
 assault rifles I recommend the era in 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.160
 the 94 the truth is the best the best 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.290
 assault rifle I believe with butt and 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.060
 unsheathed I think it's one of the 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.010
 best not to say the best rifle in 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.190
 assault and I think that one of the best 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.930
 guns of the canon tip the cox-2 and good 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.630
 These are some small weapons that 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.690
 I recommend going to try them if not 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.740
 you can also try them there are also shotguns 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.400
 like the remington 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.169
 it's very good that's one of the best 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.599
 Sometimes you make agile marks sometimes it's not a 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.789
 little irregular but nothing happens and 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:06.349
 good for all of you also the 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:08.150
 that you like the competitive my channel goes 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:10.250
 to start playing competitive is going to 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.599
 start to climb competitive because I 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.460
 before I played in a modern warfare 3 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:16.039
 dedicate almost all the modern game 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.440
 warfare 3 to play competitive and I left it 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.300
 and I completely ignored the subject and 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.490
 the truth I want to come back I have many 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.490
 win for all of them lovers of 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.080
 competitive and you will have videos and good 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.880
 quiet that not only his mouth to the 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.639
 multiple the two I also upload 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.590
 battlefield 3 the good a game the 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.820
 truth that is very cucumber is a game 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.680
 very good newly purchased 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.660
 and the truth in a game that has 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.720
 surprised I thought it was worse 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.370
 truth is very good and we do not know 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.930
 I recommend that you buy it if you do not 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.400
 you have but a lot of people know it and 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.170
 many people have it so I guess that 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.440
 you will have tasted it you have tasted it 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:55.080
 used sometime but good you will have me 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.060
 variety in the channel you to me 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.380
 like to interact with subscribers 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.510
 because the truth I think is the best 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.790
 what can I do that is to know what 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.860
 like to go up to everyone knows what you 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.230
 what games do you like if a lot of people 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.260
 he tells me for example to make a wal club 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.970
 of spiderman for example let's say then I 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.710
 obviously I do it to me I do not care 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.880
 buy a game if people do 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.500
 like for example I bought the 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.900
 battlefield so that people like it 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.100
 and see more my videos and vote and all that 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.160
 because it 's what I like most about 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:25.590
 youtube and well then this is all almost 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.570
 all there is no gameplay left as you see 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.740
 I have 15 very fast casualties with the 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:32.100
 dogs and the swarm that make a 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.690
 massacre and you will see maybe you will see 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.720
 seen always and a little bit cut off because 

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.790
 I have cut the 

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.980
 the boring parts of the gameplay by 

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.800
 so to say so that you are entertained 

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:45.380
 always and good then here I say goodbye 

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.990
