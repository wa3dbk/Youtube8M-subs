00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.650
 from 170 € 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.550

 I asked to be positive 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.180
 a new explosion that originated its turn in the year 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.180

 one thing is right 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.230
 what moves them 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.510
 has the same passion 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.760
 In the next years 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.170
 extinct we have 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.650
 the way I like it 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.890
 in 2010 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.060
 Tavares treasures your car. 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.060

 jussara several people we do not know 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.110
 What I'm going to say about the case of writing that I 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.149
 the committee this then the head of the Guinean government ministerial processes can 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.389
 make the charges 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.389
 the leader of cds-pp paulo doors is a passion 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.220
 I think they are not included in the debate 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.939
 however that the criminal process for all q 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.679
 background keeping a passion population 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.939
 and after that passion of 20 cents and the sectors 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:30.399
 to a defensive shot 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:32.619
 much was that 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.069

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:39.979
 enthusiasts toni bruise already in their vehicles and go that the two wings go 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:41.509
 affect the process people 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:44.699
 I will comment implies in case of victory 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:46.159
 then she 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.289
 in these situations 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:49.719
 the course treats 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:51.389
 because there is less traffic 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.659
 they are aware that they are living there today and the Portuguese authorities 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.919
 are also increasingly aware of this phenomenon 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.590

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:07.429
 attitudes of this meeting 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:10.299
 I'm not a criminal 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.079
 if not more 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.849
 like any other area 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.080
 the athlete was caught with the hand they travel 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.080
 I just think it's a sign that one in the US
