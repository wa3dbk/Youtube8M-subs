00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.110
 the oceans cover 70% of the earth's surface and contain more 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.110
 of 20 thousand species of fish 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:16.160
 of this 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
 370 are sharks 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:27.719
 before the dinosaurs existed the sharks were already in the act 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.930
 appeared more than 400 million years ago and have changed very little in the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.930
 last 100 million years 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.010
 at present few species on earth instill so much respect 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.290
 iniesta 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.300
 these amazing predators occupy the upper part of the food chain 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.060
 Marine 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.620
 by eliminating the weak and injured they help maintain an ecosystem and 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.620
 balanced 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.360
 sharks are very well adapted hunting machines that depend on their 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.820
 specialized senses to hunt their prey 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.260
 using his developed sense of hearing 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.310
 can detect sound vibrations 900 meters away 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.479
 they are especially sensitive to low frequency pulsations 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.479
 produced by the dam that are struggling 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.890
 the vibrations of this high speaker produce sounds that resemble the 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.009
 of a wounded animal 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.009
 mexican sharks 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.470
 your sense of smell comes into play when you approach the press 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.780
 can detect a single drop of blood in more than 100 liters of water 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.159
 the water flows through your nose located in the lower part of your face and you 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.159
 provides a lot of olfactory information 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.810
 inside of his face he also has some forums that give us a substance 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.469
 gelatinous 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:15.079
 they collect the electrical signals that are produced when an animal moves 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.379
 they are like an extra sense that helps sharks find their prey yet 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.379
 when it is hidden in the sand 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.369
 When we think of sharks, we can not stop thinking about their lives 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:36.119
 sharks use and lose their customers all the time 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:41.449
 some species lose as many as 30 thousand during their life 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.449
 but the replacements are always there 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:50.649
 the rows of teeth allow a new one to be placed where it is needed 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:58.680
 in addition to their reputation something else that distinguishes their skeleton 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.479
 is formed by strong and flexible cartilages instead of bones 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:10.719
 the cartilages are lighter than the judges and when the sharks swim 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.809
 they use less energy than fish with skeleton partners 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.299
 a hard skin covers your aerodynamic body 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.239
 structures like small teeth will give your skin a texture 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.239
 similar to the sandpaper that protects them from burns 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:31.639
 these clients are pointing backwards to reduce resistance to 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.639
 water when nothing 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:39.019
 So many advantages make sharks one of the most efficient 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.019
 predators of the 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.899
 many of them are designed to attack but not all of them do 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.559
 actually most sharks do not attack man 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.329
 oo 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.239
 we still have a lot to learn from these mysterious and misunderstood 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:06.740
 creature 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.520
 Asa scientists continue to visit their secrets
