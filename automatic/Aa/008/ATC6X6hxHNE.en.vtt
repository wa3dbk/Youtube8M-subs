00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
has a lot of overhead cables and this is

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.380 
has a lot of overhead cables and this is
quite<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.160> tall<00:02:08.429> vehicle<00:02:08.850> how<00:02:09.030> did<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.270> get

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
quite a tall vehicle how did you get

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.260 
quite a tall vehicle how did you get
around<00:02:09.600> that<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:10.259> being<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.649> problem<00:02:10.979> as<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
around that not being a problem as the

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.530 
around that not being a problem as the
vehicle<00:02:13.050> was<00:02:13.230> made<00:02:13.650> in<00:02:13.980> Slovakia<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:15.000> was<00:02:15.270> made

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
vehicle was made in Slovakia it was made

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.990 
vehicle was made in Slovakia it was made
so<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.440> fits<00:02:16.830> underneath<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.520> cables

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
so that it fits underneath the cables

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.720 
so that it fits underneath the cables
it's<00:02:18.450> much<00:02:18.720> shorter<00:02:18.750> than<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.890> ones<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:20.460> are

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
it's much shorter than the ones that are

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.080 
it's much shorter than the ones that are
running<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:21.240> in<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.960> UK<00:02:22.110> it's<00:02:22.620> only<00:02:23.090> four

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
running in in in the UK it's only four

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.320 
running in in in the UK it's only four
meters<00:02:24.510> high<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:25.740> also<00:02:26.190> means<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.940> it's

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
meters high that also means that it's

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
meters high that also means that it's
not<00:02:27.630> really<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:29.310> upper<00:02:29.580> part<00:02:29.819> is<00:02:30.030> not<00:02:30.600> very

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
not really the upper part is not very

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.100 
not really the upper part is not very
comfortable<00:02:32.130> for<00:02:32.430> taller<00:02:32.760> people<00:02:32.880> as<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.900> am

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
comfortable for taller people as I am

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.620 
comfortable for taller people as I am
but<00:02:34.380> people<00:02:35.069> are<00:02:35.160> suppose<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.490> sit<00:02:35.850> there<00:02:36.120> not

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
but people are suppose to sit there not

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.559 
but people are suppose to sit there not
too<00:02:36.840> steep<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.790> now<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.850> driver<00:02:39.150> looks<00:02:39.420> like

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
too steep and now the driver looks like

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.120 
too steep and now the driver looks like
he<00:02:39.690> had<00:02:39.840> his<00:02:39.930> hands<00:02:40.200> full<00:02:40.319> what<00:02:40.590> sort<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:40.830> extra

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
he had his hands full what sort of extra

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.770 
he had his hands full what sort of extra
training<00:02:41.430> does<00:02:41.730> he<00:02:41.880> receive<00:02:42.180> for<00:02:42.480> driving

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
training does he receive for driving

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.580 
training does he receive for driving
this<00:02:42.870> vehicle<00:02:43.020> from<00:02:43.740> what<00:02:43.980> he<00:02:44.130> said<00:02:44.490> it's<00:02:44.819> not

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
this vehicle from what he said it's not

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.699 
this vehicle from what he said it's not
so<00:02:46.590> different<00:02:46.860> from<00:02:47.190> driving<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.940> normal<00:02:48.360> bus

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
so different from driving a normal bus

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.930 
so different from driving a normal bus
basically<00:02:49.709> he<00:02:49.860> just<00:02:50.100> needs<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.430> get<00:02:50.580> used<00:02:50.819> to

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
basically he just needs to get used to

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.300 
basically he just needs to get used to
the<00:02:51.090> height<00:02:51.350> can<00:02:52.350> we<00:02:52.470> expect<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.830> see<00:02:52.980> any<00:02:53.160> more

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
the height can we expect to see any more

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.340 
the height can we expect to see any more
of<00:02:53.370> these<00:02:53.520> in<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.760> future

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
of these in the future

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.930 
of these in the future
interesting<00:02:55.350> question<00:02:55.980> but<00:02:56.190> unfortunately<00:02:56.910> I

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
interesting question but unfortunately I

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.020 
interesting question but unfortunately I
cannot<00:02:57.270> answer<00:02:57.629> it<00:02:57.959> just<00:02:58.080> yet<00:02:58.980> we'll<00:02:59.730> see

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
cannot answer it just yet we'll see

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.770 
cannot answer it just yet we'll see
we'll<00:03:00.510> see<00:03:00.540> if<00:03:01.049> if<00:03:01.349> it

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
we'll see if if it

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.480 
we'll see if if it
a<00:03:01.810> pillar<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.350> from<00:03:02.590> what<00:03:02.800> I've<00:03:02.980> seen<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.430> think

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
a pillar and from what I've seen I think

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.460 
a pillar and from what I've seen I think
it<00:03:03.730> will<00:03:03.910> be<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:04.840> we<00:03:04.990> might<00:03:05.200> consider

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
it will be so we might consider

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.190 
it will be so we might consider
prolonging<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.760> maybe<00:03:07.450> leaving<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:07.959> for

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
prolonging it maybe leaving it for

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.020 
prolonging it maybe leaving it for
another<00:03:08.470> two<00:03:08.740> weeks<00:03:08.770> but<00:03:09.160> we'll<00:03:09.580> see<00:03:09.819> and

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
another two weeks but we'll see and

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.150 
another two weeks but we'll see and
we'll<00:03:10.090> keep<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:10.690> informed<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:14.620> vehicle<00:03:15.010> is

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
we'll keep you informed the vehicle is

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.040 
we'll keep you informed the vehicle is

however<00:03:23.140> has<00:03:23.380> meant<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.680> bus<00:03:23.860> was<00:03:24.040> planned

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
however has meant the bus was planned

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.100

I<00:03:34.480> had<00:03:34.870> done<00:03:35.019> it<00:03:35.170> for<00:03:35.380> eight<00:03:35.590> years<00:03:35.620> then<00:03:36.400> I

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
I had done it for eight years then I

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.670 
I had done it for eight years then I
took<00:03:36.700> a<00:03:36.820> break<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.450> then<00:03:37.690> I<00:03:37.840> returned<00:03:38.320> five

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
took a break and then I returned five

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.880 
took a break and then I returned five
years<00:03:38.920> ago<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:39.910> how<00:03:40.360> is<00:03:40.570> driving<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.470> two-story

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.850 
bus different from driving a normal bus
it's<00:03:46.090> really<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.630> same<00:03:46.840> as<00:03:47.050> driving<00:03:47.260> any<00:03:47.590> bus

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
it's really the same as driving any bus

it's really the same as driving any bus
all<00:03:48.220> you<00:03:48.400> have<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.730> do<00:03:48.910> is<00:03:49.150> bear<00:03:49.540> in<00:03:49.750> mind<00:03:49.989> that

all you have to do is bear in mind that

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.800 
all you have to do is bear in mind that
it's<00:03:50.650> taller<00:03:51.040> so<00:03:51.610> you<00:03:51.700> should<00:03:52.030> know<00:03:52.269> where<00:03:52.630> you

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
it's taller so you should know where you

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.740 
it's taller so you should know where you
can't<00:03:53.110> go<00:03:53.380> because<00:03:53.680> of<00:03:53.890> its<00:03:54.160> height<00:03:54.510> what<00:03:55.510> new

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
can't go because of its height what new

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.390 
can't go because of its height what new

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
that a lot of countries and a lot of

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.210 
that a lot of countries and a lot of
cities<00:05:28.440> are<00:05:29.600> already<00:05:30.600> having<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.500> buses<00:05:32.040> like

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
cities are already having the buses like

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.370 
cities are already having the buses like
this<00:05:32.520> one<00:05:32.760> so<00:05:33.480> I<00:05:33.510> don't<00:05:33.930> think<00:05:34.110> there<00:05:34.350> are

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
this one so I don't think there are

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.310 
this one so I don't think there are
copying<00:05:34.920> copying<00:05:35.190> London<00:05:35.910> so<00:05:36.630> it's<00:05:36.900> a<00:05:37.140> good

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
copying copying London so it's a good

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.010 
copying copying London so it's a good
idea<00:05:37.620> but<00:05:38.370> I<00:05:38.430> don't<00:05:38.730> think<00:05:39.000> it's<00:05:39.480> if<00:05:39.780> it's

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
idea but I don't think it's if it's

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.580 
idea but I don't think it's if it's
gonna<00:05:40.200> last<00:05:40.500> for<00:05:40.890> a<00:05:40.920> long<00:05:41.190> time<00:05:41.510> because

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
gonna last for a long time because

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.140 
gonna last for a long time because
because<00:05:43.590> I<00:05:43.710> think<00:05:43.800> it's<00:05:44.190> just<00:05:44.310> attraction<00:05:44.940> for

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150

because I think it's just attraction for
some<00:05:45.330> time<00:05:45.570> and<00:05:46.020> then<00:05:46.680> it<00:05:46.830> become<00:05:47.280> just<00:05:48.210> simple

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
some time and then it become just simple

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.770 
some time and then it become just simple
bus<00:05:48.980> dobri<00:05:49.980> now<00:05:50.100> it's<00:05:50.340> a<00:05:50.400> good<00:05:50.550> idea<00:05:50.910> recho<00:05:51.450> why
