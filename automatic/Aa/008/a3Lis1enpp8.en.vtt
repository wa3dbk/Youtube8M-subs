today<00:00:00.960> we're<00:00:01.170> changing<00:00:01.439> an<00:00:01.920> air<00:00:02.310> conditioning

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
today we're changing an air conditioning

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.099 
today we're changing an air conditioning
compressor<00:00:03.090> on<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.750> 96<00:00:04.560> Ford<00:00:04.680> Explorer<00:00:05.899> in<00:00:06.899> this

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
compressor on a 96 Ford Explorer in this

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.720 
compressor on a 96 Ford Explorer in this
step<00:00:07.379> I'm<00:00:07.589> going<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.830> demonstrate<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.490> proper

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
step I'm going to demonstrate the proper

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.879 
step I'm going to demonstrate the proper
service<00:00:09.269> procedure<00:00:09.300> for<00:00:09.809> reinstalling<00:00:10.410> your

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
service procedure for reinstalling your

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.070 
service procedure for reinstalling your
air<00:00:11.190> conditioning<00:00:11.730> manifold<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.630> back<00:00:12.840> of

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
air conditioning manifold to the back of

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.289 
air conditioning manifold to the back of
the<00:00:13.380> air<00:00:13.500> conditioning<00:00:13.950> compressor<00:00:14.210> what<00:00:15.210> we

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
the air conditioning compressor what we

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.510 
the air conditioning compressor what we
have<00:00:15.570> here<00:00:16.170> right<00:00:16.440> between<00:00:16.770> my<00:00:16.920> fingers<00:00:17.310> is

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
have here right between my fingers is

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.790 
have here right between my fingers is
the<00:00:17.880> air<00:00:18.029> conditioning<00:00:18.600> manifold<00:00:19.199> now<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
the air conditioning manifold now the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.090 
the air conditioning manifold now the
compressor<00:00:20.430> does<00:00:21.150> both<00:00:21.410> compress<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.650> drive

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
compressor does both compress and drive

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.279 
compressor does both compress and drive
fluid<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:23.970> also<00:00:24.119> generates<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.810> suction

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
fluid and it also generates the suction

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.109 
fluid and it also generates the suction
side<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.920> system<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.519> have<00:00:26.640> two<00:00:26.849> lines

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
side of the system so you have two lines

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.330 
side of the system so you have two lines
you<00:00:28.109> can<00:00:28.289> see<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> lines<00:00:29.039> actually

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
you can see that the lines actually

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.609 
you can see that the lines actually
protrude<00:00:30.119> through<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.810> base<00:00:31.019> block<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.529> the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
protrude through the base block of the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.410 
protrude through the base block of the
manifold<00:00:32.099> slightly<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:33.090> what<00:00:33.210> you're<00:00:33.329> going

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
manifold slightly so what you're going

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.819 
manifold slightly so what you're going
to<00:00:33.510> want<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.750> do<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.989> take<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.380> make<00:00:34.500> sure<00:00:34.680> that

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
to want to do is take and make sure that

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.860 
to want to do is take and make sure that
you<00:00:34.950> have<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.160> properly<00:00:35.489> aligned<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.210> that

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
you have it properly aligned and that

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.440 
you have it properly aligned and that
those<00:00:37.140> lines<00:00:37.500> will<00:00:37.950> seat<00:00:38.190> flat<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.239> back

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
those lines will seat flat to the back

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.819 
those lines will seat flat to the back
of<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> compressor<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:40.500> see<00:00:40.620> how<00:00:40.680> it's

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
of the compressor you can see how it's

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.610 
of the compressor you can see how it's
seated<00:00:41.010> nice<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.489> flat<00:00:41.700> there<00:00:42.590> make<00:00:43.590> sure

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
seated nice and flat there make sure

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.130 
seated nice and flat there make sure
that<00:00:44.489> it's<00:00:44.670> seated<00:00:44.879> flat<00:00:45.149> before<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.719> install

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
that it's seated flat before you install

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.319 
that it's seated flat before you install
and<00:00:46.559> begin<00:00:46.890> tightening<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.399> bolt<00:00:47.610> these

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
and begin tightening the bolt these

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.330 
and begin tightening the bolt these
lines<00:00:48.719> are<00:00:48.960> made<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.200> steel<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.980> back<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
lines are made of steel the back of the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.729 
lines are made of steel the back of the
compressor<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.910> made<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.420> soft<00:00:51.750> aluminum<00:00:52.260> if

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
compressor is made of a soft aluminum if

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.490 
compressor is made of a soft aluminum if
you<00:00:53.309> begin<00:00:53.760> driving<00:00:54.539> those<00:00:54.719> lines<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.320> and

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
you begin driving those lines in and

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.020 
you begin driving those lines in and
they're<00:00:55.590> not<00:00:55.620> lined<00:00:56.039> up<00:00:56.160> correctly<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.670> will

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
they're not lined up correctly you will

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.670 
they're not lined up correctly you will
damage<00:00:57.300> or<00:00:57.750> destroy<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.260> back<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.559> your

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
damage or destroy the back of your

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.010 
damage or destroy the back of your
compressor<00:00:59.239> once<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.660> lined<00:01:00.840> up

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
compressor once you have it lined up

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.450 
compressor once you have it lined up
make<00:01:01.199> sure<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.469> totally<00:01:01.770> flat<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.309> take

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
make sure it's totally flat you can take

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:17.630 
make sure it's totally flat you can take
and<00:01:02.640> begin<00:01:02.850> installing<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.390> bolt

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.370 

I'm<00:01:18.210> going<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.390> run<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.570> down<00:01:18.600> as<00:01:18.900> far<00:01:19.110> as<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.320> can

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
I'm going to run it down as far as I can

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.680 
I'm going to run it down as far as I can
by<00:01:19.680> hand<00:01:19.890> because<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:20.909> kind<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.300> a<00:01:21.420> tight
