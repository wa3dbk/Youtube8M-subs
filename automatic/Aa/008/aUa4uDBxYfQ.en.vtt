some more detailed information regarding
the<00:00:14.190> case<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.670> also<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.059> features<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.719> has<00:00:15.960> so

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
the case and also the features it has so

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.980 
the case and also the features it has so
the<00:00:16.800> case<00:00:16.980> will<00:00:17.250> provide<00:00:17.640> shock<00:00:18.119> absorption

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
the case will provide shock absorption

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.630 
the case will provide shock absorption

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
apply and remove and finally it's made

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.430 
apply and remove and finally it's made
with<00:00:34.829> anti<00:00:35.250> scratch<00:00:35.579> materials<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:37.140> without

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
with anti scratch materials so without

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.010 
with anti scratch materials so without
further<00:00:37.710> ado<00:00:38.070> let's<00:00:38.309> open<00:00:38.489> up<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.020> packaging

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
further ado let's open up the packaging

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.590 
further ado let's open up the packaging
and<00:00:40.200> actually<00:00:40.559> try<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.829> case<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.430> let's<00:00:42.239> first

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
and actually try the case on let's first

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.430 
and actually try the case on let's first
to<00:00:42.899> get<00:00:43.079> rid<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.739> placeholder<00:00:44.210> cardboard

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
to get rid of this placeholder cardboard

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.190 
to get rid of this placeholder cardboard
so<00:00:46.440> again<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:48.059> case<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.390> extremely

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
so again this is this case is extremely

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.740 
so again this is this case is extremely
lightweight<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.190> sleet<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.149> won't<00:00:51.420> add<00:00:51.719> a

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
lightweight and sleet so I won't add a

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.529 
lightweight and sleet so I won't add a
lot<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.739> extra<00:00:53.100> bulk<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.730> our<00:00:53.820> device<00:00:54.120> which<00:00:54.390> is

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
lot of extra bulk to our device which is

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.500 
lot of extra bulk to our device which is
great<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.410> now<00:00:55.620> let's<00:00:56.070> bring<00:00:56.280> over<00:00:56.579> our<00:00:56.730> moto<00:00:57.239> G

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
great so now let's bring over our moto G

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.959 
great so now let's bring over our moto G
and<00:00:57.690> apply<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.079> case<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.070> very<00:00:59.520> simple

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
and apply the case to it very simple

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:00.860 
and apply the case to it very simple
application

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
application

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.020 
application
I<00:01:00.899> recommend<00:01:01.739> inserting<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.340> bottom<00:01:02.760> portion

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
I recommend inserting the bottom portion

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.620 
I recommend inserting the bottom portion
of<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> device<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.049> first<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.830> after<00:01:05.250> that

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
of the device in first and after that

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.300 
of the device in first and after that
they'll<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.110> push<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.860> rest<00:01:08.100> of

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
they'll just have to push the rest of

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.940 
they'll just have to push the rest of
the<00:01:08.400> phone<00:01:08.640> into<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> case<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.659> finally<00:01:10.619> our

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
the phone into the case and finally our

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.690 
the phone into the case and finally our
moto<00:01:11.400> G<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:12.170> engulfed<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.530> glory<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.100> our

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
moto G is engulfed in the glory of our

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.450 
moto G is engulfed in the glory of our
case<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> phone<00:01:15.869> still<00:01:16.229> feels<00:01:16.619> great<00:01:16.950> even

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
case so the phone still feels great even

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.300 
case so the phone still feels great even
with<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.909> case<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.420> especially<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.890> now<00:01:20.100> with

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
with the case on especially and now with

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.260 
with the case on especially and now with
some<00:01:20.640> much-needed<00:01:20.930> protection<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:23.009> do

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
some much-needed protection so we do

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.609 
some much-needed protection so we do
have<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.540> circuit<00:01:24.930> board<00:01:25.110> pattern<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
have the circuit board pattern on the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.100 
have the circuit board pattern on the
back<00:01:25.830> which<00:01:26.100> with<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.820> bug<00:01:27.060> droid<00:01:27.180> robot<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
back which with the bug droid robot and

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.200 
back which with the bug droid robot and
the<00:01:28.259> cruiser<00:01:28.560> my<00:01:28.740> logo<00:01:28.950> contained<00:01:29.460> within<00:01:29.640> and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
the cruiser my logo contained within and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.179 
the cruiser my logo contained within and
it<00:01:30.390> helps<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:30.900> grip<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.439> well<00:01:31.650> which<00:01:32.159> is

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
it helps with grip as well which is

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.940 
it helps with grip as well which is
pretty<00:01:32.400> nice<00:01:32.939> other<00:01:33.930> than<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.710> case

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
pretty nice other than that the case

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.700 
pretty nice other than that the case
keeps<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.759> relatively<00:01:36.299> low<00:01:36.570> profile<00:01:37.140> with<00:01:37.470> all

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
keeps a relatively low profile with all

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.819 
keeps a relatively low profile with all
the<00:01:38.250> cutouts<00:01:38.790> for<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.329> ports<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:39.990> buttons<00:01:40.110> so

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
the cutouts for the ports and buttons so

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.300 
the cutouts for the ports and buttons so
you<00:01:40.860> still<00:01:41.540> will<00:01:42.540> have<00:01:42.570> access<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:44.009> all<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
you still will have access to all the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.370 
you still will have access to all the
functionality<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> power<00:01:46.290> button

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
functionality we have the power button

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.260 
functionality we have the power button
and<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.829> volume<00:01:46.979> buttons<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> right<00:01:47.970> here

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
and the volume buttons on the right here

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.270 
and the volume buttons on the right here
and<00:01:48.450> they're<00:01:48.720> actually<00:01:48.930> visible<00:01:49.619> not<00:01:49.829> covered

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
and they're actually visible not covered

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.850 
and they're actually visible not covered
which<00:01:50.549> makes<00:01:50.850> them<00:01:51.149> easier<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.570> press<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.500> top

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
which makes them easier to press up top

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.219 
which makes them easier to press up top
we<00:01:53.130> have<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.579> cutouts<00:01:54.000> for<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.360> 3.5

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
we have the cutouts for the 3.5

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.810
