hi this is my gavin ii with nitrous
express<00:00:06.620> today<00:00:07.550> we're<00:00:07.820> going<00:00:07.940> to<00:00:08.000> tell<00:00:08.210> you

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 
express today we're going to tell you

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.540 
express today we're going to tell you
how<00:00:08.600> nitrous<00:00:09.020> express<00:00:09.170> makes<00:00:09.770> big<00:00:10.070> horsepower

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.550 
how nitrous express makes big horsepower

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.690 
how nitrous express makes big horsepower
with<00:00:11.090> nitrous<00:00:11.420> oxide<00:00:11.840> now<00:00:12.620> nitrous<00:00:13.010> oxide<00:00:13.430> is

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
with nitrous oxide now nitrous oxide is

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.240 
with nitrous oxide now nitrous oxide is
a<00:00:13.730> cryogenic<00:00:14.570> expansion<00:00:15.200> gas<00:00:15.379> which<00:00:16.219> means

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
a cryogenic expansion gas which means

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.100 
a cryogenic expansion gas which means

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
to turn down and then it has to turn

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.990 
to turn down and then it has to turn
again<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.750> come<00:02:57.050> out<00:02:57.340> some<00:02:58.340> some<00:02:58.790> other
