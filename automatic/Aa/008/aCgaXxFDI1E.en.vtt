00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
basically got to do so basically you

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.670

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.010 
need to stock up underwear engrams
and<00:00:54.130> you<00:00:54.370> then<00:00:54.579> need<00:00:54.760> to<00:00:54.790> get<00:00:55.120> or<00:00:55.300> obtain<00:00:55.510> a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
and you then need to get or obtain a

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.830 
and you then need to get or obtain a
legendary<00:00:56.739> weapon<00:00:57.280> Engram<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:58.059> as<00:00:58.329> far<00:00:58.510> as<00:00:58.570> he

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
legendary weapon Engram and as far as he

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.420 
legendary weapon Engram and as far as he
states<00:00:59.170> this<00:00:59.350> does<00:00:59.590> not<00:00:59.739> work<00:00:59.980> with<00:01:00.219> the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
states this does not work with the

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.270 
states this does not work with the
legendary<00:01:00.850> arm<00:01:01.239> engrams<00:01:01.840> only<00:01:02.440> works<00:01:02.649> with

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280

legendary arm engrams only works with
legendary<00:01:03.850> weapon<00:01:04.239> Engram<00:01:04.570> so<00:01:04.780> basically<00:01:05.140> you

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
legendary weapon Engram so basically you

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.200 
legendary weapon Engram so basically you
stuck<00:01:05.649> up<00:01:05.680> on<00:01:05.890> your<00:01:06.039> where<00:01:06.280> England's<00:01:06.789> you

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
stuck up on your where England's you

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.660 
stuck up on your where England's you
then<00:01:07.450> need<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.660> obtain<00:01:07.899> there's<00:01:08.860> no<00:01:09.070> weapon<00:01:09.490> in

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.770 
then need to obtain there's no weapon in
clumps<00:01:09.970> from<00:01:10.090> somewhere<00:01:10.479> probably

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
clumps from somewhere probably

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.380 
clumps from somewhere probably

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
legendary weapon in glam you then need

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.219 
legendary weapon in glam you then need
to<00:01:21.280> head<00:01:21.550> over<00:01:21.729> to<00:01:21.789> the<00:01:21.940> cooktop<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.539> start

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
to head over to the cooktop and start

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.620 
to head over to the cooktop and start
decrypting<00:01:23.649> your<00:01:24.310> where<00:01:24.640> engrams<00:01:25.090> as<00:01:25.300> soon<00:01:25.509> as

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
decrypting your where engrams as soon as

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.240

you get a legendary at your where you

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.520 
you get a legendary at your where you
then<00:01:27.429> you<00:01:27.580> do<00:01:27.729> quickly<00:01:28.119> as<00:01:28.479> soon<00:01:28.780> as<00:01:28.959> possible

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
then you do quickly as soon as possible

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.370 
then you do quickly as soon as possible
decrypt<00:01:30.250> that<00:01:30.729> legendary<00:01:31.300> Engram<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:31.959> that

decrypt that legendary Engram and that

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.010 
decrypt that legendary Engram and that
way<00:01:32.619> you<00:01:32.979> will<00:01:33.160> get<00:01:33.340> an<00:01:33.580> exotic<00:01:34.179> weapon<00:01:34.720> this

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
way you will get an exotic weapon this

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.020 
way you will get an exotic weapon this
is<00:01:35.080> what<00:01:35.319> he<00:01:35.530> states<00:01:35.890> I'm<00:01:36.130> not<00:01:36.429> too<00:01:36.610> sure<00:01:36.849> about

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
is what he states I'm not too sure about

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.999 
is what he states I'm not too sure about
it<00:01:37.240> but<00:01:37.630> because<00:01:37.810> I've<00:01:38.110> got<00:01:38.259> plenty<00:01:38.500> of<00:01:38.740> layers

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
it but because I've got plenty of layers

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.070 
it but because I've got plenty of layers
and<00:01:39.220> I<00:01:39.640> do<00:01:39.700> have<00:01:40.090> two<00:01:40.300> legendary<00:01:40.810> weapon

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
and I do have two legendary weapon

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.990 
and I do have two legendary weapon
engrams<00:01:41.470> I'm<00:01:41.679> going<00:01:42.190> to<00:01:42.250> test<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.640> waters<00:01:42.970> on

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
engrams I'm going to test the waters on

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.699 
engrams I'm going to test the waters on
this<00:01:43.209> thing<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.539> see<00:01:43.690> if<00:01:43.750> it<00:01:43.869> really<00:01:44.110> works

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:44.709 
this thing and see if it really works

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:46.830 
this thing and see if it really works
now<00:01:45.009> hopefully<00:01:45.490> though<00:01:45.670> I<00:01:45.910> will<00:01:46.330> get<00:01:46.509> a<00:01:46.539> little

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
now hopefully though I will get a little

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.779 
now hopefully though I will get a little
bit<00:01:47.080> out<00:01:47.229> of<00:01:47.259> my<00:01:47.380> version<00:01:47.709> guys<00:01:48.069> know<00:01:48.280> how<00:01:48.459> bad

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
bit out of my version guys know how bad
