party for trying to push that through so

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.789 
party for trying to push that through so
the<00:01:13.920> time<00:01:14.130> Perkins<00:01:14.670> system<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:16.380> don't<00:01:16.500> get

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the time Perkins system is you don't get

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.179 
the time Perkins system is you don't get
to<00:01:16.950> vote<00:01:17.189> unless<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:18.240> pay<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.810> dollar<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.680> taxes

to vote unless you pay a dollar of taxes

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.969 
to vote unless you pay a dollar of taxes
but<00:01:20.939> what<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> really<00:01:21.689> think<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.500> should<00:01:22.860> be

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
but what I really think is it should be

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.070 
but what I really think is it should be
like<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> corporation<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.600> pay<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> million

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
like a corporation if you pay a million

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.170 
like a corporation if you pay a million
dollars<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.710> taxes<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.250> get<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.610> million<00:01:26.850> votes

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
dollars in taxes you get a million votes

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.010 
dollars in taxes you get a million votes
how's<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:29.720> well<00:01:30.720> it's<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.920> yeah<00:01:33.020> you're

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
how's that well it's a yeah you're

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.660 
how's that well it's a yeah you're
you're<00:01:34.380> right<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.890> don't<00:01:35.100> agree<00:01:35.220> with<00:01:35.400> you

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
you're right that I don't agree with you

you're right that I don't agree with you
it's<00:01:35.939> you're<00:01:36.600> wrong<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.530> I'm<00:01:37.680> angry<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.159> would

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
it's you're wrong that I'm angry I would

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.560 
it's you're wrong that I'm angry I would
point<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.030> flaw<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.390> your

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
point out to you the flaw in your

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.960 
point out to you the flaw in your
argument<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.229> since<00:01:41.009> everybody<00:01:41.579> pays

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
argument is that since everybody pays

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.120 
argument is that since everybody pays
sales<00:01:42.390> tax<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.990> anyone<00:01:43.320> who<00:01:43.439> drives<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.860> car

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
sales tax and anyone who drives a car

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.999 
sales tax and anyone who drives a car
pays<00:01:44.759> taxes<00:01:45.390> for<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.869> there<00:01:46.110> then<00:01:46.470> we're

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
pays taxes for that there then we're

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.620 
pays taxes for that there then we're
right<00:01:47.250> back<00:01:47.310> where<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:47.729> started<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.360> want

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
right back where we started in a want

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.210 
right back where we started in a want
the<00:01:48.750> wonderful<00:01:49.170> place<00:01:49.350> where<00:01:49.560> we've<00:01:49.680> evolved

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the wonderful place where we've evolved

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.580 
the wonderful place where we've evolved
