00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
gonna need more construction paper so

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:16.690 
gonna need more construction paper so
basically<00:01:15.289> what<00:01:15.649> we're<00:01:15.799> gonna<00:01:15.920> do<00:01:16.219> is<00:01:16.459> we're

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
basically what we're gonna do is we're

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.940 
basically what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:01:16.789> start<00:01:17.149> with<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:18.289> left<00:01:18.529> hand<00:01:18.709> side

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
gonna start with the left hand side

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:27.639 
gonna start with the left hand side
corner<00:01:19.520> here<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:26.060> we're<00:01:26.899> just<00:01:26.929> gonna<00:01:27.380> go

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
corner here and we're just gonna go

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.550 
corner here and we're just gonna go
ahead<00:01:27.979> and<00:01:28.840> start

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.410 

so<00:01:34.560> once<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.189> had<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.119> way<00:01:36.360> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
so once you have had it this way you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.999 
so once you have had it this way you
want<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.689> make<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> tight<00:01:37.290> cone

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
want to make a tight cone

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.580 
want to make a tight cone
so<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.909> see<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:39.330> is<00:01:39.420> no<00:01:39.630> space<00:01:39.689> over<00:01:40.380> there

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
so you see there is no space over there

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.969 
so you see there is no space over there
and<00:01:41.400> then<00:01:41.850> basically<00:01:42.330> just<00:01:43.729> go<00:01:44.729> ahead<00:01:44.850> and

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
and then basically just go ahead and

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.539 
and then basically just go ahead and
wrap<00:01:49.100> there<00:01:50.100> we<00:01:50.190> go

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
wrap there we go

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.310 
wrap there we go
now<00:01:50.820> if<00:01:50.940> you<00:01:51.149> want<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.450> make<00:01:51.600> them<00:01:51.750> thicker<00:01:52.049> you

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
now if you want to make them thicker you

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.020 
now if you want to make them thicker you
can<00:01:52.500> make<00:01:52.680> them<00:01:52.830> thicker<00:01:53.070> if<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.700> if<00:01:53.909> you

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
can make them thicker if you like if you

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.460 
can make them thicker if you like if you
want<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.299> make<00:01:54.450> them<00:01:54.600> thinner<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.170> do

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
want to make them thinner you can do

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.289 
want to make them thinner you can do
thinner<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.890> by<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.280> adjusting<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:57.060> cone

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
thinner and by just adjusting the cone

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.980 
thinner and by just adjusting the cone
here<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:58.310> get<00:01:59.310> different<00:01:59.549> sizes<00:01:59.990> now

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
here you can get different sizes now

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.270 
here you can get different sizes now
what<00:02:01.170> we're<00:02:01.320> gonna<00:02:01.500> do<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.830> I'm<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.009> gonna

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
what we're gonna do is I'm just gonna

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.330 
what we're gonna do is I'm just gonna
cut<00:02:02.789> it<00:02:03.240> right<00:02:03.869> there<00:02:04.340> come<00:02:05.340> here<00:02:05.610> with<00:02:05.789> my

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
cut it right there come here with my

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:18.080 
cut it right there come here with my
stapler<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:16.380> staple<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:17.040> but<00:02:17.700> I'm<00:02:17.850> still

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
stapler and staple it but I'm still

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.780 
stapler and staple it but I'm still
gonna<00:02:18.239> hold<00:02:18.510> on<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.870> because<00:02:19.260> it'll

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
gonna hold on to it because it'll

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.309 
gonna hold on to it because it'll
unravel<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.799> there's<00:02:22.880> our<00:02:23.880> sheet<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.540> foil<00:02:24.930> now

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
unravel so there's our sheet of foil now

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:36.380 
unravel so there's our sheet of foil now
put<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.400> down<00:02:26.610> like<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:33.110> just<00:02:34.700> leave<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.730> if

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
put it down like so just leave that if

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.569 
put it down like so just leave that if
you<00:02:36.569> want<00:02:36.840> I'm<00:02:37.110> just<00:02:37.260> gonna<00:02:37.410> put<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.680> up<00:02:40.579> and
