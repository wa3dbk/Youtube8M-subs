00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the feel it looks a little more like the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.439 
the feel it looks a little more like the
older<00:00:22.859> ones<00:00:23.070> when<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:23.789> all<00:00:24.090> put<00:00:24.119> together

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
older ones when it's all put together

only thing I don't like it has very poor
stamina<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.080> very<00:00:28.470> poor<00:00:28.769> attack<00:00:29.099> for<00:00:30.090> balance

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
stamina in very poor attack for balance

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.040 
stamina in very poor attack for balance
type<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.170> more<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.619> defense<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:33.050> even

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
type it's more of a defense and even

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.560 
type it's more of a defense and even
then<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.559> not<00:00:34.680> very<00:00:35.070> good<00:00:35.510> anyway<00:00:38.390> here<00:00:39.390> is

little so i can have these little corn
like<00:00:52.620> patterns<00:00:53.070> these<00:00:53.340> are<00:00:53.520> supposed<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.940> be

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
like patterns these are supposed to be

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.020 
like patterns these are supposed to be
horns<00:00:54.539> they<00:00:54.780> look<00:00:54.960> more<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.320> wings<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.829> me

but a student now I'm completely getting
off<00:00:59.489> track<00:00:59.820> here<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:00.390> stupidly<00:01:00.930> they<00:01:01.559> put<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
off track here but stupidly they put the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.570 
off track here but stupidly they put the
design<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.350> part<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.949> can't<00:01:05.220> see

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
design on the part that you can't see

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.980 
design on the part that you can't see
when<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> top<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.210> put<00:01:06.570> together<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.580> the

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
when the top is put together and the

when the top is put together and the
molding<00:01:09.990> he's<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.189> bottom<00:01:11.580> where<00:01:11.790> you

molding he's on the bottom where you

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.950 
molding he's on the bottom where you
can't<00:01:12.210> see<00:01:12.590> it's<00:01:13.590> kind<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.040> stupid<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
and the bull face bolt recoil design I

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.480 
and the bull face bolt recoil design I
would<00:01:35.530> have<00:01:35.649> done<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:35.829> little<00:01:36.069> different

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
would have done a little different

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.099 
would have done a little different
things<00:01:36.789> better<00:01:37.030> but<00:01:37.329> I'm<00:01:37.509> not<00:01:37.539> getting<00:01:37.960> into

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
things better but I'm not getting into

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:39.510 
things better but I'm not getting into
too<00:01:38.259> much<00:01:38.439> detail<00:01:38.859> because<00:01:38.950> I<00:01:39.130> don't<00:01:39.310> have<00:01:39.369> a

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
too much detail because I don't have a

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.919 
too much detail because I don't have a
lot<00:01:39.819> of<00:01:39.850> time<00:01:41.579> drop<00:01:42.579> the<00:01:42.880> bass<00:01:43.479> bolt<00:01:43.780> in<00:01:45.929> put

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
lot of time drop the bass bolt in put

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.420 
lot of time drop the bass bolt in put
the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.480 

the<00:01:50.970> track<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:52.160> tighten<00:01:53.160> it<00:01:53.220> all<00:01:53.310> together

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
the track on tighten it all together

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.270 
the track on tighten it all together
with<00:01:53.910> the<00:01:54.720> orange<00:01:55.140> assembly<00:01:55.830> cool<00:01:55.980> that<00:01:56.190> it

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
with the orange assembly cool that it

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.540 
with the orange assembly cool that it
comes<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:57.590> here<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:58.620> have<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.070> tip

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
comes with and here we have the tip

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.510 
comes with and here we have the tip
going<00:02:02.550> to<00:02:02.730> be<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:02.940> before<00:02:03.360> but<00:02:03.630> it's<00:02:03.870> a<00:02:04.520> tip

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
going to be this before but it's a tip

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.350 
going to be this before but it's a tip
that's<00:02:05.729> supposed<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:08.060> defensive<00:02:09.060> tip

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
that's supposed to be a defensive tip

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.470 
that's supposed to be a defensive tip
with<00:02:09.720> stamina<00:02:10.050> potential<00:02:10.830> because<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.880> has<00:02:12.060> it

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
with stamina potential because it has it

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.020 
with stamina potential because it has it
comes<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.959> point<00:02:13.020> at<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.620> very<00:02:13.830> end<00:02:14.070> if

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
comes to a point at the very end if

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.840 
comes to a point at the very end if
again<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.840> entire<00:02:16.440> top<00:02:16.709> is<00:02:16.980> more<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.400> defect

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
again the entire top is more of a defect

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.630 
again the entire top is more of a defect
a<00:02:18.060> defense<00:02:18.630> type<00:02:18.930> than<00:02:19.170> anything<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.890> really

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
a defense type than anything I really

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.820 
a defense type than anything I really
don't<00:02:20.790> like<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.209> much<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.990> mean<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.560> like

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
don't like it that much I mean I like

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.710 
don't like it that much I mean I like
the<00:02:22.980> way<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.220> looks<00:02:23.250> but<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:24.090> hate<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.570> way<00:02:24.690> it

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
the way it looks but I hate the way it

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.300
