00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.730
 to all 

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.340
 the friends of the audience in the audience 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.620
 of the fire of I promise with you 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.559
 gonzalo valdivia de ávila in this 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.409
 occasion I want to share a comic one 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.150
 juvenile adaptation of Don Quixote of the 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:18.750
 stain ' the ingenious gentleman 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.850
 what 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.550
 It was distributed by the publisher 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:29.419
 bruguera de barcelona in 1977 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.039
 it's exemplary I got a gift from an uncle 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.710
 relative 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:38.850
 when I had 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:41.190
 about 19 years old in 1980 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.680
 these two comics arrived a little late 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.450
 to Peru in the military government not 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:52.040
 they arrived very soon 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:56.120
 in this adaptation 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.490
 is a kind of summary the language 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.920
 it's simplified because it's for children 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:07.480
 from 9 to 10 years old and the characters the 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.480
 Most of the characters are generic 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.080
 starts with the Quixote in his village 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.310
 point to leave leads a family life and 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.530
 he's bored with her his niece and her 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.520
 housekeeper never have a name 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.289
 own 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.289
 also in the case of the landlord 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.650
 and the bags of 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.820
 of the inn the sale does not have a 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.220
 name that define them I suppose that 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.440
 one of them is maritornes 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.440
 the one that makes the most of Don Quixote 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.470
 I'm doing the demonstration the 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.590
 affirmation as a panning of all these 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.260
 figures these illustrations and they 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.410
 I offer 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:02.700
 do the scan page by page in 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:06.840
 high resolution very soon to upload it 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.940
 in a review similar to the one I'm 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.610
 doing now but where you with the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.980
 pause they will be able to appreciate each sheet 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.200
 stopped even read 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.870
 also on my facebook page the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.569
 Prometheus fire I'm going up all 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.569
 these pages one by one 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.470
 to the page of followers of the fire of 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.130
 I promise in a particular album for 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.770
 to be able to appreciate them all of you 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.240
 and there is a brief explanation as to 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:44.180
 I say is a kind of summary more is 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.220
 focuses on the action because it is for children 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.030
 Don Quixote is crushed when confronted 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.060
 with muleteers with merchants with 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.160
 delinquents with pastors and 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.390
 there is apparently no rest, but in 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.240
 the ninth 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.720
 if there is an interim between adventure and 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.460
 adventure or between encounter and encounter 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.890
 we do not have a Don Quixote that does not 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.200
 recharge your batteries in the novel 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.900
 even Don Quixote is given time to 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.290
 meditate on the novel does not give time 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.060
 to compose love poems your line is 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.970
 mentioned in this comic also of the 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.950
 cinema does not come out like a lady who 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.230
 imagine the gentleman in his mind not like 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.830
 a lovely lady like a donut and he 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.020
 and qatar 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:37.760
 Renaissance 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:43.420
 there is no vignette that shows us 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:48.020
 Dulcinea neither as a peasant nor as a lady 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.210
 lovely or like give me enchanted the 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.680
 episode of the Don Quixote Lions 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.760
 ceases to be called the gentleman of the 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.040
 sad figure for 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.040
 and call himself the knight of the lions 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.470
 as well 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.470
 camacho weddings appear 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:13.819
 where a young 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:16.910
 basilio taunts the guests and achieves 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.329
 marry as a last will with your 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.329
 loved 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.080
 the comic strikes as I say in the 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.510
 the Quixote and Sancho adventures up 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.260
 the episode of the mocking dukes 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.730
 of the 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.320
 that badly shows the magician berlin berlin 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.290
 also the wooden work full of 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.110
 explosives clavileño but in this comic 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:46.490
 leaves no name 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:51.040
 of this little trojan horse as well 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.040
 say it this little trick 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.550
 there are plenty 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.190
 scenes that are panoramic for the 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.099
 era of large open environments and 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:06.190
 I like that because it is how it could be 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:08.960
 take an animation for example in this 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.910
 fight is when 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.199
 the knight of the white moon abencia 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.800
 Don said have 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:17.319
 but there is editing is summarized 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.349
 because there is only the confrontation of 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:23.289
 sansón carrasco in his second 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:26.530
 incarnation of knight of the white 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:28.060
 moon and not like that of the mirrors when 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.360
 he faces like the gentleman in the 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.419
 mirrors loses before Don Quixote 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.460
 because his horse stumbles back from 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:39.159
 Don Quixote the priest and the barber also 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.840
 are the characters that try to return 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:46.020
 the gentleman to the sanity of 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.639
 to do it again of things 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.120
 from his farm Don Quixote dies 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:55.979
 redeemed 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:06:00.840
 he repents of his exploits 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.840
 named sancho his heir 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.860
 dies with his family and friends as 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:08.509
 witnesses 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.300
 Sanchez Carrasco dedicates the epitaph and 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:14.800
 here is a nod to the work of cervantes 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:18.840
 some vignettes dedicated to this character 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.270
 take care of them on the back cover 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.840
 therefore has a catalog of several figures 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:28.919
 of several novels most youth 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:31.370
 but the only classic on the list is don 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.370
 Quixote 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.940
 Well I hope you liked this 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:40.639

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:01.039
 titan handing the torch to a
