after drying it's all in these sheets I

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.920 
after drying it's all in these sheets I
wonder<00:03:56.859> if<00:03:56.920> that's<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.070> right<00:03:57.250> word<00:03:57.930> your

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
wonder if that's the right word your

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.390

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
student and it's as part of a class

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.610 
student and it's as part of a class
assignment<00:04:00.549> and<00:04:01.030> you<00:04:01.090> found<00:04:01.269> this<00:04:01.450> video<00:04:01.630> one

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
assignment and you found this video one

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.220 
assignment and you found this video one
of<00:04:02.709> your<00:04:02.829> tasks<00:04:03.250> is<00:04:03.400> to<00:04:03.430> see<00:04:03.700> whether<00:04:03.910> a<00:04:04.329> sheaf

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
of your tasks is to see whether a sheaf

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.430 
of your tasks is to see whether a sheaf
of<00:04:05.440> garlic<00:04:05.890> is<00:04:06.160> that<00:04:06.579> makes<00:04:06.760> sense<00:04:07.030> but<00:04:07.440> it's

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
of garlic is that makes sense but it's

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.250 
of garlic is that makes sense but it's
just<00:04:08.620> an<00:04:08.799> it<00:04:08.970> it's<00:04:09.970> a<00:04:10.120> guess<00:04:10.359> and<00:04:10.660> if<00:04:10.870> I<00:04:11.049> was<00:04:11.230> you
