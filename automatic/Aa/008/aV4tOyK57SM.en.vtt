00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.880
 and he loved me I take everyone 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.860
 know tirano I hope you're fine 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.939
 me it's going well, so I 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.439
 specify before anything else that I 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.759
 start over command tahri because 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.810
 precisely I make them I realized 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.009
 account I was a little soft in 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.939
 the same camp what is not my 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.439
 habit so I told myself we're going 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.520
 start again to give a little bit of 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.290
 punch then today we offer you 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.540
 a double dea does not have 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.120
 general melee intoxicated by this asia to 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.100
 the asm 1 on the map ascend power me 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.480
 really beautiful pleasure you will have the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.039
 player string in description 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 so I'm just debating the 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:45.510
 gameplay because today's gameplay 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.249
 will not be the main thing of the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.050
 video the commander harrie is really 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:50.190
 very important when you saw tool 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.289
 who will have and command tahri 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.769
 important to important videos 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.710
 matter I made a huge mistake yesterday 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.510
 I explain myself and I made a video 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.379
 let's say on the rage team that the team rage 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.650
 organizes at an ode and if a tournament for 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.690
 subscribers, but only 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.820
 turn was paying so 2 euros 50 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.830
 per player and each team was doing 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.659
 four players so we welcomed 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.220
 full of equipped so on playstation 3 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.930
 and playstation 4 it's still the case 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.370
 there will be a form in the in the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.380
 description if you want to participate 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.150
 but so before anything else I specify 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.310
 laurent roux I made this mistake two 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.130
 rounds are selling or just you 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.990
 to say that it paid off but not without 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.820
 tell you why so I explain myself 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.740
 so first of all the winners of 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.100
 hot tournament this odc will win 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.720
 helmet glasses glimmer tee shirt and 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.990
 it's full of little things that will 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.490
 add players and and youtuber 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.980
 of the team rachis wishes and it is 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.190
 to play with them it's finally either 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.260
 well, in a nutshell, not a big reason why we have 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.690
 made this tournament and it's at the death 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.420
 paying is simple 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.520
 simply because we have to 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.620
 the money that will be reaped to finance the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.270
 next team decerto de language 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.040
 so for all those who are not at 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.350
 current the new wave will actually get 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.539
 launch as a structure in 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.399
 welcoming a roster decerto who will 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.819

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.959
 she described etc lan what that 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.150
 I know it's just 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.060
 tournaments that are organized pretty much 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.810

 transport the steam ticket for you 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.090

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.280
 maybe around 50 60 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.720
