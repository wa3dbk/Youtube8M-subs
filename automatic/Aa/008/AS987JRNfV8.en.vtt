of leaning slightly to one side like so
and<00:00:47.160> then<00:00:47.340> underneath<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:51.260> kind<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.350> an

and then underneath that I kind of an

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.030 
and then underneath that I kind of an
angled<00:00:55.039> square

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.610 

take<00:00:59.790> your<00:00:59.970> time<00:01:00.240> to<00:01:00.540> position<00:01:00.720> this

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.770 

correctly<00:01:04.620> because<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.850> quite<00:01:06.120> it<00:01:06.510> will

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
correctly because it's quite it will

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.100 
correctly because it's quite it will
become<00:01:07.260> quite<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.590> crucial<00:01:08.870> measurement<00:01:09.870> later

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
become quite a crucial measurement later

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:18.650 
become quite a crucial measurement later
on<00:01:11.090> okay<00:01:15.020> next<00:01:16.020> we're<00:01:16.260> going<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.410> add<00:01:17.540> kind<00:01:18.540> of

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
on okay next we're going to add kind of

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.310 
on okay next we're going to add kind of
an<00:01:18.780> oval<00:01:19.110> shape<00:01:19.410> again<00:01:20.160> angled<00:01:21.020> in<00:01:22.020> this

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
an oval shape again angled in this

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.670 
an oval shape again angled in this
corner<00:01:22.830> here<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.690> I<00:01:24.690> may<00:01:24.930> very<00:01:25.200> well<00:01:25.410> have<00:01:25.650> to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
corner here and I may very well have to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.530 
corner here and I may very well have to
adjust<00:01:26.190> what<00:01:26.340> I'm<00:01:26.490> doing<00:01:26.850> as<00:01:26.940> I<00:01:26.970> go<00:01:27.180> along<00:01:27.270> as

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
adjust what I'm doing as I go along as

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.560 
adjust what I'm doing as I go along as
well<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.430> fact<00:01:29.640> I'm<00:01:29.790> already<00:01:30.030> doing<00:01:30.300> that

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
well so in fact I'm already doing that

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:39.050 
well so in fact I'm already doing that
gonna<00:01:31.050> move<00:01:31.170> over<00:01:31.350> with<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:34.970> side<00:01:37.820> okay<00:01:38.820> and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
gonna move over with it side okay and

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.300 
gonna move over with it side okay and
then<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.509> next<00:01:39.780> shape<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.680> very<00:01:40.920> strange

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
then the next shape is very strange

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.630 
then the next shape is very strange
really<00:01:41.880> I've<00:01:42.600> got<00:01:42.660> a<00:01:42.810> line<00:01:43.080> across<00:01:43.350> here

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.580

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
face like this I'm going to join up here

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.090 
face like this I'm going to join up here
they<00:02:44.570> will<00:02:44.780> will<00:02:45.050> eventually<00:02:45.709> become<00:02:45.830> the

they will will eventually become the
shoulders<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:47.690> then<00:02:47.840> going<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.140> create<00:02:48.860> a

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
shoulders and then going to create a

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.600 
shoulders and then going to create a
shape<00:02:49.490> running<00:02:50.500> across<00:02:51.500> here<00:02:51.620> this<00:02:52.250> will<00:02:52.459> be

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
shape running across here this will be

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.949 
shape running across here this will be
one<00:02:53.120> hand<00:02:55.060> then<00:02:56.060> we<00:02:56.209> need<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.450> fill<00:02:56.630> in<00:02:56.750> that

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
one hand then we need to fill in that

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.920 
one hand then we need to fill in that
that<00:02:57.320> is<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:58.220> other<00:02:58.370> arm<00:02:59.440> and<00:03:01.930> shape

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
that is the other arm and shape

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.090 
that is the other arm and shape
underneath<00:03:03.730> again<00:03:04.730> just<00:03:05.360> really<00:03:05.660> basic<00:03:06.440> block

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
underneath again just really basic block

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.479 
underneath again just really basic block
shapes<00:03:07.519> I'm<00:03:08.420> putting<00:03:08.780> in<00:03:08.900> here<00:03:09.170> all<00:03:10.130> quite

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
shapes I'm putting in here all quite

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.190 
shapes I'm putting in here all quite
angular<00:03:11.000> at<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.209> moment<00:03:11.600> we're<00:03:11.750> gonna<00:03:11.810> soften

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
angular at the moment we're gonna soften

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.060 
angular at the moment we're gonna soften
them<00:03:12.440> at<00:03:12.530> a<00:03:12.620> later<00:03:12.800> stage<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:15.170> next<00:03:15.620> I've<00:03:15.860> got

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
them at a later stage and next I've got

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.289 
them at a later stage and next I've got
a<00:03:16.100> line<00:03:16.430> running<00:03:17.390> down<00:03:17.720> here<00:03:18.850> which<00:03:19.850> connects

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
a line running down here which connects

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.509 
a line running down here which connects
up<00:03:20.830> to<00:03:21.830> this<00:03:21.950> line<00:03:22.220> down

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
up to this line down

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.369 
up to this line down
and<00:03:24.519> then<00:03:24.640> I'm<00:03:24.760> gonna<00:03:24.940> create<00:03:25.209> 9<00:03:26.019> running

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
and then I'm gonna create 9 running

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.920 
and then I'm gonna create 9 running
across<00:03:26.590> here<00:03:26.950> like<00:03:26.980> this<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:29.909> then<00:03:30.909> a<00:03:31.330> line

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
across here like this and then a line

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.390 
across here like this and then a line
down<00:03:32.170> here<00:03:32.230> now<00:03:32.590> all<00:03:32.769> of<00:03:32.920> this<00:03:32.980> doesn't<00:03:33.220> really

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
down here now all of this doesn't really

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.740 
down here now all of this doesn't really
make<00:03:33.489> much<00:03:33.760> sense<00:03:33.970> at<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.239> moment<00:03:34.629> probably

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
make much sense at the moment probably

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.860 
make much sense at the moment probably
to<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:35.890> then<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.489> last<00:03:36.819> shape<00:03:37.480> I'm<00:03:37.659> going

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
to you and then the last shape I'm going

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.210 
to you and then the last shape I'm going
to<00:03:37.930> create<00:03:39.060> he's<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.110> strange<00:03:41.640> low-key<00:03:42.870> square

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
to create he's a strange low-key square

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.100 
to create he's a strange low-key square
shape<00:03:45.220> here<00:03:45.459> now<00:03:45.640> these<00:03:45.760> are<00:03:45.940> all<00:03:46.120> guidelines

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
shape here now these are all guidelines

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.369 
shape here now these are all guidelines
obviously<00:03:48.040> at<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.790> moment<00:03:49.180> now<00:03:50.019> we're<00:03:50.260> going

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
obviously at the moment now we're going

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.470 
obviously at the moment now we're going
to<00:03:50.440> go<00:03:50.829> over<00:03:51.129> those<00:03:51.250> guidelines<00:03:51.640> and<00:03:52.150> really

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
to go over those guidelines and really

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:00.970 
to go over those guidelines and really
start<00:03:52.780> shaping<00:03:53.409> the<00:03:54.159> figure

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.070 

we've<00:04:01.980> got<00:04:02.420> perspective<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:03.630> think<00:04:03.840> about

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
we've got perspective to think about

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.800 
we've got perspective to think about
here<00:04:04.550> okay<00:04:05.550> so<00:04:05.790> it's<00:04:06.030> coming<00:04:06.210> towards<00:04:06.690> you

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
here okay so it's coming towards you

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.500 
here okay so it's coming towards you
Sony's<00:04:07.260> going<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.680> be<00:04:07.940> quite<00:04:08.940> large<00:04:09.150> if<00:04:09.420> you

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
Sony's going to be quite large if you

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.420 
Sony's going to be quite large if you
compare<00:04:09.870> it<00:04:10.020> for<00:04:10.230> instance<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.070> size<00:04:11.310> of

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
compare it for instance to the size of

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.360 
compare it for instance to the size of
the<00:04:11.550> head<00:04:11.730> it's<00:04:12.570> almost<00:04:12.960> the<00:04:13.230> same<00:04:13.410> size<00:04:13.740> as

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
the head it's almost the same size as

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.910 
the head it's almost the same size as
the<00:04:14.520> head<00:04:14.720> okay<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:16.320> we've<00:04:16.410> got<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.590> front<00:04:16.770> of

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
the head okay and we've got the front of

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.699 
the head okay and we've got the front of
the<00:04:16.980> foot<00:04:17.160> there<00:04:17.420> so<00:04:18.420> then<00:04:19.230> we'll<00:04:19.380> go<00:04:19.410> back<00:04:19.530> up

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
the foot there so then we'll go back up

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.080 
the foot there so then we'll go back up
to<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.130> face<00:04:20.340> because<00:04:20.580> at<00:04:20.670> the<00:04:20.730> moment<00:04:20.760> he

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
to the face because at the moment he

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.630 
to the face because at the moment he
hasn't<00:04:21.360> really<00:04:21.630> got<00:04:21.780> much<00:04:21.900> of<00:04:21.959> a<00:04:22.110> face<00:04:22.640> quickly

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
hasn't really got much of a face quickly

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.740 
hasn't really got much of a face quickly
put<00:04:23.790> the<00:04:23.820> hat<00:04:24.000> in

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:42.050 

indication<00:04:30.750> of<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:30.900> face

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.180 

and<00:04:42.600> obviously<00:04:42.960> his<00:04:43.260> face<00:04:43.590> is<00:04:43.770> gonna<00:04:43.950> be<00:04:44.040> in

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
and obviously his face is gonna be in

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:52.720 
and obviously his face is gonna be in
shadow<00:04:44.990> because<00:04:45.990> it's<00:04:46.170> under<00:04:47.090> under<00:04:48.090> a<00:04:48.150> hat

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.680 

now<00:04:53.730> and<00:04:53.820> let's<00:04:53.940> add<00:04:54.060> a<00:04:54.090> little<00:04:54.210> bit<00:04:54.390> more<00:04:54.570> to

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
now and let's add a little bit more to

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
now and let's add a little bit more to
this<00:04:54.840> here<00:04:55.680> because<00:04:56.010> it's<00:04:56.220> kind<00:04:56.550> of<00:04:57.590> meant<00:04:58.590> to

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
this here because it's kind of meant to

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.010 
this here because it's kind of meant to
represent<00:04:58.890> a<00:04:59.250> camera<00:04:59.640> he's<00:05:00.390> actually<00:05:00.510> leaning

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
represent a camera he's actually leaning

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:08.810 
represent a camera he's actually leaning
down<00:05:01.230> filming<00:05:01.830> something<00:05:02.630> okay<00:05:07.340> so<00:05:08.340> just<00:05:08.610> by

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
down filming something okay so just by

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.490 
down filming something okay so just by
using<00:05:09.230> basic<00:05:10.230> geometric<00:05:10.470> shapes<00:05:12.470> you<00:05:13.470> can

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
using basic geometric shapes you can

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.170 
using basic geometric shapes you can
actually<00:05:14.190> create<00:05:14.610> a<00:05:14.760> figure<00:05:16.460> in<00:05:17.460> any<00:05:17.640> pose<00:05:17.970> at

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
actually create a figure in any pose at

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.600 
actually create a figure in any pose at
all<00:05:18.390> really<00:05:18.860> much<00:05:19.860> you've<00:05:20.070> applied<00:05:20.310> those

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
all really much you've applied those

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.780 
all really much you've applied those
geometric<00:05:20.940> shapes<00:05:21.890> okay<00:05:22.890> so<00:05:23.670> there<00:05:24.480> he<00:05:24.750> is
