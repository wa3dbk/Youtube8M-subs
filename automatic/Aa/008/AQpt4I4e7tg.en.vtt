The Komoro station building has few decoration and simple rectilinear style.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Because of central station of the Komoro City, there are larger rotary in front of the station and some medium-rise buildings surrounding it.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
In the "Community Garden of Komoro" found by the local nonprofit organization, you can enjoy flowers and colored leaves for all four seasons.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The station building, rebuilt in 1950, has high ceiling so you can get lots of reverb.

At one time, all trains including limited express train ASAMA, which connected Tokyo and Nagano, has stopped here. So Komoro station was crowded with passengers as one of the major stations on the Shin-etsu Main Line.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000
However, the Komoro station was demoted from limited express station to locan and rapid station in 1997, because Nagano Shinkansen opened in 1997 never go through the Komoro City.
