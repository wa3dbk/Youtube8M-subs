that guy on that go over there got a

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.160 
that guy on that go over there got a
redstone<00:00:22.060> video<00:00:22.360> for<00:00:22.570> you<00:00:22.660> today<00:00:22.779> and<00:00:23.020> it's

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
redstone video for you today and it's

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.109 
redstone video for you today and it's
basically<00:00:23.529> a<00:00:23.680> tea<00:00:24.189> flip<00:00:24.460> flop<00:00:24.640> with<00:00:24.880> a<00:00:24.910> rail

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
basically a tea flip flop with a rail

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.540 
basically a tea flip flop with a rail
attached<00:00:25.570> to<00:00:25.869> it<00:00:26.020> so<00:00:26.920> what's<00:00:27.100> going<00:00:27.279> to<00:00:27.340> happen

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
attached to it so what's going to happen

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.310 
attached to it so what's going to happen
here<00:00:27.580> is<00:00:27.910> when<00:00:28.119> I<00:00:28.150> get<00:00:28.450> in<00:00:28.540> this<00:00:28.630> mine<00:00:28.900> cart<00:00:29.230> and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
here is when I get in this mine cart and

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.550 
here is when I get in this mine cart and
I'm<00:00:30.009> going<00:00:30.130> to<00:00:30.160> go<00:00:30.279> over<00:00:30.310> and<00:00:31.020> basically<00:00:32.020> those

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
I'm going to go over and basically those

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.990 
I'm going to go over and basically those
lights<00:00:32.860> are<00:00:33.010> going<00:00:33.100> to<00:00:33.190> stay<00:00:33.550> on<00:00:33.579> and<00:00:33.880> stay

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
lights are going to stay on and stay

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.090 
lights are going to stay on and stay
switched<00:00:34.480> on<00:00:34.750> so<00:00:35.230> I<00:00:35.260> mean<00:00:35.560> you<00:00:35.650> could<00:00:35.770> use<00:00:35.950> this

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
switched on so I mean you could use this

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.450 
switched on so I mean you could use this
as<00:00:36.310> a<00:00:36.340> minecart<00:00:37.470> station<00:00:38.470> train<00:00:38.739> station<00:00:39.280> or

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
as a minecart station train station or

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.930 
as a minecart station train station or
you<00:00:40.120> could<00:00:40.329> say<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.800> know<00:00:41.920> oh<00:00:42.220> I<00:00:42.250> can<00:00:42.640> tell<00:00:42.820> if

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
you could say you know oh I can tell if

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.369 
you could say you know oh I can tell if
someone's<00:00:43.210> been<00:00:43.359> into<00:00:43.570> my<00:00:43.660> base<00:00:43.870> through<00:00:44.260> the

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
someone's been into my base through the

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:45.599 
someone's been into my base through the
certain<00:00:44.739> bit<00:00:44.949> because<00:00:45.129> these<00:00:45.340> lights

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
certain bit because these lights

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.959 
certain bit because these lights
switch-on<00:00:45.879> and<00:00:46.590> if<00:00:47.590> we<00:00:47.739> go<00:00:47.920> back<00:00:48.219> in<00:00:48.550> this<00:00:48.670> case

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
switch-on and if we go back in this case

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:50.939 
switch-on and if we go back in this case
I've<00:00:49.149> said<00:00:49.329> it<00:00:49.480> that<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:50.379> lights<00:00:50.559> and<00:00:50.769> switch

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
I've said it that the lights and switch

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.450 
I've said it that the lights and switch
off<00:00:51.129> so<00:00:51.820> what<00:00:52.180> we<00:00:52.420> got<00:00:52.690> going<00:00:53.019> on<00:00:53.199> E<00:00:53.340> well<00:00:54.340> we've

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
off so what we got going on E well we've

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.090 
off so what we got going on E well we've
got<00:00:54.609> two<00:00:54.820> powered<00:00:55.359> sorry<00:00:56.050> redstone<00:00:56.559> detecting

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
got two powered sorry redstone detecting

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.970 
got two powered sorry redstone detecting
rails<00:00:57.460> here<00:00:57.879> and<00:00:58.140> adjacent<00:00:59.140> to<00:00:59.469> those<00:00:59.649> are

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
rails here and adjacent to those are

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.919 
rails here and adjacent to those are
pieces<00:01:00.399> of<00:01:00.429> redstone<00:01:00.969> running<00:01:01.539> into<00:01:01.809> this

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
pieces of redstone running into this

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.530 
pieces of redstone running into this
little<00:01:02.170> memory<00:01:02.769> cell<00:01:03.160> here<00:01:03.579> which<00:01:04.239> you<00:01:04.390> can

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
little memory cell here which you can

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.250 
little memory cell here which you can
see<00:01:04.570> over<00:01:05.199> here<00:01:05.230> it's<00:01:05.620> very<00:01:05.800> basic

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
see over here it's very basic

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.210 
see over here it's very basic
essentially<00:01:08.260> what's<00:01:08.440> going<00:01:08.650> on<00:01:08.770> is<00:01:08.920> if<00:01:09.070> I

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
essentially what's going on is if I

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.880 
essentially what's going on is if I
provide<00:01:09.880> this<00:01:11.100> with<00:01:12.100> some<00:01:12.910> power<00:01:13.650> those<00:01:14.650> two

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
provide this with some power those two

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.770 
provide this with some power those two
torches<00:01:15.280> are<00:01:15.460> going<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:15.820> flip<00:01:16.329> they're<00:01:16.689> going

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
torches are going to flip they're going

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.620 
torches are going to flip they're going
to<00:01:16.869> flip<00:01:17.320> off<00:01:17.500> and<00:01:18.130> if<00:01:18.520> I<00:01:18.640> do<00:01:18.700> it<00:01:18.909> again<00:01:19.299> over

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
to flip off and if I do it again over

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.280 
to flip off and if I do it again over
here<00:01:20.100> again<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.549> all<00:01:21.729> sorry<00:01:22.390> sorry<00:01:22.780> sorry

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
here again the all sorry sorry sorry

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.069 
here again the all sorry sorry sorry
there<00:01:23.590> we<00:01:23.680> go<00:01:23.829> then<00:01:24.610> they<00:01:25.119> will<00:01:25.240> flip<00:01:25.479> again<00:01:25.780> so

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
there we go then they will flip again so

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.609 
there we go then they will flip again so
every<00:01:26.350> time<00:01:26.380> they<00:01:26.710> receive<00:01:27.070> power<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.810> cell

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
every time they receive power the cell

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.440 
every time they receive power the cell
switches<00:01:30.220> so<00:01:30.399> it's<00:01:30.490> basically<00:01:30.670> remembering

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
switches so it's basically remembering

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.080 
switches so it's basically remembering
where<00:01:31.689> the<00:01:31.869> power<00:01:32.110> came<00:01:32.470> from<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.759> if<00:01:33.909> the

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
where the power came from so if the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.819 
where the power came from so if the
power<00:01:34.299> comes<00:01:34.750> from<00:01:34.899> this<00:01:35.200> side<00:01:35.439> it<00:01:35.710> will

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
power comes from this side it will

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.639 
power comes from this side it will
remember<00:01:36.159> that<00:01:36.549> it<00:01:36.729> was<00:01:36.759> on<00:01:37.119> this<00:01:37.270> side

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
remember that it was on this side

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.719 
remember that it was on this side
whereas<00:01:38.649> if<00:01:38.829> it<00:01:38.950> came<00:01:39.070> from<00:01:39.220> this<00:01:39.399> side<00:01:39.579> it

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
whereas if it came from this side it

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.429 
whereas if it came from this side it
will<00:01:39.820> remember<00:01:40.180> even<00:01:40.719> when<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.930> powers<00:01:41.140> gone

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
will remember even when the powers gone

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.709 
will remember even when the powers gone
that<00:01:41.860> it's<00:01:42.009> on<00:01:42.219> it<00:01:42.790> came<00:01:43.000> from<00:01:43.119> this<00:01:43.270> side<00:01:43.509> so

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
that it's on it came from this side so

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:45.929 
that it's on it came from this side so
with<00:01:44.649> this<00:01:44.799> what<00:01:45.009> we<00:01:45.130> can<00:01:45.280> do<00:01:45.460> is<00:01:45.670> that<00:01:45.850> when

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
with this what we can do is that when

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.580 
with this what we can do is that when
the<00:01:45.969> car<00:01:46.240> goes<00:01:46.420> over<00:01:46.689> that<00:01:46.719> detector<00:01:47.409> rail

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
the car goes over that detector rail

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.069 
the car goes over that detector rail
what's<00:01:47.829> happening<00:01:48.250> here<00:01:48.430> is<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:49.000> use<00:01:49.960> the

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
what's happening here is the use the

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.679 
what's happening here is the use the
other<00:01:50.170> side<00:01:50.439> as<00:01:50.649> an<00:01:50.799> example<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:52.149> a<00:01:52.180> current<00:01:52.600> is

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
other side as an example so a current is

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.260 
other side as an example so a current is
sent<00:01:52.869> from<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.649> block<00:01:54.130> that<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.759> detector

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
sent from the block that the detector

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.139 
sent from the block that the detector
rail<00:01:55.420> is<00:01:55.570> on<00:01:55.719> and<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.229> comes<00:01:56.530> up<00:01:56.740> here<00:01:57.070> and<00:01:57.250> then

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
rail is on and it comes up here and then

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:59.310 
rail is on and it comes up here and then

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
what it's going to do is going to go on

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.499 
what it's going to do is going to go on
top<00:01:59.710> of<00:01:59.890> this<00:02:00.070> block<00:02:00.369> here<00:02:00.640> I'll<00:02:01.240> show<00:02:01.299> you

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
top of this block here I'll show you

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.830 
top of this block here I'll show you
apparently<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:03.610> let<00:02:04.180> me<00:02:04.240> just<00:02:04.270> switch<00:02:04.539> this

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
apparently and let me just switch this

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.430 
apparently and let me just switch this
you've<00:02:05.409> ever<00:02:05.680> burn<00:02:05.950> switch<00:02:06.880> over<00:02:07.270> so<00:02:08.080> once<00:02:08.289> we

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
you've ever burn switch over so once we

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.290 
you've ever burn switch over so once we
get<00:02:08.560> our<00:02:08.740> power<00:02:09.280> from<00:02:09.490> our<00:02:09.610> detector<00:02:10.090> rail

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
get our power from our detector rail

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.900 
get our power from our detector rail
this<00:02:11.080> current<00:02:11.620> then<00:02:11.830> becomes<00:02:12.280> active<00:02:12.760> it

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
this current then becomes active it

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.300 
this current then becomes active it
becomes<00:02:13.600> powered<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.320> it<00:02:14.680> will<00:02:14.800> switch<00:02:15.130> off

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
becomes powered and it will switch off

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.970 
becomes powered and it will switch off
this<00:02:15.640> redstone<00:02:16.120> torch<00:02:16.660> here<00:02:17.020> because<00:02:17.620> when<00:02:17.950> a

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
this redstone torch here because when a

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.509 
this redstone torch here because when a
torch<00:02:18.310> is<00:02:18.490> powered<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.840> then<00:02:20.200> switches<00:02:21.190> itself

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
torch is powered it then switches itself

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.210 
torch is powered it then switches itself
off<00:02:21.780> which<00:02:22.780> means<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:23.260> this<00:02:23.680> redstone

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
off which means that this redstone

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.850 
off which means that this redstone
current

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
current

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.520 
current
here<00:02:25.190> also<00:02:25.460> switches<00:02:26.300> itself<00:02:26.600> off<00:02:26.840> which<00:02:27.230> will

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
here also switches itself off which will

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.970 
here also switches itself off which will
then<00:02:27.650> mean<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.190> torch<00:02:28.550> will<00:02:28.910> switch<00:02:29.300> on

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
then mean that this torch will switch on

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.640 
then mean that this torch will switch on
now<00:02:31.030> yeah<00:02:32.030> so<00:02:32.720> quickly<00:02:33.290> show<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.470> the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
now yeah so quickly show you the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.160 
now yeah so quickly show you the
mechanics<00:02:33.860> of<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.340> torch<00:02:34.640> if<00:02:35.030> this<00:02:35.870> brought

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
mechanics of the torch if this brought

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.930 
mechanics of the torch if this brought
if<00:02:36.320> i<00:02:36.470> give<00:02:36.770> this<00:02:36.920> block<00:02:37.160> power<00:02:37.400> which<00:02:37.700> will

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
if i give this block power which will

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.820 
if i give this block power which will
power<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.210> torch<00:02:38.660> that<00:02:39.170> torch<00:02:39.500> will<00:02:39.680> switch

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
power the torch that torch will switch

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.160 
power the torch that torch will switch
off<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.340> that's<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.180> basic<00:02:41.630> of<00:02:41.780> what's<00:02:41.960> going

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
off and that's the basic of what's going

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.450 
off and that's the basic of what's going
that's<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.500> base<00:02:42.620> there's<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.040> basics<00:02:43.370> of

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
that's the base there's the basics of

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.370 
that's the base there's the basics of
what's<00:02:43.640> going<00:02:43.850> on<00:02:43.940> here<00:02:44.180> is<00:02:44.420> that<00:02:44.900> when<00:02:45.350> i

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
what's going on here is that when i

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.850 
what's going on here is that when i
provide<00:02:46.070> power<00:02:46.550> here<00:02:47.230> this<00:02:48.230> current<00:02:48.650> then

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
provide power here this current then

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.610 
provide power here this current then
passes<00:02:49.340> torch<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.820> switch<00:02:50.060> off<00:02:50.330> but<00:02:51.110> there's

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
passes torch to switch off but there's

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.470 
passes torch to switch off but there's
no<00:02:51.830> longer<00:02:52.040> any<00:02:52.160> current<00:02:52.790> coming<00:02:53.120> here<00:02:53.300> so

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
no longer any current coming here so

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.780 
no longer any current coming here so
this<00:02:53.600> torch<00:02:53.959> no<00:02:54.230> matter<00:02:54.380> what<00:02:54.620> i<00:02:54.650> do<00:02:54.790> we'll

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
this torch no matter what i do we'll

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.320 
this torch no matter what i do we'll
stay<00:02:56.240> switched<00:02:56.600> on<00:02:56.810> until<00:02:57.050> i<00:02:57.980> go<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.550> power<00:02:58.970> it

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
stay switched on until i go and power it

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.840 
stay switched on until i go and power it
itself<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:01.190> again<00:03:01.370> what<00:03:01.550> we've<00:03:01.670> got<00:03:01.820> here

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
itself so again what we've got here

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.880 
itself so again what we've got here
we've<00:03:02.090> got<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.300> same<00:03:02.480> setup<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.080> our<00:03:03.290> input

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
we've got the same setup and our input

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.770 
we've got the same setup and our input
is<00:03:04.070> originating<00:03:04.730> from<00:03:04.850> those<00:03:05.060> detector<00:03:05.570> rails

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
is originating from those detector rails

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.930 
is originating from those detector rails
and<00:03:06.080> I've<00:03:06.709> just<00:03:06.890> got<00:03:07.070> it<00:03:07.190> set<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:07.430> that<00:03:07.610> when

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
and I've just got it set so that when

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.690 
and I've just got it set so that when
one<00:03:08.270> side<00:03:08.660> becomes<00:03:09.470> powered<00:03:09.800> that<00:03:10.070> current

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
one side becomes powered that current

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.970 
one side becomes powered that current
travels<00:03:10.910> up<00:03:11.180> here<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.570> into<00:03:12.050> these<00:03:12.170> redstone

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
travels up here and into these redstone

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.780 
travels up here and into these redstone
lamps<00:03:13.520> so<00:03:14.120> if<00:03:14.239> i<00:03:14.360> put<00:03:14.980> yet<00:03:15.980> decide<00:03:16.370> if<00:03:16.520> i<00:03:16.610> put

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
lamps so if i put yet decide if i put

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.300 
lamps so if i put yet decide if i put
down<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.060> mine<00:03:17.209> cart<00:03:17.450> there<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:19.100> lights

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
down the mine cart there the lights

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.040 
down the mine cart there the lights
switch-on<00:03:19.760> because<00:03:20.239> this<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.660> now<00:03:20.810> receiving

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
switch-on because this is now receiving

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.370 
switch-on because this is now receiving
power<00:03:21.410> which<00:03:21.590> is<00:03:21.739> switch<00:03:21.920> this<00:03:22.100> block<00:03:22.340> off<00:03:23.380> so

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
power which is switch this block off so

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.990 
power which is switch this block off so
you<00:03:24.440> could<00:03:24.709> actually<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.400> could<00:03:25.520> think<00:03:25.790> of
