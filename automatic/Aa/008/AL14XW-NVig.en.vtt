00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
put all the glass around it you just

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.400 
put all the glass around it you just
light<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.550> with<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> flint<00:00:51.239> steel<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:52.260> gets

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
light it with a flint steel just gets

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.930 
light it with a flint steel just gets
rid<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.680> real<00:00:52.860> easy<00:00:52.890> something's<00:00:53.789> going<00:00:53.910> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
rid of it real easy something's going to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.849 
rid of it real easy something's going to
go<00:00:54.030> let's<00:00:54.420> say<00:00:54.629> five<00:00:55.559> wide<00:00:56.370> no<00:00:56.850> yes<00:00:57.690> five<00:00:58.590> wide

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
go let's say five wide no yes five wide

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.510 
go let's say five wide no yes five wide
and<00:00:59.780> for<00:01:00.780> long<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.250> be<00:01:02.370> pretty

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
and for long it's going to be pretty

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.740 
and for long it's going to be pretty
hard<00:01:02.850> because<00:01:03.059> I'm<00:01:03.329> gonna<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.629> keep

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
hard because I'm gonna have to keep

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.380 
hard because I'm gonna have to keep
coming<00:01:03.930> up<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.439> down<00:01:04.790> but<00:01:05.790> I'm<00:01:05.970> going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.240> get

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
coming up and down but I'm going to get

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.609 
coming up and down but I'm going to get
full<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.439> let's<00:01:08.010> say<00:01:08.250> three<00:01:08.909> high<00:01:09.439> it<00:01:10.439> will

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
full and let's say three high it will

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.560 
full and let's say three high it will
too<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.040> quite<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> timing<00:01:12.119> process<00:01:12.450> it

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
too it's quite like a timing process it

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.630 
too it's quite like a timing process it
does<00:01:12.720> take<00:01:12.960> quite<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.260> lot<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.560> time<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.460> it's

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
does take quite a lot of time but it's

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.760 
does take quite a lot of time but it's
it's<00:01:14.909> worth<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.479> at<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.630> end<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:16.650> just

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
it's worth it at the end so I'm just

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.120 
it's worth it at the end so I'm just
going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> go<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:19.320> it's<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> bit<00:01:19.770> dark<00:01:19.950> i'll
