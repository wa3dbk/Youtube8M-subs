00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.349
 the 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.900
 hello to all the leaders is the 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.000
 bazois exceeds I hope you have 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.700
 all very well me it's going today 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.119
 is found super easy glitch point 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.949
 to realize on the map newton zombies 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.760
 so it's really a guy who's going to be 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.000
 interesting 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.949
 well for for everyone what is it 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.720
 a guide that everyone realized 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:36.010
 because and it's really very simple 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.050
 a very easy stratagem so that as 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.640
 you can see what do you think 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.649
 really advise but then really 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.140
 to take the mp 5 for those who are 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:47.379
 not very strong in jump strata take it 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.969
 mp5 it will be ten times easier so 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.910
 very frankly listen to this advice 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.579
 take the mp sastre a jump so there i 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.140
 a little bit there I showed you 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.789
 how not to fail so I 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.370
 start again nostra jump is not close 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.899
 it is very very very easy so arrived 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.460
 here is going to have to actually lengthen well 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.379
 be careful not to fall 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.750
 and there we will have to run while doing a 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.930
 arc of a circle why do that because 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.310
 that there is an invisible barrier that is going 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.729
 kill you actually one of the two barriers 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.380
 so in fact so that's it if you do not 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.479
 not run and if you do not do it 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.369
 same arc that I showed you 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.159
 in the video you have automatically 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.610
 to die so from there you just have to 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.939
 jump and you'll be on a spot 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.610
 invincibility 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.060
 so there are several places where we can 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.600
 go 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.140
 thanks to this stratagem not very easy to 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.930
 achieve 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.729
 so I'll let you see that yourself 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.329
 so there you can see under another 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.430
 angle 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.650
 it's really a very fun guide very 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.680
 simple to make and really very very 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.000
 very very nice by cons being the most 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.320
 hard by obliging oneself makes these two it's 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.509
 not to take the barrier head 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.310
 so be careful of that damn 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.670
 barriers so here I hope this 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.869
 video will have pleased you leaked commented 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.790
 share do not hesitate to subscribe to 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.500
 the chain and then I tell you to the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.500
 next go bye everyone
