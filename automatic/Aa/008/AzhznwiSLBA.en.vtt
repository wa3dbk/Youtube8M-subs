second okay forgot to mention that this
is<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.640> oil<00:02:55.820> pump<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:57.230> drum<00:02:57.500> is<00:02:57.650> going<00:02:57.710> to

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
is the oil pump that drum is going to

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.530 
is the oil pump that drum is going to
sit<00:02:58.070> on<00:02:58.100> there<00:02:58.370> there's<00:02:58.550> that<00:02:58.670> little<00:02:58.910> key<00:02:59.300> way

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
sit on there there's that little key way

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.310 
sit on there there's that little key way
right<00:02:59.810> here

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
right here

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.560 
right here
that<00:03:01.220> matches<00:03:01.520> up<00:03:02.890> with<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.070> key<00:03:04.310> way<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:04.850> know

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
that matches up with the key way I know

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.600 
that matches up with the key way I know
if<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:05.720> can<00:03:05.870> see<00:03:06.080> it<00:03:06.430> right<00:03:07.430> in<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:07.640> back<00:03:08.110> see

if you can see it right in the back see

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.050 
if you can see it right in the back see
okay<00:03:11.650> like<00:03:12.650> I<00:03:12.770> said<00:03:13.010> before<00:03:13.160> these<00:03:13.640> need<00:03:14.030> to

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
okay like I said before these need to

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.420 
okay like I said before these need to
fit<00:03:14.420> right<00:03:14.720> down<00:03:14.750> inside<00:03:15.260> these<00:03:15.710> grooves<00:03:16.100> and

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
fit right down inside these grooves and

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.130 
fit right down inside these grooves and
they<00:03:16.820> won't<00:03:17.090> be<00:03:17.240> able<00:03:17.330> to<00:03:17.480> fit<00:03:17.660> down<00:03:17.840> in<00:03:17.990> there

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
they won't be able to fit down in there

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.010 
they won't be able to fit down in there
until<00:03:18.290> this<00:03:18.710> is<00:03:18.860> properly<00:03:19.340> engaged<00:03:19.580> with<00:03:20.270> the

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
until this is properly engaged with the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:28.960 
until this is properly engaged with the
oil<00:03:21.590> pump<00:03:21.950> now<00:03:22.730> listen<00:03:27.040> you'll<00:03:28.040> hear<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.610> pump

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
oil pump now listen you'll hear the pump

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.760 
oil pump now listen you'll hear the pump
I<00:03:29.030> can't<00:03:29.420> hear<00:03:29.540> in<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.750> video<00:03:29.989> you'll<00:03:30.590> hear

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
I can't hear in the video you'll hear

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.030 
I can't hear in the video you'll hear
the<00:03:30.890> pump<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.280> it<00:03:31.850> spins<00:03:32.120> freely<00:03:32.709> that's<00:03:33.709> how

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
the pump and it spins freely that's how

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.400 
the pump and it spins freely that's how
you<00:03:34.100> know<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.430> it's<00:03:34.940> inside<00:03:35.510> correctly<00:03:36.260> now

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
you know that it's inside correctly now

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.729 
you know that it's inside correctly now
like<00:03:36.650> I<00:03:36.770> said<00:03:36.830> before<00:03:37.190> there's<00:03:37.640> that<00:03:37.820> bushing

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
like I said before there's that bushing

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.340 
like I said before there's that bushing
the<00:03:39.739> thrust<00:03:40.550> washer<00:03:40.730> actually<00:03:41.360> make<00:03:42.140> sure

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
the thrust washer actually make sure

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.110 
the thrust washer actually make sure
that<00:03:42.560> it's<00:03:42.739> not<00:03:42.860> off-center<00:03:43.520> because<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:43.940> has

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
that it's not off-center because it has

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.390 
that it's not off-center because it has
it's<00:03:44.840> going<00:03:44.989> to<00:03:45.050> fit<00:03:45.290> eventually<00:03:45.830> on<00:03:45.980> here

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
it's going to fit eventually on here

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.830 
it's going to fit eventually on here
alright<00:03:47.120> I<00:03:47.390> will<00:03:47.780> now<00:03:47.959> show<00:03:49.209> how<00:03:50.209> to<00:03:50.270> take<00:03:50.390> this

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
alright I will now show how to take this

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.620 
alright I will now show how to take this
and<00:03:51.140> put<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:51.980> onto<00:03:52.190> here<00:03:52.640> I<00:03:52.790> was<00:03:53.150> trying<00:03:53.300> to<00:03:53.450> put

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
and put it onto here I was trying to put

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.210 
and put it onto here I was trying to put
this<00:03:53.810> onto<00:03:54.200> here<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:54.739> it<00:03:54.860> just<00:03:55.040> wasn't

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
this onto here and it just wasn't

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.540 
this onto here and it just wasn't
working<00:03:55.520> the<00:03:56.390> magnet<00:03:56.870> was<00:03:56.989> falling<00:03:57.410> out<00:03:57.560> a<00:03:57.830> lot

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
working the magnet was falling out a lot

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.920 
working the magnet was falling out a lot
of<00:03:58.580> different<00:03:58.760> things<00:03:59.030> were<00:03:59.239> going<00:03:59.270> on<00:03:59.600> so

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
of different things were going on so

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.100 
of different things were going on so
I'll<00:04:00.860> be<00:04:00.980> back<00:04:01.190> in<00:04:01.239> the<00:04:02.239> chain<00:04:02.510> off<00:04:02.720> of<00:04:02.900> here

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
I'll be back in the chain off of here

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.080 
I'll be back in the chain off of here
with<00:04:03.230> this<00:04:03.350> gear<00:04:03.739> make<00:04:04.280> sure<00:04:04.489> that<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.880> big

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
with this gear make sure that the big

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.070 
with this gear make sure that the big
side<00:04:05.390> is<00:04:05.800> going<00:04:06.800> to<00:04:06.950> be<00:04:07.130> down<00:04:07.940> because<00:04:08.900> usually

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
side is going to be down because usually

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.610 
side is going to be down because usually
it's<00:04:09.530> up<00:04:09.739> so<00:04:10.340> when<00:04:10.520> you<00:04:10.610> flip<00:04:10.850> it<00:04:10.940> over<00:04:11.620> it's

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
it's up so when you flip it over it's

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.850 
it's up so when you flip it over it's
down<00:04:12.890> place<00:04:13.790> it<00:04:13.820> inside<00:04:14.390> it<00:04:15.290> rides<00:04:15.560> right<00:04:15.830> on

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
down place it inside it rides right on

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.340 
down place it inside it rides right on
the<00:04:16.100> bearing<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:16.549> then<00:04:17.450> you<00:04:17.870> connect<00:04:18.230> the

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
the bearing and then you connect the

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.750 
the bearing and then you connect the
chain<00:04:19.870> once<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.049> chain<00:04:21.290> is<00:04:21.500> on<00:04:21.680> both<00:04:22.310> of<00:04:22.580> them

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
going to put this shaft into there and

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.220 
going to put this shaft into there and
then<00:04:44.210> you're<00:04:44.360> going<00:04:44.570> to<00:04:44.660> take<00:04:44.810> this<00:04:44.990> whole

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
then you're going to take this whole

then you're going to take this whole
thing<00:04:45.260> and<00:04:45.770> put<00:04:46.340> it<00:04:46.490> on<00:04:46.730> that<00:04:47.330> way<00:04:47.600> and<00:04:48.380> I'll

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
thing and put it on that way and I'll

thing and put it on that way and I'll
show<00:04:48.740> you<00:04:48.770> how<00:04:48.980> that<00:04:49.160> works<00:04:50.980> okay<00:04:51.980> as<00:04:52.040> you<00:04:52.310> can

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460

see<00:04:52.810> both<00:04:53.810> shafts<00:04:54.410> are<00:04:54.680> now<00:04:54.830> in<00:04:55.070> and<00:04:55.840> it's<00:04:56.840> just

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
see both shafts are now in and it's just

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.700 
see both shafts are now in and it's just
a<00:04:57.290> matter<00:04:57.500> of<00:04:58.060> lifting<00:04:59.060> it<00:04:59.180> up<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.710> then

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
a matter of lifting it up and then

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.129 
a matter of lifting it up and then
getting<00:05:01.160> it<00:05:01.280> on<00:05:01.400> top<00:05:01.730> make<00:05:02.570> sure<00:05:02.600> that<00:05:02.960> this

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
getting it on top make sure that this

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.770 
getting it on top make sure that this
end<00:05:03.500> over<00:05:03.710> here<00:05:03.830> is<00:05:04.340> either<00:05:04.700> off<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.330> table<00:05:05.750> a

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
end over here is either off the table a

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.080 
end over here is either off the table a
little<00:05:05.930> bit<00:05:06.080> so<00:05:06.919> the<00:05:07.040> shaft<00:05:07.280> can<00:05:07.430> all<00:05:07.640> go<00:05:07.940> all

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
little bit so the shaft can all go all

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.170 
little bit so the shaft can all go all
the<00:05:08.210> way<00:05:08.240> through<00:05:08.570> and<00:05:09.340> it'll<00:05:10.340> it'll<00:05:10.580> fit<00:05:10.940> it

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
the way through and it'll it'll fit it

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.460 
the way through and it'll it'll fit it
seems<00:05:11.630> like<00:05:11.840> it's<00:05:11.990> going<00:05:12.080> to<00:05:12.169> be<00:05:12.260> a<00:05:12.290> little

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
seems like it's going to be a little

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.740 
seems like it's going to be a little
tight<00:05:12.620> but<00:05:12.710> this<00:05:12.890> will<00:05:13.040> tighten<00:05:14.030> up<00:05:14.120> and<00:05:14.360> it'll

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
tight but this will tighten up and it'll

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.270 
tight but this will tighten up and it'll
go<00:05:14.900> right<00:05:15.110> together<00:05:15.320> and<00:05:15.830> I'll<00:05:15.950> show<00:05:16.100> you<00:05:16.190> how

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
go right together and I'll show you how

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.920 
go right together and I'll show you how
that<00:05:16.340> looks<00:05:19.090> okay<00:05:20.090> just<00:05:20.390> to<00:05:20.450> let<00:05:20.480> people<00:05:20.780> know

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
that looks okay just to let people know

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.550 
that looks okay just to let people know
I'm<00:05:21.260> using<00:05:21.440> like<00:05:21.710> a<00:05:21.740> handle<00:05:22.280> to<00:05:22.640> hold<00:05:22.790> it<00:05:23.030> up

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
I'm using like a handle to hold it up

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.379 
I'm using like a handle to hold it up
straight<00:05:24.560> and<00:05:26.350> it's<00:05:27.350> off<00:05:27.590> the<00:05:27.620> table<00:05:27.979> so<00:05:28.389> the

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
straight and it's off the table so the

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.080 
straight and it's off the table so the
shaft<00:05:29.660> can<00:05:29.870> go<00:05:30.169> completely<00:05:30.860> through<00:05:31.220> I'm

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
shaft can go completely through I'm

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.870 
shaft can go completely through I'm
going<00:05:32.540> to<00:05:32.660> put<00:05:32.840> them<00:05:32.960> together<00:05:33.139> now<00:05:33.560> okay

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.060 

here's<00:05:37.880> the<00:05:38.060> finished<00:05:38.419> product<00:05:39.070> it's

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
here's the finished product it's

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.740 
here's the finished product it's
together<00:05:41.080> like<00:05:42.080> I<00:05:42.229> said<00:05:42.760> you<00:05:43.760> take<00:05:44.000> it<00:05:44.240> and<00:05:44.360> you

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
together like I said you take it and you

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.200 
together like I said you take it and you

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
flip it over this way and you push it in

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.090 
flip it over this way and you push it in
this<00:05:47.419> one's<00:05:47.630> going<00:05:47.780> to<00:05:47.870> go<00:05:48.530> in<00:05:48.740> a<00:05:48.770> little<00:05:48.950> bit

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
this one's going to go in a little bit

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.830 
this one's going to go in a little bit
and<00:05:49.490> you<00:05:49.760> can<00:05:50.289> to<00:05:51.289> move<00:05:51.470> the<00:05:51.740> chain<00:05:52.039> and<00:05:52.660> to<00:05:53.660> get

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
and you can to move the chain and to get

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.200 
and you can to move the chain and to get
the<00:05:54.110> shafts<00:05:55.100> to<00:05:55.340> line<00:05:55.520> up<00:05:55.700> over<00:05:55.820> here<00:05:55.910> you<00:05:56.090> can

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
the shafts to line up over here you can

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.870 
the shafts to line up over here you can
just<00:05:56.300> move<00:05:56.510> this<00:05:56.750> a<00:05:56.780> little<00:05:57.020> bit<00:05:57.200> and<00:05:57.320> then

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
they both go into the slot you know I

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.320 
they both go into the slot you know I
don't<00:06:10.340> want<00:06:10.490> to<00:06:10.550> push<00:06:10.669> it<00:06:10.820> together<00:06:10.940> right<00:06:11.300> now

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
don't want to push it together right now
