00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.120
 many receptors attached to proteins that 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.460
 they have a large extracellular domain of 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.830
 ligand binding when a ligand 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.599
 appropriate protein binds to this domain 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.580
 the receiver undergoes a conformation change 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.650
 to which it transmits its regions I quote 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.900
 sun and cas which can then 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.820
 activate a primer binding protein 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.340
 to gtp that abbreviated 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.680
 we call protein g as its name 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.449
 It suggests a protein g primerica is 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.539
 It consists of three protein subunits 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.519
 called alpha beta and gamma units 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.380
 alpha and gamma are united in a 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.540
 covalent to lipid tails that 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.030
 facilitate the anchoring of the protein ga 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.309
 the plasma membrane in the absence of 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.219
 signal the alpha subunit is attached to a 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.980
 gp and protein g is inactive 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.899
 in some cases inactive g protein 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.940
 is associated with the receiver also in 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.039
 active while in other cases as 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.680
 here it shows just binds to the receiver 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.810
 when it has been activated 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.940
 in any case to an activated receiver 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.680
 induces a change conformation to in the 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.220
 alpha subunit that entails the 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.410
 dissociation of the gp attached the gtp is 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.240
 abundant in the sun quote so that 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.840
 now you can easily join in the 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.539
 place of the gp 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.759
 the union of the gtp causes a second change 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.530
 conformation to the protein g that 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.810
 allows the activation of both the 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.240
 alpha subunit as of the beta complex 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.640
 gamma in some situations like 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.679
 shows here the activated alpha subunit 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.780
 dissociates from the beta gamma complex 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.880
 also activated while in other 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.180
 situations both components activated 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.950
 they stay together 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.930
 in any case now both 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.460
 activated components can regulate the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.500
 target protein activity in the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.150
 plasma membrane as in the complex 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.840
 which is shown here for a subunit 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.910
 alpha linked to gtp so the target proteins 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.440
 activated can transmit the signal to 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.540
 other components of the cascade of 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.070
 signaling 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.100
 finally the alpha subunit hydrolyzes 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.200
 its gtp that leads attached to gp which 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.450
 inactivates the subunit 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.039
 often this step is accelerated by 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.869
 the binding of another protein called 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.350
 Protein regulatory protein g 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.470
 signaler or heretic the subunit 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.970
 inactivated alpha linked to g of p now 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.370
 becomes part of a new 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.530
 g protein with a new beta complex 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.160
 gamma blocking signaling 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.160
 downstream 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.519
 while the signaling receiver 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.370
 stay stimulated you can continue 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.440
 activating proteins however after a 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.660
 prolonged stimulation the receivers 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.040
 finally they are inactivated even though 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.590
 remain attached to ligands 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.629
 activators in this case a receiver 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.209
 kinase phosphorylates in the cyto regions 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.459
 sun and cas of the receiver activated when 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.709
 the receptor has been phosphorylated joins 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.680
 with high affinity to a protein rest 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.510
 ina of the English arrest to stop inactive 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.190
 the receiver himself preventing his 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.170
 interaction with proteins g 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.300
 the resins also act as 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.070
 adaptive proteins and recruit the 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.320
 Phosphorylate receptors 2 to slits 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.270
 platinum coated from where the 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.550
 receivers are in two cited and then 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.720
 they can be degraded in lysosomes or 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.720
 activate new signaling pathways
