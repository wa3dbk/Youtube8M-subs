 narrated in the first person 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.490
 only that it alternates between the characters 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.840
 so he was not just for a character 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.990
 but by practically all 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.539

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.160

 Finally, each chapter begins. 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.120
 with the face of the character who is 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:48.239

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.730
 chapter title that is based at last 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.440
 a movie all chapters are named 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.059
 for one by one movie name and found 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.460

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.690

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.550
 to do with something that happens in the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.539
 Also drawing book are also well 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.730

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.290
 the edition but they are quite cool this is the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.650
 first positive point the book is very 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.920
 pretty apparently and then he'll join us 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.560
 soul routine in first collegiate college 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.409

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.299

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.549

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.770
 I was and if the intention of luiza wheat 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.290
 was to make the voter feel 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.000

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.810
 I wore years speaks volumes on the first in 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.700
 second high school my school 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.229
 did not need a uniform every day 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.030
 It is not mandatory and I was very 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.100
 t-shirt I went a lot with this take off 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.930
 some people even told me that 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.820
 It was red china girl I know 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.070
 because they had so here but one fell and 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.170
 when the connector such then more or less 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.340
 that's how I was 15 like 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.540
 What I am today is not 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.879
 but I had a little more hair in 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.119
 mutau stop bad is everybody passed by 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.119
 this phase 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.950
 promotion book party congratulations goal 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.840
 completed one thing I found a 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.830
 bit boring in the book that annoys me 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.190
 little 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.890
 was that it is sometimes the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.600
 characters seems like it's something that 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.640
 is not known the main character who 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.310
 there was a super cool girl is one of the 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.720
 women was super smart in some 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.370
 moments gives the impression that she wants 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.390
 be different to get the attention of 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.310
 other people 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.620
 This is not very cool, even with the 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.120
 choose her party when she delivers 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.250
 the invitation sounds like she wants 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.590
 draw attention knows home wanting 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.560
 talk like that there who is the annoying snow 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.090
 Now it was annoying nerd but anyway I 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.690
 I believe all this has a reason 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.940
 after the justifiable fk this bane 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.520
 then because it seems that the character 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.410
 I learned in the course of the narrative seems 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.450
 that it grows somewhat more than 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.430
 also bothered me was the fact that the 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.110
 Bia is in love with the most 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.940
 the most beautiful and popular school 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.010
 spoiler is already just said at the beginning of 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.290
 book here on the cover that he is the dream 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.850
 and it's a bit annoying because it's not 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.880
 needs to be the most popular but 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.840
 school, it 's already known that we do not 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.880
 it was like this 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.530
 Such a girl admitted the attention but the people 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.470
 was not pulled by my school name 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.810
 had the other boys and 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.700
 Sometimes beauty is not everything and this book 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.560
 shows a lot of it 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.810
 one of the free beauty messages is not 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.370
 all money is not everything the status is 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.530
 very important sometimes you can 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.160
 understand this also with the attitudes of 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.260
 some characters and it's a sad thing 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.860
 but makes it clear that the statute is not 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.049
 all 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.970
 The central message of this book for me is 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.850
 be yourself and care about the 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.890
 people who care about you and not and 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.900
 stop paying attention to who 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.820
 call you do not care about them 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.100
 because people are not worth anything to 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.440
 you then I think so I think 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.000
 he gave in was great at leaving his 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.260
 clear message to the voter 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.150
 so congratulations because it 's a message 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.980
 very cool then these points 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.610
 negative effects are justified by this 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.040
 message and is central to the book because 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.070
 it seems like this is going to unfold 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:21.109
 as the narrative happens and it was 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.109
 necessary this initial bump knows 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.530
 the book is not an amazing book he 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.419
 It will not make you feel nervous and without 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.730
 eat to be able to read to discover the 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.410
 that will happen even a little bit 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.200
 predictable can you imagine some 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.480
 things that will happen but that too 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.190
 It's not a bother, but it's also 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.210
 it's a thing that speaks my God looks that 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.130
 great principle is not only the fact is and is 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.100
 A very relaxing and pretty reading. 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.930
 Take it easy to read one day I read one day. 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.960
 I thought it was a lot of fun reading. 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.990
 very relaxing and it's a story for 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.730
 bed then it exists for a reason knows 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.919
 you might have assigned this book to show 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.870
 people that they should not be 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.120
 to care about what others think of 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.280
 his personality and yourself 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.230
 Another thing that the book does well 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.130
 Of course some people are very 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.130
 third 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.530
 even in high school 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.870
 What do you want to know, popular you have to 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.760
 be popular and the rich in your case opinion 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.530
 rich and we remember that at the time 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.250
 there was a lot of it 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:29.370
 so I think with this with the way 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:32.910
 The wheat luiza is tells the place where they are 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.160
 school is to talk to her because slang 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.780
 within the lines of the characters of the 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.490
 book takes place in rio de janeiro and she 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.030
 it was a lot of slang from there I know 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.190
 some cariocas and I understood a lot of it 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.140
 I 've never been to the river and I felt 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.600
 there little by the way in luiza 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.729
 street place by the way she puts the 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.490
 slang and I thought she was great and 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.890
 environmental reader in the world the characters 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.990
 both in the college and in the 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.360
 January and are with a super positive 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.520
 she made me enter the world 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.500
 knew and completely got rid of the time 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.510
 then everyone who picks up 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.919
 this book in the hand starts reading will 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.780
 remember this school season then 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:11.370
 Congratulations on luiza so your intention 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.560
 was to make the reader feel 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.990
 inside the book then so a book that 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.630
 environment well reader has a message 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.700
 Nice but a bit unpredictable and has 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:24.510
 some things you already had a read 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:27.300
