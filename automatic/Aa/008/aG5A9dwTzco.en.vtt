we<00:01:03.430> got

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
we got

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.109 
we got
avid<00:01:04.600> ultimate<00:01:05.469> brakes<00:01:05.740> so<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.670> whole<00:01:06.820> bike

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
avid ultimate brakes so the whole bike

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.230 
avid ultimate brakes so the whole bike
is<00:01:07.740> actually<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.770> racing<00:01:09.250> machine<00:01:09.610> all<00:01:10.210> right

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
is actually a racing machine all right

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.289 
is actually a racing machine all right
so<00:01:10.540> we<00:01:11.140> got<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.380> double<00:01:11.649> chain<00:01:12.009> ring<00:01:12.280> so<00:01:12.790> we

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
so we got a double chain ring so we

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:14.520 
so we got a double chain ring so we
don't<00:01:13.479> use<00:01:13.689> triple<00:01:13.930> chain<00:01:14.229> ring<00:01:14.409> for

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
don't use triple chain ring for

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.989 
don't use triple chain ring for
cross-country<00:01:15.039> racing<00:01:15.399> just<00:01:15.670> because<00:01:15.850> it's

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:15.999 
cross-country racing just because it's

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:17.669 
cross-country racing just because it's
more<00:01:16.209> efficient<00:01:16.689> it's<00:01:16.810> lighter<00:01:17.109> and<00:01:17.259> there's

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
more efficient it's lighter and there's

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:20.039 
more efficient it's lighter and there's
less<00:01:17.950> chance<00:01:17.979> of<00:01:18.429> dropping<00:01:18.819> the<00:01:19.060> changes<00:01:19.450> but

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
less chance of dropping the changes but

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.319 
less chance of dropping the changes but
we<00:01:20.170> claim<00:01:20.439> a<00:01:20.469> weight<00:01:20.770> of<00:01:20.799> 9.2<00:01:21.549> kilos<00:01:22.060> for<00:01:22.240> the

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
we claim a weight of 9.2 kilos for the

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.959 
we claim a weight of 9.2 kilos for the
whole<00:01:22.479> bike<00:01:22.719> so<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.889> there's<00:01:24.280> no<00:01:24.520> mountain

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
whole bike so and there's no mountain

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:25.800 
whole bike so and there's no mountain
sparks<00:01:25.329> on<00:01:25.509> it

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
sparks on it

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.779 
sparks on it
so<00:01:26.079> it's<00:01:26.229> super<00:01:26.409> light<00:01:26.740> super<00:01:27.249> efficient

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
so it's super light super efficient

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:41.399 
so it's super light super efficient
super<00:01:28.179> strong

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409

the<00:02:24.940> Sharklets<00:02:25.450> taken<00:02:26.049> off<00:02:26.170> so<00:02:26.380> you<00:02:26.470> can

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
the Sharklets taken off so you can

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.949 
the Sharklets taken off so you can
actually<00:02:27.040> see<00:02:27.459> where<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.910> races<00:02:28.330> are<00:02:28.450> placed

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
actually see where the races are placed

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.839 
actually see where the races are placed
and<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.650> can<00:02:29.830> see<00:02:30.010> how<00:02:30.190> smooth<00:02:30.489> that<00:02:30.519> works

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
and you can see how smooth that works

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.270 
and you can see how smooth that works
what<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.510> can't<00:02:31.840> see<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.380> actually<00:02:32.590> if<00:02:32.950> I<00:02:33.069> put

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
what you can't see is actually if I put

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.190 
what you can't see is actually if I put
load<00:02:33.489> on<00:02:33.670> this<00:02:33.790> fork<00:02:34.090> right<00:02:34.239> here<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:35.110> it

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
load on this fork right here that it

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.900 
load on this fork right here that it
will<00:02:35.290> still<00:02:35.560> move<00:02:35.769> at<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:36.250> same<00:02:36.430> way<00:02:36.670> actually

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
will still move at the same way actually

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.670 
will still move at the same way actually
as<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.150> matter<00:02:37.299> of<00:02:37.360> fact<00:02:37.599> we<00:02:38.019> need<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.230> load<00:02:38.470> of

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
as a matter of fact we need a load of

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.030 
as a matter of fact we need a load of
500<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.430> 700<00:02:39.940> kilos<00:02:40.329> to<00:02:40.720> deform<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.560> deform

500 to 700 kilos to deform to deform
just<00:02:42.250> let<00:02:42.430> people<00:02:42.630> demonstrate<00:02:43.630> this<00:02:43.810> if<00:02:44.260> I

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
just let people demonstrate this if I

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.229 
just let people demonstrate this if I
just<00:02:44.590> like<00:02:44.829> as<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.549> can<00:02:45.700> see<00:02:45.850> right<00:02:46.060> now<00:02:46.090> I

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
just like as you can see right now I

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.789 
just like as you can see right now I
mean<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.569> can<00:02:46.720> still<00:02:46.900> look<00:02:47.109> at<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.319> there's<00:02:47.560> no

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
mean I can still look at that there's no

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.979 
mean I can still look at that there's no
friction<00:02:48.220> super<00:02:48.790> smooth<00:02:49.030> moving<00:02:49.660> back<00:02:49.840> and

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
friction super smooth moving back and

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.319 
friction super smooth moving back and
forth<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.500> can<00:02:50.769> actually<00:02:51.069> hang<00:02:51.400> like<00:02:51.579> four<00:02:52.150> or

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
forth I can actually hang like four or

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.539 
forth I can actually hang like four or
five<00:02:52.359> grown-up<00:02:53.170> guys<00:02:53.470> without<00:02:54.190> really

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
five grown-up guys without really

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.390 
five grown-up guys without really
affecting<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:55.269> performance<00:02:55.930> of<00:02:56.049> this

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
affecting the performance of this

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.009 
affecting the performance of this
suspension<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:57.850> just<00:02:58.750> for<00:02:58.900> all<00:02:58.989> the
