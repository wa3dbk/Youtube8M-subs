00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
anyway I just hope it doesn't do this

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.690 
anyway I just hope it doesn't do this
because<00:00:46.420> because<00:00:47.420> I<00:00:47.540> found<00:00:47.810> that<00:00:48.050> my<00:00:48.700> capture

system legs whatever there's too much of

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:03.500 
system legs whatever there's too much of
one<00:00:53.300> color<00:00:54.580> on<00:00:55.580> the<00:00:55.700> screen

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.800 

and<00:01:04.049> that's<00:01:04.350> well<00:01:05.250> not<00:01:05.939> funny

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.070

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
in order to get this pipe there's a 1-up

00:01:46.400 --> 00:02:01.170 
in order to get this pipe there's a 1-up
I<00:01:46.520> could<00:01:46.700> get<00:01:47.830> it's<00:01:48.830> just<00:01:49.040> a<00:01:53.170> 10<00:01:54.790> blocks

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:10.810 

because<00:02:02.180> that's<00:02:02.570> safe<00:02:07.300> pretty<00:02:08.300> sure<00:02:09.820> this

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
because that's safe pretty sure this

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.900 
because that's safe pretty sure this
leads<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.360> some<00:02:11.660> place<00:02:11.870> special<00:02:13.840> yeah<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:16.610> can

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
skip this section of the rubble oh I'm

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.770 
skip this section of the rubble oh I'm
sure<00:02:21.980> Eddie<00:02:22.340> she<00:02:22.640> can't<00:02:22.940> walk<00:02:23.120> on<00:02:23.360> top<00:02:23.630> of

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
sure Eddie she can't walk on top of

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.610 
sure Eddie she can't walk on top of
those<00:02:23.870> oh<00:02:24.110> wait<00:02:24.890> there<00:02:25.820> is<00:02:25.850> some<00:02:26.180> up<00:02:26.330> there<00:02:26.570> oh

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.610 

this<00:02:30.620> is<00:02:30.709> like<00:02:32.120> I<00:02:32.959> knew<00:02:33.290> I<00:02:33.320> shouldn't

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
this is like I knew I shouldn't

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.210 
this is like I knew I shouldn't
have<00:02:33.680> gone<00:02:33.830> for<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.160> I<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:39.680> didn't<00:02:40.100> know

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
have gone for that I just didn't know

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.559 
have gone for that I just didn't know
there<00:02:40.370> was<00:02:40.430> something<00:02:40.640> up<00:02:40.880> there<00:02:40.910> so

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.559 

so<00:02:47.569> I<00:02:48.220> think<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.430> have<00:02:49.549> too<00:02:49.670> long<00:02:49.879> jump<00:02:50.239> to<00:02:50.420> get

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
so I think you have too long jump to get

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.250 
so I think you have too long jump to get
past<00:02:50.959> that<00:02:51.170> oh<00:02:51.349> oh<00:02:51.650> oh<00:02:51.709> there's<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:53.260> there's

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
past that oh oh oh there's a there's

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.500 
past that oh oh oh there's a there's
