that it matches and has the right size
and<00:01:29.750> it<00:01:30.750> does<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:32.390> then<00:01:33.390> apply<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.500> glue

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.680 

when<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> glue<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.500> applied<00:01:47.330> let<00:01:48.330> it<00:01:48.420> set<00:01:48.659> for

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
when the glue is applied let it set for

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.140 
when the glue is applied let it set for
a<00:01:49.020> couple<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.409> seconds<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.640> blow<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
a couple of seconds you can blow on the

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.640 
a couple of seconds you can blow on the
glue<00:01:51.330> so<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.720> gets<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.930> little<00:01:52.050> bit<00:01:52.229> sticky

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
glue so it gets a little bit sticky

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.410 
glue so it gets a little bit sticky
because<00:01:52.890> if<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.159> glue<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.460> sticky<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:54.210> going

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
because if the glue is sticky it's going

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.660 
because if the glue is sticky it's going
to<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.600> easier<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:55.560> attach<00:01:55.830> it<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.369> eyelid

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
to be easier to attach it to the eyelid
