 through example after you see here 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.440
 axillary 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.760
 what more do you see there audio well you 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.910
 for the rest, for example 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.890
 Bluetooth and also the optical connection 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.260
 which connection sitting here so 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.420
 all at the back 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.719
 You can see the optical here as well 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.760

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.149
 wired an mp3 player to it 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.340
 Close 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.090
 and here on the side on you too 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.280
 HDMI-in and HDMI-out to that HDMI-out 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.100

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.600
 is also yes with an audio 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.909
 research and om and that means that 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.670
 you return the TV sound can 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.720
