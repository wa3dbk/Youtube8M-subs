the date next page option one so this is

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.310 
the date next page option one so this is

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.160 
the strength of your logo and black and
white<00:01:34.740> before<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.759> apply<00:01:36.509> any<00:01:36.659> type<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.930> color

to<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.950> client<00:01:38.310> gets<00:01:38.490> an<00:01:38.610> idea<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.970> what

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
to it so the client gets an idea of what

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.700 
to it so the client gets an idea of what
the<00:01:39.210> logo<00:01:39.479> looks<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.930> right<00:01:40.229> away<00:01:40.350> without

being<00:01:40.950> influenced<00:01:41.549> by<00:01:41.579> color<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.869> right<00:01:43.380> here

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
being influenced by color so right here

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.069 
being influenced by color so right here
is<00:01:43.710> my<00:01:43.829> primary<00:01:44.130> lock<00:01:44.670> up<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.180> then<00:01:45.720> here's<00:01:45.960> an

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
is my primary lock up and then here's an

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.859 
is my primary lock up and then here's an
alternate<00:01:46.649> version<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:48.000> same<00:01:48.240> logo<00:01:48.630> just

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
alternate version of that same logo just

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.990 
alternate version of that same logo just
to<00:01:49.110> say<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.070> need<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.369> mock<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.579> up<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:50.970> a

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
to say if you need to mock it up on a

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.600 
to say if you need to mock it up on a
pencil<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:51.509> example<00:01:52.020> an<00:01:52.799> application<00:01:52.950> that's

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
pencil for example an application that's

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.389 
pencil for example an application that's
kind<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.149> extreme<00:01:54.530> horizontal<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:56.009> can<00:01:56.159> still

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
kind of extreme horizontal it can still

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.469 
kind of extreme horizontal it can still
be<00:01:56.549> done

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
be done

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.850 
be done
you<00:01:57.869> just<00:01:58.079> need<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.290> rearrange<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.829> elements

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
you just need to rearrange the elements

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.980 
you just need to rearrange the elements
in<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.369> logo<00:01:59.640> so<00:01:59.790> this<00:01:59.939> becomes<00:02:00.299> another<00:02:00.689> logo

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
in the logo so this becomes another logo

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.109 
in the logo so this becomes another logo
but<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.500> still<00:02:01.799> references<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> primary<00:02:02.880> logo

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
but it still references the primary logo

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.899 
but it still references the primary logo
so<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> version<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:05.009> we<00:02:05.159> refer<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.790> as

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
so this is a version that we refer to as

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.819 
so this is a version that we refer to as
stacked<00:02:06.390> because<00:02:06.899> your<00:02:07.079> elements<00:02:07.439> stack<00:02:07.649> on

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
stacked because your elements stack on

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.199 
stacked because your elements stack on
top<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:08.039> each<00:02:08.310> other<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.819> more<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.149> a

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
top of each other this is more of a

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.559 
top of each other this is more of a
vertical<00:02:09.660> format<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.200> then<00:02:10.289> you

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
vertical format and then you

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.030 
vertical format and then you
your<00:02:10.689> horizontal<00:02:10.959> format<00:02:11.530> here<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:13.680> those<00:02:14.680> are

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
your horizontal format here so those are

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.250 
your horizontal format here so those are
the<00:02:15.489> primary<00:02:15.999> and<00:02:16.090> alternate<00:02:16.689> lockups<00:02:17.079> for

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
the primary and alternate lockups for

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.759 
the primary and alternate lockups for
option<00:02:17.530> 1<00:02:17.709> option<00:02:18.269> 1<00:02:19.269> color<00:02:19.719> scheme<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:20.530> I

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
option 1 option 1 color scheme so I

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.000 
option 1 option 1 color scheme so I
pulled<00:02:21.159> a<00:02:21.519> few<00:02:22.230> retro<00:02:23.230> color<00:02:23.530> scenes<00:02:23.829> that<00:02:23.980> I

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
pulled a few retro color scenes that I

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.920 
pulled a few retro color scenes that I
felt<00:02:24.249> would<00:02:24.370> feel<00:02:25.090> appropriate<00:02:25.659> for<00:02:25.810> this

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
felt would feel appropriate for this

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.740 
felt would feel appropriate for this
this<00:02:26.590> brand<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.790> can<00:02:27.969> see<00:02:28.180> I'm<00:02:28.299> using<00:02:28.540> the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
this brand and you can see I'm using the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.129 
this brand and you can see I'm using the
same<00:02:28.959> color<00:02:29.319> scheme<00:02:29.920> on<00:02:30.689> these<00:02:31.689> two<00:02:31.930> options

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:32.139 
same color scheme on these two options

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:34.709 
same color scheme on these two options
just<00:02:32.469> just<00:02:33.159> to<00:02:33.310> show<00:02:33.459> that<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:33.700> is<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.120> versatile

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:34.719 
just just to show that it is a versatile

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.770 
just just to show that it is a versatile
palette<00:02:35.469> depending<00:02:36.310> on<00:02:36.430> how<00:02:36.639> he<00:02:36.700> would<00:02:37.180> like

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
palette depending on how he would like

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.009 
palette depending on how he would like
those<00:02:37.989> colors<00:02:38.200> used<00:02:39.159> on<00:02:39.549> the<00:02:40.150> logo<00:02:40.329> and<00:02:40.930> you

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
those colors used on the logo and you

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.509 
those colors used on the logo and you
can<00:02:41.169> see<00:02:41.319> I'm<00:02:41.409> also<00:02:41.709> showing<00:02:41.919> the<00:02:42.099> alternate

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
can see I'm also showing the alternate

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.039 
can see I'm also showing the alternate
version<00:02:42.549> down<00:02:42.939> here<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:43.329> he<00:02:43.389> can<00:02:43.540> get<00:02:43.629> an<00:02:43.750> idea

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
version down here so he can get an idea

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.640 
version down here so he can get an idea
of<00:02:44.139> how<00:02:44.439> both<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.680> them<00:02:44.919> work<00:02:45.129> with<00:02:45.310> color<00:02:45.579> and

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
of how both of them work with color and

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.439 
of how both of them work with color and
then<00:02:47.650> I<00:02:47.739> always<00:02:47.889> like<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.370> show<00:02:48.699> at<00:02:48.879> least<00:02:48.909> one

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:49.449 
then I always like to show at least one

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:52.530 
then I always like to show at least one
mock-up<00:02:49.989> of<00:02:50.199> the<00:02:50.769> logo<00:02:51.129> in<00:02:51.400> use<00:02:51.760> so<00:02:52.180> we<00:02:52.269> can<00:02:52.449> get

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
mock-up of the logo in use so we can get

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.209 
mock-up of the logo in use so we can get
an<00:02:52.659> idea<00:02:52.959> of<00:02:53.019> if<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.739> were<00:02:53.859> to<00:02:53.980> choose<00:02:54.159> this

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:54.219 
an idea of if you were to choose this

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:54.869 
an idea of if you were to choose this
option

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
option

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.240 
option
what<00:02:55.449> do<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:55.599> could<00:02:55.780> expect<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.680> feel<00:02:56.889> or

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
what do you could expect it to feel or

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.909 
what do you could expect it to feel or
look<00:02:57.459> like<00:02:57.489> in<00:02:58.000> an<00:02:58.959> environment<00:02:59.590> where<00:02:59.769> it

00:02:59.909 --> 00:02:59.919 
look like in an environment where it

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.399 
look like in an environment where it
would<00:03:00.189> be<00:03:00.730> used<00:03:01.060> so<00:03:01.540> here<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:01.900> would<00:03:02.049> be<00:03:02.079> a

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
would be used so here it would be a

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.439 
would be used so here it would be a
sample<00:03:03.099> website<00:03:03.250> header<00:03:04.650> option<00:03:05.650> to

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:06.449 
sample website header option to

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.640 
sample website header option to
definitely<00:03:07.449> different<00:03:07.750> than<00:03:07.840> option<00:03:08.199> 1<00:03:08.379> so

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
definitely different than option 1 so

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.349 
definitely different than option 1 so
you've<00:03:08.769> got<00:03:08.889> a<00:03:08.919> good<00:03:09.069> contrast<00:03:09.609> there<00:03:09.939> and<00:03:10.209> I'm

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
you've got a good contrast there and I'm

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:11.729 
you've got a good contrast there and I'm
just<00:03:10.510> showing<00:03:10.659> down<00:03:10.900> here<00:03:11.139> some<00:03:11.349> holding

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
just showing down here some holding

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.520 
just showing down here some holding
shapes<00:03:12.040> if<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.819> want<00:03:13.090> to<00:03:13.810> have<00:03:13.989> it<00:03:14.139> look<00:03:14.349> like

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
shapes if you want to have it look like

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.640 
shapes if you want to have it look like
more<00:03:14.769> of<00:03:14.799> a<00:03:14.949> sticker<00:03:15.250> on<00:03:16.139> places<00:03:17.139> you<00:03:17.259> use<00:03:17.470> it

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
more of a sticker on places you use it

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.219 
more of a sticker on places you use it
so<00:03:17.829> we've<00:03:18.819> got<00:03:19.030> two<00:03:19.269> holding<00:03:19.599> shapes<00:03:19.870> down

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:20.229 
so we've got two holding shapes down

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:22.830 
so we've got two holding shapes down
here<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.829> then<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.639> primary<00:03:22.030> load<00:03:22.209> logo

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
here and then the primary load logo

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.860 
here and then the primary load logo
lockup<00:03:23.259> right<00:03:23.290> up<00:03:23.590> here<00:03:24.509> second<00:03:25.509> page<00:03:25.689> is

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
lockup right up here second page is

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.530 
lockup right up here second page is
color<00:03:26.109> once<00:03:26.409> again<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:26.919> same<00:03:27.819> color<00:03:28.090> schemes

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
color once again and same color schemes

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.259 
color once again and same color schemes
using<00:03:29.139> and<00:03:29.620> showing<00:03:30.069> those<00:03:30.609> holding<00:03:31.030> shapes

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
using and showing those holding shapes

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.729 
using and showing those holding shapes
down<00:03:31.509> here<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:33.269> then<00:03:34.269> here<00:03:34.750> is<00:03:34.959> another

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
down here and then here is another

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.069 
down here and then here is another
application<00:03:36.519> mock-up<00:03:37.090> so<00:03:37.359> you<00:03:37.599> can<00:03:37.780> see<00:03:37.930> it's

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
application mock-up so you can see it's

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.229 
application mock-up so you can see it's
centered<00:03:38.439> now<00:03:38.650> on<00:03:38.979> the<00:03:39.400> sample<00:03:39.729> header<00:03:39.909> so<00:03:40.150> you

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
centered now on the sample header so you

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.080 
centered now on the sample header so you
can<00:03:40.389> compare<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.500> first<00:03:41.829> logo<00:03:42.159> header<00:03:42.759> with

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
can compare the first logo header with

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.879 
can compare the first logo header with
the<00:03:43.180> second<00:03:43.509> logo<00:03:43.720> header<00:03:43.930> very<00:03:44.199> easily<00:03:44.439> and

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
the second logo header very easily and

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.729 
the second logo header very easily and
then<00:03:45.489> finally<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.180> third<00:03:46.389> option<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:47.259> always

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
then finally the third option I always

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.559 
then finally the third option I always
like<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.459> note<00:03:49.060> on<00:03:49.269> my<00:03:49.599> PDF<00:03:50.009> what<00:03:51.299> option<00:03:52.299> is<00:03:52.419> my

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
like to note on my PDF what option is my

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.229 
like to note on my PDF what option is my
recommended<00:03:53.139> option<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:53.859> I<00:03:54.579> usually<00:03:54.939> always

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
recommended option and I usually always

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.059 
recommended option and I usually always
leave<00:03:55.509> it<00:03:55.629> for<00:03:55.810> last<00:03:56.049> so<00:03:56.349> there's<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.620> lead<00:03:56.889> up

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
leave it for last so there's a lead up

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.420 
leave it for last so there's a lead up
to<00:03:57.750> my<00:03:58.750> final<00:03:59.109> option<00:03:59.500> here<00:03:59.829> you<00:03:59.919> can<00:04:00.069> see<00:04:00.250> this

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
to my final option here you can see this

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.369 
to my final option here you can see this
logo<00:04:00.639> is<00:04:00.819> pretty<00:04:01.060> versatile<00:04:01.509> if<00:04:02.049> you<00:04:02.169> got<00:04:02.259> your

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
logo is pretty versatile if you got your

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:03.959 
logo is pretty versatile if you got your
primary<00:04:02.799> logo<00:04:02.979> lock<00:04:03.250> up<00:04:03.430> but<00:04:03.579> then<00:04:03.699> you<00:04:03.819> can

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:03.969 
primary logo lock up but then you can

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:05.670 
primary logo lock up but then you can
also<00:04:04.090> rearrange<00:04:04.449> the<00:04:04.719> elements<00:04:04.750> in<00:04:05.259> a<00:04:05.379> few

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
also rearrange the elements in a few

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.619 
also rearrange the elements in a few
different<00:04:05.949> ways<00:04:06.219> and<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:07.060> can<00:04:07.269> still<00:04:07.479> get

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
different ways and you can still get

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.159 
different ways and you can still get
interesting<00:04:08.229> but<00:04:08.409> still<00:04:08.530> very<00:04:09.400> similar

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
interesting but still very similar

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.929 
interesting but still very similar
results<00:04:11.169> and<00:04:11.379> I<00:04:11.799> should<00:04:11.979> mention<00:04:12.099> the<00:04:12.609> the

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:12.939 
results and I should mention the the

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.300 
results and I should mention the the
reason<00:04:13.209> for<00:04:13.359> this<00:04:13.479> -<00:04:14.049> and<00:04:14.379> the<00:04:14.530> two<00:04:14.739> dots<00:04:14.949> it's

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
reason for this - and the two dots it's

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.370 
reason for this - and the two dots it's
kind<00:04:15.579> of<00:04:15.729> you<00:04:16.599> could<00:04:16.719> think<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.049> might<00:04:17.229> be<00:04:17.349> a

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
kind of you could think it might be a

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.860 
kind of you could think it might be a
little<00:04:17.620> confusing<00:04:18.009> because<00:04:18.969> the<00:04:19.209> -<00:04:19.359> just<00:04:19.570> come

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
little confusing because the - just come

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.800 
little confusing because the - just come
before<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.320> dots<00:04:20.500> but<00:04:21.099> this<00:04:21.789> is<00:04:21.969> actually<00:04:22.479> D

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
before the dots but this is actually D

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.300 
before the dots but this is actually D
and

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
and

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.930 
and
Morse<00:04:23.430> code<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:24.690> -<00:04:24.870> on<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.080> two<00:04:25.260> dots<00:04:25.470> and

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
Morse code the - on the two dots and

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.610 
Morse code the - on the two dots and
because<00:04:26.940> it's<00:04:27.150> dot<00:04:27.419> -<00:04:27.750> with<00:04:28.139> the<00:04:28.230> two<00:04:28.410> DS

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
because it's dot - with the two DS

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.730 
because it's dot - with the two DS
that's<00:04:29.070> why<00:04:29.250> it's<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.060> same<00:04:30.270> Morse<00:04:30.540> code<00:04:30.900> line

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
that's why it's the same Morse code line

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.830 
that's why it's the same Morse code line
repeated<00:04:33.020> so<00:04:34.020> here<00:04:34.710> are<00:04:34.800> those<00:04:34.950> color<00:04:35.220> options

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
repeated so here are those color options

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.710 
repeated so here are those color options
used<00:04:36.840> on<00:04:37.169> all<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.560> different<00:04:38.000> options<00:04:39.000> for

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
used on all the different options for

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.909 
used on all the different options for
the<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:40.800> logo<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:41.460> alternates<00:04:41.940> and<00:04:42.919> then

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
the the logo the alternates and then

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.190 
the the logo the alternates and then
here<00:04:44.190> you<00:04:44.310> can<00:04:44.340> see<00:04:44.780> whenever<00:04:45.780> I'm

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
here you can see whenever I'm

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.590 
here you can see whenever I'm
recommending<00:04:46.650> an<00:04:47.010> option<00:04:47.310> I<00:04:47.400> usually<00:04:47.760> like<00:04:47.970> to

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
recommending an option I usually like to

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.110 
recommending an option I usually like to
provide<00:04:49.020> more<00:04:49.550> mock-ups<00:04:50.550> than<00:04:50.730> my<00:04:50.880> previous

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
provide more mock-ups than my previous

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.270 
provide more mock-ups than my previous
options<00:04:51.870> just<00:04:52.200> to<00:04:52.350> kind<00:04:52.560> of<00:04:52.650> sell<00:04:52.889> it<00:04:53.040> that

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
options just to kind of sell it that

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.530 
options just to kind of sell it that
much<00:04:53.490> more<00:04:53.820> by<00:04:54.270> showing<00:04:54.570> it<00:04:54.840> in<00:04:55.080> a<00:04:56.240> variety<00:04:57.240> of

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
much more by showing it in a variety of

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.050 
much more by showing it in a variety of
different<00:04:57.750> uses<00:04:58.050> so<00:04:58.740> here's<00:04:59.040> some<00:04:59.790> just

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
different uses so here's some just

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.020 
different uses so here's some just
different<00:05:00.360> colored<00:05:00.750> headers<00:05:01.200> and<00:05:01.970> then<00:05:02.970> I

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
different colored headers and then I

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.850 
different colored headers and then I
also<00:05:03.180> mocked<00:05:03.510> it<00:05:03.660> up<00:05:03.750> on<00:05:03.930> some<00:05:04.110> stationery<00:05:04.680> so

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
also mocked it up on some stationery so

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.170 
also mocked it up on some stationery so
you've<00:05:04.979> got<00:05:05.130> a<00:05:05.160> letterhead<00:05:05.460> there<00:05:05.880> you've<00:05:06.150> got

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
you've got a letterhead there you've got

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.870 
you've got a letterhead there you've got
an<00:05:06.750> envelope<00:05:07.160> business<00:05:08.160> cards<00:05:08.550> front<00:05:08.790> and

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
an envelope business cards front and

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.680 
an envelope business cards front and
back<00:05:09.060> and<00:05:09.330> then<00:05:09.450> pencils<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:11.120> then<00:05:12.120> finally

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
back and then pencils and then finally

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.110 
back and then pencils and then finally
the<00:05:12.900> last<00:05:12.930> page<00:05:13.470> I<00:05:13.919> would<00:05:14.430> recommend<00:05:14.970> this<00:05:15.060> for

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
the last page I would recommend this for

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.409 
the last page I would recommend this for
any<00:05:15.450> any<00:05:16.940> presentation<00:05:17.940> that<00:05:18.090> you're<00:05:18.180> putting

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
any any presentation that you're putting

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.810 
any any presentation that you're putting
together<00:05:18.570> that<00:05:18.930> has<00:05:19.080> logos<00:05:19.560> I<00:05:19.800> think<00:05:20.580> this<00:05:20.700> is

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
together that has logos I think this is

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.300 
together that has logos I think this is
pretty<00:05:21.540> much<00:05:21.690> a<00:05:21.990> universal<00:05:22.290> page<00:05:22.979> not<00:05:23.280> just

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
pretty much a universal page not just

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.909 
pretty much a universal page not just
specific<00:05:24.150> to<00:05:24.330> me<00:05:24.510> is<00:05:24.750> showing<00:05:25.320> all<00:05:25.530> of<00:05:25.710> your

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
specific to me is showing all of your

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.100 
specific to me is showing all of your
options<00:05:26.250> together<00:05:26.850> on<00:05:27.060> one<00:05:27.270> page<00:05:27.539> so<00:05:27.930> the

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
options together on one page so the

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.529 
options together on one page so the
client<00:05:28.410> can<00:05:28.530> get<00:05:28.680> an<00:05:28.770> idea<00:05:29.070> of<00:05:29.340> the<00:05:30.300> strength

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
client can get an idea of the strength

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.070 
client can get an idea of the strength
compared<00:05:31.380> to<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:32.280> other<00:05:32.400> options<00:05:32.940> if<00:05:33.870> any

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
compared to the other options if any

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.890 
compared to the other options if any
kind<00:05:34.410> of<00:05:34.470> jump<00:05:34.740> out<00:05:34.890> at<00:05:35.160> them<00:05:35.220> right<00:05:35.789> away<00:05:36.030> so

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900

offering<00:06:01.650> a<00:06:01.889> few<00:06:02.340> options<00:06:02.850> with<00:06:03.030> those

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
offering a few options with those

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.510 
offering a few options with those
revisions<00:06:03.990> in<00:06:04.139> mind<00:06:04.440> so<00:06:04.919> here's<00:06:05.190> the<00:06:05.340> first

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
revisions in mind so here's the first

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.969 
revisions in mind so here's the first
one<00:06:05.729> it's<00:06:06.539> just<00:06:06.690> taking<00:06:07.050> the<00:06:07.169> logo<00:06:07.440> exactly

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
one it's just taking the logo exactly

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.950 
one it's just taking the logo exactly
and<00:06:08.250> slanting<00:06:08.820> it<00:06:08.970> and<00:06:09.180> then<00:06:09.330> applying<00:06:09.690> color

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
and slanting it and then applying color

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.659 
and slanting it and then applying color
in<00:06:10.260> a<00:06:10.410> few<00:06:10.979> different<00:06:11.310> ways<00:06:13.400> option<00:06:14.400> two<00:06:14.639> is

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:14.669 
in a few different ways option two is

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:16.520 
in a few different ways option two is
just<00:06:15.090> changing<00:06:15.419> those<00:06:15.570> harder<00:06:15.960> lines<00:06:16.200> with

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
just changing those harder lines with

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.879 
just changing those harder lines with
dots<00:06:16.800> so<00:06:17.280> you<00:06:17.340> can<00:06:17.550> see<00:06:17.840> same<00:06:18.840> same<00:06:19.470> thing<00:06:19.710> as

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
dots so you can see same same thing as

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:23.750 
dots so you can see same same thing as
the<00:06:20.400> previous<00:06:20.850> slide<00:06:21.000> and<00:06:22.190> then<00:06:23.190> the<00:06:23.220> last<00:06:23.490> one

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
the previous slide and then the last one

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.659 
the previous slide and then the last one
is<00:06:24.800> definitely<00:06:25.800> a<00:06:25.830> little<00:06:26.010> different<00:06:26.130> and

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
is definitely a little different and

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.450 
is definitely a little different and
makes<00:06:26.850> it<00:06:27.030> more<00:06:27.180> of<00:06:27.270> a<00:06:27.389> square<00:06:27.950> logo<00:06:28.950> and<00:06:29.280> then

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
makes it more of a square logo and then

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.710 
makes it more of a square logo and then
once<00:06:29.729> again<00:06:29.850> I<00:06:30.060> show<00:06:30.360> them

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
once again I show them

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.350 
once again I show them
all<00:06:31.350> together<00:06:31.680> so<00:06:32.460> the<00:06:32.730> client<00:06:33.030> ended<00:06:33.240> up

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
all together so the client ended up

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.980 
all together so the client ended up
choosing<00:06:33.630> the<00:06:34.170> second<00:06:34.590> one<00:06:34.710> in<00:06:34.890> the<00:06:34.950> end<00:06:35.490> and

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
choosing the second one in the end and

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.490 
choosing the second one in the end and
in<00:06:36.990> next<00:06:37.290> week's<00:06:37.470> video<00:06:38.420> tutorial<00:06:39.420> I'll<00:06:40.260> show

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
in next week's video tutorial I'll show

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.620 
in next week's video tutorial I'll show
you<00:06:40.770> how<00:06:41.010> to<00:06:41.490> create<00:06:41.910> all<00:06:42.090> the<00:06:42.180> different<00:06:42.450> file

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630 
you how to create all the different file

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.810 
you how to create all the different file
formats<00:06:43.080> for<00:06:43.200> this<00:06:43.410> for<00:06:43.620> final<00:06:43.980> handoff<00:06:44.520> for

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
formats for this for final handoff for

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.130 
formats for this for final handoff for
the<00:06:44.940> client<00:06:46.100> obviously<00:06:47.100> this<00:06:47.250> is<00:06:47.430> for<00:06:48.140> mostly

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140 
the client obviously this is for mostly

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.050 
the client obviously this is for mostly
web<00:06:49.470> but<00:06:49.830> you<00:06:49.920> still<00:06:50.190> want<00:06:50.400> to<00:06:50.520> always<00:06:50.730> give<00:06:51.030> a

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
web but you still want to always give a

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.770 
web but you still want to always give a
client<00:06:51.300> an<00:06:51.570> opportunity<00:06:52.260> to<00:06:52.530> have<00:06:53.450> the<00:06:54.450> the

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
client an opportunity to have the the
