start<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:39.710> process<00:00:39.920> is<00:00:40.250> just<00:00:40.370> finely<00:00:40.879> slice

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
start the process is just finely slice

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
still got that structural integrity

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.510 
still got that structural integrity

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
to get it nice and fine is just chop

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:24.700 
to get it nice and fine is just chop
through<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.119> short

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
this stage all we're going to do is just

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.830 
this stage all we're going to do is just
sweat<00:02:46.790> those<00:02:47.790> grains<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.269> rice<00:02:48.390> off<00:02:48.660> and

covering it all that excess fat that was

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.680 
covering it all that excess fat that was
in<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.580> plan<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:50.940> this<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.090> going<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.360> stop

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
in the plan and this is going to stop

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.570

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.130 
crucially important that we do use a hot
stock<00:03:30.030> further<00:03:30.360> method<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:30.870> either<00:03:30.930> you've

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
stock further method so either you've

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.410 
stock further method so either you've
got<00:03:31.349> nice<00:03:31.650> hot<00:03:31.890> stock<00:03:32.190> freshly<00:03:32.640> made<00:03:32.790> or<00:03:33.299> I've

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
got nice hot stock freshly made or I've

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.090 
got nice hot stock freshly made or I've
got<00:03:33.600> panis<00:03:34.019> dog<00:03:34.200> just<00:03:34.380> boiling<00:03:34.709> away<00:03:34.829> at<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
got panis dog just boiling away at the

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.800 
got panis dog just boiling away at the
back<00:03:35.250> behind<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.609> resort<00:03:35.910> so<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.420> as<00:03:36.570> I<00:03:36.660> say

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
back behind the resort so and as I say

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.930 
back behind the resort so and as I say
crucially<00:03:37.320> important<00:03:37.829> that<00:03:38.280> we're<00:03:38.430> using<00:03:38.670> hot

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
crucially important that we're using hot

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.430 
crucially important that we're using hot
stock<00:03:39.209> because<00:03:39.480> every<00:03:39.690> time<00:03:39.870> we<00:03:40.019> add<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.260> cold

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
stock because every time we add the cold

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.870 
stock because every time we add the cold
stock<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.829> that<00:03:40.950> pan<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.310> pan<00:03:41.340> is<00:03:41.670> going<00:03:41.820> to

stock to that pan the pan is going to

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
stock to that pan the pan is going to
cool<00:03:42.030> down<00:03:42.209> we're<00:03:42.359> going<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.540> very<00:03:42.750> very

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
cool down we're going to very very

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.349 
cool down we're going to very very
slowly<00:03:43.350> incorporate<00:03:44.010> this<00:03:44.160> stock<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:45.269> the

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
slowly incorporate this stock and to the

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.300 
slowly incorporate this stock and to the
risotto<00:03:45.650> constantly<00:03:46.650> stirring<00:03:46.920> constantly

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
risotto constantly stirring constantly

risotto constantly stirring constantly
agitating<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.150> rice<00:03:48.329> that's<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:49.230> every

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
agitating the rice that's and and every

full<00:03:51.989> of<00:03:52.200> stock<00:03:52.440> that<00:03:52.560> we<00:03:52.650> pop<00:03:52.859> in<00:03:53.040> there<00:03:53.220> we're

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
full of stock that we pop in there we're

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:54.920 
full of stock that we pop in there we're
going<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.030> add<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.209> next<00:03:54.390> level<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:54.810> start

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
going to add the next level and start

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.110 
going to add the next level and start
the<00:03:55.140> process<00:03:55.319> time<00:03:55.859> and<00:03:56.040> time<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.459> so<00:03:56.940> that

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
the process time and time and so that

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.720 
the process time and time and so that
rice<00:03:57.329> is<00:03:57.359> cooked<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.870> perfection

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.150 

so<00:04:03.300> I<00:04:03.330> don't<00:04:03.480> know<00:04:03.690> it's<00:04:03.959> more<00:04:04.470> ladleful<00:04:05.010> at<00:04:05.099> a

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
so I don't know it's more ladleful at a

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.210 
so I don't know it's more ladleful at a
time<00:04:06.110> it's<00:04:07.110> roughly<00:04:07.500> gonna<00:04:07.709> take<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.190> a

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
time it's roughly gonna take you a

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.880 
time it's roughly gonna take you a
minute<00:04:08.550> to<00:04:08.670> two<00:04:08.879> minutes<00:04:08.910> just<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:10.590> get<00:04:10.739> each

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
minute to two minutes just to get each

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.780 
minute to two minutes just to get each
ladle<00:04:11.280> to<00:04:11.430> incorporate<00:04:12.060> into<00:04:12.330> that<00:04:12.480> risotto

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.099 

so<00:04:17.790> that's<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.209> rice<00:04:18.389> cooked<00:04:18.690> in<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.870> risotto

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
so that's the rice cooked in the risotto

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.870 
so that's the rice cooked in the risotto
now<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:19.620> always<00:04:19.889> like<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.130> check<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.549> rice<00:04:20.729> I
