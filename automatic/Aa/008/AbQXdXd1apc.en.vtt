modification I think that I've done to
the<00:00:55.590> Isetta<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:57.239> purists<00:00:57.750> may<00:00:57.780> cringe

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the Isetta and the purists may cringe

the seal on the left side and then

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.790 
the seal on the left side and then

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
freshly redone backing plate it would go

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.640 
freshly redone backing plate it would go
like<00:02:29.190> this<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.780> then<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:30.870> plate<00:02:31.200> holds<00:02:31.560> it

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
like this and then this plate holds it

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.300 
like this and then this plate holds it
on<00:02:31.740> there's<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.040> seal<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.490> there<00:02:32.760> with<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:34.190> or<00:02:35.190> my

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
pinky finger is here there's like a

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.540 
pinky finger is here there's like a
little<00:02:36.990> drain<00:02:37.380> so<00:02:37.770> you<00:02:37.830> know<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.070> got<00:02:38.250> lots<00:02:38.370> of

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
little drain so you know you got lots of

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.270 
little drain so you know you got lots of
grease<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:38.820> there<00:02:39.230> when<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.440> grease<00:02:40.920> hits

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
grease in there when that grease hits

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.190 
grease in there when that grease hits
the<00:02:41.460> inside<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:41.760> your<00:02:41.850> rim<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.270> then<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.930> hub

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
the inside of your rim and then the hub

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.990 
the inside of your rim and then the hub
then<00:02:43.560> would<00:02:43.830> seal<00:02:44.160> on<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:44.640> inside<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:47.000> the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
then would seal on the inside of the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.060 
then would seal on the inside of the
seal<00:02:48.240> seals<00:02:48.600> on<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.960> on<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.350> hub<00:02:49.560> surface<00:02:50.660> so

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
seal seals on the on the hub surface so

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.680 
seal seals on the on the hub surface so
