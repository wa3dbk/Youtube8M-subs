 bike back wheel so here we have 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:19.779
 a few effects including saab or so here 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:23.259
 must be life is so that 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:26.199
 it's ya between France and France 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:40.210
 why four so there we did 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:42.550
 part of this is not the same 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.820

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.820
 their faith 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:01:01.700
 where expensive or even on that side for cage 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:04.280
 of equal in the left and this is it 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.010

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:29.420
 between the two brakes here it is 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:31.970
 well settled afterwards for the arms we

 have two solutions either with these 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:41.540

 here have lives here and are drawn 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.400
 vestal we shoot that we pull this with a 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.240
 clamp that see this one will squeeze you too 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.770
 after that it's going to block where there and 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.820
 for speed bikes could the 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.670
 speeds where there is any 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.770
