the hair it's very important that you go

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.400 
the hair it's very important that you go
from<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> mid<00:00:33.149> shaft<00:00:33.360> through<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.750> ends<00:00:34.260> and

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
from the mid shaft through the ends and

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.530 
from the mid shaft through the ends and
try<00:00:35.040> not<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.309> get<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.760> scalp<00:00:36.059> area<00:00:36.270> so

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
try not to get it on the scalp area so

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.000 
try not to get it on the scalp area so
it<00:00:36.719> won't<00:00:36.899> weigh<00:00:37.079> down<00:00:37.260> their<00:00:37.469> hair<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.770> we<00:00:37.860> get

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
it won't weigh down their hair so we get

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.389 
it won't weigh down their hair so we get
the<00:00:38.160> most<00:00:38.340> volume<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.329> your<00:00:39.540> hair<00:00:39.780> style<00:00:40.399> so

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
the most volume in your hair style so

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.350 
the most volume in your hair style so
what<00:00:41.489> we're<00:00:41.579> going<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.760> do<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.030> we're<00:00:42.149> going<00:00:42.239> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.639 
what we're going to do is we're going to
go<00:00:42.570> through<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.899> wash<00:00:43.140> your<00:00:43.320> hair<00:00:43.440> with<00:00:43.500> a

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
go through and wash your hair with a

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.110 
go through and wash your hair with a
good<00:00:43.829> volumizing<00:00:44.430> shampoo<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:45.030> then

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
good volumizing shampoo and then

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:59.460 
good volumizing shampoo and then
conditioner<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.809> then<00:00:46.230> we'll<00:00:46.350> go<00:00:46.469> from<00:00:46.500> there

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.950 

I<00:00:59.670> think<00:01:00.670> one<00:01:00.850> of<00:01:00.880> the<00:01:01.060> important<00:01:01.480> parts<00:01:01.780> of

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
I think one of the important parts of

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.170 
I think one of the important parts of
blow<00:01:02.860> drying<00:01:03.100> your<00:01:03.220> hair<00:01:03.460> is<00:01:03.610> to<00:01:03.790> get<00:01:03.910> as<00:01:04.000> much

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
blow drying your hair is to get as much

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.990 
blow drying your hair is to get as much
water<00:01:04.600> out<00:01:04.750> of<00:01:04.930> it<00:01:05.170> as<00:01:05.350> possible<00:01:05.590> so<00:01:06.580> really

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
water out of it as possible so really

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.420 
water out of it as possible so really
taking<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:07.600> getting<00:01:08.560> that<00:01:08.680> water<00:01:08.980> out<00:01:09.160> as

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
taking and getting that water out as

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.310 
taking and getting that water out as
much<00:01:09.760> as<00:01:09.820> possible<00:01:10.090> throughout<00:01:10.780> those<00:01:11.020> ends

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
much as possible throughout those ends

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.990 
much as possible throughout those ends
because<00:01:11.560> it<00:01:11.770> ends<00:01:12.190> up<00:01:12.280> holding<00:01:12.430> in<00:01:12.730> a<00:01:12.790> lot<00:01:12.820> of

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
because it ends up holding in a lot of

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.730 
because it ends up holding in a lot of
extra<00:01:13.390> moisture<00:01:15.270> which<00:01:16.270> makes<00:01:17.140> your<00:01:17.260> blow-dry

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
extra moisture which makes your blow-dry

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.480 
extra moisture which makes your blow-dry
much<00:01:18.460> longer<00:01:19.260> so<00:01:20.260> the<00:01:20.380> more<00:01:20.890> moisture<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:21.310> can

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
much longer so the more moisture you can

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.310 
much longer so the more moisture you can
get<00:01:21.640> out<00:01:21.730> of<00:01:21.760> the<00:01:21.940> hair<00:01:22.150> the<00:01:22.360> better<00:01:22.540> when

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
get out of the hair the better when

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.660 
get out of the hair the better when
blow-drying<00:01:23.800> that<00:01:24.010> will<00:01:24.130> be<00:01:24.220> much<00:01:24.400> quicker

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
blow-drying that will be much quicker

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.180 
blow-drying that will be much quicker
and<00:01:25.090> won't<00:01:26.020> be<00:01:26.140> hurting<00:01:26.380> you<00:01:26.500> as<00:01:26.680> much<00:01:26.890> on<00:01:27.070> your

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
and won't be hurting you as much on your

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.440 
and won't be hurting you as much on your
hands<00:01:27.550> and<00:01:27.760> arms<00:01:28.510> a<00:01:29.760> couple<00:01:30.760> key<00:01:30.970> things<00:01:31.000> that

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
hands and arms a couple key things that

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.180 
hands and arms a couple key things that
I<00:01:31.479> think<00:01:31.570> are<00:01:31.840> very<00:01:32.140> very<00:01:32.350> important<00:01:32.950> when

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
I think are very very important when

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.940 
I think are very very important when
going<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.330> blow-dry<00:01:34.660> the<00:01:34.960> hair<00:01:35.110> to<00:01:35.500> add<00:01:35.650> a<00:01:35.680> lot

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
going to blow-dry the hair to add a lot

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.890 
going to blow-dry the hair to add a lot
of<00:01:36.070> volume<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.670> texture<00:01:37.000> and<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.450> one<00:01:37.750> you

more thickness and fullness throughout
the<00:01:57.070> hair<00:01:57.310> so<00:01:58.060> I'm<00:01:58.150> going<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.330> use<00:01:58.420> a<00:01:58.509> moose

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
the hair so I'm going to use a moose

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.600 
the hair so I'm going to use a moose
right<00:01:58.990> now<00:01:59.140> through<00:01:59.710> her<00:01:59.860> hair<00:02:00.070> at<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.430> root

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
right now through her hair at the root

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.190 
right now through her hair at the root
area<00:02:00.759> and<00:02:01.119> then<00:02:01.450> pull<00:02:01.690> it<00:02:01.720> all<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.050> way

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
area and then pull it all the way

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.680 
area and then pull it all the way
through<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.710> ends<00:02:03.340> so<00:02:03.880> that<00:02:03.909> we<00:02:04.180> have<00:02:04.210> even

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
through the ends so that we have even

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.990 
through the ends so that we have even
distribution<00:02:05.020> from<00:02:05.710> root<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:05.980> end<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.850> give

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
distribution from root to end to give

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.050 
distribution from root to end to give
you<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.210> maximum<00:02:07.830> volume<00:02:11.880> making<00:02:12.880> sure<00:02:13.030> to

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
you the maximum volume making sure to

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.020 
you the maximum volume making sure to
work<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.690> into<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.140> scalp<00:02:14.650> itself<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:16.000> it

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
work it into the scalp itself so it

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.449 
work it into the scalp itself so it
penetrates<00:02:16.840> deeply<00:02:17.320> into<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:17.830> scalp<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.430> a

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
penetrates deeply into the scalp is a

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.170 
penetrates deeply into the scalp is a
very<00:02:18.850> very<00:02:19.150> good<00:02:19.630> key<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.850> giving<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:21.970> your

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
very very good key and giving you your

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.400 
very very good key and giving you your
volume<00:02:22.570> as<00:02:22.720> well<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:27.630> think<00:02:28.630> your<00:02:28.840> next<00:02:29.140> step

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
volume as well I think your next step

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.250 
volume as well I think your next step
that<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.250> would<00:02:30.340> like<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.670> do<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:31.260> actually

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
that you would like to do is actually

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.340 
that you would like to do is actually
adding<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:33.010> good<00:02:33.250> route<00:02:33.730> volumizer<00:02:34.600> the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
adding a good route volumizer the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.960 
adding a good route volumizer the
volumizer<00:02:35.980> what<00:02:36.220> that's<00:02:36.400> going<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.670> do<00:02:36.850> is<00:02:36.910> you

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
volumizer what that's going to do is you

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.240 
volumizer what that's going to do is you
want<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.180> spray<00:02:37.480> on<00:02:37.660> all<00:02:37.900> your<00:02:38.080> root<00:02:38.290> area<00:02:38.470> so

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.789 

a<00:04:04.000> couple<00:04:05.000> of<00:04:05.209> other<00:04:05.299> things<00:04:05.420> that's<00:04:05.840> really

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
a couple of other things that's really

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.149

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
the rollers this thick you want to make

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.370 
the rollers this thick you want to make
sure<00:04:43.190> your<00:04:43.550> section<00:04:44.030> is<00:04:44.180> that<00:04:44.419> thick<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:45.020> also

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
the same length as well so if you were

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.830 
the same length as well so if you were
to<00:04:50.150> take<00:04:50.419> this<00:04:50.630> round<00:04:51.020> brush<00:04:51.500> and<00:04:52.539> use<00:04:53.539> this

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
to take this round brush and use this

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.409 
to take this round brush and use this
it's<00:04:54.080> like<00:04:54.139> the<00:04:54.500> same<00:04:54.800> length<00:04:55.160> and<00:04:55.460> also<00:04:56.300> the

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
it's like the same length and also the

it's like the same length and also the
same<00:04:56.449> width<00:04:58.060> so<00:04:59.060> it's<00:04:59.180> very<00:04:59.389> important<00:05:00.020> when

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530

you're going to blow dry underneath get

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.750 
you're going to blow dry underneath get
as<00:05:53.900> hot<00:05:54.199> as<00:05:54.470> possible<00:05:55.130> all<00:05:55.310> the<00:05:55.520> way<00:05:55.639> around

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
as hot as possible all the way around

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.320 
as hot as possible all the way around
and<00:05:56.240> then<00:05:56.300> down<00:05:57.260> and<00:05:57.680> let<00:05:58.250> that<00:05:58.430> set<00:05:58.760> it's

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
and then down and let that set it's

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330 
and then down and let that set it's
important<00:05:59.840> to<00:06:00.020> heat<00:06:00.259> it<00:06:00.289> up<00:06:00.500> and<00:06:00.770> let<00:06:00.949> it<00:06:00.979> set

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
important to heat it up and let it set

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.420 
important to heat it up and let it set
so<00:06:01.400> you<00:06:01.610> get<00:06:01.759> the<00:06:01.909> maximum<00:06:02.360> volume<00:06:03.310> if<00:06:04.310> you

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
so you get the maximum volume if you

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.260 
so you get the maximum volume if you
don't<00:06:04.669> have<00:06:06.159> more<00:06:07.159> than<00:06:07.310> two<00:06:07.520> brushes<00:06:07.849> what

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
don't have more than two brushes what

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.830
