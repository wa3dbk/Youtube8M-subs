this<00:00:00.329> video<00:00:00.690> is<00:00:00.989> going<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.260> show<00:00:01.350> you<00:00:01.530> how<00:00:01.829> to

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
this video is going to show you how to

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.820 
this video is going to show you how to
apply<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.520> cervical<00:00:03.149> color<00:00:03.389> to<00:00:03.840> an<00:00:04.200> unconscious

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
apply a cervical color to an unconscious

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.960 
apply a cervical color to an unconscious
patient<00:00:05.870> so<00:00:06.870> we<00:00:07.049> begin<00:00:07.319> by<00:00:07.859> sizing<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.760> color

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
patient so we begin by sizing the color

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.540 
patient so we begin by sizing the color
with<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.599> cervical<00:00:09.990> supply<00:00:10.440> spine<00:00:11.070> secured

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
with the cervical supply spine secured

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.940 
with the cervical supply spine secured
by<00:00:11.700> somebody<00:00:12.059> else<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:12.900> measure<00:00:13.170> from<00:00:13.590> the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
by somebody else so you measure from the

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.010 
by somebody else so you measure from the
jaw<00:00:14.960> chin<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.820> the<00:00:17.820> trapezius<00:00:18.600> muscle<00:00:18.900> at<00:00:18.990> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
jaw chin to the trapezius muscle at the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.019 
jaw chin to the trapezius muscle at the
back<00:00:19.199> not<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.619> angle<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> jaw<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.910> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
back not the angle of the jaw to the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.500 
back not the angle of the jaw to the
trapezius<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.650> on<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:22.949> patient<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:24.150> three

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
trapezius so on this patient it is three

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.679 
trapezius so on this patient it is three
fingers<00:00:26.150> you<00:00:27.150> then<00:00:27.359> measure<00:00:27.570> on<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.340> collar

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
fingers you then measure on a collar

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.650 
fingers you then measure on a collar
from<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.990> black<00:00:31.260> stud<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.669> bottom<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
from the black stud to the bottom of the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.479 
from the black stud to the bottom of the
yellow<00:00:33.809> plastic<00:00:34.500> rather<00:00:34.920> than<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.309> white

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
yellow plastic rather than the white

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.020 
yellow plastic rather than the white
foam<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.630> three<00:00:36.870> fingers<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:38.160> right<00:00:38.760> size

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
foam so three fingers is the right size

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.840 
foam so three fingers is the right size
for<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.390> patient<00:00:39.950> some<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> colors<00:00:41.579> are

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
for this patient some of the colors are

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.510 
for this patient some of the colors are
come<00:00:42.270> flat<00:00:42.629> packed<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.350> which<00:00:43.890> case<00:00:44.160> they<00:00:44.340> need

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
come flat packed in which case they need

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.720 
come flat packed in which case they need
to<00:00:44.640> be<00:00:44.730> assembled<00:00:45.289> this<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.469> done<00:00:46.739> by<00:00:47.129> fitting

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
to be assembled this is done by fitting

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.420 
to be assembled this is done by fitting
that<00:00:47.940> same<00:00:48.360> black<00:00:48.629> stud<00:00:49.020> through<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.129> only

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
that same black stud through the only

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.310 
that same black stud through the only
ring<00:00:50.670> through<00:00:50.969> which<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.300> will<00:00:51.449> fit<00:00:52.219> and<00:00:54.320> also

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
ring through which it will fit and also

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.770 
ring through which it will fit and also
producing<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.039> kink<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.910> back<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
producing a kink in the back of the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.299 
producing a kink in the back of the
collet<00:00:58.170> for<00:00:58.590> ease<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.829> insertion<00:01:00.980> so<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.160> an

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
collet for ease of insertion so with an

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.590 
collet for ease of insertion so with an
appropriately<00:01:02.910> sized<00:01:03.149> collar<00:01:05.090> you<00:01:06.090> insert<00:01:06.450> it

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
appropriately sized collar you insert it

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:18.500 
appropriately sized collar you insert it
under<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> patient's<00:01:07.470> neck

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.340 

and<00:01:19.590> then<00:01:20.590> secure<00:01:20.950> it<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:22.750> then<00:01:22.930> want<00:01:23.050> to<00:01:23.170> use

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
and then secure it you then want to use

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.430 
and then secure it you then want to use
sandbags<00:01:23.830> and<00:01:24.040> tape<00:01:24.280> to<00:01:25.080> effectively<00:01:26.080> secure

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
sandbags and tape to effectively secure

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.359 
sandbags and tape to effectively secure
the<00:01:26.590> c-spine<00:01:28.410> so<00:01:29.410> you<00:01:29.500> place<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.830> sandbags<00:01:30.220> in

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
the c-spine so you place the sandbags in

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.190 
the c-spine so you place the sandbags in
place<00:01:30.550> and<00:01:30.880> they<00:01:31.000> can<00:01:31.180> then<00:01:31.270> be<00:01:31.330> compressed<00:01:31.840> by

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
place and they can then be compressed by

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.240 
place and they can then be compressed by
your<00:01:32.380> assistant<00:01:34.650> then<00:01:35.650> you<00:01:35.770> take<00:01:36.010> the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
your assistant then you take the

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.180 
your assistant then you take the
sandbags<00:01:36.670> in<00:01:36.850> position<00:01:37.710> making<00:01:38.710> sure<00:01:38.890> that

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
sandbags in position making sure that

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.859 
sandbags in position making sure that
the<00:01:39.250> tape<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:39.670> tested<00:01:40.150> they're<00:01:40.360> free<00:01:40.690> sandbags

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the tape is tested they're free sandbags

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.080 
the tape is tested they're free sandbags
base<00:01:43.869> the<00:01:44.050> color<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.490> sandbag<00:01:45.880> and

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
base the color to the sandbag and

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.509 
base the color to the sandbag and
bedroom<00:01:46.780> and<00:01:47.970> same<00:01:48.970> go<00:01:49.149> to<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.300> top
