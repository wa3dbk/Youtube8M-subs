refreshing clean feeling and I was

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.760

trying to explain it to beanie and I

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.190 
trying to explain it to beanie and I

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
they're the one that they had previously

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.280 
they're the one that they had previously
and<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:21.660> they<00:02:22.660> tried<00:02:22.840> one<00:02:22.989> that<00:02:23.080> they<00:02:23.170> had

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
and I they tried one that they had

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.800 
and I they tried one that they had
previously<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.130> it<00:02:24.489> kind<00:02:25.269> of<00:02:25.360> did<00:02:25.569> what<00:02:25.600> they

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
previously and it kind of did what they

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.840 
previously and it kind of did what they
were<00:02:25.900> supposed<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:26.350> do<00:02:26.560> but<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.130> didn't

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
were supposed to do but it didn't

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.309 
were supposed to do but it didn't
control<00:02:28.390> oil<00:02:28.810> at<00:02:29.680> all<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:31.600> fit<00:02:31.840> adjust<00:02:32.200> to

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
control oil at all and it fit adjust to

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.160 
control oil at all and it fit adjust to
my<00:02:32.440> skin<00:02:32.650> tone<00:02:32.860> but<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.250> always<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.940> was<00:02:34.170> always

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
my skin tone but it always it was always

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.860 
my skin tone but it always it was always
dark<00:02:35.739> so<00:02:36.519> I'm<00:02:36.880> going<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.360> try<00:02:37.830> this<00:02:38.830> one<00:02:39.100> and

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
dark so I'm going to try this one and

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.930 
dark so I'm going to try this one and
just<00:02:40.870> see<00:02:41.290> what<00:02:41.500> happens<00:02:42.100> hopefully<00:02:42.760> nothing

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
just see what happens hopefully nothing

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.210 
just see what happens hopefully nothing
bad<00:02:43.269> because<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:44.110> does<00:02:44.560> have<00:02:44.680> an<00:02:44.830> acne

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
bad because it does have an acne

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.309 
bad because it does have an acne
treatment<00:02:45.670> in<00:02:45.850> it<00:02:48.660> this<00:02:49.660> is<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:49.930> darkest

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
treatment in it this is the darkest

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.630 
treatment in it this is the darkest
shade<00:02:50.500> they<00:02:50.650> have<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:51.160> I<00:02:51.190> think<00:02:51.220> it's<00:02:51.519> the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
shade they have and I think it's the

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.340 
shade they have and I think it's the
deep<00:02:51.880> one<00:02:52.180> because<00:02:52.540> medium<00:02:52.930> deep<00:02:53.110> are

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
deep one because medium deep are

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.539 
deep one because medium deep are
difficult<00:02:53.799> too<00:02:53.980> little<00:02:54.640> too<00:02:54.880> light<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:56.130> I<00:02:57.130> plan

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
difficult too little too light so I plan

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.930 
difficult too little too light so I plan
to<00:02:57.780> try<00:02:58.780> that<00:02:58.989> out<00:02:59.049> for<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.590> week<00:02:59.739> and<00:03:00.040> then<00:03:00.670> come
