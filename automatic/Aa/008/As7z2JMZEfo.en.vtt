00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
and go down here I'm say underground

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.770 
and go down here I'm say underground
right<00:03:43.260> here<00:03:43.500> this<00:03:43.950> little<00:03:44.160> room<00:03:44.570> this<00:03:45.570> was<00:03:45.750> the

right here this little room this was the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.580 
right here this little room this was the
nicest<00:03:46.049> put<00:03:46.440> like<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.650> room<00:03:46.890> or<00:03:47.010> something

nicest put like a room or something
firing<00:03:49.640> that<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:50.970> texture<00:03:51.690> is<00:03:52.019> on<00:03:52.200> a<00:03:52.260> cube

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
firing that that texture is on a cube

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.600 
firing that that texture is on a cube
the<00:03:53.699> fire<00:03:54.209> from<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.109> Gunther

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
the fire from the Gunther

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.200 
the fire from the Gunther
that's<00:03:56.850> that's<00:03:57.270> on<00:03:58.310> that<00:03:59.310> is<00:03:59.610> on<00:03:59.820> a<00:04:01.340> cube<00:04:02.340> which

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
that's that's on that is on a cube which

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.910 
that's that's on that is on a cube which
has<00:04:03.390> been<00:04:03.570> textured<00:04:04.110> and<00:04:04.260> izzy<00:04:04.710> thorough

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
has been textured and izzy thorough

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.560 
has been textured and izzy thorough
except<00:04:05.400> with<00:04:05.520> the<00:04:05.640> stuff<00:04:05.850> on<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.030> cube<00:04:06.300> the

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
except with the stuff on the cube the

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.480 
except with the stuff on the cube the
texture<00:04:06.990> on<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.110> cube<00:04:07.350> is<00:04:07.440> everything<00:04:07.800> so<00:04:08.400> the

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
texture on the cube is everything so the

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.800 
texture on the cube is everything so the
background<00:04:08.820> is<00:04:08.880> black<00:04:09.090> so<00:04:09.450> i<00:04:09.510> can<00:04:09.660> make<00:04:09.780> it

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
background is black so i can make it

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.410 
background is black so i can make it
like<00:04:09.990> transparent<00:04:10.770> if<00:04:11.580> you<00:04:11.730> look<00:04:11.880> closely<00:04:11.940> you

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
like transparent if you look closely you

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.120 
like transparent if you look closely you
can<00:04:12.510> see<00:04:13.320> it<00:04:13.440> right<00:04:13.620> there<00:04:13.710> I<00:04:15.920> can<00:04:16.920> do<00:04:17.010> this

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
can see it right there I can do this

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.990 
can see it right there I can do this
right<00:04:17.989> yeah<00:04:18.989> like<00:04:19.170> they're<00:04:19.609> all<00:04:20.609> if<00:04:20.730> you<00:04:20.850> can

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
right yeah like they're all if you can

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.410 
right yeah like they're all if you can
sign<00:04:21.209> up<00:04:21.450> but<00:04:21.780> it's<00:04:22.440> very<00:04:22.710> hard<00:04:22.920> to<00:04:23.010> tell<00:04:23.420> but

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
sign up but it's very hard to tell but

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.410 
sign up but it's very hard to tell but
um<00:04:24.660> yeah<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.770> take<00:04:26.190> half<00:04:26.490> credit<00:04:26.760> for<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.180> sky

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
um yeah I take half credit for the sky

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.560 
um yeah I take half credit for the sky
because<00:04:28.290> the<00:04:28.440> sky<00:04:28.680> texture<00:04:29.190> is<00:04:29.280> not<00:04:29.520> mine<00:04:29.760> but

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
because the sky texture is not mine but

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.270 
because the sky texture is not mine but

yet<00:06:12.900> even<00:06:13.230> though<00:06:13.290> I<00:06:13.320> do<00:06:13.470> have<00:06:13.620> the<00:06:13.830> model<00:06:14.130> I

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
yet even though I do have the model I

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.960 
yet even though I do have the model I
just<00:06:14.400> haven't<00:06:14.580> put<00:06:14.700> it<00:06:14.730> in<00:06:14.880> yet<00:06:16.160> so<00:06:17.160> um<00:06:17.430> yeah

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
just haven't put it in yet so um yeah

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.880 
just haven't put it in yet so um yeah
and<00:06:18.330> as<00:06:18.570> you<00:06:18.720> can<00:06:18.840> see<00:06:18.870> the<00:06:19.080> ground<00:06:19.350> reflects

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
and as you can see the ground reflects

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.580 
and as you can see the ground reflects
there<00:06:20.250> some<00:06:20.880> reason<00:06:21.030> i<00:06:21.450> need<00:06:22.140> to<00:06:22.260> get<00:06:22.350> rid<00:06:22.530> of

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
there some reason i need to get rid of

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.180 
there some reason i need to get rid of
that<00:06:22.770> a<00:06:23.010> reflection<00:06:23.760> look<00:06:23.910> right<00:06:24.510> there<00:06:25.190> but

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
that a reflection look right there but

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.240 
that a reflection look right there but
um<00:06:26.430> yeah<00:06:27.030> tell<00:06:27.840> me<00:06:27.990> what<00:06:28.110> you<00:06:28.200> think<00:06:28.230> I<00:06:28.650> just

i<00:06:32.460> didn't<00:06:32.820> do<00:06:32.970> these<00:06:33.210> textures<00:06:33.750> or<00:06:34.070> the<00:06:35.070> models

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
i didn't do these textures or the models

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.430 
i didn't do these textures or the models
or<00:06:35.670> anything<00:06:35.970> so<00:06:36.300> everything<00:06:36.870> else<00:06:36.990> is<00:06:37.170> mine

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
or anything so everything else is mine

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.150 
or anything so everything else is mine
except<00:06:37.830> for<00:06:38.040> the<00:06:38.100> textures<00:06:39.800> except<00:06:40.800> for<00:06:41.010> that

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
except for the textures except for that

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.860 
except for the textures except for that
that<00:06:41.520> little<00:06:41.730> crossing<00:06:42.300> thing<00:06:42.510> right<00:06:42.720> there

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
that little crossing thing right there

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.590

on<00:06:43.050> there<00:06:43.260> that's<00:06:43.620> my<00:06:43.800> texture<00:06:44.310> and<00:06:44.490> if<00:06:45.420> you

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
on there that's my texture and if you

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.730 
on there that's my texture and if you
look<00:06:45.720> really<00:06:45.900> closely<00:06:46.140> i<00:06:46.350> don't<00:06:46.530> know<00:06:46.590> if<00:06:46.680> you

can see but there's actually a very
intricate<00:06:48.120> texture<00:06:48.630> on<00:06:48.780> here<00:06:49.050> on<00:06:49.410> the<00:06:49.560> cone<00:06:49.800> on

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
intricate texture on here on the cone on

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.700

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.230 
something make a bunch of copies of this

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.280 
something make a bunch of copies of this
it<00:07:11.160> make<00:07:11.640> it<00:07:11.790> look<00:07:11.910> at<00:07:12.060> two<00:07:12.540> player<00:07:12.840> in<00:07:13.110> or

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
it make it look at two player in or

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.130 
it make it look at two player in or
something<00:07:13.650> and<00:07:14.150> that<00:07:15.150> would<00:07:15.330> make<00:07:15.840> the<00:07:15.990> frame

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:16.140 
something and that would make the frame

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.600 
something and that would make the frame
rate<00:07:16.350> okay<00:07:16.650> that<00:07:16.890> would<00:07:16.980> make<00:07:17.130> it<00:07:17.160> about<00:07:17.430> what

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:17.610 
rate okay that would make it about what

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.190 
rate okay that would make it about what
it<00:07:17.700> is<00:07:17.850> now<00:07:18.200> because<00:07:19.200> without<00:07:20.100> hyper<00:07:20.730> or

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:21.200 
it is now because without hyper or

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.830 
it is now because without hyper or
camstudio<00:07:22.200> on<00:07:22.440> it's<00:07:22.740> a<00:07:22.860> lot<00:07:23.040> more<00:07:23.630> frames<00:07:24.630> is

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 
camstudio on it's a lot more frames is

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.050 
camstudio on it's a lot more frames is
like<00:07:25.020> 55<00:07:25.410> so<00:07:25.890> i<00:07:25.920> actually<00:07:26.040> put<00:07:26.310> another<00:07:26.550> person
