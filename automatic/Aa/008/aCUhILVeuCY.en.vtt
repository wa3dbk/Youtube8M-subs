what's all this shit about Hoffman's
operation<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.270> is<00:00:24.540> resonator<00:00:25.230> it'll<00:00:25.740> map<00:00:25.920> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
operation and is resonator it'll map the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.220 
operation and is resonator it'll map the
underground<00:00:26.520> network<00:00:26.940> then<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.600> can<00:00:27.779> find<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
underground network then we can find the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:01:41.040 
underground network then we can find the
locust<00:00:28.590> heart<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.430> rip<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.700> out
