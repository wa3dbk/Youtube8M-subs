00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.309
 in the summer of 2012 found a carpet at 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.370
 Meet in Kassel instead of in the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.780
 kulturfabrik salzmann and i want the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.969
 plant a little bit 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.369
 Let's start at the top left of the sketch in 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.630
 The foyer is on its podium 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.060
 set up here was a terminal station 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.369
 the mainline also there this 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.320
 Station was the bulk discharge here 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.720
 the protective goods were the ones with poppy seeds 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.599
 loaded goods were unloaded and demon trickles 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.910
 following gravity down into 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.559
 the silo and here then on the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.950
 floor in the florence the train station 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.300
 bulk goods trains are loaded again in 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.239
 station were also the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.489
 container trains compiled and of 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.789
 Here it went through the 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:51.180
 artist's wardrobe then continue on the 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.770
 mainline direction bridge and the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.180
 Nebenbahnen went to the container terminal 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.070
 This is where the car system route began 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.230
 consisting of the highway over the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.420
 bridge goes and also connected via 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.899
 the motorway exit of the container 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.899
 appointments 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.210
 Here were the basis of the vehicles 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.070
 stopped and could with the two 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.790
 functional container plan b and 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.790
 be discharged 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.680
 The trains were over the rail yard 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.210
 provided and so we had 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:41.509
 this carpet in real 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:43.159
 combined cargo traffic too 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.080
 for the first time at a carpet in 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.080
 Operation was the bridge lighting 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.180
 The bridge this time built even higher 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.430
 than ever 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.750
 the bridge center was about a meter 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.060
 over the floor 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.530
 you can see the little ones at the spectator 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.190
 Children could even under the bridge 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.190
 run through 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.220
 behind the bridge, it was 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.819
 system track uphill to a return 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.470
 and the railroads therefore take you over the 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.470
 south ramp downhill 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.209
 Finally, in the studio on the 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.700
 to arrive on floor 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.209
 here there were several stations so the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.969
 clausthal at the end of the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.069
 main line the freight trains drive around 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:16.650
 around this station by the station 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.799
 She broke her and either she was 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.099
 over the southern ramp back up the mountain 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:26.400
 direction bridge or continue on the ground 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:30.030
 on the side track over the station 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.900
 wolfsburg florence politics good moves
