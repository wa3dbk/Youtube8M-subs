 Dominican coffee punch with chocolate 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.230
 absolutely delicious is widely used in the cibao is 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:13.029
 prepare easy the first thing we do 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.949
 is to grind our coffee I like to use the 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:17.830
 Coffee beans grind not because it tastes better 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:20.050
 we put a great fret to the extent 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.510
 the teak has that measure in where 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.300
 we fill it up there and we put our 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.520
 strainer and we're going to add coffee let's go 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:32.050
 to add enough coffee that we 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.480
 stay pure but not too much that no 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.399
 can raise the coffee water then what 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.530
 I'm adding chocolate these cocoa 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.469
 pure of what is used on holy Sunday in 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.019
 the cibao that they do by hand do not have 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.089
 nothing only cocoa a little 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.699
 sugar I put in nutmeg because 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:51.190
 that gives it a great taste 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.679
 so we cover our frets the 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.289
 we put that coffee on the stove 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:59.620
 meanwhile then let's put the 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.389
 milk to boil to cook we put our 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.370
 little milk to go on fire 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:05.670
 go away taking what that is 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.369
 working we separate the egg whites 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.869
 from the yolks we go to three eggs 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.189
 we're going to beat it to the point of snow 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.899
 before work whether it was with a 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.439
 molinillo that falls on his arms 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.970
 to this lady beating that clear up 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.140
 that is about to snow 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.490
 machine makes it easy thanks to God 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.289
 then we have our clear to 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.770
 point of snow we will add the 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.500
 yolk is added one by one until 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.200
 is incorporated well then when 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.960
 well incorporated we add the other up 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.110
 add the three then we leave that 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.380
 there beating and meanwhile loves 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.720
 check and our coffee is going up and 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.429
 since the coffee goes up then we are going to 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.399
 add only milk to milk 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:56.069
 is almost boiling if I leave a 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.159
 little bit more is bounced then we add 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:02.820
 the coffee to the milk and we mix it well 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.159
 if we want we can give it a whipping 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.220
 milk and coffee to mix 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.130
 human right and that all 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.250
 then we are going to add that milk 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.830
 hot to the mix we had there 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.450

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.450

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.740
 that the yolks and the egg is cooked but 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.640
 it will not be like scrambled eggs 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.590
 but it is creamy delicious tasty 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.530
