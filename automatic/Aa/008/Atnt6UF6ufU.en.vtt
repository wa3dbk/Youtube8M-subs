picker is that um you know this kind of

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.589 
picker is that um you know this kind of
very<00:04:38.190> little<00:04:38.310> ego<00:04:38.849> involved<00:04:39.210> obviously

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
very little ego involved obviously

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.439 
very little ego involved obviously
looking<00:04:39.960> at<00:04:40.169> his<00:04:40.440> ego<00:04:40.740> but<00:04:41.190> I<00:04:41.370> can't<00:04:41.639> find<00:04:41.909> it
