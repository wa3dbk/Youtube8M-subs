00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
it just I guess I was just really

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.830 
it just I guess I was just really
uncomfortable<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.240> when<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.450> was<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.630> kid

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
uncomfortable with it when I was a kid

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.690 
uncomfortable with it when I was a kid
literally<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.439> baby<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.830> would<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.130> cry<00:01:17.369> every

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
literally a baby I would just cry every

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.219 
literally a baby I would just cry every
single<00:01:17.729> time<00:01:18.000> was<00:01:18.330> at<00:01:18.450> my<00:01:18.540> mom's<00:01:18.689> house<00:01:18.990> every

my<00:01:20.580> grandparents<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.360> would<00:01:21.509> cry<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.930> lived

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
my grandparents I would cry so I lived

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.510 
my grandparents I would cry so I lived
with<00:01:22.290> my<00:01:22.320> grandparents<00:01:22.890> all<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.369> way<00:01:23.430> up

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
with my grandparents all the way up

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.920 
with my grandparents all the way up
until<00:01:23.640> now<00:01:23.880> 20<00:01:24.240> years<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.659> was<00:01:24.840> basically

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
until now 20 years so I was basically

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.660 
until now 20 years so I was basically
raised<00:01:25.439> by<00:01:25.560> my<00:01:25.770> grandparents<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.460> might

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
raised by my grandparents and that might

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.940 
raised by my grandparents and that might
be<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> cause<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.210> me<00:01:27.600> being<00:01:27.960> such<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> more<00:01:28.890> or

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
be the cause of me being such a more or

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.560 
be the cause of me being such a more or
less<00:01:29.009> like<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.310> hermit<00:01:29.640> crab<00:01:29.850> really<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.360> guess

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
less like a hermit crab really I guess

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.030 
less like a hermit crab really I guess
that<00:01:30.689> would<00:01:30.780> explain<00:01:31.049> why<00:01:31.320> I'm<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.740> reclusive

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
that would explain why I'm so reclusive

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.890 
that would explain why I'm so reclusive
this<00:01:32.490> isn't<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.820> sob<00:01:33.060> story<00:01:33.090> or<00:01:33.509> anything<00:01:33.689> like

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900
