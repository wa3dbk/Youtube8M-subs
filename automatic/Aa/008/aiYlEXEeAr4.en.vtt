of<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.299> features<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.810> car<00:00:06.990> first

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
of the features of the car first

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.700 
of the features of the car first
starting<00:00:08.160> with<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.490> electric<00:00:08.940> battery<00:00:09.510> so<00:00:10.290> to

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
starting with the electric battery so to

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.209 
starting with the electric battery so to
plug<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:12.059> car<00:00:12.389> just<00:00:13.019> do<00:00:13.710> that

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
plug in the car just do that

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.590 
plug in the car just do that
this<00:00:14.910> actually<00:00:16.460> charges<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.580> car<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:18.390> takes

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
this actually charges the car it takes

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.540 
this actually charges the car it takes
about<00:00:18.720> six<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.680> eight<00:00:19.830> hours<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.250> actually

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
about six to eight hours to actually

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.390 
about six to eight hours to actually
charge<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.090> car<00:00:21.300> fully<00:00:21.680> it<00:00:22.680> gets<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.340> think

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
charge the car fully it gets I think

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.750 
charge the car fully it gets I think
about<00:00:23.789> thirty<00:00:24.060> five<00:00:24.359> miles<00:00:24.900> or<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.699> a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
about thirty five miles or so on a

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.220 
about thirty five miles or so on a
charge<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.750> something<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.019> you'd

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
charge and so it's something that you'd

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.250 
charge and so it's something that you'd
probably<00:00:28.380> want<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.740> do<00:00:29.039> at<00:00:29.760> night<00:00:30.260> perhaps

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
probably want to do at night perhaps

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.290 
probably want to do at night perhaps
before<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:32.009> drive<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.460> work<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> morning

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
before you drive to work in the morning

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.049 
before you drive to work in the morning
because<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.380> does<00:00:34.500> take<00:00:34.710> most<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.370> day<00:00:35.910> to

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
because it does take most of the day to

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.970 
because it does take most of the day to
charge<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.320> what<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.559> car<00:00:37.770> looks

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
charge and this is what the car looks

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.979 
charge and this is what the car looks
like<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.430> can<00:00:38.520> actually<00:00:38.670> see<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.750> my

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
like and you can actually see that my

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.900 
like and you can actually see that my
Prius<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.770> kind<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.100> behind<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.730> can

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
Prius is kind of behind it so you can

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.430 
Prius is kind of behind it so you can
see<00:00:42.030> it's<00:00:42.180> about<00:00:42.270> about<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.870> same<00:00:43.050> size<00:00:43.260> as

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440

on the highway and then you're going
somewhere<00:02:50.890> I<00:02:51.069> may<00:02:51.220> be<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.430> drive<00:02:51.610> into<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:51.970> city

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
somewhere I may be to drive into a city

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.170 
somewhere I may be to drive into a city
and<00:02:52.510> you'd<00:02:53.349> rather<00:02:53.620> save<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.250> battery<00:02:54.579> for
