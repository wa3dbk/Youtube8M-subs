here<00:00:54.710> then<00:00:55.010> and<00:00:55.420> I<00:00:56.420> think<00:00:57.050> it's<00:00:57.319> really<00:00:57.440> sad

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
here then and I think it's really sad

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.579 
here then and I think it's really sad
because<00:00:57.890> it<00:00:58.159> would<00:00:58.339> been<00:00:58.489> really<00:00:58.969> cute<00:00:59.269> and<00:00:59.690> it

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
has this um but like Keira but shut up

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.410 
has this um but like Keira but shut up
trim<00:01:06.430> at<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.579> bottom<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:10.000> it<00:01:11.000> has<00:01:11.240> this

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
trim at the bottom and it has this

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.749 
trim at the bottom and it has this
zipper<00:01:12.079> that<00:01:13.009> goes<00:01:13.070> from<00:01:14.030> here<00:01:14.119> to<00:01:14.659> here<00:01:14.899> and

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
zipper that goes from here to here and

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:22.870 
zipper that goes from here to here and
on<00:01:16.759> the<00:01:17.149> zipper<00:01:17.780> pull<00:01:20.649> it<00:01:21.649> says<00:01:22.070> a<00:01:22.369> little<00:01:22.789> bit

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
on the zipper pull it says a little bit

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.590 
on the zipper pull it says a little bit
on<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:24.070> it<00:01:25.070> says<00:01:25.340> on<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:26.210> back<00:01:26.360> as<00:01:26.689> well<00:01:26.869> and

I didn't know what to put it in put it
inside<00:02:30.110> because<00:02:31.100> I<00:02:31.310> felt<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:32.180> I<00:02:32.330> tried<00:02:32.750> to

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
inside because I felt that I tried to

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.810

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
because I felt that if I had coins I

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.250 
because I felt that if I had coins I
would<00:02:38.360> have<00:02:38.900> one<00:02:39.140> too

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.950 
would have one too
you<00:02:42.260> know<00:02:42.350> keep<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.890> money<00:02:43.160> I<00:02:43.550> mean<00:02:44.420> I<00:02:44.690> mean

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
the cash and the coins together so I

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.030 
the cash and the coins together so I
felt<00:02:49.540> what<00:02:50.540> am<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:51.050> going<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.380> do<00:02:51.560> with<00:02:51.740> this<00:02:51.830> one

I think it must have been like six
months<00:02:55.790> or<00:02:55.910> so<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.360> if<00:02:56.900> this<00:02:57.350> was<00:02:57.590> just<00:02:57.830> in<00:02:58.010> my

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
months or so and if this was just in my

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.030 
months or so and if this was just in my
closet<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.910> didn't<00:02:59.270> I<00:02:59.450> didn't<00:03:00.260> use<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.800> or

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.500 
closet it didn't I didn't use it or
anything<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.820> then<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.870> started<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:04.180> see<00:03:05.180> some

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510
