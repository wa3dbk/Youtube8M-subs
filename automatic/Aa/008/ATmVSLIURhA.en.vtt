and that covers the axon and what that

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.450 
and that covers the axon and what that
does<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.439> speeds<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:17.659> neural<00:01:18.659> speed

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
does is it speeds the neural speed

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.649 
does is it speeds the neural speed
increases<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.640> neural<00:01:20.880> speed<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.509> also

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
increases the neural speed it also

in<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.010> electrochemical<00:02:14.490> part<00:02:14.940> but<00:02:15.000> then

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
in the electrochemical part but then

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.910 
in the electrochemical part but then
there<00:02:15.240> are<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.390> glial<00:02:15.630> cells<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.800> are

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
there are the glial cells that are

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.800 
there are the glial cells that are
involved<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.310> housekeeping<00:02:17.600> nutrition<00:02:18.600> and

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
involved in housekeeping nutrition and

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.530 
involved in housekeeping nutrition and
support<00:02:19.350> so<00:02:19.560> they're<00:02:19.680> gonna<00:02:19.800> keep<00:02:20.580> dead<00:02:21.300> cells

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
support so they're gonna keep dead cells

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.610 
support so they're gonna keep dead cells
away<00:02:21.720> they're<00:02:21.990> gonna<00:02:22.080> make<00:02:22.230> sure<00:02:22.350> there<00:02:22.500> are

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
away they're gonna make sure there are

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.260 
away they're gonna make sure there are
nutrients<00:02:23.100> going<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.610> neurons<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.150> those

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
nutrients going to the neurons and those

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.390 
nutrients going to the neurons and those
sorts<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.630> things<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:24.990> so<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.740> glial<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.370> I

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
sorts of things and so the glial is I

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.790 
sorts of things and so the glial is I
think<00:02:26.820> it's<00:02:27.030> Latin<00:02:27.390> for<00:02:27.420> for<00:02:27.960> glue<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.560> it

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
think it's Latin for for glue and it

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.010 
think it's Latin for for glue and it
kind<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.010> keeps<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.510> brain<00:02:30.690> parts

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
kind of keeps the the brain parts

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.960 
kind of keeps the the brain parts
together<00:02:34.310> this<00:02:35.310> is<00:02:35.490> what<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.640> straight<00:02:35.940> a

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
together this is what a straight a

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.700 
together this is what a straight a
structure<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.660> neuron<00:02:36.810> looks<00:02:37.200> like<00:02:37.440> this<00:02:37.620> is

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
structure of a neuron looks like this is

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.750 
structure of a neuron looks like this is
a<00:02:37.740> typical<00:02:38.250> neuron

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
a typical neuron

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.690 
a typical neuron
it's<00:02:39.080> oversimplified<00:02:40.080> but<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.430> notice<00:02:41.670> that

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
it's oversimplified but you notice that

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.230 
it's oversimplified but you notice that
you<00:02:41.910> have<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.150> dendrites<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.790> dendrites

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
you have the dendrites and the dendrites

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.910 
you have the dendrites and the dendrites
are<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.450> branches<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:48.830> receive<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.190> signal

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
are the branches that receive the signal

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.730 
are the branches that receive the signal
the<00:02:52.920> signal<00:02:53.180> travels<00:02:54.180> down<00:02:54.420> into<00:02:55.080> let's<00:02:55.620> say

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
the signal travels down into let's say

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.410 
the signal travels down into let's say
that<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.040> signal<00:02:56.370> comes<00:02:56.640> from<00:02:56.940> these<00:02:57.120> right

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
that the signal comes from these right

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.880 
that the signal comes from these right
here<00:02:57.660> we've<00:02:57.750> got<00:02:57.780> enough<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.290> signal<00:02:58.650> we

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
here we've got enough of a signal we

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.080 
here we've got enough of a signal we
have<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.160> signal<00:02:59.460> coming<00:02:59.640> down<00:02:59.820> through<00:03:00.000> the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
have the signal coming down through the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
cell body goes out the axon and then it

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.150 
cell body goes out the axon and then it
goes<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:06.240> axon<00:03:06.960> terminals<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:08.130> terminals

goes to the axon terminals the terminals

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.830 
goes to the axon terminals the terminals
will<00:03:08.940> have<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.240> terminal<00:03:09.510> buttons<00:03:09.840> etc<00:03:11.840> nose

I have never seen it referenced the same

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.490 
I have never seen it referenced the same
thing<00:03:23.610> with<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.820> Schwann<00:03:24.060> cell<00:03:24.360> never<00:03:25.260> seen

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.220 
thing with the Schwann cell never seen
it<00:03:25.620> referenced<00:03:26.040> but<00:03:26.550> this<00:03:26.700> is<00:03:26.820> your<00:03:26.940> basic

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
it referenced but this is your basic

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.260 
it referenced but this is your basic
neurone<00:03:28.230> neuron<00:03:29.010> that<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:29.610> will<00:03:29.730> be<00:03:29.880> finding

neurone neuron that you will be finding
inside<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.140> brain<00:03:31.320> so<00:03:31.950> your<00:03:32.400> brain<00:03:32.640> is<00:03:32.820> that

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
inside the brain so your brain is that

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.630 
inside the brain so your brain is that
big<00:03:33.209> neural<00:03:33.930> network<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:35.040> neural<00:03:35.400> network

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
big neural network and a neural network

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:43.310 
big neural network and a neural network

what<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:48.840> that<00:03:48.959> going<00:03:49.080> to<00:03:49.140> be<00:03:49.260> called<00:03:53.660> dendrite

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
what is that going to be called dendrite

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.640 
what is that going to be called dendrite
this<00:03:56.400> whole<00:03:56.730> thing<00:03:57.300> right<00:03:57.480> here<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:58.470> whole

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
this whole thing right here the whole

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.520 
this whole thing right here the whole
thing<00:03:58.890> that's<00:03:59.220> going<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.640> be<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.030> soma

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
thing that's going to be the soma

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.170 
thing that's going to be the soma
remember<00:04:01.530> soma<00:04:01.980> is<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.370> Greek<00:04:02.550> word<00:04:02.580> for<00:04:02.760> body

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
remember soma is the Greek word for body

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.990 
remember soma is the Greek word for body
so<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:04.680> soma<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.430> body<00:04:05.730> of<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.270> cell<00:04:08.000> this

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
so the soma is the body of the cell this

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.820 
so the soma is the body of the cell this
tiny<00:04:09.330> little<00:04:09.450> thing<00:04:09.570> in<00:04:09.900> here<00:04:10.230> we<00:04:10.500> don't<00:04:10.709> need

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
tiny little thing in here we don't need

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.900 
tiny little thing in here we don't need
to<00:04:10.950> worry<00:04:11.130> about<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.430> but<00:04:11.550> it<00:04:12.000> is<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.360> nucleus

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
to worry about it but it is a nucleus

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.750 
to worry about it but it is a nucleus
then<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:15.120> have<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:16.440> covering<00:04:16.950> of<00:04:17.100> this<00:04:17.549> thing

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
then you have the covering of this thing

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.580 
then you have the covering of this thing
right<00:04:17.940> here<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.510> covering<00:04:18.930> is<00:04:19.049> known<00:04:19.260> as

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
the myelin what is this long thing right

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.300 
the myelin what is this long thing right
here<00:04:23.970> though<00:04:24.180> what's<00:04:24.900> that<00:04:25.080> called

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.770 

axon<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.520> at<00:04:30.480> the<00:04:30.570> end<00:04:30.750> of<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:30.960> axons<00:04:32.780> the

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
axon and at the end of the axons the

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.280 
axon and at the end of the axons the
terminal<00:04:34.520> branches<00:04:37.400> etc<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.970> so<00:04:39.570> you<00:04:40.020> need<00:04:40.200> to

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
terminal branches etc and so you need to

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.010 
terminal branches etc and so you need to
know<00:04:40.410> those<00:04:40.620> parts
