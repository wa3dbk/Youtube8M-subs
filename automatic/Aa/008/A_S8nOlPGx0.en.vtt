device<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.739> work<00:03:55.890> for<00:03:56.190> some<00:03:56.340> reason<00:03:56.610> the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
device of work for some reason the

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.370 
device of work for some reason the
settings<00:03:57.090> were<00:03:57.269> messed<00:03:57.540> up<00:03:57.720> which<00:03:57.989> you<00:03:58.230> know<00:03:58.350> I

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
settings were messed up which you know I

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.020 
settings were messed up which you know I
never<00:03:58.620> even<00:03:58.769> mess<00:03:59.070> with<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.430> settings<00:03:59.820> so<00:04:00.000> I

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
never even mess with the settings so I

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.120 
never even mess with the settings so I
don't<00:04:00.209> even<00:04:00.269> know<00:04:00.540> why<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.750> was<00:04:01.050> like<00:04:01.200> that<00:04:01.260> so

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
don't even know why it was like that so

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.610 
don't even know why it was like that so
I<00:04:02.160> had<00:04:02.489> to<00:04:02.550> go<00:04:02.700> back<00:04:02.910> into<00:04:03.180> theater<00:04:04.080> mode<00:04:04.260> to

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
I had to go back into theater mode to

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.270

mode it didn't record the whole game
play<00:04:35.530> so<00:04:35.560> maybe<00:04:36.040> when<00:04:36.900> we<00:04:37.900> decide<00:04:38.230> to<00:04:38.350> play

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
play so maybe when we decide to play

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.380 
play so maybe when we decide to play
again<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:39.130> I<00:04:39.640> can<00:04:39.790> make<00:04:39.910> another<00:04:40.180> video

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390

showing you what those look like but
again<00:04:43.810> just<00:04:43.990> think<00:04:44.260> of<00:04:44.500> the<00:04:44.770> elemental<00:04:45.580> fist

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.570 
again just think of the elemental fist
and<00:04:46.240> it<00:04:47.170> does<00:04:47.470> pretty<00:04:47.710> much<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:47.980> same<00:04:48.250> thing

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
and it does pretty much the same thing

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.330 
and it does pretty much the same thing
