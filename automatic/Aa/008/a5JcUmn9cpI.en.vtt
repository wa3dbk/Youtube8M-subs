 talk and let's see how we did it 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.120
 ok our first step is going to be squeeze 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.290
 the lemons until you reach a half of 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.290
 lemon juice cup 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.750
 now in our blender we are going to 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.310
 add the three ingredients the cheese 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.680
 cream that has to be at a 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.530
 room temperature of our milkmaid 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.930
 and our half cup of lemon juice 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.930
 to mix all the ingredients 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.930
 if you do not want these groups to come out 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.460
 as to me you have to leave your that is to 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.950

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.970
 important that and good we add the two 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.970
 dye drops 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.090

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.370
 ingredients and with the desired color what 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.630

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.630

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.459
 beautiful 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.140

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.360
 hours to the refrigerator that I told them 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.420

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.060
 that does not require many ingredients and 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.100
 Well, I already split a bit of 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.870
 bread and 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.180
