you can see if this was a real law of

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.559 
you can see if this was a real law of
gravity<00:02:11.190> strory<00:02:11.549> would<00:02:11.760> be<00:02:11.879> really<00:02:12.090> funny<00:02:12.420> how

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
gravity strory would be really funny how

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.530 
gravity strory would be really funny how
would<00:02:12.750> look<00:02:12.950> what<00:02:13.950> happened<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.489> me<00:02:14.610> spin

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
would look what happened to me spin

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.369 
would look what happened to me spin
