excess to feed this entire pasture

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.950 
excess to feed this entire pasture
because<00:02:47.520> my<00:02:47.730> ground<00:02:48.000> underneath<00:02:48.330> of<00:02:48.570> 6-8

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
because my ground underneath of 6-8

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.930 
because my ground underneath of 6-8
inches<00:02:48.990> is<00:02:49.500> blue<00:02:49.740> clay<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.700> when<00:02:50.850> that

inches is blue clay and when that

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.150 
inches is blue clay and when that
compost<00:02:51.360> see<00:02:51.540> it's<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:52.050> it<00:02:52.620> can't<00:02:52.860> penetrate

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
compost see it's it it can't penetrate

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.410 
compost see it's it it can't penetrate
so<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:53.940> seeps<00:02:54.330> into<00:02:54.810> my<00:02:55.110> pasture<00:02:55.970> this<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.180> all

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
so it seeps into my pasture this is all

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.380 
so it seeps into my pasture this is all
the<00:02:57.690> overflow<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.710> is<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.160> extra<00:02:59.790> this<00:03:00.210> is

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
the overflow this is the extra this is

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.020 
the overflow this is the extra this is
like<00:03:00.630> we<00:03:01.140> have<00:03:01.350> so<00:03:01.740> much<00:03:01.950> we<00:03:02.400> just<00:03:02.610> gotta<00:03:02.820> get

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
like we have so much we just gotta get

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.880 
like we have so much we just gotta get
rid<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:04.610> everything<00:03:05.610> back<00:03:06.000> for<00:03:06.240> 12<00:03:06.480> minutes

rid of everything back for 12 minutes
these<00:03:07.890> are<00:03:07.950> things<00:03:08.460> that<00:03:08.550> just<00:03:12.380> I'm<00:03:13.380> looking

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
these are things that just I'm looking

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.170 
these are things that just I'm looking
at<00:03:13.800> farmers<00:03:14.220> today<00:03:14.370> who<00:03:14.610> are<00:03:14.670> going<00:03:14.820> bankrupt

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
at farmers today who are going bankrupt

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.870 
at farmers today who are going bankrupt
paying<00:03:15.840> for<00:03:16.050> fertilizer<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.950> producing<00:03:17.460> less

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
and less every year or I'm doing nothing

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.200 
and less every year or I'm doing nothing
I<00:03:20.820> get<00:03:21.060> all<00:03:21.270> of<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.870> then<00:03:22.020> it<00:03:22.140> does<00:03:22.320> this

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
I get all of that and then it does this

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.510 
I get all of that and then it does this
extra<00:03:24.210> excess<00:03:25.140> like<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.680> next<00:03:26.220> year<00:03:26.340> does<00:03:26.490> it

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
extra excess like and next year does it

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:34.580 
extra excess like and next year does it
better<00:03:26.850> I<00:03:27.030> don't<00:03:27.150> do<00:03:27.360> anything<00:03:33.140> and<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.290> slope

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
better I don't do anything and a slope

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.490 
better I don't do anything and a slope
is<00:03:34.740> such<00:03:34.860> an<00:03:34.980> advantage<00:03:35.340> see<00:03:35.970> if<00:03:36.060> is<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:37.080> slope

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
is such an advantage see if is the slope

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.650 
is such an advantage see if is the slope
is<00:03:37.740> just<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.250> Sophia<00:03:38.640> if<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.940> have<00:03:39.180> lands<00:03:39.570> the

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
is just the Sophia if you have lands the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.700 
is just the Sophia if you have lands the
slope<00:03:39.900> anything<00:03:40.140> goes<00:03:40.230> bad

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
slope anything goes bad

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.350 
slope anything goes bad
plant<00:03:41.100> your<00:03:41.220> good<00:03:41.400> stuff<00:03:41.580> up<00:03:41.730> front<00:03:41.970> recover
