00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
actually happened that was a historical

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.429 
actually happened that was a historical
act<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.340> took<00:01:35.610> place<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.420> therefore<00:01:36.869> is

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
act that took place and therefore is

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.980 
act that took place and therefore is
just<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.100> historical<00:01:38.610> thing<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.869> could

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
just a historical thing and it could

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.350 
just a historical thing and it could
have<00:01:40.170> no<00:01:40.380> effect<00:01:40.799> upon<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.060> word

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
have no effect upon you but the word

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.499 
have no effect upon you but the word
that's<00:01:42.899> used<00:01:43.020> has<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.310> more<00:01:44.850> than<00:01:45.180> just

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
that's used has in it more than just

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.560 
that's used has in it more than just
that<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.170> actually<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.250> word<00:01:47.490> trust

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
that and actually the word trust

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.620 
that and actually the word trust
I<00:01:48.600> think<00:01:49.350> conveys<00:01:49.890> more<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.700> meaning<00:01:51.180> than

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
I think conveys more the meaning than

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.530 
I think conveys more the meaning than
the<00:01:51.810> word<00:01:51.990> believe<00:01:52.530> does<00:01:52.950> trust<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.329> Lord

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
the word believe does trust in the Lord

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.170 
the word believe does trust in the Lord
