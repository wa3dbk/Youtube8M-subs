excitement around the club these days I

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.840 
excitement around the club these days I
think<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.800> standards<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.340> been<00:01:02.370> set<00:01:02.699> that

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
think the standards have been set that

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.179 
think the standards have been set that
high<00:01:03.059> last<00:01:03.390> season<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.960> think<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.680> norm<00:01:04.920> I

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
high last season I think it's the norm I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.570 
high last season I think it's the norm I
think<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:06.689> we<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> dip<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.439> form<00:01:07.470> or<00:01:08.040> we

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
think if we have a dip in form or we

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.950 
think if we have a dip in form or we
drop<00:01:08.729> out<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.030> top<00:01:09.210> six<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.600> think<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
drop out the top six I think the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.980 
drop out the top six I think the
questions<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.560> asked<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.490> yeah<00:01:11.970> we've<00:01:12.840> got
