00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 one of the ideals that always bat 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.820
 he wanted to keep to the letter is the 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.610
 to never kill me good there are moments of 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.500
 extreme tension in which the gentleman 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.740
 dark had to break his code 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:40.229
 and that's why I present you 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:40.229
 [Music] 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.230
 the kid hippies was a super killer 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.840
 Russian that aimed to eliminate 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.150
 a large number of Soviet defectors 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.710
 high profile 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.440
 unfortunately batman always failed 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.290
 in his attempts to stop him doing 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.590
 that keys and peace will never fail at the time 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.750
 to eliminate your objectives the next 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.460
 in the blacklist of kits and track was 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.220
 nothing more and nothing less than the president 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.950
 king that batman to see that the life of the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.590
 first American president was 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.990
 at risk he decides to kidnap him and put him 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.540
 under his protection in this way the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.180
 chip plans are totally seen 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.420
 ruined and this causes a great hatred 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.580
 of the Russian villain towards patio in the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.590
 final confrontation the gentleman 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.810
 dark and the Russian murderer has the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.020
 definitive battle in some cameras 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.259
 underground x and peace despite being 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.860
 terribly wounded challenges batman to a 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.630
 fight to death in the heat of 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.400
 batman confrontation achieves that keats and 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.870
 peace enter a large deposit 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.780
 metal 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.110
 the dark knight did not hesitate a minute 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.380
 in closing the door and leaving the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.930
 Russian assassin so that the king of 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.190
 the night simply withdraws from the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.590
 scene in 'batman year 3 it was revealed that 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.650
 batman had contacted the police 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.140
 so he would go find the killer 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.810
 I decided to make a mention in the video 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.180
 since many people still believe that in 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.660
 reality if he had let the 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.660
 villain 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.340
 to 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.069
 as we said at the beginning of the video 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:35.760
 Batman has a code integrated tablet 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.250
 of not killing in the 30s and the beginnings 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.709
 the 40s the batman policy was 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.980
 destroy crime no matter the cost 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.170
 that's why in those times the pad man was 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.440
 a hero who had a similar style 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.959
 Japanese I know that Batman killed as if 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.810
 your life would depend on it to give you a 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.209
 example in a story the pacman ata 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.930
 from the neck to an enemy with a rope 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:05.329
 then up to the rope to your airplane bat and 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.329
 take off the rest is already history 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.200
 mat mont was one of the first 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.300
 batman's enemies has been his appearance 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.320
 a couple of numbers after the 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.520
 dark knight 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.740
 the monk was a powerful sorcerer 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.590
 showing hypnosis skills and 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.650
 batman vampirism knowing that matt 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.140
 mount was clearly more powerful than him 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.530
 He decides to enter his mansion stealthily 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.100
 and kill him with silver bullets while 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.100
 I slept 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.099
 although the next case is something strange 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:52.159
 since batman did not intend to 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:55.819
 eliminate this enemy what happened was 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:58.430
 an accident so to speak good 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:03.019
 being to the point this happened in batman 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.329
 number 425 in the year 1,988 in the 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.609
 history a drug dealer is 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.250
 looking for revenge on batman after 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:12.439
 that Robin would drop the brother of 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.590
 mentioned drug dealer from a 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:18.289
 roof during the battle the pacman 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.959
 ends up being the one persecuted through 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:24.260
 a garbage deposit by the trafficker 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:28.570
 of drugs and somehow knocks down a 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:32.600
 huge pile of cars on him leaving him 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:37.820
 obviously crushed dead 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:40.070
 [Music] 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.040
 the last one on the list the truth has 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.730
 generated a lot of controversy since it is not very 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.820
 clear if batman committed a murder or 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.890
 I 'm not talking about the wind show for 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.950
 those who did not read it in this story 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.740
 the joker leaves lizada a barbara gordon 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.670
 with a shot in the waist and after 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.160
 of the fact the clown king shows him 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:07.490
 hundreds of images of barberà nude and 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:11.270
 bleeding on the floor to the commissioner 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.850
 córdoba on the final page and it seems like 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.910
 if you batman strangle the joker up 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.640
 death the problem is that the end is 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:23.090
 very open and for years there has been 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.940
 controversies about whether the joker died or not 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.310
 Grant Morrison one of the greatest 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.980
 comic writers talked about the end of 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.340
 the killing joke and this was what he 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:37.400
 said batman kills soccer that's why 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:41.330
 that is called the joke joke the joker 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.289
 he makes his murderous joke in the end the batman 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.960
 arrives 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:49.180
 He breaks his neck and that's why laughter 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:52.030
 It stops and the light goes off 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.930
 anyway what I did morrison 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:58.870
 speculation remains speculation 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:03.699
 so I want you to tell me that 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:05.840
 based on this image if batman killed 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:08.360
 joker 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.030
 a question to think 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.219
 well this is the end of the video I hope 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.699
 that you liked it and if you liked it 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:18.340
 You can give your like and subscribe if 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:21.710
 you want if you still did not do it 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:26.349
 so that's all for today I hope 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.349
 see them in another video and goodbye 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.220
