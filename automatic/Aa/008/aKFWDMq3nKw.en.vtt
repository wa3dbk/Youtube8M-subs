00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.770
 yes hello people and welcome 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.420
 to a new video of me today 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.420
 I'll give you a game booster 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.410
 Actually, that is there for that too 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.030
 less powerful pcs are very low 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.680
 play challenging games 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.920
 that everything runs smoothly 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.020
 and for that razer already has some game 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.570
 booster created game booster 3 game 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:42.100
 booster 2 and that is here now 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.500
 new version of von razer and at 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.210
 This new version is also necessary 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.280
 in the account but make This dates 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.800
 quickly she only has to create an account 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.239
 go specify his e-mail address and 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.800
 recognize his password again 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.430
 then the whole accept the account 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.160
 set up 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.540
 I already have an account 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.440
 set up 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.689
 That's why I'll get started 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.860
 the whole thing is pretty chic and designed 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:10.990
 red black and yes the surface is 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.389
 we also do pretty well right now 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.759
 see will come after the sign 

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:18.789
 we are here in our mediathek 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.350
 so to speak, our games are now 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.630
 I already play the games, so to speak 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.709
 added or automatically 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.859
 been added 

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:27.840
 if you're missing a game, go here 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:30.670
 on this plus 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.679
 and there are only a few others left 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.149
 indicated players and if there as well 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.429
 He is not there to add to the game 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.529
 and just look where he does that 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.149
 For example, now age has saved 

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:50.409
 of empires is not in now 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:52.479
 and I do now add this 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.149
 play her you see here in here 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.179
 they are, so to speak, at the start 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.590
 this game when the settings the 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.179
 we will accelerate afterwards 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.029
 set applied to this game 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.659
 just as liquid and easy as possible 

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:09.429
 run as best as possible to get started 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.950
 Shortly to the program still exists here 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.230
 another subcategory offer 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.230
 I do not know how many times this one 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.880
 Offers change but are even complete 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.250
 interesting offer for everyone 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:26.590
 up to 50 60 74 in part I offer 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.920
 but do not know how to do that now 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.110
 paid or something but that's just it 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.850
 still come in the beta version now 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.200
 we the actual interesting because 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.960
 to accelerate the 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.750
 When accelerating it goes so here are 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.040
 Processes, so to speak, represent the man 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.860
 can choose 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.510
 which are closed when you get that 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.920
 Game starts that is quite helpful 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.920
 Show yourself here 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.180
 spotify web helper then we could go to 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.610
 make an example then we need 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.770
 not if we just play some game 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.200
 play there are some programs 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.850
 you do not need it right now 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.500
 for example, Mr Matschie or something 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.780
 like you have to own a bit 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.860
 look what you need for example 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.330
 Do not switch anything too fast 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.760
 committee may work that 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.830
 do not play anymore or something else 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.050
 separated but you just have to 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.810
 look what you do not need and exactly 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.580
 the whole program is synonymous 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.740
 unnecessary services just pretty 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.060
 then exclude quickly synonymous 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.070
 a little look at what you need 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.770
 you are not sure you prefer nothing 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.740
 exclude where you are not 100 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.500
 percent safe since exactly I could 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.850
 the whole here on automatically 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.380
 that means when you accelerate that 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.420
 this is really going to start 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.120
 automatically speeds up otherwise you can 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.620
 do it now and manually 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.920
 but we do not need that now 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.140
 really the diagnosis is really just 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.400
 you can do a bug report 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.800
 But you do not have to but relatively 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.850
 complicated then we come to 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.670
 defragment 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.470
 that it is quite interesting because if 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.420
 her losing game installs her 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.330
 play somewhere on the hard disk where 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.800
 free memory is and that means that 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.000
 Reading speed increases with time 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.410
 on this hard drive off and that too 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.850
 that could give against acting 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.959
 defragment so to speak the 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.360
 arrange hard disk 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.980
 that may take a moment but if 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.170
 her here on the singles and goes 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.030
 the fragmentation becomes, so to speak, the 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.440
 hard disk sorted and thereby also the 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.470
 reading speed faster and faster 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.600
 thereby also the play liquid on this 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.980
 fps is also quite interesting 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.720
 be used to display 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.820
 how many apps so frames per second 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.090
 you can play right now too 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.340
 show in which corner that want to have 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.850
 I have it over left above and that 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.040
 could of course also and make up 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.530
 divide it just then that there is one more 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.280
 very special thing I the old 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.020
 game where is not there namely that gave 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.270
 screencast module that means you can here 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.190
 either screenshots during the game 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.780
 make or even whole video recordings 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.280
 I especially like the video recordings 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.920
 interesting because screenshots you can yes 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.620
 also make the keyboard 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.820
 this means you can use one here 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.920
 You can also hire artists yourself 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.920
 the whole videos can do that 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.410
 So dissolve the video quality 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.880
 resolution video quality highest ever 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.890
 After all, how good the calculator is 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.590
 Can he really hurt or place 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.210
 other gameplays record these videos 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.090
 I have not tried it myself 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.840
 but it should be pretty good 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.740
 work exactly 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.090
 otherwise it is really only 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.710
 to say that you play as it were 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.210
 simply you can get it all over 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.340
 you can also do all this about this 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.970
 start when I start something now 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.280
 Looks like this is starting game and you 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.740
 see the whole thing is accelerating and it 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.160
 will be started 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:50.440
 it would be now in the example mw2 it will be 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.470
 first optimized and then started 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.720
 and that is relatively good because it too 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.060
 relatively fast and he should then 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.800
 especially with weaker pc actually 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.510
 have a pretty good performance though 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.060
 you close the whole again that goes 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.440
 whole back the page again in the old one 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.270
 For example, the thing has just happened 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.730
 has opened that we are there 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.390
 have closed because it is not 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.030
 is needed 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.940
 Well that 's it I hope you can now 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:19.870
 even with poor performance or games 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:22.360
 play and be as fluid as possible and 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.050
 yes I think that's it I hope we 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.050
 we see each other soon
