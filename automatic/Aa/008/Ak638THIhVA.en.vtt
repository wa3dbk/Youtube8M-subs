00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
picked this thing apart so much that

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.480 
picked this thing apart so much that
they're<00:00:04.049> looking<00:00:04.380> at<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.589> time

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
they're looking at the time

to launch up to 37 miles an hour they

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:10.339 
to launch up to 37 miles an hour they
say<00:00:08.370> howdy<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.299> actually<00:00:09.780> picking<00:00:10.080> up<00:00:10.200> a

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.830 
say howdy is actually picking up a
little<00:00:10.469> bit<00:00:10.709> of<00:00:10.830> time<00:00:11.010> there<00:00:11.840> it's

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
little bit of time there it's

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.839 
little bit of time there it's
interesting<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.559> note<00:00:13.589> once<00:00:14.129> again<00:00:14.460> we<00:00:14.639> have

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
interesting to note once again we have

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.790 
interesting to note once again we have

that very long for of course caution and

that very long for of course caution and
certainly<00:00:17.099> these<00:00:17.730> teams<00:00:18.029> want<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.450> get<00:00:18.570> some

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
certainly these teams want to get some

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.480 
certainly these teams want to get some
information<00:00:19.110> in<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.919> book<00:00:20.099> so<00:00:20.310> not

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
information in the book so not

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.339 
information in the book so not
surprising<00:00:21.119> did<00:00:21.240> not<00:00:21.450> see<00:00:21.689> people<00:00:22.019> come<00:00:22.199> to

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:22.349 
surprising did not see people come to

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.109

pit<00:00:22.529> road<00:00:22.560> under<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.430> first<00:00:23.640> full<00:00:23.849> course

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
pit road under that first full course

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.910 
pit road under that first full course
caution<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.660> also<00:00:24.810> shows<00:00:25.199> exactly<00:00:25.619> what

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
caution but it also shows exactly what

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.620 
caution but it also shows exactly what
we<00:00:26.010> talked<00:00:26.250> about<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.300> lose

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
we talked about and that is you lose

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.929 
we talked about and that is you lose
less<00:00:27.960> time<00:00:28.259> under<00:00:28.679> green<00:00:29.039> flag<00:00:29.340> stops<00:00:29.699> now

less time under green flag stops now

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.240 
less time under green flag stops now
then<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.630> do<00:00:30.810> from<00:00:31.080> behind<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.859> pace<00:00:32.040> car

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
then you do from behind the pace car

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.680 
then you do from behind the pace car
spitting<00:00:32.850> under<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.150> full<00:00:33.390> course<00:00:33.600> caution

spitting under a full course caution

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.540 
spitting under a full course caution
yeah<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.410> difference<00:00:34.769> between<00:00:34.890> all<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.400> saw<00:00:35.519> a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
yeah the difference between all we saw a

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.979 
yeah the difference between all we saw a
little<00:00:35.699> bit<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.970> debris<00:00:36.150> get<00:00:36.390> kicked<00:00:36.600> up<00:00:36.780> there

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
little bit of debris get kicked up there

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.630 
little bit of debris get kicked up there
by<00:00:37.199> that<00:00:37.379> forward<00:00:37.799> as<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.949> came<00:00:38.129> through<00:00:38.400> tat

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
by that forward as it came through tat

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.360 
by that forward as it came through tat
Rouge<00:00:38.879> but<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:40.140> difference<00:00:40.350> coming<00:00:40.949> down<00:00:41.100> pit

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
Rouge but the difference coming down pit

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.770 
Rouge but the difference coming down pit
lane<00:00:41.430> as<00:00:41.940> opposed<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.299> staying<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
lane as opposed to staying on the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.180 
lane as opposed to staying on the
racetrack<00:00:42.960> forget<00:00:43.409> the<00:00:43.530> servicing<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
racetrack forget the servicing of the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.549 
racetrack forget the servicing of the
race<00:00:44.339> car<00:00:44.580> cost<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.970> forty<00:00:45.420> two<00:00:45.659> seconds<00:00:46.350> and

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
race car cost you forty two seconds and

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.590 
race car cost you forty two seconds and
then<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.159> to<00:00:47.220> add<00:00:47.280> refueling<00:00:48.269> to<00:00:48.390> that

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
then you have to add refueling to that

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.840 
then you have to add refueling to that
which<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:49.080> the<00:00:49.530> p1<00:00:49.890> machines<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.369> typically

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
which on the p1 machines is typically

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.780 
which on the p1 machines is typically
around<00:00:51.089> 28<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.750> 30<00:00:52.049> seconds<00:00:52.650> so<00:00:52.860> that's<00:00:53.400> a<00:00:53.580> big

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
around 28 to 30 seconds so that's a big

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.789 
around 28 to 30 seconds so that's a big
number<00:00:54.000> right<00:00:54.269> there<00:00:54.299> minute<00:00:54.900> ten<00:00:55.199> just

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:55.799 
number right there minute ten just

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:58.130 
number right there minute ten just
bringing<00:00:56.159> the<00:00:56.250> car<00:00:56.430> down<00:00:56.699> pit<00:00:57.000> lane<00:00:57.140> refueling

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
bringing the car down pit lane refueling

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.750 
bringing the car down pit lane refueling
that<00:00:58.530> would<00:00:58.650> be<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> difference<00:00:59.040> to<00:00:59.309> staying

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
that would be the difference to staying

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.310 
that would be the difference to staying
out<00:00:59.939> on<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.330> racetrack<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.019> just<00:01:01.199> to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
out on the racetrack and just to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.410 
out on the racetrack and just to
reinforce<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.400> rules<00:01:02.610> here<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> little<00:01:03.030> bit<00:01:03.239> we

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
reinforce the rules here a little bit we

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.509 
reinforce the rules here a little bit we
saw<00:01:03.659> a<00:01:03.689> couple<00:01:03.839> of<00:01:04.199> people<00:01:04.530> over<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.220> wall

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519

would cost you a few seconds on a fuel
only<00:01:20.369> stock<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.210> certainly<00:01:21.929> they<00:01:22.079> trying<00:01:22.350> to

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
only stock so certainly they trying to
