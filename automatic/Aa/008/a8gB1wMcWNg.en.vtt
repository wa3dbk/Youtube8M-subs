00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:06.590
 This time, I would like to explain about cutting. 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.450
 It is also called brushing. 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.360
 This is a rendition of this kind of sound. 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.359
 I will try for a moment. 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.339
 It sounds like you're playing like this with your right hand moving like this. 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.710
 This is because the sound of "Tsukutaku" I mentioned earlier is so important. 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.230
 In this movie this time, I squeeze just to make it sound like "Tsukukuku" 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.800
 I would like to do for a moment. 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.330
 Let's do it for a moment, actually. 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.480
 Lightly touch the four fingers of your left hand on each string. 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.470
 I can not hold it down. Touch lightly. 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.810
 I just put it on. 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:02.600
 And when you use the pick with your right hand up and down, up and down. 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.060
 It's just about this, but 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.259
 If you have a bad person 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.759
 It sounds like "pacman" in this way. 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:16.559
 What should I do? 

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:26.340
 The trick is to increase the swing speed of this pick with your right hand. 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.460
 In this up and down movement ... 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.759
 It's not up and down with up and down movement, 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.179
 With the wrist 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.240
 When you go up and down. 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.409
 Speaking of what to do with this, 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:42.569
 It is a snap of the wrist. 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:45.130
 This snap. 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.859
 It is often said that the action of shaking off wet hands like this with splashes. 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.380
 After that, it is the operation to cover the fan. 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.789
 After that, it is often said that the operation to turn over the table. 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:07.459
 So that movement. Shaking out using rotation, to some extent 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.180
 It sounds like "Tsukutaku". 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.110
 Still, people who don't sound like "Tsuku-kuk" sometimes hold the pick too hard. 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.610
 Keep the pick as light as possible. 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:27.550
 If you grip the pick tightly, the pick will win on each string. 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.010
 Because it sounds like "Bakibaki" 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.750
 As much as possible to lose the pick to the strings "Soo so so soft." 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.020
 Let's bring the pick gently. 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.650
 Remove the power so much that the pick blows off if the power is removed any more. 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.180
 So let your right wrist relax already. 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.580
 It is useless with force. 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.980
 Let me relax 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.950
 And so on 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.910
 If you can hear the sound of "Tsukutuk", it will pass for the time being. 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.610
 First of all, please do your best for a while until the sound of "Tsukukuku" here is heard. 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.640
 You may need to improve the form in various ways, 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.180
 Let's look for that kind of thing and do it.
