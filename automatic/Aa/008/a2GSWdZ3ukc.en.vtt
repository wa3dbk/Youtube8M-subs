00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.280 
can simply take and you just plug it
into<00:02:05.850> his<00:02:06.030> hand<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.450> actually<00:02:06.810> quite<00:02:06.990> a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
into his hand it is actually quite a

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.010 
into his hand it is actually quite a
tight<00:02:07.619> fit

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
tight fit

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.040 
tight fit
he<00:02:09.170> holds<00:02:09.620> it<00:02:09.950> like<00:02:10.640> he<00:02:10.790> should<00:02:11.000> one<00:02:11.690> thing<00:02:11.930> I

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
he holds it like he should one thing I

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.010 
he holds it like he should one thing I
really<00:02:12.350> don't<00:02:12.470> like<00:02:12.590> is<00:02:12.980> this<00:02:13.910> spike<00:02:14.360> he<00:02:14.810> never

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
really don't like is this spike he never

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.780 
really don't like is this spike he never
had<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:15.350> in<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.560> show<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:16.010> really<00:02:16.220> don't

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
had this in the show and I really don't

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.310 
had this in the show and I really don't
understand<00:02:17.180> why<00:02:17.300> they<00:02:17.480> had<00:02:17.600> them<00:02:17.750> molded<00:02:18.170> like

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
understand why they had them molded like

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.460 
understand why they had them molded like
that<00:02:18.500> they<00:02:19.100> could<00:02:19.340> have<00:02:19.460> made<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:20.470> detachable

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
that they could have made a detachable

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.340 
that they could have made a detachable
accessory<00:02:22.130> like<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.610> shard<00:02:23.300> sword<00:02:23.900> or

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
accessory like the shard sword or

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.010 
accessory like the shard sword or
something<00:02:25.250> like<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.460> I<00:02:25.700> mean<00:02:26.030> it's<00:02:26.720> really

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
something like that I mean it's really

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.590 
something like that I mean it's really
flimsy<00:02:28.010> plastic<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:29.920> it's<00:02:30.920> kind<00:02:31.130> of<00:02:31.160> a<00:02:31.220> pain

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
flimsy plastic and it's kind of a pain

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.440 
flimsy plastic and it's kind of a pain
really<00:02:32.600> hits<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.980> it's<00:02:34.460> one<00:02:34.670> of<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.820> few<00:02:35.060> flaws

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
really hits so it's one of the few flaws

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.380 
really hits so it's one of the few flaws
on<00:02:35.690> this<00:02:35.870> mold<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.830> other<00:02:37.100> is<00:02:37.460> that<00:02:37.850> because

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
on this mold the other is that because

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.410 
on this mold the other is that because
he<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:38.960> a<00:02:39.110> little<00:02:39.800> bit<00:02:39.890> narrow<00:02:40.220> than<00:02:40.640> original

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
he is a little bit narrow than original

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.950 
he is a little bit narrow than original
Diamondhead<00:02:42.140> he's<00:02:43.100> really<00:02:43.640> likes<00:02:44.270> to<00:02:44.540> fall
