rockstar<00:01:12.160> could<00:01:12.280> not<00:01:12.370> perfect<00:01:12.790> every<00:01:13.150> little

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
rockstar could not perfect every little

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.570 
rockstar could not perfect every little
thing<00:01:13.660> but<00:01:14.110> one<00:01:14.260> thing<00:01:14.470> they<00:01:14.500> can<00:01:14.890> do<00:01:15.100> is<00:01:15.130> like

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
thing but one thing they can do is like

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.430 
thing but one thing they can do is like
make<00:01:15.820> their<00:01:16.000> system<00:01:16.390> stronger<00:01:16.690> to<00:01:17.020> find<00:01:17.260> out

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
make their system stronger to find out

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.870 
make their system stronger to find out
who's<00:01:17.590> actually<00:01:17.800> doing<00:01:18.100> it<00:01:18.400> so<00:01:18.730> I<00:01:18.760> think

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
who's actually doing it so I think

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.190 
who's actually doing it so I think
they're<00:01:19.180> gonna<00:01:19.240> track<00:01:19.630> every<00:01:19.930> single

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
improved which means it's probably going

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.460
