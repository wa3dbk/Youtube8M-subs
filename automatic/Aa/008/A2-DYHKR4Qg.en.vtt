for<00:02:00.590> baking<00:02:01.549> and<00:02:01.789> I<00:02:01.820> like<00:02:02.060> that<00:02:02.210> I<00:02:02.270> can<00:02:02.539> reduce

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
for baking and I like that I can reduce

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.169 
for baking and I like that I can reduce
the<00:02:03.170> amount<00:02:03.469> of<00:02:03.560> sugar<00:02:03.619> and<00:02:04.189> calories<00:02:04.549> and<00:02:04.850> my

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
the amount of sugar and calories and my

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:07.600 
the amount of sugar and calories and my
recipe<00:02:05.720> and<00:02:05.990> still<00:02:06.679> get<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:06.890> sweetness<00:02:07.369> and

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
recipe and still get the sweetness and

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.419 
recipe and still get the sweetness and
flavor<00:02:07.759> that<00:02:08.000> I<00:02:08.179> need<00:02:08.479> from<00:02:08.780> brown<00:02:08.989> sugar<00:02:09.429> so

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
flavor that I need from brown sugar so

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.790 
flavor that I need from brown sugar so
I'm<00:02:10.580> just<00:02:10.759> stirring<00:02:11.090> my<00:02:11.569> apples<00:02:12.110> all<00:02:12.319> around

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
softened once your apple pie filling is

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.289 
softened once your apple pie filling is
done<00:02:24.500> cooking<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:25.430> want<00:02:25.549> to<00:02:25.700> let<00:02:25.849> that<00:02:26.000> cool

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
done cooking you want to let that cool

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.539 
done cooking you want to let that cool
completely<00:02:26.750> while<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.319> work<00:02:27.500> on<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.980> topping

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
completely while you work on the topping

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.210 
completely while you work on the topping
and<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.819> base<00:02:29.060> for<00:02:29.750> this<00:02:29.870> recipe<00:02:30.319> it's<00:02:30.680> just

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
and the base for this recipe it's just

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.250 
and the base for this recipe it's just
one<00:02:31.549> dough<00:02:31.819> for<00:02:32.120> both<00:02:32.360> topping<00:02:32.930> in<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.080> base

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
one dough for both topping in the base

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.440 
one dough for both topping in the base
so<00:02:33.470> it's<00:02:33.620> really<00:02:33.890> easy<00:02:34.010> I'm<00:02:34.760> going<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.239> weigh
