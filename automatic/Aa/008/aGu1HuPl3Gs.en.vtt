00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
difficult one for us to start learning

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.760 
difficult one for us to start learning
how<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.120> scale<00:02:34.570> with<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.020> you<00:02:35.440> know<00:02:35.470> I'm<00:02:35.650> going

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
how to scale with and you know I'm going

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.140 
how to scale with and you know I'm going
to<00:02:35.830> try<00:02:36.010> my<00:02:36.040> hardest<00:02:36.310> but<00:02:36.520> if<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.790> gameplay

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
to try my hardest but if the gameplay

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.150 
to try my hardest but if the gameplay
doesn't<00:02:37.300> reflect<00:02:37.660> it<00:02:37.960> because<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.920> skill

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
doesn't reflect it because the skill

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.980 
doesn't reflect it because the skill
moves<00:02:39.370> just<00:02:39.670> didn't<00:02:39.940> end<00:02:40.120> up<00:02:40.270> working<00:02:40.480> for<00:02:40.690> me

as soon as he actually retires from

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.849 
as soon as he actually retires from
playing<00:04:19.690> football<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:20.169> isn't<00:04:20.410> on<00:04:20.500> altima

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
playing football and isn't on altima

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.650 
playing football and isn't on altima
team<00:04:21.099> so<00:04:21.520> he's<00:04:21.700> going<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:22.030> go<00:04:22.150> in<00:04:22.300> instead<00:04:22.599> of

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
team so he's going to go in instead of

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.390 
team so he's going to go in instead of
Alex<00:04:22.990> into<00:04:23.229> that<00:04:23.349> central<00:04:23.770> center<00:04:24.039> attacking

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
Alex into that central center attacking

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.700 
Alex into that central center attacking
mid<00:04:24.520> position<00:04:24.700> because

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
mid position because

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.230 
mid position because
think<00:04:25.919> that<00:04:26.190> he<00:04:26.460> isn't<00:04:26.580> fast<00:04:26.819> enough<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:27.120> play

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
think that he isn't fast enough to play

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.300 
think that he isn't fast enough to play
sort<00:04:27.479> of<00:04:27.539> like<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.750> wing<00:04:27.990> sides<00:04:28.319> and<00:04:28.650> he'll<00:04:29.100> be

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
sort of like the wing sides and he'll be

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.680 
sort of like the wing sides and he'll be
able<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.580> set<00:04:29.940> up<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.150> play<00:04:30.330> really<00:04:30.600> nicely

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
able to set up the play really nicely

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.779 
able to set up the play really nicely
from<00:04:31.080> that<00:04:31.259> can<00:04:31.440> position<00:04:31.710> wasn't<00:04:32.460> impressed

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
from that can position wasn't impressed

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.240 
from that can position wasn't impressed
with<00:04:32.880> Diego<00:04:33.300> Valeri<00:04:33.600> as<00:04:34.020> well<00:04:34.259> in<00:04:34.530> goal<00:04:34.770> so<00:04:35.220> I

the better brazilian goalkeepers but he

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
absolutely shocking probably should have

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.490 
absolutely shocking probably should have
put<00:05:38.729> a<00:05:38.759> man<00:05:38.940> on<00:05:38.970> the<00:05:39.120> line<00:05:39.330> and<00:05:39.599> to<00:05:40.229> be<00:05:40.320> honest

put a man on the line and to be honest

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.959 
put a man on the line and to be honest
it<00:05:40.620> cost<00:05:40.800> me<00:05:40.949> because<00:05:41.190> we<00:05:41.310> end<00:05:41.430> up<00:05:41.550> going<00:05:41.820> away

with<00:05:42.240> a<00:05:42.270> one<00:05:42.539> all<00:05:42.750> draw<00:05:42.960> not<00:05:43.349> brilliant<00:05:43.740> and

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
with a one all draw not brilliant and

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.620 
with a one all draw not brilliant and
but<00:05:44.610> not<00:05:44.729> the<00:05:44.849> end<00:05:44.969> of<00:05:45.000> the<00:05:45.060> world<00:05:45.180> we<00:05:45.360> have<00:05:45.449> now

got<00:05:45.810> one<00:05:45.990> point<00:05:46.259> in<00:05:46.380> division<00:05:46.740> i<00:05:46.979> think<00:05:47.430> its

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
got one point in division i think its

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.760 
got one point in division i think its
division<00:05:47.820> 5<00:05:48.060> win<00:05:48.300> we<00:05:49.020> play<00:05:49.050> three<00:05:49.440> games<00:05:49.469> and

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
division 5 win we play three games and

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.080 
division 5 win we play three games and
they<00:05:49.830> got<00:05:49.949> one<00:05:50.130> point<00:05:50.370> from<00:05:50.490> that<00:05:50.699> so<00:05:50.940> we're

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
they got one point from that so we're

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.010 
they got one point from that so we're
really<00:05:51.180> going<00:05:51.360> to<00:05:51.509> need<00:05:51.599> to<00:05:51.659> pull<00:05:51.810> our<00:05:51.900> socks

I've was we going to get relegated so

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.560 
I've was we going to get relegated so
we're<00:05:55.530> going<00:05:55.620> to<00:05:55.770> go<00:05:55.800> straight<00:05:56.550> into<00:05:56.969> our<00:05:57.330> next

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
we're going to go straight into our next

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.089 
we're going to go straight into our next
game<00:05:57.840> after<00:05:58.169> we've<00:05:58.289> made<00:05:58.469> a<00:05:58.500> purchase<00:05:58.770> we

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
game after we've made a purchase we

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:01.760 
game after we've made a purchase we
picked<00:05:59.340> up<00:05:59.460> Naldo<00:05:59.880> for<00:06:00.060> the<00:06:00.120> team<00:06:00.530> the<00:06:01.530> reason

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
picked up Naldo for the team the reason

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.680 
picked up Naldo for the team the reason
picked<00:06:01.919> up<00:06:02.039> now<00:06:02.219> is<00:06:02.460> just<00:06:02.909> because<00:06:03.210> we're

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
picked up now is just because we're

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.839 
picked up now is just because we're
conceding<00:06:04.110> a<00:06:04.169> lot<00:06:04.349> of<00:06:04.530> very<00:06:04.889> cheap<00:06:05.250> goals<00:06:05.520> and

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:05.849 
conceding a lot of very cheap goals and

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:07.279 
conceding a lot of very cheap goals and
I<00:06:05.909> think<00:06:06.090> that's<00:06:06.240> mainly<00:06:06.539> because<00:06:06.690> of<00:06:06.960> our

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
I think that's mainly because of our

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:08.870 
I think that's mainly because of our
defenders<00:06:07.860> now<00:06:08.310> though<00:06:08.490> I<00:06:08.520> know<00:06:08.669> is

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880
