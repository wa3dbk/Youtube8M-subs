most popular pedal that we've created

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.089 
most popular pedal that we've created
over<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.109> years<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.650> we've<00:00:25.859> done<00:00:26.039> some

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
over the years and we've done some

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.710 
over the years and we've done some
changes<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.939> for<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.180> year<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.539> let<00:00:27.660> me

changes to it for this year so let me

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.630 
changes to it for this year so let me
show<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:27.900> what<00:00:28.080> we've<00:00:28.199> done<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:29.220> first<00:00:29.429> thing

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
show you what we've done the first thing

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.429 
show you what we've done the first thing
that<00:00:29.760> we've<00:00:29.880> done<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.240> we've<00:00:30.390> added<00:00:30.689> basically

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
that we've done is we've added basically

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.360 
that we've done is we've added basically
here<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.360> dual<00:00:33.360> spring<00:00:33.809> rocker<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.890> previously

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
here a dual spring rocker so previously

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.330 
here a dual spring rocker so previously
if<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.420> look<00:00:36.540> at<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> bottom<00:00:37.079> here<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:38.070> was

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
if you look at the bottom here this was

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.549 
if you look at the bottom here this was
a<00:00:38.370> fixed<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.120> now<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.329> got<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> bearing

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
a fixed and now it's got a bearing

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.830 
a fixed and now it's got a bearing
inside<00:00:40.680> here<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.460> pivots<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.480> takes<00:00:42.660> a

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
inside here so it pivots so it takes a

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.690 
inside here so it pivots so it takes a
little<00:00:43.050> bit<00:00:43.230> more<00:00:43.500> off<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.160> resistance<00:00:44.640> of

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
little bit more off of the resistance of

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.310 
little bit more off of the resistance of
the<00:00:44.789> pedal<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> little<00:00:45.120> smoother<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.170> that's

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the pedal a little smoother so that's

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.470 
the pedal a little smoother so that's
one<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> changes<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:47.250> made<00:00:47.480> second

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
one of the changes that we made second

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.180 
one of the changes that we made second
change<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:48.960> made<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> very<00:00:49.590> big<00:00:49.860> change

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
change that we made is a very big change

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.299 
change that we made is a very big change
and<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.120> we<00:00:51.239> now<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:52.110> try<00:00:52.710> pivot

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
and that is that we now have a try pivot

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.720 
and that is that we now have a try pivot
hoop<00:00:53.969> clamp<00:00:54.360> system<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.500> no<00:00:56.100> longer<00:00:56.430> do<00:00:56.699> you

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
hoop clamp system so no longer do you

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.880 
hoop clamp system so no longer do you
have<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.910> worry<00:00:57.149> about<00:00:57.270> making<00:00:57.890> additional

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
have to worry about making additional

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.189 
have to worry about making additional
adjustments<00:00:59.520> literally<00:01:00.090> one<00:01:00.420> screw<00:01:00.899> here<00:01:01.079> on

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
adjustments literally one screw here on

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.049 
adjustments literally one screw here on
the<00:01:01.289> side<00:01:01.530> takes<00:01:02.219> care<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.489> everything<00:01:02.789> and

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the side takes care of everything and

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.880 
the side takes care of everything and
there's<00:01:03.270> there's<00:01:03.629> literally<00:01:03.960> pivoting<00:01:04.619> pads

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
there's there's literally pivoting pads

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.370 
there's there's literally pivoting pads
here<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.880> help<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.240> Center<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.900> help

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
here that help you to Center the help

we've taken off velcro on the bottom of
the<00:01:16.020> pedal<00:01:16.380> velcro<00:01:17.070> as<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.369> know<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> great

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the pedal velcro as you know is a great

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.600 
the pedal velcro as you know is a great
way<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.380> stick<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.830> carpet<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:20.369> then<00:01:20.520> you

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
way to stick to the carpet but then you

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.399 
way to stick to the carpet but then you
got<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.790> yank<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.240> up<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.869> put<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> full

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
got to yank it up so you put a full

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.380 
got to yank it up so you put a full
rubber<00:01:22.740> skid<00:01:23.159> plate<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.580> bottom<00:01:23.700> you

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
rubber skid plate on the bottom you

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.140 
rubber skid plate on the bottom you
still<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:25.259> no<00:01:25.530> issues<00:01:25.890> with<00:01:26.040> creeping<00:01:26.580> but

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
still have no issues with creeping but

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.580 
still have no issues with creeping but
at<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> same<00:01:27.540> time<00:01:27.750> it's<00:01:27.990> really<00:01:28.229> easy<00:01:28.409> to

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
at the same time it's really easy to

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.260 
at the same time it's really easy to
take<00:01:29.040> off<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.729> off<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.060> off<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
take off and up and off the off the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.219 
take off and up and off the off the
ground<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:32.070> our<00:01:32.390> most<00:01:33.390> popular<00:01:33.630> pedal

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
ground so this is our most popular pedal

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.359 
ground so this is our most popular pedal
lever<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.619> made<00:01:34.799> some<00:01:35.009> real<00:01:35.159> nice<00:01:35.340> change

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
lever and we made some real nice change

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.539 
lever and we made some real nice change
to<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.119> for<00:01:36.450> 2012<00:01:37.229> look<00:01:37.799> basically<00:01:38.070> its

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
to it for for 2012 look basically its

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.090 
to it for for 2012 look basically its
most<00:01:38.850> mo<00:01:39.450> more<00:01:39.869> functional<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.470> smooth<00:01:40.950> right

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
most mo more functional and smooth right

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.429 
most mo more functional and smooth right
