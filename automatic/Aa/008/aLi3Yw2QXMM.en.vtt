00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.799
 Hello, my name is Maria. 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.590
 play fence and on my plan alex on day o 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.080
 People are complaining a lot about the ping and 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.849
 internet slow down there and there the same 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.839
 making meeting and will give strength in 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.660
 Marketplace 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.510
 I'll leave chewed links down there 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.369
 video right and let's start I'm not 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.349
 In doing ok then I'll give a 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.250
 Force way possible hit 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.750
 good 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.700
 basically we are going to download 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.700
 of two programs if it is speed 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:48.030
 ok then I will show how the works 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.960
 people will give you two clicks to run one 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.969
 a little 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.949
 as I will show that it will give 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.250
 in the end because it's a test of the year so much 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.870
 How much, then, will we ease? 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.510
 in the end it will give a similar screen 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.439
 with this one, and will talk about 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.240
 percentage of 60 to 300 patients per 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.799
 percent with the best dns server 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.869
 be closer to your home because 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.490
 is basically interfering with 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.460
 transmission and reception of data 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.320
 ok can give 9% customer is seeing the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.909
 image can give 30 blocks in can a 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.729
 300% better than the primary server 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.799
 secondary server 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.479
 the program the only thing that we will 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.759
 do here is put 220 start benchmark 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.130
 it can take 15 to 20 minutes 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.470
 depending on the internet have patience and 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.360
 close any programs that use connection 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.970
 with the internet it leaves only this problem 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.340
 round of interference none of which he 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.290
 I think it's better with you I 'm not going 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.840
 and I 'm going to stay here in the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.159
 The end he's going to give is this screen that 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:57.860
 We'll do the replacement as 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.860
 Opened at 17 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:20.459
 The boring for you to own properties 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.319
 protocol tcp ip version 4 ok version 496 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.660
 property we will apply here 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.370
 รณ use the following 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.450
 dns servers or equivalent 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.890
 preferential 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:49.000
 the secondary and when the test is finished 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:58.170
 is not that the substitute will do the 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:01.120
 Download and compressed work ok 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:09.239
 How do you work? 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:09.239
 but the Brazil forward 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:20.459
 if you want fate to move forward and 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:25.630
 win automatically uncheck forward 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:28.239
 this program is 30 days to install 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.370
 it's 30 days after 30 days it goes 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.650
 expires but along with this low is 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.650
 commanding a file that reset the beach 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:20.310
 ie the demand of download beauty sim 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.580
 It makes it clear that you can not move on 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:30.340
 internet while it will start or 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.689
 I do not know all this here, right. 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.280
 take a while 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:35.229
 I will not leave everything because I want to 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:05:22.469
 do a brief tutorial as soon as 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:05:25.469
 finish what it already indicates to be 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:25.469
 installed 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:44.889
 getting down here normal for a lot 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:50.969
 high click again to add it 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:50.969
 will prioritize whether the band and 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:58.449
 finish the traffic analysis 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:13.180
 lets just bookmark this media stream 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:16.110
 continuous line ok again because at 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:21.729
 times the first calibration does not work 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:22.810
 between 20% and 30% of calibration 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:28.060
 new 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:32.949
 saves 12 minutes again in another 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:34.319
 thing I forgot the beautiful information 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:37.449
 of the adapter 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:39.429
 here below the zero calibration because 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:43.539
 I did not finish that one if the sky is 

00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:44.229
 below 85 redo after two 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:47.649
 minutes 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:52.089
 Ok, getting to 85 on top of the filezinho. 

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:54.159
 you can rest easy and close my simple 

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:55.149
 basic probably your 3ds goes 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:57.339
 improve 

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:58.329
 the let good eye that its state in a 

00:06:57.339 --> 00:07:00.189
 personal work was complaining 

00:06:58.329 --> 00:07:03.159
 likely to improve as well. 

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:04.989
 ok the basic tutorial any questions 

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:06.189
 feel free to call me my channel 

00:07:04.989 --> 00:07:09.119
 that I give a strength of ok 

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:09.119
 thanks people, thanks
