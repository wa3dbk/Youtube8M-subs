00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.900 
questions we get is which color should I
go<00:00:33.300> for<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.899> it's<00:00:34.440> often<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.160> personal<00:00:35.579> one<00:00:35.730> but

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
go for and it's often a personal one but

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.750 
go for and it's often a personal one but
sometimes<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.420> want<00:00:36.600> actual<00:00:36.960> feedback<00:00:37.170> from

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
sometimes you want actual feedback from

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.880 
sometimes you want actual feedback from
hands<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.879> use<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.930> starting<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> back

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
hands on use so starting on the back

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.889 
hands on use so starting on the back
here<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.309> where<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.760> see<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> lot<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
here is where we can see a lot of the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.130 
here is where we can see a lot of the
difference<00:00:43.410> between<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.730> two<00:00:44.910> units<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
difference between the two units so the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.470 
difference between the two units so the
overall<00:00:46.350> profile<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.430> exactly<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:48.000> same<00:00:48.270> it's

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
overall profile is exactly the same it's

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.380 
overall profile is exactly the same it's
the<00:00:48.570> color<00:00:49.700> differences<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.879> material<00:00:51.329> is

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the color differences the material is

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.360 
the color differences the material is
the<00:00:51.510> same<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.649> back<00:00:52.829> here<00:00:53.100> we've<00:00:53.219> got

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the same so on the back here we've got

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.930 
the same so on the back here we've got
this<00:00:53.460> gloss<00:00:53.879> sort<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.300> finish<00:00:55.489> here<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.789> can

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
this gloss sort of finish here you can

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.260 
this gloss sort of finish here you can
see<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.149> HTC<00:00:58.050> logo<00:00:58.489> stands<00:00:59.489> out<00:00:59.699> considerably

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
see the HTC logo stands out considerably

fingerprints or grease on the back cover

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.060

it<00:01:19.950> doesn't<00:01:20.280> pick<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.729> fingerprints

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
it doesn't pick up the fingerprints

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.420 
it doesn't pick up the fingerprints
quite<00:01:21.600> same<00:01:21.869> or<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.409> can't<00:01:22.619> really<00:01:22.740> see<00:01:22.860> them

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.840 
quite same or you can't really see them
as<00:01:23.790> such<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> grease<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:24.900> there<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.530> a

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
as such as the grease so there is a

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.429 
as such as the grease so there is a
massive<00:01:26.850> advantage<00:01:27.119> there<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:28.200> sort<00:01:28.380> of

down<00:02:07.740> here<00:02:07.979> probably<00:02:08.160> stands<00:02:08.459> out<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> bit<00:02:08.879> more

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
down here probably stands out a bit more

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.770 
down here probably stands out a bit more
on<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.239> white<00:02:09.420> because<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:11.099> drilled<00:02:11.400> hole

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
on the white because of the drilled hole

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.470 
on the white because of the drilled hole
than<00:02:11.900> it<00:02:12.020> does<00:02:12.260> on<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.590> black<00:02:13.160> if<00:02:14.060> we<00:02:14.270> then

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
than it does on the black if we then

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.960 
than it does on the black if we then
turn<00:02:14.930> them<00:02:15.080> over<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.380> look<00:02:15.680> at<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.010> sides<00:02:16.520> so

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
turn them over to look at the sides so

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.970 
turn them over to look at the sides so
you<00:02:17.000> can<00:02:17.180> see<00:02:17.420> on<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.780> black<00:02:17.990> we've<00:02:18.350> got<00:02:18.560> black

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
you can see on the black we've got black

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.750 
you can see on the black we've got black
banding<00:02:19.550> running<00:02:19.880> round<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.690> whereas<00:02:21.290> on<00:02:21.440> the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
banding running round it whereas on the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.220 
banding running round it whereas on the
blue<00:02:22.760> one<00:02:22.970> here<00:02:23.000> we've<00:02:23.360> got<00:02:23.600> this<00:02:23.840> blue

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
blue one here we've got this blue

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.320 
blue one here we've got this blue
banding<00:02:24.770> running<00:02:25.100> all<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.459> way<00:02:25.490> around<00:02:25.730> all

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
banding running all the way around all

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.260 
banding running all the way around all
the<00:02:27.230> headphone<00:02:27.890> jacks<00:02:28.250> etc<00:02:28.850> in<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.060> same

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
the headphone jacks etc in the same

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.300 
the headphone jacks etc in the same
position<00:02:29.780> but<00:02:29.810> you<00:02:30.050> can<00:02:30.170> see<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.650> differences

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
position but you can see the differences

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
position but you can see the differences
between<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.940> two<00:02:32.080> units<00:02:33.080> there<00:02:34.180> down<00:02:35.180> the

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
between the two units there down the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.600 
between the two units there down the
side<00:02:36.940> quite<00:02:37.940> a<00:02:37.970> bit<00:02:38.150> of<00:02:38.239> difference<00:02:39.610> there

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
side quite a bit of difference there

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.610 
side quite a bit of difference there
we've<00:02:40.880> got<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.060> nice<00:02:41.239> run<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.350> lacquer

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
we've got a nice run of the the lacquer

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.210 
we've got a nice run of the the lacquer
blue<00:02:43.550> or<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.300> sorry<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.750> glacier<00:02:44.989> blue<00:02:45.230> then

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
blue or the sorry the glacier blue then

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.840 
blue or the sorry the glacier blue then
down<00:02:46.519> round<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.260> usb<00:02:48.260> on<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.530> front<00:02:48.980> there's

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
down round the usb on the front there's

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.850 
down round the usb on the front there's
less<00:02:50.269> differences<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:51.019> really<00:02:51.320> speak<00:02:51.650> of

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
less differences to really speak of

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.680 
less differences to really speak of
because<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.550> screen<00:02:52.880> that<00:02:53.269> it's<00:02:53.450> only

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
because of the screen that it's only

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.850 
because of the screen that it's only
really<00:02:53.870> at<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:54.110> top<00:02:54.320> here<00:02:54.560> that<00:02:54.739> we<00:02:54.830> can

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
really at the top here that we can

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.790 
really at the top here that we can
actually<00:02:55.510> see<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.690> difference<00:02:57.170> with<00:02:57.530> the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
actually see the difference with the

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.059 
actually see the difference with the
white<00:02:58.670> framing<00:02:59.360> up<00:02:59.600> here<00:03:00.170> so<00:03:00.650> again<00:03:00.920> the

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
white framing up here so again the

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.220 
white framing up here so again the
speaker<00:03:01.459> grill<00:03:01.670> stands<00:03:02.090> out<00:03:02.360> a<00:03:02.390> bit<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:02.930> you

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
speaker grill stands out a bit and you

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.780 
speaker grill stands out a bit and you
can<00:03:03.380> just<00:03:03.620> see<00:03:03.709> a<00:03:03.890> little<00:03:04.130> bit<00:03:04.280> of<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.489> frame

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
can just see a little bit of the frame

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.520 
can just see a little bit of the frame
actually<00:03:05.060> around<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.800> side<00:03:07.100> here<00:03:07.700> which

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
actually around the side here which

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.650 
actually around the side here which
isn't<00:03:09.530> quite<00:03:09.769> so<00:03:09.890> obvious<00:03:10.100> on<00:03:10.610> the<00:03:11.209> black

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
isn't quite so obvious on the black

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.590 
isn't quite so obvious on the black
model<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:12.319> then<00:03:13.130> if<00:03:13.340> we<00:03:13.489> actually<00:03:13.640> remove<00:03:14.239> the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
model and then if we actually remove the

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:22.539 
model and then if we actually remove the
back<00:03:14.780> covers<00:03:15.640> on<00:03:16.640> these<00:03:16.880> units<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:22.370> there's

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
back covers on these units so there's

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.690 
back covers on these units so there's
the<00:03:22.700> inside<00:03:23.060> of<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.600> black<00:03:23.810> one<00:03:24.430> let's<00:03:25.430> take<00:03:25.640> a

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
the inside of the black one let's take a

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.750 
the inside of the black one let's take a
look<00:03:25.970> inside<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.930> white<00:03:27.140> one<00:03:30.100> well<00:03:31.100> you<00:03:31.549> can

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
look inside the white one well you can

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.330 
look inside the white one well you can
see<00:03:31.970> they're<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.660> same<00:03:32.900> it's<00:03:33.140> just<00:03:33.200> that<00:03:33.739> to

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
see they're the same it's just that to

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.100 
see they're the same it's just that to
the<00:03:34.430> back<00:03:34.610> cover<00:03:34.910> that<00:03:35.180> really<00:03:35.480> stands<00:03:35.780> out<00:03:35.959> as

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
the back cover that really stands out as

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.470 
the back cover that really stands out as
the<00:03:36.140> difference<00:03:36.620> apart<00:03:37.370> from<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.730> cameras

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
the difference apart from the cameras

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.380 
the difference apart from the cameras
around<00:03:38.630> in<00:03:39.049> here<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.620> inside<00:03:40.130> is<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:41.150> same

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
around in here the inside is the same

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.240 
around in here the inside is the same
ones<00:03:41.780> not<00:03:42.049> you<00:03:42.290> know<00:03:42.410> white<00:03:42.799> or<00:03:43.040> blue<00:03:43.220> or

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
ones not you know white or blue or

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.190 
ones not you know white or blue or
anything<00:03:43.609> like<00:03:43.640> that<00:03:43.850> so<00:03:44.600> that's<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:45.019> quick

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
anything like that so that's a quick

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.449 
anything like that so that's a quick
comparison<00:03:45.530> of<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.390> HTC<00:03:47.390> Desire<00:03:47.900> 500
