hello<00:00:04.380> I'm<00:00:04.590> at<00:00:04.710> go<00:00:04.890> from<00:00:05.040> house<00:00:05.160> calm<00:00:05.550> and

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
hello I'm at go from house calm and

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.339 
hello I'm at go from house calm and
you're<00:00:06.180> gonna<00:00:06.300> learn<00:00:06.479> a<00:00:06.540> little<00:00:07.050> bit<00:00:07.170> about

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:07.349 
you're gonna learn a little bit about

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:11.180 
you're gonna learn a little bit about
the<00:00:08.280> 2<00:00:08.430> by<00:00:08.580> 4<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.510> 4<00:00:09.660> by<00:00:09.809> 4<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:10.290> hole<00:00:10.800> patterns

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
the 2 by 4 and a 4 by 4 a hole patterns

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.180 
the 2 by 4 and a 4 by 4 a hole patterns
on<00:00:11.309> snowboards<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.000> by<00:00:12.599> NYX<00:00:12.870> now<00:00:13.099> there's<00:00:14.099> a

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
on snowboards and by NYX now there's a

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.070 
on snowboards and by NYX now there's a
difference<00:00:14.820> between<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.269> 4<00:00:15.480> by<00:00:15.599> 4<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.959> 2

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
difference between the 4 by 4 and the 2

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.390 
difference between the 4 by 4 and the 2
by<00:00:16.230> 4<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.680> course<00:00:16.980> now<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.940> 2<00:00:18.930> by<00:00:19.200> 4<00:00:19.370> has<00:00:20.370> a

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
by 4 of course now the 2 by 4 has a

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.060 
by 4 of course now the 2 by 4 has a
shorter<00:00:21.360> distance<00:00:21.540> between<00:00:21.960> each<00:00:22.500> insert

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
shorter distance between each insert

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.590 
shorter distance between each insert
there's<00:00:23.310> actually<00:00:23.580> 2<00:00:23.880> centimeters<00:00:24.450> of

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
there's actually 2 centimeters of

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.220 
there's actually 2 centimeters of
distance<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.860> between<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.670> 2<00:00:26.820> by<00:00:26.940> 4<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.420> on

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
distance in between the 2 by 4 and on

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.980 
distance in between the 2 by 4 and on
the<00:00:28.710> 4x4<00:00:28.980> there<00:00:29.670> seem<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.850> be<00:00:29.940> a<00:00:30.270> four

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
the 4x4 there seem to be a four

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.990 
the 4x4 there seem to be a four
centimeter<00:00:31.320> difference<00:00:31.800> between<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
centimeter difference between the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.290 
centimeter difference between the
lengthwise<00:00:34.129> this<00:00:35.129> is<00:00:35.280> between<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.670> hardware

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
lengthwise this is between the hardware

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.799 
lengthwise this is between the hardware
what<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.410> gives<00:00:37.739> us<00:00:37.949> kind<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.249> some<00:00:39.210> more

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
what that gives us kind of some more

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.989 
what that gives us kind of some more
stance<00:00:40.350> options<00:00:40.859> with<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.159> 2<00:00:41.280> by<00:00:41.429> 4<00:00:41.460> over<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:41.999 
stance options with the 2 by 4 over the

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:44.779 
stance options with the 2 by 4 over the
4<00:00:42.239> by<00:00:42.390> 4<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:43.019> now<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.559> binding<00:00:44.070> discs<00:00:44.399> have

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
4 by 4 but now that binding discs have

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.410 
4 by 4 but now that binding discs have
that<00:00:44.940> kind<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.390> sliding<00:00:46.730> patterns<00:00:47.730> in

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
that kind of like sliding patterns in

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.540 
that kind of like sliding patterns in
them<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:49.379> pretty<00:00:49.679> much<00:00:49.769> get<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.980> same<00:00:50.069> amount

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
them you pretty much get the same amount

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.569 
them you pretty much get the same amount
of<00:00:50.579> options<00:00:51.079> with<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.109> 4<00:00:52.409> by<00:00:52.559> 4<00:00:52.589> as<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:52.949> do<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> 2

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
of options with a 4 by 4 as you do a 2

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.079 
of options with a 4 by 4 as you do a 2
by<00:00:53.760> 4

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
by 4

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.989 
by 4
but<00:00:54.749> to<00:00:55.019> my<00:00:55.170> four<00:00:55.440> actually<00:00:55.679> has<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.309> think<00:00:56.850> us

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:56.999 
but to my four actually has I think us

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:02.450 
but to my four actually has I think us
12<00:00:57.600> inserts<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:59.280> 4x4<00:00:59.909> has<00:01:00.420> 8<00:01:01.039> now<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.309> is

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
12 inserts the 4x4 has 8 now this is

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.399 
12 inserts the 4x4 has 8 now this is
just<00:01:02.729> a<00:01:02.789> traditional<00:01:03.300> disc<00:01:03.659> that<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.929> find<00:01:04.290> in

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
just a traditional disc that you find in

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.440 
just a traditional disc that you find in
pretty<00:01:04.680> much<00:01:04.710> any<00:01:04.979> snowboard<00:01:05.940> binding

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
pretty much any snowboard binding

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.260 
pretty much any snowboard binding
besides<00:01:07.200> Burton's<00:01:07.710> CST<00:01:08.310> bindings<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:10.219> I'll

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
besides Burton's CST bindings and I'll

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.179 
besides Burton's CST bindings and I'll
just<00:01:12.270> put<00:01:12.450> them<00:01:12.540> over<00:01:12.719> the<00:01:12.930> top<00:01:12.960> inserts<00:01:13.649> just

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
just put them over the top inserts just

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.630 
just put them over the top inserts just
like<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.579> the<00:01:14.729> 2<00:01:14.850> by<00:01:15.000> 4<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.479> course<00:01:16.640> that's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
like this is the 2 by 4 of course that's

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.490 
like this is the 2 by 4 of course that's
gonna<00:01:17.939> be<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> 4<00:01:18.539> by<00:01:18.689> 4<00:01:18.719> you<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.259> have<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
gonna be the 4 by 4 you can have the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.459 
gonna be the 4 by 4 you can have the
sliding<00:01:19.770> system<00:01:20.280> go<00:01:21.060> towards<00:01:21.539> your<00:01:21.869> your<00:01:22.229> nose

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.480 
that both on the 4 by 4 and the 2 by 4
whole<00:01:36.960> patters<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.530> that's<00:01:37.979> pretty<00:01:38.189> much<00:01:38.340> it

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
whole patters and that's pretty much it

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.819 
whole patters and that's pretty much it
it's<00:01:38.609> simple<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.299> make<00:01:39.689> sure<00:01:39.719> we<00:01:39.960> buy<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.409> a
