 A : First, if you have more than one potato , you can cut it with your specialty. 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.770
 I also have two fairies, so if you are too thin, you can do it again. 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.850
 I have a texture. 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.850
 1 2 3 days or so 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.910
 Now, I've got some potatoes . 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:46.620
 What you have to do is get rid of the potatoes. 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.620
 If you remove the water from the potatoes with a towel, the sauce works well. 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:57.120
 Let's prepare the potatoes and we're ready for the game. 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:01:01.800

 I mean, is that enough in the oven 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:23.160
 The next thing I want to say is 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:30.530
 Just spread this out. Not too much to stick to butter rolls. 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.530
 Let's coat it a little. 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:44.420
 Here you are laughing with salt and pepper. 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.420
 A little flower stall should be soldier than Korean stubbornness. 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:53.150

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:00.760

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.760
 Let's put potatoes on, and once again seasoning 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:12.850
 When you're done, you put it next to it and it will be the sauce now. 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.850
 I had a fresh cream and I will cut down a little milk. 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:22.340
 If you do not use this for five minutes, then why not? 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.670
 I want you to boil it together. 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.670
 Run 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.120
 Make me up 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.010
 Ah 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.010
 I put the yolk cheese in the fire and mixed it with the yolk. 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:54.160
