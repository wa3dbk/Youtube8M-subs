00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.259
 just like that to all friends my 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.809
 name giovanni better known as 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.150
 spark and here we are in a new video 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.009
 commented first that nothing girls and 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.990
 guys did an instagram that will be 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.540
 here in the description if you want 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.430
 follow me in case you want to know a little 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.439
 more of my personal life than the photos that 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.150
 go to post a little more personal 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.189
 I would leave that in the description for 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.710
 to come and follow me I would appreciate it 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.519
 a lot so well then I'm very 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.980
 excited first of all nobody says 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:37.860
 that this is true I do not say I do not 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.290
 I come to confirm that this is true of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.390
 you will already be seeing images 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.970
 supposedly filtered in quotes 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.890
 because nobody says that this is true 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.449
 that's why I want to ask you your 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.100
 opinion what do they think with 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.409
 regarding what I'm going to say to 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.659
 bottom continuation will be seeing a 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.820
 series of images that supposedly 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.040
 have leaked in relation to the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.949
 remasterization of gears of war 1 for 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.629
 for the xbox one, well, it turns out that 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.580
 was I in college came to my 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.040
 home pre no me laptop I connect to 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.510
 twitter and I start to realize an 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.200
 series of images that begin 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.079
 to post 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.939
 but the note strange because they had a 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.250
 different lighting a texture 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.939
 different everything was different and it looked 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.280
 with more quality and more detailed so 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.799
 I dedicated myself to investigate more thoroughly and 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.929
 it turns out that images had been leaked 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.380
 with regard to software or for the 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:33.899
 xbox when I asked this one howard 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.789
 because he has I am good for pc yes 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.280
 these images were true or were 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.920
 false because I imagined myself that 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.349
 It could be some way that will improve you 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.060
 the textures or the lighting and he me 

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:47.549
 says no because there are no modes 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.979
 I can do this so people 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.110
 beautiful supposedly are images 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.240
 filtered nobody ensures that this is 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.130
 true no one ensures that this is 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.869
 the course game by one they are going to 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.140
 present at the e3 that is the 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.630
 remastering if this is true I 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.149
 It would bother me a bit because I say this 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.580
 because you only see that the law that you 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.530
 they added an illumination and they improved it 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.709
 the textures that that can make a mod 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.420
 but there is no voice for gears of war pc and 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.069
 It would bother me a little, not because nothing else 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.709
 you see that they added some textures and 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:24.220
 an illumination if this is false I 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:27.580
 I would be glad because there is more you can do 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.130
 more in the remastering because the xbox 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.830
 which has as more power as well 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.750
 say yes no so I would like to know your 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.760
 opinion what do you think as well 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.760
 told me howard could well be a 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.069
 person with a super pc that has 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.190
 the super quality is up there is a software 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.500
 pc so I would like to know your opinion 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.140
 what do you think about 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.040
 these alleged filtered images of 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.610
 kirk software 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.950
 1b for the xbox one and a few minutes left 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.590
 days we are about to arrive in June 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.460
 so that the e3 arrives everything that happens 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.620
 in relation to the three 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.840
 in the channel in fact I intend to make a 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.850
 bible or reaction of the whole of three by 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.720
 if they happen to pass some advance of gears 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.690
 of war one to remastered or some 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.690
 advance of gears of war 4 that thinks about 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.670
 show I also want to think that if 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.370
 this curse of war ultimate edition is 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.020
 true it could be that in this 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.410
 remastering that will sell us 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.960
 they put us the beta so that we 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.960
 we could try are my assumptions 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.400
 I also want to know you are your opinion 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.890
 what do you think about these 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.710
 images if there are some images 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.930
 edited if there are some images of josh 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.230
 howard ps but with a super quality of 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.360
 a super pc or are images of living 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.760
 u remastered software that have been 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.520
 I would like to know your opinion 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.830
 I would like to know what you think I do not say 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.050
 that this is true simply the 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.030
 I saw and I said well it would be a good 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.340
 news and I wanted to know the opinion of 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.870
 you so nice people pretty people 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.180
 closer is knowing what you think of these 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.130
 supposed images in quotation marks that 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.640
 have leaked in relation to gears of war 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.030
 um 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:15.620
 you like the quality you like the 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.930
 textures or you can or think that the 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.180
 company the company in charge of 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.550
 remastering could have done a 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.320
 I work better if this becomes true 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.270
