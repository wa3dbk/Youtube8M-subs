00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:09.919
 10 d the mossos 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:11.570
 show the promotion 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.149
 and decay of a great symbol 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:15.660
 percent mural 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.509
 of all times of the water 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:20.610
 the water av player in a few times 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.090
 neither archaic 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.939
 an impressive role 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.929
 at least four papers is another central is in the story quickly 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.079
 in the waters the federative scope the life to leave the heavy water that did not veto 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.270
 feminine that no one is hiding 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.060
 but also cement the male event also that piece course the 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.990
 liquid 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.210
 the water also feet danger danger of death and deepened of shipwreck 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.240
 so ask for a strong 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.220
 but it is also transit 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.590
 useless of the seven flora species lie relationship 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.970
 unveiling 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.150
 revelation 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.180
 He said that from another area, the water that rivers are for example 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.120
 there have been nine transfer points 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.539
 the most classic example is the script is ugly percent in greece 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:14.880
 kiese the river that crossed the arms tail boat of caronte calderer in that water 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.620
 the day of remembrance 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.390
 DÃ­ez that the past life 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.730
 the transit 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.420
 between being my vote and remembering and no longer know who you were 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.509
 by laser the lagoons stigies the Stygian lagoon 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.640
 they will go where the souls of the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.280
 eb dead that have not been buried was a terrible sin 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.229
 percent good and how we have to be examples of c 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.260
 that point where the uam 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.770
 then he conquered the hundred 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.770
 and another I lie to you is water like 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.700
 that 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.740
 the metaphor of what was done 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.060
 the one that calm down 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.070
 but others are aspect 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.230
 physical that is obvious but also the spiritual 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.240
 as for a few examples but there are many of the environment where you see 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.870
 clearly wants that metaphor of equity to be satisfied 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.900
 with an absolute 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.929
 is always related to water 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.139
 as well as the easiest to do absolute iso 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:12.150
 if so, have 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.179
 those human yearnings 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:16.049
 almost infinite 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.659
 p but I know that it is the roles that the water has had throughout the 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:20.350
 history 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.900
 they are impressive 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.649
 but they could moment would not know where to encrypt them 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:28.769
 the ponte gemplus like the one I mentioned earlier 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:29.950
 from Greece 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.509
 as I had had to dismount 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:35.120
 a little later 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.779
 with one is left with a text da tipa evening of Thessaloniki 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.799
 where it is already seen that the relationship with water 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.549
 it's more structural 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.409
 and especially with the industrial revolution 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.500
 with western modernity 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.509
 in the papers radically change the water is not so valuable anymore 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:54.999
 for its generatrix mystery 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:58.430
 because of the panic it causes when it overflows 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.300
 from tehran 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.900
 by that mediation yes no bohr 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.549
 its driving force 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.730
 because a water that falls from a height 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.380
 can move a huge turbine 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.470
 because water can be a river can be a commercial activity 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.739
 huge why 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.889
 an instrumental relation already by one hundred by the water 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.189
 well, that also has its mythical and has had 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:28.399
 but the corpse has lost that they are all removed from respect 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:32.309
 and I think that this led to the situation a bit prey has opposed 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.789
 today 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:35.789
 that it is necessary to be in all as the expo of zaragoza 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.519
 so that we realize 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.439
 What a man, then, how can we michel spa? 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.210
 alleged bilbao although they are not 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.210
 dominable 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.569
 not so of little value 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.349
 If the water fails 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.729
 all shows to future failure 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:55.299
 I do not think that 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.569
 in that great 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.519
 of western tradition 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.260
 it is very instrumental 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.649
 very desacralizadora very disenchanted of the world 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:06.270
 this is the fourth time in looks only 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.059
 for its productivity 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:09.540
 then I started 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.299
 well you do not have to worry too much about her 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.600
 if they get dirty this poison 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.299
 yes 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.249
 without that artist because he can not visit as before 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:22.879
 and then we find paradoxes 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:25.289
 like the current ones 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.770
 very serious 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.689
 of aspronte of some 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:33.200
 n but I do not want it now the claws because we all have 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.860
 present in the mind not 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.059
 I think that environmentalism 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:38.729
 p 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.170
 can maintain an interesting balance 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.509
 On one side 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.260
 worry about the dictator petrocasas let's say 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.480
 respect it natural as 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.500
 as such natural 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.720
 and at the same time 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.830
 value it 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.770
 patrick instrumentally 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.840
 for being able to manage it sensibly 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.810
 but for me it is sensibly you need 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.240
 respect that 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.870
 because if you do not respect 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.379
 it does not give any value 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.650
 and of course one day you realize that you have lost 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.050
 the good one hundred thousand talks will not have more things will be longer 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.580
 but to the message 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.479
 it could be that
