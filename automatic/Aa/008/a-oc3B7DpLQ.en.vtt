00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:09.450
 we would like to present the rehabilitation 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:12.090
 dogs well this next step here is the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:17.850
 guinea place to go to let 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:20.939
 how do you do it is okay today 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:26.510
 behaved that good, he who dies dies 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:31.140
 goalkeeper will let you put on the table 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:35.750
 is not getting out of the shot again and did 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.750
 province put want to see where you 0 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:50.390
 it seems crazy then you put 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.629
 to a very different thing than someone 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:03.600
 It's for you to do when your mother gets 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:06.090
 she was not a day in that part and nothing 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.320
 When you got it you did it to 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.049
 get up and feel motivated to jump 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.210
 I will leave here and the closest tite 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.200
 Can you correct this? 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.540
 If I want to go through this, come in. 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.210
 exactly the same line of thought 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.970
 if I put guide or while 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.130
 jumping to the foliage all the way around 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.400
 so this will now wait for you 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.009
 A little maybe 30 seconds a minute 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.810
 will wait for it to reach you 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.040
 can have control with it in the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:45.590
 pectoral or drag the world is yours 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.590
 arise and this here 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.079
 the collar on the neck is a way for you 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.149
 have control in the field but the goalkeeper does not 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.700
 It's for me it 's focused on the dog, it's not 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.890
 to walk without relaxation she has the same 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.600
 concept of a rein of the horse 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.209
 You do not walk the schedule, do you? 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.849
 you only touch the rule to direct the 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.180
 horse because the pectoral she is a 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:17.810
 working tool it pull and he 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.610
 his neck was free and he is and will not go 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.590
 listen I deserved anyone with the guide by 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.599
 least with the guide at least I was 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.340
 To do that, I just did it if it was a 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.500
 pectoral head was free bit 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.760
 do what he wanted but he 'll have to 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.060
 learn that there is a limit to 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.910
 walk once thor understood 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.430
 this part of the task is everybody's time 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.849
 be trained on how to walk around 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.280
 correct form does not control soccer 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.560
 him and found the head to control 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.319
 mind that found the body of 90 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.600
 I will not let you check the area that 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.060
 urine in each one because in a 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.690
 healthy walking with other dogs not 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.690
 would do it 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.030
 he pulled to the side that I do not want 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.350
 train out of me we went on sale to 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.320
 close to me, fire 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:15.690
 so you can get it here as you think 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:19.470
 You do not have to look all over for him. 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.450
 can stay a little longer can stay longer 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.690
 It seems like he's feeding on it. 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.730
 Do not you answer the head? 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.340
 then they go through other dogs that 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.590
 are trapped in their homes and 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.080
 react to any aggressive style by 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.100
 Carol is gentle but firm and 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.980
 assertive 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.050
 so it's worth every time your dog 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.420
 from madame with you can do exactly 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.959
 The moment the farm is watching 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.000
 there is relaxation between the guide between 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.850
 she is a dog, she is not there 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.140
 pulling is pressed and is now 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:58.050
 her side is different from before 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.220
 because it's the idea here is that the partner 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.400
 Be good to both of you. 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:07.170
 for you to your mother but it would be good 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:10.650
 also for the top carol had already given the 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:13.170
 if before was never ever holding 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.959
 very firm in the guide and with it always 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.900
 in front of us running and wanting 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.820
 how do you feel now in 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.700
 relationship we learned this afternoon 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.710
 It's a lot of joy, how old can we be? 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.979
 walk with him so he sees that he is 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.560
 enjoying the 100's and the people together 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:35.669
 taking advantage of it well within 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:38.120
 house went well and when we talk about 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.050
 tour 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.580
 personally I thought we would have a 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.979
 big challenge 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.860
 When I saw him putting it here I realized 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:50.160
 that there was a lot of shaking of the lathe 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.830
 and this excitement when putting guide already 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.130
 could be the announcement of achieving a 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.960
 ride then we made here step to 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.710
 step of how to put shape guide 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.910
 correct to wait for the geek to calm down and 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.840
 more incredible is that these things 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.249
 happened 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.609
 the Carol 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:10.989
 itu had much patience as answered 

00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:13.629
 these stimuli 

00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:17.399
 he was calm he was calm and when 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:21.279
 he entered that state of relaxation 

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:24.489
 is that the proposal but the tone behaved 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:27.339
 well because he has already begun to learn 

00:05:24.489 --> 00:05:29.559
 in the home how to behave and 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:32.649
 then during the whole tour then 

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:35.589
 so the only suggestion I have for 

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:38.469
 Geez, Victor, they have to repeat everything. 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:41.139
 was made today during their lives with 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:44.469
 geek for that geek to become that dog that 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:46.899
 did not appear so calm and submissive today 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.799
 if you continue in this toada and in that 

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:50.289
 footprint 

00:05:47.799 --> 00:05:52.449
 you will have this and if this mentality 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:55.149
 that this state of mind much more often 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:56.829
 than the aggressive part which gives much 

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:59.619
 hope for us to understand that he 

00:05:56.829 --> 00:06:02.110
 It is quieter than he is aggressive 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:03.729
 is aggressive and at some points to the 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.739
 our work from today is 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:10.749
 remove the responsibility so that it 

00:06:05.739 --> 00:06:13.869
 always remain being the dog calm 

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:16.539
 this same friend, right? 

00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:19.360
 the company then yours, since today 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:21.039
 They learn how to care for as tÃ³ 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.239
 tell him what he can and can not 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:27.879
 what is the limit and when can it do 

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:30.129
 It was a wonder if I'm very happy. 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:32.549
 I wanted to thank you for your enjoyment now. 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:36.249
 to thank for class in the year already 

00:06:32.549 --> 00:06:38.589
 ended up thrilled again because the 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:41.569
 makes our best friend is my best 

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:44.539
 best friend of the rite 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:47.389
 and the way he was and his tendency 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:50.360
 to become increasingly aggressive 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:51.409
 in his instability with other 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.300
 people 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:54.619
 It makes us very sad and very sad. 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.479
 worried 

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:59.270
