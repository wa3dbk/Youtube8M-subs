in<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.860> guy<00:00:14.009> says<00:00:14.219> probably<00:00:14.490> top<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.699> the<00:00:14.759> title

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:15.029 
in a guy says probably top of the title

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:16.850 
in a guy says probably top of the title
this<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.449> best<00:00:15.750> possible<00:00:16.020> class<00:00:16.500> setup

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
this is the best possible class setup

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.589 
this is the best possible class setup
obviously<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.369> my<00:00:17.490> own<00:00:17.610> opinion<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.180> changes

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:18.599 
obviously in my own opinion it changes

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.749 
obviously in my own opinion it changes
it<00:00:18.689> varies<00:00:18.990> within<00:00:19.200> each<00:00:19.680> individual<00:00:20.550> person

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:20.759 
it varies within each individual person

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.279 
it varies within each individual person
i'm<00:00:21.060> not<00:00:21.240> going<00:00:21.419> to<00:00:21.449> pull<00:00:21.630> my<00:00:21.750> hair<00:00:21.930> out<00:00:21.960> about

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
i'm not going to pull my hair out about

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.019 
i'm not going to pull my hair out about
it<00:00:22.439> but<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:22.650> isn't<00:00:22.949> this<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> way<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.910> is

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
it but this isn't this is a way this is

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.150 
it but this isn't this is a way this is
the<00:00:24.060> way<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.210> tell<00:00:24.509> you<00:00:25.050> guys<00:00:25.259> my<00:00:25.679> personal

guys will take inspiration from it and

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.710 
guys will take inspiration from it and
maybe<00:00:29.369> use<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.759> as<00:00:29.849> your<00:00:29.970> own<00:00:30.060> class<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:30.570> guys

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
this is basically the class setup as you

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.490 
this is basically the class setup as you
can<00:00:33.269> probably<00:00:33.420> tell<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.720> the<00:00:33.809> screen<00:00:34.110> i<00:00:34.140> have

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500

you know call of duty games a lot of

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:55.880 
you know call of duty games a lot of
competitive<00:00:54.750> people<00:00:54.869> always<00:00:55.260> stick<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.680> sort

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
competitive people always stick to sort

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.859 
competitive people always stick to sort
of<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> cage<00:00:56.430> onra<00:00:56.909> of<00:00:57.059> weapons<00:00:57.479> so<00:00:57.780> you

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:57.869 
of the a cage onra of weapons so you

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:59.509 
of the a cage onra of weapons so you
know<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.170> don't<00:00:58.530> see<00:00:58.710> why<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.189> any<00:00:59.309> different

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
know I don't see why it's any different

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.820 
know I don't see why it's any different
now<00:00:59.790> it's<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.750> such<00:01:00.869> a<00:01:00.900> great<00:01:01.019> gun<00:01:01.439> so<00:01:01.680> as<00:01:01.739> you

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
now it's just such a great gun so as you

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.920 
now it's just such a great gun so as you
can<00:01:01.920> probably<00:01:02.070> see<00:01:02.330> my<00:01:03.330> class<00:01:03.540> adopts<00:01:03.839> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
can probably see my class adopts a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.630 
can probably see my class adopts a
little<00:01:04.110> bit<00:01:04.229> different<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.129> bit<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.400> mix

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
little bit different it's a bit of a mix

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.219 
little bit different it's a bit of a mix
up<00:01:05.850> some<00:01:06.090> people<00:01:06.360> aren't<00:01:06.659> probably<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> hundred

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
up some people aren't probably a hundred

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.200 
up some people aren't probably a hundred
percent<00:01:07.439> sure<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:08.159> why<00:01:08.610> I'm<00:01:08.759> missing<00:01:09.030> some

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
percent sure on why I'm missing some

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.370 
percent sure on why I'm missing some
things<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:09.630> that's<00:01:09.780> just<00:01:09.930> how<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.229> to

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
things but that's just how I like to

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.810 
things but that's just how I like to
roll<00:01:10.680> obviously<00:01:11.040> I've<00:01:11.100> got<00:01:11.220> no<00:01:11.340> score<00:01:11.549> streaks

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
roll obviously I've got no score streaks

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.760 
roll obviously I've got no score streaks
because<00:01:12.230> call<00:01:13.230> of<00:01:13.290> duty<00:01:13.440> advanced<00:01:13.680> warfare

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
because call of duty advanced warfare

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.290 
because call of duty advanced warfare
school<00:01:14.160> streets<00:01:14.430> aren't<00:01:14.640> really<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.120> best

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
school streets aren't really the best

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.090 
school streets aren't really the best
unfortunately<00:01:15.690> unless<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.380> put<00:01:16.620> the<00:01:16.830> last

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
unfortunately unless you put the last

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.670 
unfortunately unless you put the last
one<00:01:17.670> or<00:01:17.790> two<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.000> which<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:19.080> you're<00:01:19.200> managed<00:01:19.500> to

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
one or two on which if you're managed to

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.260 
one or two on which if you're managed to
get<00:01:19.800> too<00:01:20.010> sweet<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.610> know<00:01:20.640> you'll<00:01:20.940> get<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.120> few

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
get too sweet you know you'll get a few

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.400 
get too sweet you know you'll get a few
kills<00:01:21.510> off<00:01:21.660> that<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:21.930> all<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.080> other<00:01:22.230> ones

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
kills off that but all the other ones

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.540 
kills off that but all the other ones
you<00:01:22.560> know<00:01:22.650> you're<00:01:22.800> lucky<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.160> get<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.370> kill

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
you know you're lucky if you get to kill

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.010 
you know you're lucky if you get to kill
off<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:23.880> I'm<00:01:24.090> not<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.300> big<00:01:24.450> fan<00:01:24.480> of<00:01:24.659> using<00:01:24.840> them

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
off so I'm not a big fan of using them

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.800 
off so I'm not a big fan of using them
I'd<00:01:25.170> rather<00:01:25.350> use<00:01:25.620> them<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:26.220> my<00:01:26.820> actual<00:01:27.120> gun<00:01:27.390> and

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
I'd rather use them on my actual gun and

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
I'd rather use them on my actual gun and
