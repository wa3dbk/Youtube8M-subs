simulation<00:00:39.500> so<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:40.770> will<00:00:40.860> just<00:00:41.010> go<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
simulation so we will just go to the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.940 
simulation so we will just go to the
download<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.090> install<00:00:42.809> look<00:00:43.200> for<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.590> latest

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
in this case is a J's 4.1 click on it

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.779 
in this case is a J's 4.1 click on it
and<00:00:48.270> you'll<00:00:48.480> find<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.020> will<00:00:49.140> pop<00:00:49.350> up<00:00:49.500> the

just gonna briefly go through the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.809 
just gonna briefly go through the

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
variables are involved this is the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.030 
variables are involved this is the
initialization<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:06.060> evolution<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.799> means

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
initialization the evolution that means

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.910 
initialization the evolution that means
the<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:09.180> equations<00:03:09.989> our<00:03:10.170> company<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.739> not<00:03:10.890> a

the the equations our company is not a

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.309 
the the equations our company is not a
fixed<00:03:11.280> relationships<00:03:12.019> it<00:03:13.019> looks<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.290> bit

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
fixed relationships it looks a bit

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.530 
fixed relationships it looks a bit
complicated<00:03:13.650> now<00:03:14.190> but<00:03:14.609> you<00:03:14.940> get<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.239> hang<00:03:15.420> of

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
complicated now but you get the hang of

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.780 
complicated now but you get the hang of
it<00:03:15.660> after<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.989> while<00:03:16.200> these<00:03:16.980> are<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.250> custom

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
it after a while these are the custom

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.170 
it after a while these are the custom
functions<00:03:19.190> so<00:03:20.190> in<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.430> view<00:03:20.640> panel<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.150> can

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
functions so in the view panel you can

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.590 
functions so in the view panel you can
find<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.989> simulation<00:03:22.650> is<00:03:23.069> I<00:03:23.459> mean<00:03:24.450> is

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
find that the simulation is I mean is

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.670 
find that the simulation is I mean is

yourself<00:03:32.720> just<00:03:33.720> gonna<00:03:33.900> expand<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.380> little

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
yourself just gonna expand it a little

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.710 
yourself just gonna expand it a little
bit<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:34.950> I<00:03:35.069> can<00:03:35.100> see<00:03:35.579> further<00:03:36.000> on<00:03:36.269> you<00:03:36.630> know

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
bit and I can see further on you know

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.640 
bit and I can see further on you know
all<00:03:37.019> these<00:03:37.260> sliding<00:03:37.950> control<00:03:39.109> so<00:03:40.139> EGS

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
all these sliding control so EGS

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.490 
all these sliding control so EGS
actually<00:03:41.010> gives<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:42.000> designer<00:03:42.600> la<00:03:42.989> control

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
actually gives the designer la control

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.490 
actually gives the designer la control
over<00:03:43.859> one<00:03:44.069> one<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.579> appear<00:03:44.970> in<00:03:45.060> happened<00:03:45.540> so

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
over one one to appear in happened so

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.650 
over one one to appear in happened so
how<00:03:47.069> do<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.280> get<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:47.609> out<00:03:47.730> ingesting<00:03:48.329> on<00:03:48.480> the

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
how do you get it out ingesting on the

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.710 
how do you get it out ingesting on the
occasion<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.530> save<00:03:49.859> as<00:03:50.069> exporting<00:03:50.819> as<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.060> jar

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
arm which is a lot better because then

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.050 
arm which is a lot better because then
you<00:03:58.410> don't<00:03:58.560> worry<00:03:59.010> about<00:03:59.280> embedding<00:03:59.730> in<00:03:59.850> on

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
you don't worry about embedding in on

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
independently like to share unit so now

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.250 
independently like to share unit so now
you<00:04:05.310> can<00:04:05.549> see<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:05.970> compressed<00:04:06.750> files<00:04:06.989> are
