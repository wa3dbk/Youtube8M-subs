same<00:02:29.959> Springs<00:02:30.410> that<00:02:30.650> come<00:02:30.799> with<00:02:30.950> your<00:02:31.069> loom<00:02:31.340> so

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
same Springs that come with your loom so

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.080 
same Springs that come with your loom so
that's<00:02:32.870> helpful<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.530> know<00:02:34.069> that<00:02:34.099> you'll

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
that's helpful to know that you'll

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.059 
that's helpful to know that you'll
always<00:02:35.299> have<00:02:35.569> a<00:02:35.629> spring<00:02:36.080> for<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.349> bottom<00:02:36.680> that

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
always have a spring for the bottom that

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.559 
always have a spring for the bottom that
you<00:02:37.129> have<00:02:37.370> for<00:02:37.549> the<00:02:37.610> top<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:38.000> can<00:02:38.120> also<00:02:38.150> just

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
you have for the top you can also just

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.030 
you have for the top you can also just
bring<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.900> by<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.319> bottom<00:02:39.680> spring<00:02:39.950> kit

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
bring the by the bottom spring kit

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.400 
bring the by the bottom spring kit
separately<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.730> then<00:02:41.239> buy<00:02:41.510> whatever<00:02:41.780> springs

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
separately and then buy whatever springs

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.100 
separately and then buy whatever springs
you're<00:02:42.709> planning<00:02:43.340> on<00:02:43.459> using<00:02:43.670> on<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.060> bottom

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.110 

one<00:02:48.110> of<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.500> big<00:02:48.709> questions<00:02:48.890> we<00:02:49.549> get<00:02:49.790> about

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
one of the big questions we get about

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.509 
one of the big questions we get about
using<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.599> bottom<00:02:50.870> spring<00:02:51.260> kit<00:02:51.470> is<00:02:51.739> what<00:02:52.400> if

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
using the bottom spring kit is what if

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.150 
using the bottom spring kit is what if
you<00:02:53.049> have<00:02:54.049> a<00:02:54.079> piece<00:02:54.410> that<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:54.739> want<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:54.980> warp

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
you have a piece that you want to warp

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.650 
you have a piece that you want to warp
and<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.400> don't<00:02:55.670> want<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.090> use<00:02:56.209> your<00:02:56.360> bottom

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
and you don't want to use your bottom

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.559 
and you don't want to use your bottom
spring<00:02:56.989> kit<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.739> answer<00:02:58.129> is<00:02:58.370> that<00:02:58.849> you

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
spring kit and the answer is that you

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.119 
spring kit and the answer is that you
just<00:02:59.780> don't<00:02:59.989> have<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.349> put<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.530> spring<00:03:00.739> on<00:03:00.950> there

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
just don't have to put a spring on there

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.789 
just don't have to put a spring on there
you<00:03:01.370> can<00:03:01.549> warp<00:03:01.849> right<00:03:02.540> around<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:03.110> and<00:03:03.260> be<00:03:03.560> fine

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
you can warp right around it and be fine

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.589 
you can warp right around it and be fine
some<00:03:04.459> people<00:03:04.790> have<00:03:04.970> said<00:03:05.209> that<00:03:05.450> they've

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
some people have said that they've

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.509 
some people have said that they've
placed<00:03:06.049> something<00:03:06.560> behind<00:03:07.099> their<00:03:07.280> warp

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
placed something behind their warp

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.100 
placed something behind their warp
threads<00:03:07.790> because<00:03:08.030> they<00:03:08.269> were<00:03:08.329> worried<00:03:08.840> that

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
threads because they were worried that

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.220 
threads because they were worried that
this<00:03:09.739> might<00:03:10.150> hurt<00:03:11.150> their<00:03:11.420> beads<00:03:11.690> if<00:03:12.049> they're

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
this might hurt their beads if they're

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.309 
this might hurt their beads if they're
using<00:03:12.859> beads<00:03:13.209> but<00:03:14.209> we<00:03:14.359> usually<00:03:14.780> don't<00:03:14.900> do<00:03:15.139> this

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
using beads but we usually don't do this

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.800 
using beads but we usually don't do this
and<00:03:15.500> we've<00:03:15.620> never<00:03:15.799> had<00:03:15.920> a<00:03:16.069> problem<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.819> the

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
and we've never had a problem and the

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.780 
and we've never had a problem and the
other<00:03:17.989> question<00:03:18.230> that<00:03:18.650> we<00:03:18.739> get<00:03:18.889> a<00:03:18.950> lot<00:03:19.220> is<00:03:19.250> how

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
other question that we get a lot is how

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.220 
other question that we get a lot is how
do<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:20.000> advance<00:03:20.299> your<00:03:20.540> warp<00:03:20.840> when<00:03:21.049> you're

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
do you advance your warp when you're

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.050 
do you advance your warp when you're
using<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.709> bottom<00:03:21.950> spring<00:03:22.310> kit<00:03:22.489> now<00:03:23.000> the

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
using the bottom spring kit now the

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.970 
using the bottom spring kit now the
bottom<00:03:23.389> spring<00:03:23.690> kit<00:03:23.840> is<00:03:24.019> very<00:03:24.290> useful<00:03:24.829> for

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
bottom spring kit is very useful for

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.250 
bottom spring kit is very useful for
warping<00:03:25.819> and<00:03:25.970> for<00:03:26.209> weaving<00:03:26.569> your<00:03:26.690> first<00:03:26.959> row

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
warping and for weaving your first row

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.949 
warping and for weaving your first row
as<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.560> said<00:03:27.889> before<00:03:28.150> but<00:03:29.150> you<00:03:29.569> don't<00:03:29.750> really

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
as I said before but you don't really

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.559 
as I said before but you don't really
need<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:30.440> after<00:03:31.190> you've<00:03:31.940> started<00:03:32.299> your

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
need it after you've started your

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.629 
need it after you've started your
weaving<00:03:32.989> and<00:03:33.560> so<00:03:33.709> what<00:03:33.889> you<00:03:34.010> can<00:03:34.220> do<00:03:34.430> is<00:03:35.019> simply

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
weaving and so what you can do is simply

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:41.050 
weaving and so what you can do is simply
unhook<00:03:37.810> your<00:03:38.810> spring<00:03:39.290> from<00:03:40.160> each<00:03:40.370> side<00:03:40.730> and

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
unhook your spring from each side and

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.409 
unhook your spring from each side and
just<00:03:41.150> pull<00:03:41.780> it<00:03:42.230> up<00:03:42.349> behind<00:03:43.310> your<00:03:43.760> warp<00:03:44.060> threads

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
just pull it up behind your warp threads

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.629 
just pull it up behind your warp threads
and<00:03:44.840> then<00:03:45.590> you<00:03:45.739> can<00:03:45.919> advance<00:03:46.190> your<00:03:46.459> weaving

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
and then you can advance your weaving

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:51.370 
and then you can advance your weaving
once<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.150> spring<00:03:47.389> is<00:03:47.540> removed<00:03:48.519> and<00:03:50.380> that's

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
once the spring is removed and that's

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.770 
once the spring is removed and that's
that<00:03:51.739> that's<00:03:52.099> all<00:03:52.340> about<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:53.060> bottom<00:03:53.359> spring

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
that that's all about the bottom spring

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.409 
that that's all about the bottom spring
kit<00:03:54.079> so<00:03:54.980> let<00:03:55.220> me<00:03:55.340> know<00:03:55.489> if<00:03:55.669> you<00:03:55.819> ever<00:03:55.849> have<00:03:56.209> any

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
kit so let me know if you ever have any

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.270 
kit so let me know if you ever have any
questions<00:03:56.900> about<00:03:57.049> it<00:03:57.319> and<00:03:57.470> we'll<00:03:57.709> be<00:03:57.859> sure<00:03:58.130> to
