00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
see actually what you have to do is you

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.149 
see actually what you have to do is you
just<00:00:38.570> have<00:00:38.809> to<00:00:39.049> start<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:40.250> lab<00:00:40.460> you're

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.159 
just have to start and the lab you're

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:45.850 
just have to start and the lab you're
there<00:00:43.159> you<00:00:43.489> run<00:00:43.729> around<00:00:43.940> until<00:00:44.600> he<00:00:45.140> hits<00:00:45.559> a

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
there you run around until he hits a

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.860 
there you run around until he hits a
bottom<00:00:46.460> obstacle<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:47.150> you<00:00:47.210> have<00:00:47.420> to<00:00:47.570> repeat

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
bottom obstacle and you have to repeat

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.590 
bottom obstacle and you have to repeat
it<00:00:47.930> three<00:00:48.260> times<00:00:48.710> I<00:00:49.070> actually<00:00:49.549> already<00:00:50.089> got

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
it three times I actually already got

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.840 
it three times I actually already got
this<00:00:50.839> achievement<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:51.530> this<00:00:51.739> is<00:00:51.890> why<00:00:52.549> it<00:00:52.610> will

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
this achievement so this is why it will

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.410 
this achievement so this is why it will
not<00:00:53.119> pop<00:00:53.479> up<00:00:53.690> but<00:00:54.580> there's<00:00:55.580> our<00:00:55.699> first<00:00:56.089> death

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
not pop up but there's our first death

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.340 
not pop up but there's our first death
no<00:00:57.350> I<00:00:57.379> will<00:00:57.769> do<00:00:58.100> this<00:00:58.280> again<00:00:59.049> play<00:01:00.049> it<00:01:00.110> again

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
no I will do this again play it again

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.130 
no I will do this again play it again
and<00:01:01.040> run<00:01:01.400> again<00:01:01.729> you<00:01:02.150> see<00:01:02.330> I'm<00:01:02.510> not<00:01:02.720> doing

and run again you see I'm not doing
anything<00:01:03.379> this<00:01:03.680> is<00:01:03.830> just<00:01:04.189> the<00:01:04.339> magic<00:01:04.850> trick

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
anything this is just the magic trick

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.420 
anything this is just the magic trick
that<00:01:05.720> has<00:01:05.810> to<00:01:05.960> do<00:01:06.110> you<00:01:06.290> just<00:01:06.650> run<00:01:06.950> into<00:01:07.130> the

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
that has to do you just run into the

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.910 
that has to do you just run into the
obstacle<00:01:07.760> three<00:01:08.270> times<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:08.960> then<00:01:09.560> it<00:01:09.740> should

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
obstacle three times and then it should

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.330 
obstacle three times and then it should
pop<00:01:10.310> out<00:01:10.520> some<00:01:11.000> people<00:01:11.450> seem<00:01:12.050> to<00:01:12.080> have<00:01:12.710> any

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
pop out some people seem to have any

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.640 
pop out some people seem to have any
problem<00:01:13.790> in<00:01:13.910> getting<00:01:14.270> this<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:14.630> they<00:01:15.410> have<00:01:15.620> to

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
problem in getting this and they have to

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.820 
problem in getting this and they have to
repeat<00:01:16.100> it<00:01:16.130> more<00:01:17.060> than<00:01:17.540> three<00:01:18.020> times<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:18.620> just

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
repeat it more than three times so just

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.340 
repeat it more than three times so just
do<00:01:19.430> it<00:01:19.550> until<00:01:19.730> it<00:01:20.030> pops<00:01:20.300> up<00:01:20.510> it<00:01:20.690> should<00:01:20.840> do<00:01:21.080> on

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
do it until it pops up it should do on

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.710 
do it until it pops up it should do on
the<00:01:21.500> third<00:01:21.740> or<00:01:22.040> fourth<00:01:22.400> try<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:25.390> then<00:01:26.390> that's

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
the third or fourth try and then that's

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.260 
the third or fourth try and then that's
it<00:01:27.050> okay<00:01:27.470> it's<00:01:27.650> a<00:01:27.740> pretty<00:01:28.040> easy<00:01:28.280> cheap<00:01:28.760> man<00:01:28.970> and

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
it okay it's a pretty easy cheap man and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.050 
it okay it's a pretty easy cheap man and
I<00:01:29.720> will<00:01:29.900> do<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.170> fourth<00:01:30.470> one<00:01:30.770> even<00:01:31.730> if<00:01:31.850> you

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
I will do the fourth one even if you

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.750 
I will do the fourth one even if you
maybe<00:01:32.540> don't<00:01:32.930> I<00:01:33.620> don't<00:01:33.710> know<00:01:34.010> why<00:01:34.220> this<00:01:34.280> is<00:01:34.730> so

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
maybe don't I don't know why this is so

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.980 
maybe don't I don't know why this is so
maybe<00:01:35.570> if<00:01:35.930> there<00:01:36.620> are<00:01:36.650> some<00:01:37.990> interactions

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
maybe if there are some interactions

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.870 
maybe if there are some interactions
with<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.320> scientists<00:01:39.950> you<00:01:40.040> won't<00:01:40.280> get<00:01:40.550> it<00:01:40.730> or

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
with the scientists you won't get it or

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.700 
with the scientists you won't get it or
something<00:01:41.210> like<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:41.510> you<00:01:41.780> just<00:01:41.990> have<00:01:42.230> to<00:01:42.470> run

don't jump in the air or you will not
get<00:01:45.530> it<00:01:45.740> okay<00:01:46.250> that<00:01:46.820> actually<00:01:48.490> so<00:01:49.490> let's<00:01:49.729> just

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
get it okay that actually so let's just

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.320 
get it okay that actually so let's just
have<00:01:50.450> a<00:01:50.479> view<00:01:51.200> on<00:01:51.229> it<00:01:51.500> again<00:01:51.830> it's<00:01:52.790> good<00:01:53.060> work

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
have a view on it again it's good work

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.130 
have a view on it again it's good work
woody<00:01:53.930> here<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.300> run<00:01:56.300> into<00:01:56.510> the<00:01:56.780> bottom

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
woody here and run into the bottom

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.170 
woody here and run into the bottom
obstacle<00:01:57.740> three<00:01:57.979> times<00:01:58.310> in<00:01:58.580> a<00:01:58.670> row<00:01:58.700> without

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
obstacle three times in a row without

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.360 
obstacle three times in a row without
leaving<00:01:59.690> the<00:01:59.930> floor<00:02:00.140> it's<00:02:00.320> pretty<00:02:00.620> easy<00:02:00.710> but

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
leaving the floor it's pretty easy but

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.030 
leaving the floor it's pretty easy but
you<00:02:01.820> won't<00:02:02.000> think<00:02:02.240> that

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
you won't think that

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.970 
you won't think that
