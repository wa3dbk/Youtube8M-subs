are all of the recipes grout is by far
the<00:00:19.050> most<00:00:19.350> important<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.580> taken<00:00:20.939> by

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
the most important that is taken by

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.630 
the most important that is taken by
using<00:00:21.600> sand<00:00:21.990> gravel<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.800> clay<00:00:22.830> it's<00:00:23.490> a

using sand gravel and clay it's a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.009 
using sand gravel and clay it's a
shapeless<00:00:23.970> recipe<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.720> works<00:00:24.869> pretty

shapeless recipe but that works pretty

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.490 
shapeless recipe but that works pretty

casting table and casting basin I'm not

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.529 
casting table and casting basin I'm not
entirely<00:00:50.309> sure<00:00:50.489> what<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> casting<00:00:51.120> basin<00:00:51.420> is

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
entirely sure what the casting basin is

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.920 
entirely sure what the casting basin is
even<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.350> requires<00:00:53.090> it<00:00:54.090> doesn't<00:00:54.510> require

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
even for it requires it doesn't require

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.880 
even for it requires it doesn't require
a<00:00:55.050> casting<00:00:55.590> basin<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.190> function<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.620> anyone

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
a casting basin to function so if anyone

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.590 
a casting basin to function so if anyone
finds<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.219> out<00:00:59.280> then<00:00:59.640> feel<00:00:59.820> free<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.180> tell<00:01:00.570> me

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
finds that out then feel free to tell me

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.889 
finds that out then feel free to tell me
so<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:01.440> add<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.039> another<00:01:02.190> video

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
so I can add that on to another video

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.240 
so I can add that on to another video
this<00:01:03.899> year<00:01:04.110> bricks<00:01:04.409> here<00:01:05.010> are<00:01:05.159> made<00:01:05.760> by<00:01:07.250> making

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
this year bricks here are made by making

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.270 
this year bricks here are made by making
a<00:01:08.340> square<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:09.110> individual<00:01:10.110> seared<00:01:10.380> bricks<00:01:10.619> it

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
a square of individual seared bricks it

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.830 
a square of individual seared bricks it
costs<00:01:11.670> quite<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.909> lot<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.689> my

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
costs quite a lot and so my

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.730 
costs quite a lot and so my
recommendations<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:14.490> building<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.450> r2<00:01:15.750> 64

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
recommendations for building this r2 64

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.640 
recommendations for building this r2 64
stacks<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.400> seared<00:01:17.970> bricks<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:19.259> will<00:01:19.500> give

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
stacks of seared bricks that will give

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.880 
stacks of seared bricks that will give
you<00:01:19.799> enough<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.369> build<00:01:20.640> your<00:01:21.470> seared<00:01:22.470> bricks

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
you enough to build your seared bricks

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.830 
you enough to build your seared bricks
and<00:01:24.020> your<00:01:25.020> smeltery<00:01:25.860> equipment<00:01:26.689> you<00:01:27.689> don't

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and your smeltery equipment you don't

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.990 
and your smeltery equipment you don't
need<00:01:28.020> you're<00:01:28.710> going<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.950> need<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> lot<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.460> sand

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
need you're going to need a lot of sand

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.219 
need you're going to need a lot of sand
you're<00:01:30.270> going<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.600> need<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.930> lot<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:33.020> gravel<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
you're going to need a lot of gravel and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.590 
you're going to need a lot of gravel and
you're<00:01:34.380> also<00:01:34.500> going<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.860> need<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.430> lot<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.970> clay

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
you're also going to need a lot of clay

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.870 
you're also going to need a lot of clay
so<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.530> mind<00:01:37.680> through<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.009> couple<00:01:38.250> things<00:01:38.579> of

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
so just mind through a couple things of

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.600 
so just mind through a couple things of
clay<00:01:39.409> probably<00:01:40.409> 10<00:01:40.619> blocks<00:01:40.860> would<00:01:41.280> give<00:01:41.490> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
clay probably 10 blocks would give you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.880 
clay probably 10 blocks would give you
enough<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:43.009> go<00:01:44.009> through<00:01:44.369> just<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.360> be<00:01:45.479> safe

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
enough for it go through just to be safe

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.310 
enough for it go through just to be safe
264<00:01:46.890> stacks<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.369> clay<00:01:47.610> 264<00:01:48.479> stacks<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.960> sand

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
and 264 stacks of gravel will give you

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.830 
and 264 stacks of gravel will give you
more<00:01:53.040> than<00:01:53.100> enough<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.939> build<00:01:54.119> your<00:01:54.360> initial

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
more than enough to build your initial

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.410 
more than enough to build your initial
smeltery<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.680> then<00:01:56.399> any<00:01:56.610> add-ons<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.210> you

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
smeltery and then any add-ons that you

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.560 
smeltery and then any add-ons that you
would<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:58.079> all<00:01:59.240> right<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.450> it

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
would like to have all right that is it

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.280 
would like to have all right that is it
for<00:02:01.310> smelting<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.670> using<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.659> smeltery<00:02:04.079> now

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
for smelting and using the smeltery now

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.100 
for smelting and using the smeltery now
we're<00:02:04.439> going<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.649> get<00:02:04.799> into<00:02:05.390> some<00:02:06.390> mobs<00:02:06.659> and
