00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.300
 Thursday the game against Germany then give you a go through why 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.660
 does not look like 80 years 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.820
 you stand in such a match soap helped right next to your bed of tension 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.069
 just need it up 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:17.169
 hope for normal times of having everyone work 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.039
 Wilders had the problems begin 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.470
 because you all 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.579
 years of breakfast together 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.859
 I will first take a shower 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.050
 of the well 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.679
 because with EPE 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.650
 years for the rest it is just 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.240
 yes relax 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.830
 Bruges discussion on such a on the last day or is that already grace afternoons 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.920
 we've already figured that out before 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.570
 discussions 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.030
 but on the match day 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.430
 still the last one 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.730
 also discuss 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.580
 Then the closer to the game the holes that you sit in the bus next to you 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.610
 hide 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.550
 also deliver 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.030
 do you have music too 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.310
 the list 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.650
 argon bit porte finnish of course also one 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.860
 another artist sometimes 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.430
 as your favorite song from him 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.060
 little boy 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.230
 where is it from youth moments I have the button that you really like 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.210
 now the breeding sheep constellation will begin 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.800
 as soon as it calmer down 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.200
 he is going to start 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.150
 If you train Stalin Compuserve, walk around on the stadium field 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.260
 I always do it 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.780
 no, I always go outside so sometimes 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.000
 yields the most for the dressing room 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 and when you are put together in the dressing room some music attention turned 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.670
 but I don't think so 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.280
 and the boys who are in the dressing rooms for such a competition 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.480
 taking the word from a peptalk 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.100
 one after the other at that point in the world 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.170
 you are not wearing everyone yet 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.450
 superstition hefty sat first judge suggests first no not working at all 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.729
 I especially ball women than the race out of the car home 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.290
 with the message that the man 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.970
 and then popping the start signal
