00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.779 
I understand he had an alcohol problem
right<00:01:34.420> so<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.890> set<00:01:36.130> there<00:01:36.340> in<00:01:36.430> his<00:01:36.549> garage

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
right so it's set there in his garage

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.440 
right so it's set there in his garage
for<00:01:37.299> years<00:01:37.539> and<00:01:37.899> years<00:01:38.259> and<00:01:38.469> then<00:01:39.460> a<00:01:39.759> gentleman

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
for years and years and then a gentleman

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.660 
for years and years and then a gentleman
found<00:01:40.899> it<00:01:41.140> and<00:01:41.320> bought<00:01:41.590> it<00:01:41.619> that<00:01:42.219> owns<00:01:42.430> it<00:01:42.609> now

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
found it and bought it that owns it now

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.450 
found it and bought it that owns it now
Tom<00:01:43.210> McNeil<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:43.930> he<00:01:44.799> went<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:45.189> put<00:01:45.340> it

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
Tom McNeil and he went and put it

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.410 
Tom McNeil and he went and put it
together<00:01:45.609> and<00:01:46.619> never<00:01:47.619> fired<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.429> car<00:01:48.670> no<00:01:49.090> kids

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
together and never fired the car no kids

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.929 
together and never fired the car no kids
so<00:01:49.600> he<00:01:49.719> probably<00:01:49.929> the<00:01:50.229> only<00:01:50.469> brand-new<00:01:51.100> 62

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
so he probably the only brand-new 62

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.999 
so he probably the only brand-new 62
Corvette<00:01:52.179> fuel<00:01:52.810> injection<00:01:53.350> in<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.530> world<00:01:53.799> I

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
Corvette fuel injection in the world I

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.889 
Corvette fuel injection in the world I
would<00:01:54.340> think<00:01:54.579> and<00:01:54.880> it<00:01:55.270> must<00:01:55.509> get<00:01:55.630> rolled

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
would think and it must get rolled

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.450 
would think and it must get rolled
around<00:01:56.049> on<00:01:56.350> dollies<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:56.920> all<00:01:57.039> because<00:01:57.340> the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
around on dollies and all because the

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.489 
around on dollies and all because the
kilometers<00:01:58.000> not<00:01:58.179> moved<00:01:58.479> not<00:01:58.869> an<00:01:59.109> inch<00:01:59.289> it's

00:01:59.489 --> 00:01:59.499 
kilometers not moved not an inch it's
