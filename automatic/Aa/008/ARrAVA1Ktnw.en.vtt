spike I have the two poles going so

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.510 
spike I have the two poles going so
you're<00:01:34.320> back<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.680> forth<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:36.770> when<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.799> use<00:01:38.100> I

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
the paper I find is a very efficient

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.490 
the paper I find is a very efficient
because<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.439> put<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.520> fish<00:01:53.909> good<00:01:54.500> walk

keeps<00:01:58.740> singing<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.430> singing<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.840> you

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
keeps singing that singing that and you

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
keeps singing that singing that and you
get<00:02:01.079> just<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.560> back<00:02:01.799> real<00:02:02.549> light<00:02:02.880> heavy

according<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.729> what<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.210> wave<00:02:06.390> action<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:07.049> and

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
according to what the wave action is and

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.740 
according to what the wave action is and
then<00:02:08.789> as<00:02:08.940> soon<00:02:09.179> as

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
then as soon as

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.050 
then as soon as

you turn your handle giving your main

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.290 
you turn your handle giving your main
gear<00:02:12.770> so<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.830> don't<00:02:14.100> have<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.340> do<00:02:14.550> anything

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
gear so you don't have to do anything

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.860 
gear so you don't have to do anything
and<00:02:15.600> then<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.980> just<00:02:17.220> set<00:02:17.460> up<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.880> you're

it<00:02:36.330> up<00:02:37.190> I've<00:02:38.190> run<00:02:38.459> my<00:02:38.640> line<00:02:38.880> off<00:02:39.150> stretched<00:02:40.020> out

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
it up I've run my line off stretched out

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.470 
it up I've run my line off stretched out
get<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.560> all<00:02:40.680> wet<00:02:40.920> out<00:02:41.100> then<00:02:41.910> as<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.209> bring<00:02:42.420> it

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
get it all wet out then as I bring it

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.740 
get it all wet out then as I bring it
back<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:43.250> use<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> no<00:02:44.580> stretch<00:02:44.940> line<00:02:45.270> except<00:02:45.660> the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
back I use a no stretch line except the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.850 
back I use a no stretch line except the
first<00:02:45.959> couple<00:02:46.260> feet<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.470> use<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.739> monofilament<00:02:47.310> I

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
first couple feet I use a monofilament I

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.380 
first couple feet I use a monofilament I
started<00:02:49.860> using<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.280> because<00:02:50.430> sometimes<00:02:50.880> the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
started using that because sometimes the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.750 
started using that because sometimes the
sand<00:02:51.750> when<00:02:51.959> you're<00:02:52.080> on<00:02:52.200> sand<00:02:52.590> on<00:02:53.160> sound<00:02:53.520> chilla

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
sand when you're on sand on sound chilla

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.670 
sand when you're on sand on sound chilla
it's<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:53.970> lot<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.209> sand<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.900> gets<00:02:55.050> abrasive

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
it's a lot of sand and it gets abrasive

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.110 
it's a lot of sand and it gets abrasive
so<00:02:56.489> it's<00:02:57.239> easy<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.600> change<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.170> mono<00:02:58.350> film<00:02:59.120> but

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
so it's easy to change the mono film but

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.820 
so it's easy to change the mono film but
you<00:03:00.239> still<00:03:00.480> got<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.780> sensitivity<00:03:01.560> with<00:03:01.709> the

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
you still got the sensitivity with the

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.150 
you still got the sensitivity with the
power<00:03:02.040> throw<00:03:02.430> or<00:03:03.270> spider<00:03:03.780> hit<00:03:04.140> despite<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.860> wire

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
power throw or spider hit despite a wire

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.600 
power throw or spider hit despite a wire
of<00:03:05.430> our<00:03:05.580> like<00:03:06.260> those<00:03:07.260> two<00:03:07.590> about<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.070> best<00:03:08.310> and

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
of our like those two about the best and

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.360 
of our like those two about the best and
they<00:03:08.820> work<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.270> best<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:11.040> got<00:03:11.220> the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
they work the best and you got the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.229 
they work the best and you got the
sensitivity<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.720> as<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.440> reel<00:03:13.680> back<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:15.060> can

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
sensitivity and as you reel back you can

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.170 
sensitivity and as you reel back you can
feel<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.420> little<00:03:15.780> Davies<00:03:16.500> up<00:03:16.739> and<00:03:17.010> down<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.970> you

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
feel a little Davies up and down and you

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.880 
feel a little Davies up and down and you
know<00:03:18.360> this<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.720> little<00:03:19.049> hole<00:03:19.230> here<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.590> little

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
know this a little hole here a little

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.460 
know this a little hole here a little
hole<00:03:20.190> there<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:21.150> then<00:03:21.840> as<00:03:21.959> you<00:03:22.110> come<00:03:22.260> on<00:03:22.440> a

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
hole there and then as you come on a

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.340 
hole there and then as you come on a
beach<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:23.160> look<00:03:23.549> either<00:03:24.299> high<00:03:24.690> or<00:03:24.720> low<00:03:24.959> tight

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
beach you look either high or low tight

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.690 
beach you look either high or low tight
you<00:03:26.100> see<00:03:26.310> little<00:03:26.489> points<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.380> come<00:03:28.380> out<00:03:28.700> you

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
you see little points that come out you

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.720 
you see little points that come out you
could<00:03:29.910> fishy<00:03:30.150> either<00:03:30.450> side<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.930> points

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
could fishy either side of the points

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.949 
could fishy either side of the points
sometimes<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.820> get<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:32.970> nice<00:03:33.180> bowl<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.840> have<00:03:33.930> a

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
sometimes you get a nice bowl you have a

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.740 
sometimes you get a nice bowl you have a
fish<00:03:34.170> in<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.410> bowl<00:03:34.590> sometime<00:03:35.360> but<00:03:36.360> I<00:03:36.450> like<00:03:36.600> the

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
fish in the bowl sometime but I like the

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.800 
fish in the bowl sometime but I like the
points<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.760> if<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:38.940> happen<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.269> hit<00:03:39.450> at<00:03:39.600> low

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
points and if I happen to hit at low

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.449 
points and if I happen to hit at low
tide<00:03:40.110> you<00:03:41.480> see<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.510> little<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:43.200> lot<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.620> sand<00:03:44.070> with

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
tide you see a little a lot of sand with

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.960 
tide you see a little a lot of sand with
shells<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.299> all<00:03:45.420> that<00:03:45.660> that's<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.380> best<00:03:46.650> spot

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
shells and all that that's the best spot

the part of the beach but there's a lot

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.860 
the part of the beach but there's a lot
of<00:03:50.010> way<00:03:50.160> that's<00:03:50.910> where<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.209> water<00:03:51.480> goes<00:03:51.660> up

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
of way that's where the water goes up

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.590 
of way that's where the water goes up
the<00:03:52.079> most<00:03:52.320> you<00:03:53.100> want<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.459> try<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:53.970> find<00:03:54.209> an

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
the most you want to try and find an

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.259 
the most you want to try and find an
outgoing<00:03:55.049> current<00:03:55.769> because<00:03:56.670> as<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.060> waves

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
outgoing current because as the waves

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.300 
outgoing current because as the waves
all<00:03:57.750> bill<00:03:58.140> then<00:03:58.410> at<00:03:58.709> different<00:03:58.980> heights

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
all bill then at different heights

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.430 
all bill then at different heights
different<00:03:59.700> times<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.269> storms<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:00.930> goes<00:04:01.170> in

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
different times and storms it goes in

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.949 
different times and storms it goes in
all<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.310> water<00:04:02.519> that<00:04:02.640> comes<00:04:02.970> in<00:04:03.150> got<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.840> go

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
all that water that comes in got to go

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.310 
all that water that comes in got to go
out<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.910> when<00:04:05.910> it<00:04:05.940> goes<00:04:06.180> out<00:04:06.390> you<00:04:06.600> can<00:04:06.780> see<00:04:06.930> one

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
out and when it goes out you can see one

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.530 
out and when it goes out you can see one
wave<00:04:07.500> they<00:04:07.799> all<00:04:08.010> come<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.760> they<00:04:08.880> join<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.360> that

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
wave they all come and they join in that

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.440 
wave they all come and they join in that
way<00:04:09.720> that's<00:04:10.110> what<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.410> want<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.739> fish<00:04:11.329> try<00:04:12.329> and

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
way that's what you want to fish try and

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.789 
way that's what you want to fish try and
get<00:04:12.570> your<00:04:12.690> bait<00:04:12.870> there<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.230> could<00:04:13.380> get<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.500> long

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
get your bait there you could get a long

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.000 
get your bait there you could get a long
one<00:04:14.160> out<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.420> then<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.989> official<00:04:16.530> short<00:04:16.799> one

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
one out and then the official short one

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.150 
one out and then the official short one
news<00:04:17.579> they<00:04:17.760> they're<00:04:17.940> in
