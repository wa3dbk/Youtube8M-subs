00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 I therefore ask all of you 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.740
 defend that the crime of mistreatment 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.110
 animal follow in the penal code is not 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.809
 remain with those false promises of 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.150
 reform of 14346 as a law of 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.430
 animal protection because there is no 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.560
 that we have to reform by increasing 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.980
 penalties typifying new behaviors in 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.350
 our criminal code does not a general law 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.019
 then if we have to aggiornar all 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.810

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.250
 ask our officials 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.700
 require them to comply with what is 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.210
 current and then just work so

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:07.050
 important to set jurisprudence to have

 violence towards animals is 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.020
 intimately linked with violence 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.019
 towards humans that most of the 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.810
 people who are perverse psychopaths 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.880
 who are in jails for rape by 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.709
 domestic violence for killing 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.870
 their women for having mistreated their 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.480
 children started doing it with the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.019
 animals tell you when they go to 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.480
 prosecutors please take the complaint 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.150
 because if I throw the car today because it 's 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.560
 old man throws it to the mother or 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.420
 daughter 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.819
 understand that they understand 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.000
 officials the seriousness in problems 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.250
 it's not only 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.260
 the animal that is at risk what is it 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.470
 that does move us we are interested 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.530
 but also all the other beings that 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.610
 we make up this society when the other 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.070
 day we rescued another from abuse of a 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.140
 domestic violence aggressor the 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.810
 we rescue noelia but also 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.709
 we rescued another one and from there goes with 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.080
 shame the police station and day 1 I 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.750
 hit and when I went to the vet 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.360
 he said he did not burn himself with a stove and he had 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.920
 burned with boiling water 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.720
 then everything that they see is violated 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.910
 in domestic violence of all those 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.890
 we work the theme of family we 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.379
 that also at risk to animals 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.569
 of families when they detect a case 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.459
 of domestic violence look how 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.680
 are the most resistant animals 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.690
 social people who attend their 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.819
 addresses are going to realize that there 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.490
 mistreatment towards animals and there 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.400
 abuse to the rest of the family 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:00.120
 I do not want to leave without telling you also that 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.730
 there is a lot of regulation that comes to us 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.880
 sell as good that did not have efficacy 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.980
 in the world 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.980
 and bring it here as a novelty 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.790
 festive the dogs law potentially 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:19.530
 dangerous when potentially 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.530
 We are dangerous human beings 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.430
 when this law 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.980
 when this law wanted to get out in 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.260
 england at a short time they were given 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.970
 account that it was inefficient and that it produced a 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.280
 abandonment of breed animals 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.680
 impressive and the shelters of 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.870
 battersea were filled with pit bulls 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.880
 rottweiler and extinct animals that do not 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.560
 they are to blame for being born with that 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.840
 race that are animals on the contrary 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.440
 also and they are our animals of 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.620
 company 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.660
 then please respect the 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.970
 animals and we do not stop them like 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.520
 dangerous the dangerous ones are those 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.750
 that train them to kill the 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:05.110
 dangerous the dangerous ones are those 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.020
 human beings who train them and those 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.930
 are those human beings are criminals 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.510
 I tell you that in me in my career 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.680
 professional I started defending animals 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:20.220
 when we rescued 32 pit bull from fight in 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.139
 a ring in the middle of mendoza mountain 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.760
 I thank Dr. Alfredo Nicked that 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.320
 he is listening to me he is the one who 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.750
 put on this path and I produced the 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.950
 addiction of never being able to 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.950
 and from there I started to walk 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:40.950
 and I started to understand and I said what is the 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.139
 problem that the criminal law and the criminal law 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.350
 because they know what happened to me when the 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:48.480
 oral trial was sentenced to these people 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.150
 to almost the maximum of the pain the 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.130
 Disabling to have animals and 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.880
 also for psychiatric treatments 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.590
 they laughed they laughed in the face because the 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.540
 delinquent does not change for more than what 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.160
 let's increase the penalties I always say that 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.270
 the theft and the address is not going to end 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.240
 in this country because we put it 112 years 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:11.490
 the same thing will happen the same goes 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.090
 to go through the criminal law this does not 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:18.530
 ends with the reform of 14346 it 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:23.810
 ends education with awareness 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.810
 with respect to nonviolence 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:32.220
 that's why it's the style that accompanies us 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.680
 now as I announce them 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.530

 we are only the lawyers here 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:54.330
 we need honest veterinarians to be 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.460
 compromise with your profession and with your 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.980
 vocation 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:01.080
 we need social workers 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.790
 we need scientists that there are already 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.980
 many in the world who understood that 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.020
 you should not experiment with animals that 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.940
 it is not necessary that there are techniques 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.100
 alternatives for that then 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.260
 We need the lobby that we have 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.060
 another side is very big when we 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.640

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:20.130
 fight for our laws sometimes

 We have 15 different scientists 

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.970
 agencies on the other side and the lobbies 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.950
 of the laboratories and the lobbies of the 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.140
 schools so we wanted to train 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.150
 lawyers we wanted to train professionals 

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.670
