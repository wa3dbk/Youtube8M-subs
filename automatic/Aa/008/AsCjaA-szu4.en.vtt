00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
and some more investigation I realize

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.810 
and some more investigation I realize
that<00:00:16.350> he's<00:00:16.470> actually<00:00:16.680> an<00:00:16.920> open<00:00:17.130> D<00:00:17.550> tuning

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
that he's actually an open D tuning

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.279 
that he's actually an open D tuning
which<00:00:18.750> sounds<00:00:19.410> like<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.710> open<00:00:20.220> D<00:00:20.810> then<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:22.109> is

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
which sounds like this open D then a is

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.400 
which sounds like this open D then a is
normal<00:00:22.680> then<00:00:23.430> d<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.789> normal<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:25.140> then<00:00:25.289> you

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
normal then d is normal but then you

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.440 
normal then d is normal but then you
drop<00:00:25.710> your<00:00:25.920> G<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> half<00:00:26.430> step<00:00:26.640> down<00:00:28.670> f-sharp

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
drop your G a half step down f-sharp

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.560 
drop your G a half step down f-sharp

then<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.840> drop<00:00:34.050> your<00:00:34.290> B<00:00:34.559> string<00:00:34.920> down<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.190> whole

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
then you drop your B string down a whole

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.110 
then you drop your B string down a whole
step<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:37.340> hear<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.460> match<00:00:38.610> up<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.879> your<00:00:38.940> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
step to a hear it match up to your a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.720 
step to a hear it match up to your a
string<00:00:39.480> then<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.020> drop<00:00:40.230> your<00:00:40.410> high<00:00:40.559> e<00:00:40.800> down<00:00:41.579> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
D that's called open D tuning now the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.380 
D that's called open D tuning now the
lesson<00:00:46.739> you're<00:00:46.860> about<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.160> see<00:00:47.370> I'm<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:47.760> in

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
lesson you're about to see I'm just in

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.510 
lesson you're about to see I'm just in
regular<00:00:48.570> drop<00:00:48.960> D<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:49.620> totally<00:00:50.129> going<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
regular drop D and it's totally going to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.150 
regular drop D and it's totally going to
work<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.570> benefit<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.050> being<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.680> open<00:00:53.039> G

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
work the benefit of being in this open G

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.790 
work the benefit of being in this open G
tuning<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.760> when<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.149> bar<00:00:54.660> all<00:00:55.020> six<00:00:55.469> strings

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
tuning is when you bar all six strings

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.099 
tuning is when you bar all six strings
you<00:00:55.920> get<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> major<00:00:56.340> chord

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.320 

and<00:00:59.679> so<00:00:59.829> that<00:01:02.429> it's<00:01:03.429> kind<00:01:03.579> of<00:01:03.670> Keith<00:01:03.940> Richards

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
and so that it's kind of Keith Richards

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.749 
and so that it's kind of Keith Richards
kind<00:01:04.509> of<00:01:04.600> thing<00:01:04.780> but<00:01:05.170> what<00:01:05.379> you<00:01:05.470> get<00:01:05.710> is<00:01:06.100> in<00:01:06.340> the

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
kind of thing but what you get is in the

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.760 
kind of thing but what you get is in the
way<00:01:07.149> I<00:01:07.180> taught<00:01:07.570> in<00:01:07.750> I<00:01:07.930> just<00:01:08.140> have<00:01:08.259> you<00:01:08.380> play

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
way I taught in I just have you play

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.590 
way I taught in I just have you play
these<00:01:08.979> top<00:01:09.189> three<00:01:09.490> strings<00:01:09.790> but<00:01:10.240> what<00:01:10.509> you

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
these top three strings but what you

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.570 
these top three strings but what you
could<00:01:10.750> do<00:01:10.960> in<00:01:11.110> this<00:01:11.259> tuning<00:01:11.680> is<00:01:11.830> play<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.430> top

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
could do in this tuning is play the top

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.160 
could do in this tuning is play the top
four<00:01:12.850> strings<00:01:12.970> or<00:01:13.390> even<00:01:13.630> all<00:01:13.720> six<00:01:14.020> strings

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.840 

and<00:01:38.299> I'm<00:01:38.450> not<00:01:38.570> sure<00:01:38.840> guitar<00:01:39.259> -<00:01:39.729> since<00:01:40.729> we

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
and I'm not sure guitar - since we

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.420 
and I'm not sure guitar - since we
haven't<00:01:41.090> even<00:01:41.150> played<00:01:41.360> this<00:01:41.900> top<00:01:42.140> string<00:01:42.439> it

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
haven't even played this top string it

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.830 
haven't even played this top string it
might<00:01:43.610> be<00:01:43.729> in<00:01:43.820> standard<00:01:44.090> tuning<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:44.720> can

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
might be in standard tuning you can

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.359 
might be in standard tuning you can
leave<00:01:45.020> it<00:01:45.140> in<00:01:45.229> standard<00:01:45.590> tuning<00:01:45.770> but<00:01:46.070> we<00:01:46.190> need

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
leave it in standard tuning but we need

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.760 
leave it in standard tuning but we need
drop<00:01:46.580> D<00:01:46.820> for<00:01:47.150> guitar<00:01:47.450> number<00:01:47.720> one<00:01:47.930> alright

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
drop D for guitar number one alright

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.270 
drop D for guitar number one alright
here<00:01:49.040> we<00:01:49.070> go

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
here we go

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:58.149 
here we go
guitar<00:01:49.729> number<00:01:50.180> one<00:01:51.490> chorus<00:01:56.920> so<00:01:57.920> we're<00:01:58.070> going

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
guitar number one chorus so we're going

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:06.639 
guitar number one chorus so we're going
to<00:01:58.280> go<00:01:58.399> we're<00:01:59.390> going<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.539> cover<00:02:05.380> it's<00:02:06.380> a<00:02:06.470> power

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
to go we're going to cover it's a power

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.719 
to go we're going to cover it's a power
chord<00:02:06.890> so<00:02:07.009> we<00:02:07.100> got<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.340> twelfth<00:02:07.640> fret<00:02:07.820> of

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
chord so we got the twelfth fret of

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.809 
chord so we got the twelfth fret of
these<00:02:10.729> top<00:02:10.970> three<00:02:11.180> strings<00:02:11.390> here<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:13.700> just

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
these top three strings here you just

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.650 
these top three strings here you just
match<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.269> words<00:02:16.180> then<00:02:17.180> we're<00:02:17.300> going<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.450> go

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
match the words then we're going to go

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.630 
match the words then we're going to go
down<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.410> where<00:02:18.500> we're<00:02:18.709> barring<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.430> eighth

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
down to where we're barring the eighth

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.430 
down to where we're barring the eighth
fret<00:02:19.970> but<00:02:20.420> we're<00:02:20.510> going<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.690> start<00:02:21.050> with<00:02:21.290> our

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
fret but we're going to start with our
