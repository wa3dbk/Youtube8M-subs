I've ever experienced doing nothing just

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.479 
I've ever experienced doing nothing just

enough<00:02:46.970> for<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.569> guard<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.620> not<00:02:48.860> notice<00:02:49.130> me

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
enough for that guard to not notice me

well the key is with that is always

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.330 
well the key is with that is always
scaling<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:53.870> experience<00:02:54.410> so<00:02:54.739> it<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.160> just

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
scaling that experience so it is just

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.280 
scaling that experience so it is just
long<00:02:55.970> enough<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.239> hold<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.930> narrative

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
said things like hey somebody there and

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.879 
said things like hey somebody there and
that<00:04:14.060> was<00:04:14.180> an<00:04:14.299> idea<00:04:14.540> that<00:04:14.599> we<00:04:14.930> kept<00:04:15.290> because<00:04:15.739> it

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
that was an idea that we kept because it

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.580 
that was an idea that we kept because it
was<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.099> strongest<00:04:16.459> idea<00:04:16.789> I<00:04:16.849> was<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.269> idea

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
was the strongest idea I was the idea

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.069 
was the strongest idea I was the idea
that<00:04:17.769> had<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.040> most<00:04:18.220> legs<00:04:18.430> and<00:04:18.669> that<00:04:18.820> idea

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
that had the most legs and that idea

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.539 
that had the most legs and that idea
permeated<00:04:20.079> through<00:04:20.380> thief<00:04:20.859> in<00:04:21.100> some<00:04:21.400> way

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
permeated through thief in some way

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.520 
permeated through thief in some way
because<00:04:21.790> it<00:04:22.090> became<00:04:22.570> a<00:04:22.630> game<00:04:22.720> about<00:04:23.080> that

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
because it became a game about that

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.040 
because it became a game about that
ambiguity<00:04:24.340> of<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.180> enemy's<00:04:25.480> awareness<00:04:25.930> of

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
ambiguity of the enemy's awareness of

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.969 
ambiguity of the enemy's awareness of
you<00:04:26.139> which<00:04:26.320> is<00:04:26.350> something<00:04:26.560> that<00:04:26.680> hadn't

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
you which is something that hadn't

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
only was that our probably strongest

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.140 
only was that our probably strongest
idea<00:04:31.360> but<00:04:31.720> game<00:04:32.139> designer<00:04:32.530> Dorian<00:04:33.070> heart<00:04:33.340> it

idea but game designer Dorian heart it

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.909 
idea but game designer Dorian heart it
was<00:04:34.270> only<00:04:34.449> when<00:04:34.600> we<00:04:34.750> finally<00:04:35.020> realized<00:04:35.500> that

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
was only when we finally realized that

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.010 
was only when we finally realized that
that<00:04:36.070> wasn't<00:04:36.280> just<00:04:36.610> a<00:04:36.729> good<00:04:37.060> idea<00:04:37.389> but<00:04:37.630> the

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
that wasn't just a good idea but the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.439 
that wasn't just a good idea but the
good<00:04:38.350> idea<00:04:38.710> that<00:04:39.580> thief<00:04:39.880> actually<00:04:40.270> like

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
good idea that thief actually like

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.629 
good idea that thief actually like
became<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:41.050> came<00:04:41.229> it<00:04:41.350> was<00:04:41.500> like<00:04:41.560> only<00:04:42.190> months

lopiccolo<00:04:50.500> coming<00:04:51.040> to<00:04:51.160> me<00:04:51.280> and<00:04:51.430> we<00:04:51.669> already<00:04:51.850> i

lopiccolo coming to me and we already i

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.659 
lopiccolo coming to me and we already i
think<00:04:52.300> my<00:04:52.419> restriction<00:04:52.960> was<00:04:53.200> like<00:04:53.669> 160

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
think my restriction was like 160

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.969 
think my restriction was like 160
polygons<00:04:55.150> or<00:04:55.360> something<00:04:55.720> ridiculous<00:04:56.020> maybe

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
polygons or something ridiculous maybe

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.820 
polygons or something ridiculous maybe
it<00:04:57.100> was<00:04:57.160> like<00:04:57.400> 200<00:04:57.840> you<00:04:58.840> know<00:04:58.960> and<00:04:59.110> then<00:04:59.229> at<00:04:59.530> the

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
it was like 200 you know and then at the

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.710 
it was like 200 you know and then at the
last<00:05:00.010> hour<00:05:00.340> like<00:05:00.610> Greg<00:05:00.910> comes<00:05:01.210> around<00:05:01.540> and

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
last hour like Greg comes around and

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.420 
last hour like Greg comes around and
says<00:05:01.990> they<00:05:02.560> had<00:05:02.740> to<00:05:02.860> be<00:05:02.979> like<00:05:03.130> a<00:05:03.160> hundred

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
says they had to be like a hundred

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.460 
says they had to be like a hundred
polygons<00:05:04.120> and<00:05:05.610> so<00:05:06.610> I'm<00:05:06.729> like<00:05:06.940> just

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
polygons and so I'm like just

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.930 
polygons and so I'm like just
scrutinizing<00:05:08.470> these<00:05:08.620> things<00:05:08.950> and<00:05:09.190> collapsing

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
scrutinizing these things and collapsing

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
maybe they'll do that an agent and they

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.080 
maybe they'll do that an agent and they
forced<00:05:41.380> to<00:05:41.500> meet<00:05:41.590> you<00:05:41.680> I<00:05:41.800> got<00:05:41.919> a<00:05:41.950> yes<00:05:42.190> yes<00:05:42.700> and<00:05:43.060> I

of similarities i think you know in
terms<00:06:32.349> of<00:06:32.499> what<00:06:32.679> we<00:06:32.770> try<00:06:33.009> to<00:06:33.039> do<00:06:33.399> the<00:06:34.210> kind<00:06:34.419> of

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 
terms of what we try to do the kind of

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:35.790 
terms of what we try to do the kind of
games<00:06:34.689> we<00:06:34.869> make<00:06:35.080> and<00:06:35.349> you<00:06:35.439> know<00:06:35.529> that<00:06:35.679> their

games we make and you know that their

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.649 
games we make and you know that their
first<00:06:35.979> person<00:06:36.429> games<00:06:36.460> at<00:06:37.089> their<00:06:37.240> games<00:06:37.479> that

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:37.659 
first person games at their games that

no seriously i think it still is a big
part<00:06:44.589> of<00:06:44.709> our<00:06:44.800> process<00:06:45.129> is<00:06:45.520> trying<00:06:46.149> anything

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:46.449 
part of our process is trying anything

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:48.929

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:48.939 
and being willing to fail which defined

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:51.989 
and being willing to fail which defined
