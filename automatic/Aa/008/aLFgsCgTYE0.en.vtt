00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180
 good afternoon, visitors of my channel 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:08.610
 I apologize for not releasing the video for a long time 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.150
 just the camera was under repair from 13 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.639
 numbers 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.509
 it was friday so i think you 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:21.180
 understand but today wanted to shoot a video 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:24.300
 on the topic of what kind of knife better say well 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.390
 so basically just recently returned 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.070
 from a small tourist but 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.489
 not hike let's say but finding 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.930
 being in very limited conditions 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.030
 I don't have to say that I have my own 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.250
 I will naturally share my opinion today 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.309
 who will have a different opinion 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.320
 please invite someone to comment 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.180
 It will be interesting to subscribe 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.260
 I have a video usually on knives 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.629
 nature's survival and things like that so i 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.789
 I think of all these knives 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.250
 most importantly decide why you need a knife 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.899
 need and in what conditions you will 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.559
 be in the example you have only 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.290
 mara 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:14.159
 and you need to make a pen for example 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:16.020
 for found blade question than from 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.810
 presented here will be easier 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.850
 you can cut a piece of mara but 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.040
 I can immediately say what time it is 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.430
 will leave quite a lot whether it is possible 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.720
 you can make rats but time won't see 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.720
 as much as at sea 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.840
 is it possible to do programs too 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.049
 it is possible and time will also leave a lot but 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:46.250
 all that is most convenient here than 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.250
 it will make it opened to saw 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:59.960
 in this knife in this knife or in this knife 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.670
 but in this knife I can say saw 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.950
 the worst of everything here is because 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.630
 that it is very short but it is very 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.850
 easily compensated because saws 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.280
 removable can be put long good 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.250
 a saw but it must be worn separately therefore 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.300
 say for convenience all the same leatherman 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.920
 a little loses the following you 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:26.930
 get hungry and you stumble upon a can 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:30.980
 Stew's example, by the way, we see 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.830
 signature stew in Ukrainian beaten 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.800
 made from here you see 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:41.750
 Donetsk region city Makeevka street ce 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:44.630
 Konareva 50 and judging by the bank she see 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.240
 I have already walked a little while, although still on time 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.610
 shelf life has not expired found just such a jar 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.450
 do you want to eat 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:03:00.820
 than it is easier to open the password 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.820
 rat magnum or something as simple as 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:11.480
 opener opener or so opened 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:15.350
 that well, also workable and the essence of my 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.590
 reflections such that, in principle, fix 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.959
 very good knife if you have nothing 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.110
 of course he is very good if there is though 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.620
 it would be with you but fixed very conveniently 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:31.459
 clean for example fish or 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.340
 carcass of an animal he is very easy 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.110
 wash nowhere no gaps nothing nothing 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.470
 moving therefore break nothing not 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:42.680
 will be if for example this knife 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:47.269
 you can clean the fish but everywhere 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.730
 slit by clogged mucus smell and then 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.070
 wash will be very difficult to be too 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.959
 could you too be with a rat too 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.090
 there will be a layer behind the novel that is actually 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.540
 any knife that opens it has 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.129
 will not give 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.120
 and so you can't them ok 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:03.439
 to cut without consequences and to cut 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:08.109
 either animal either 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:10.790
 I fish in the rat did over cuts 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:13.129
 thanks to which I can make out a rat 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.890
 using an ordinary swiss knife 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:20.479
 for this it is no longer calm 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:22.850
 fits and unscrews that's why 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:27.320
 which knife to have with you which one 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.979
 Better in principle and rat and magnum well 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.030
 let's say 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:34.220
 comfortable and interesting and more like someone 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.000
 wrote me in PM there or even by 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.280
 my comments are knives for 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.320
 Ponte and I have to agree with him 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.930
 there are basically these knives just convenient 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.800
 when there is an interesting good but they 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.130
 bear more 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.889
 they are no less functional devils and also 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:57.410
 less functional than fix 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:59.810
 so the best knife in my opinion is a fix for 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.070
 animal cutting fish and the like 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.260
 and 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.470
 have some kind of multitool it will either 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.780
 this one or this one this one already depends 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.870
 from the weight that you can bear from 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.880
 any task put in front of you if 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.620
 let's say i know what i have to 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.690
 driving by car then i take with me 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.240
 weather man i take with me 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:23.870
 take extra saws baby then 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.539
 holders and bits and so i know 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.139
 that I have everything I need if I'm 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:31.849
 city maru can even with myself 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:35.240
 don't take but i will take with me a little 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:35.720
 wix he is completely satisfied with me in any 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.220
 the sphere 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.380
 such my thoughts about the knife if 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.479
 there will be questions write in the comments if 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.919
