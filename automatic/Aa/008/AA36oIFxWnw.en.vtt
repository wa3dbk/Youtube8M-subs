00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
airplay now it's not an individual

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.010 
airplay now it's not an individual
program<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> feature<00:01:32.100> built<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.850> iOS<00:01:33.689> you

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
program it is a feature built on iOS you

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.300

how you can hook everything up to your
capture<00:06:09.390> card<00:06:09.570> but<00:06:09.750> it<00:06:09.840> should<00:06:09.990> be<00:06:10.020> pretty

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
capture card but it should be pretty

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.290 
capture card but it should be pretty
basic<00:06:10.440> HDMI<00:06:11.190> directly<00:06:11.640> in<00:06:11.700> your<00:06:11.760> capture<00:06:12.120> card

if you don't have HDMI I believe they

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.110 
if you don't have HDMI I believe they
sell<00:06:15.780> AV<00:06:16.080> versions<00:06:16.650> of<00:06:16.800> these<00:06:16.979> but<00:06:17.790> I<00:06:17.820> wouldn't

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
sell AV versions of these but I wouldn't

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.700 
sell AV versions of these but I wouldn't
