a<00:00:05.450> complete<00:00:06.450> graph<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:06.930> graph<00:00:07.020> in<00:00:07.440> which

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
a complete graph is a graph in which

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.070 
a complete graph is a graph in which
every<00:00:07.919> vertex<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.550> connected<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:09.150> every<00:00:10.050> other

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080

how many routes visit each city once
well<00:00:34.980> if<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.130> start<00:00:35.370> at<00:00:35.460> home<00:00:35.730> which<00:00:36.149> is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
well if we start at home which is

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.630 
well if we start at home which is
Seattle<00:00:36.890> notice<00:00:37.890> how<00:00:38.010> there<00:00:38.190> are<00:00:38.219> four

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
Seattle notice how there are four

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.350 
Seattle notice how there are four
choices<00:00:38.670> or<00:00:39.270> four<00:00:39.570> cities<00:00:39.899> we<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.350> visit<00:00:41.360> la

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
choices or four cities we can visit la

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.400 
choices or four cities we can visit la
Chicago<00:00:43.700> Atlanta<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.910> Dallas<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:46.289> when

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
Chicago Atlanta and Dallas so when

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.319 
Chicago Atlanta and Dallas so when
determining<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.890> number<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.370> routes<00:00:47.579> we're

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
determining the number of routes we're

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.150 
determining the number of routes we're
going<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.539> find<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.809> product<00:00:49.079> or<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.980> first

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
going to find a product or the first

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.110 
going to find a product or the first
factor<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.820> case<00:00:51.059> would<00:00:51.329> be<00:00:51.360> 4<00:00:53.120> notice

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
factor in this case would be 4 notice

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.709 
factor in this case would be 4 notice
once<00:00:54.329> we<00:00:54.510> make<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> selection<00:00:54.960> as<00:00:56.449> an<00:00:57.449> example

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
once we make a selection as an example

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.020 
once we make a selection as an example
let's<00:00:57.989> say<00:00:58.109> LA

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
let's say LA

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.760 
let's say LA
notice<00:01:00.030> how<00:01:00.149> now<00:01:00.420> there<00:01:00.719> are<00:01:00.809> 3<00:01:01.050> choices<00:01:01.260> in

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
notice how now there are 3 choices in

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.359 
notice how now there are 3 choices in
this<00:01:02.160> case<00:01:02.430> Chicago<00:01:03.329> Atlanta<00:01:04.290> or<00:01:04.500> Dallas

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
this case Chicago Atlanta or Dallas

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.730 
this case Chicago Atlanta or Dallas
because<00:01:06.360> there<00:01:06.630> are<00:01:06.689> 3<00:01:06.869> choices<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.500> next

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
because there are 3 choices the next

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.340 
because there are 3 choices the next
factor<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.460> be<00:01:08.580> 3<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.060> not<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.229> say

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
factor is going to be 3 and not just say

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.100 
factor is going to be 3 and not just say
is<00:01:10.470> an<00:01:10.560> example<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:11.100> select<00:01:11.220> Chicago<00:01:11.990> once<00:01:12.990> you

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
is an example we select Chicago once you

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.649 
is an example we select Chicago once you
make<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.320> second<00:01:13.890> selection<00:01:14.540> notice<00:01:15.540> how

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
make that second selection notice how

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.510 
make that second selection notice how
now<00:01:15.900> there<00:01:16.200> are<00:01:16.320> two<00:01:16.530> choices<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.280> case

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
now there are two choices in this case

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.810 
now there are two choices in this case
Atlanta<00:01:18.119> or<00:01:18.330> Dallas<00:01:19.130> which<00:01:20.130> gives<00:01:20.369> us<00:01:20.549> this

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
Atlanta or Dallas which gives us this

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.050 
Atlanta or Dallas which gives us this
factor<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.270> 2<00:01:22.430> after<00:01:23.430> we<00:01:23.520> make<00:01:23.670> our<00:01:23.790> third

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
factor of 2 after we make our third

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.969 
factor of 2 after we make our third
choice<00:01:24.299> let's<00:01:24.869> just<00:01:25.049> say<00:01:25.170> Atlanta<00:01:25.619> as<00:01:25.799> an

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
choice let's just say Atlanta as an

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.450 
choice let's just say Atlanta as an
example<00:01:27.110> notice<00:01:28.110> how<00:01:28.320> there's<00:01:28.650> one<00:01:29.040> remaining

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
example notice how there's one remaining

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.420 
example notice how there's one remaining
choice<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.509> case<00:01:30.570> Dallas<00:01:31.320> which<00:01:32.159> gives

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
choice in this case Dallas which gives

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.270 
choice in this case Dallas which gives
us<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.850> last<00:01:33.090> factor<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.720> 1<00:01:34.009> so<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> total

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
us this last factor of 1 so the total

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.450 
us this last factor of 1 so the total
number<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.670> routes<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.689> equal<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.229> 4<00:01:37.680> times<00:01:37.710> 3

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
number of routes is equal to 4 times 3

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.039 
number of routes is equal to 4 times 3
times<00:01:38.850> 2<00:01:39.060> times<00:01:39.540> 1<00:01:39.750> or<00:01:40.520> 24<00:01:41.520> routes

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
times 2 times 1 or 24 routes

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.230 
times 2 times 1 or 24 routes
another<00:01:43.049> way<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.200> express<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.740> product<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.640> 4

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
another way to express this product is 4

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.139 
another way to express this product is 4
factorial<00:01:45.720> which<00:01:46.710> again<00:01:46.979> means<00:01:47.280> 4<00:01:47.579> times<00:01:47.880> 3

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
factorial which again means 4 times 3

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.380 
factorial which again means 4 times 3
times<00:01:48.180> 2<00:01:48.600> times<00:01:49.049> 1<00:01:49.399> for<00:01:50.399> example<00:01:50.460> 5<00:01:50.970> factorial

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
times 2 times 1 for example 5 factorial

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.499 
times 2 times 1 for example 5 factorial
would<00:01:52.350> be<00:01:52.470> 5<00:01:52.710> times<00:01:52.740> 4<00:01:53.250> times<00:01:53.549> 3<00:01:53.700> times<00:01:54.180> 2<00:01:54.329> times

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
would be 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.490 
would be 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times
1<00:01:56.600> now<00:01:57.600> if<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.719> wanted<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.020> list<00:01:58.259> all<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
1 now if we wanted to list all the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.530 
1 now if we wanted to list all the
routes<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.100> visit<00:01:59.430> each<00:01:59.579> city<00:01:59.880> we<00:02:00.149> could<00:02:00.329> make

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
routes to visit each city we could make

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.440 
routes to visit each city we could make
a<00:02:00.570> tree<00:02:00.810> diagram<00:02:01.159> pictured<00:02:02.159> here<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:03.299> nice

thing<00:02:03.659> about<00:02:03.719> doing<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.350> we<00:02:04.469> can<00:02:04.619> see<00:02:04.829> all

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
thing about doing this is we can see all

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.880 
thing about doing this is we can see all
24<00:02:05.759> routes<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.990> one<00:02:07.170> route<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.469> we<00:02:07.560> use<00:02:07.710> as

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
24 routes the one route that we use as

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.600 
24 routes the one route that we use as
an<00:02:08.009> example<00:02:08.069> was<00:02:09.060> if<00:02:09.239> we<00:02:09.330> start<00:02:09.569> at<00:02:09.690> Seattle

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
an example was if we start at Seattle

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.240 
an example was if we start at Seattle
notice<00:02:11.610> how<00:02:11.760> we<00:02:11.819> have<00:02:12.090> 4<00:02:12.840> choices

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
notice how we have 4 choices

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.940 
notice how we have 4 choices
so<00:02:15.250> if<00:02:15.310> we<00:02:15.430> select<00:02:15.640> for<00:02:15.909> example<00:02:15.939> la<00:02:16.950> notice

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
so if we select for example la notice

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.539 
so if we select for example la notice
how<00:02:18.010> from<00:02:18.219> la<00:02:18.609> there<00:02:19.030> are<00:02:19.209> three<00:02:19.599> choices<00:02:20.549> so

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
how from la there are three choices so

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.959 
how from la there are three choices so
if<00:02:21.609> we<00:02:21.700> select<00:02:21.879> Chicago<00:02:23.640> notice<00:02:24.640> how<00:02:24.760> there

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:24.969 
if we select Chicago notice how there

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:28.559 
if we select Chicago notice how there
are<00:02:25.090> two<00:02:25.120> remaining<00:02:25.569> choices<00:02:27.359> and<00:02:28.359> if<00:02:28.480> we

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
are two remaining choices and if we

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.089 
are two remaining choices and if we
selected<00:02:28.989> Lana<00:02:29.230> notice<00:02:29.650> how<00:02:29.769> there's<00:02:29.950> only

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
selected Lana notice how there's only

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.220 
selected Lana notice how there's only
one<00:02:30.519> choice<00:02:30.730> left<00:02:31.120> which<00:02:31.870> is<00:02:32.079> Dallas<00:02:34.019> so<00:02:35.019> again

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
one choice left which is Dallas so again

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.369 
one choice left which is Dallas so again
that's<00:02:35.349> a<00:02:35.500> tree<00:02:35.709> we<00:02:35.859> can<00:02:36.010> see<00:02:36.159> all<00:02:36.370> 24<00:02:36.969> routes

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
that's a tree we can see all 24 routes

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.209 
that's a tree we can see all 24 routes
we're<00:02:38.379> going<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.560> be<00:02:38.620> more<00:02:38.769> concerned<00:02:39.069> about

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:39.219 
we're going to be more concerned about

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:42.360 
we're going to be more concerned about
circuits<00:02:39.879> so<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.659> form<00:02:40.900> circuits<00:02:41.379> we<00:02:42.010> actually

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
circuits so to form circuits we actually

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.429 
circuits so to form circuits we actually
have<00:02:42.459> to<00:02:42.579> return<00:02:42.909> back<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.389> the<00:02:43.629> home<00:02:44.019> city<00:02:44.349> of

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
have to return back to the home city of

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:47.069 
have to return back to the home city of
Seattle<00:02:45.189> when<00:02:46.030> we<00:02:46.060> convert<00:02:46.480> routes<00:02:46.810> to

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
Seattle when we convert routes to

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.309 
Seattle when we convert routes to
circuits<00:02:47.560> we<00:02:48.489> do<00:02:48.639> have<00:02:48.819> repetition<00:02:49.139> half<00:02:50.139> of

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
circuits we do have repetition half of

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.440 
circuits we do have repetition half of
the<00:02:50.409> circuits<00:02:50.829> will<00:02:51.010> be<00:02:51.040> duplicates<00:02:51.669> in<00:02:51.939> the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
the circuits will be duplicates in the

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.149 
the circuits will be duplicates in the
reverse<00:02:52.750> order<00:02:52.989> so<00:02:53.769> we'll<00:02:53.859> have<00:02:53.919> to<00:02:54.040> divide

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
reverse order so we'll have to divide

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.550 
reverse order so we'll have to divide
the<00:02:54.370> number<00:02:54.579> of<00:02:54.609> routes<00:02:54.819> by<00:02:55.060> two<00:02:55.439> to<00:02:56.439> determine

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
the number of routes by two to determine

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.500 
the number of routes by two to determine
the<00:02:56.859> number<00:02:56.950> of<00:02:57.099> circuits<00:02:57.639> in<00:02:57.879> a<00:02:58.180> complete

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
the number of circuits in a complete

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.770 
the number of circuits in a complete
graph<00:02:59.219> so<00:03:00.219> if<00:03:00.280> we<00:03:00.430> have<00:03:00.549> n<00:03:00.790> vertices<00:03:01.000> in<00:03:01.659> a

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
graph so if we have n vertices in a

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.470 
graph so if we have n vertices in a
complete<00:03:02.169> graph<00:03:02.439> there<00:03:03.340> will<00:03:03.459> be<00:03:03.489> n<00:03:03.849> minus<00:03:03.879> 1

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
complete graph there will be n minus 1

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.520 
complete graph there will be n minus 1

circuits half of these are duplicates in
reverse<00:03:10.900> order<00:03:11.169> so<00:03:12.010> there<00:03:12.159> will<00:03:12.219> be<00:03:12.280> n<00:03:12.579> minus<00:03:12.609> 1

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150

notice<00:03:49.810> how<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:49.989> complete<00:03:50.349> graph<00:03:50.530> is

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
notice how the complete graph is

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.490 
notice how the complete graph is
provided<00:03:51.129> for<00:03:51.310> us<00:03:51.989> notice<00:03:52.989> how<00:03:53.079> as<00:03:53.229> the<00:03:53.319> number

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
provided for us notice how as the number

at<00:03:56.379> a<00:03:56.439> time<00:03:56.650> will<00:03:57.400> be<00:03:57.430> very<00:03:57.549> time<00:03:57.939> consuming<00:03:57.970> so

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
at a time will be very time consuming so

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.809 
at a time will be very time consuming so
the<00:04:00.400> number<00:04:00.639> of<00:04:00.669> routes<00:04:01.769> would<00:04:02.769> be<00:04:02.949> n<00:04:03.280> minus<00:04:03.669> 1

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
the number of routes would be n minus 1

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.599 
the number of routes would be n minus 1
factorial<00:04:04.329> or<00:04:05.319> in<00:04:05.409> this<00:04:05.500> case<00:04:05.739> n<00:04:06.069> is<00:04:06.250> equal<00:04:06.579> to

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
factorial or in this case n is equal to

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:07.469 
factorial or in this case n is equal to
7

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:07.479 
7

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:11.249 
7
well<00:04:08.470> 7<00:04:08.769> minus<00:04:09.069> 1<00:04:09.129> is<00:04:09.280> equal<00:04:09.459> to<00:04:09.759> 6<00:04:10.090> so<00:04:11.019> number

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:11.259 
well 7 minus 1 is equal to 6 so number

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:14.849 
well 7 minus 1 is equal to 6 so number
of<00:04:11.290> routes<00:04:11.530> would<00:04:11.709> be<00:04:11.919> 6<00:04:12.400> factorial<00:04:13.859> which

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
of routes would be 6 factorial which

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.960 
of routes would be 6 factorial which
would<00:04:15.040> be<00:04:15.159> 6<00:04:15.489> times<00:04:15.849> 5<00:04:16.299> times<00:04:16.930> 4<00:04:17.440> times<00:04:17.739> 3<00:04:18.489> times

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
would be 6 times 5 times 4 times 3 times

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.180 
would be 6 times 5 times 4 times 3 times
2<00:04:19.150> times<00:04:19.539> 1

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
2 times 1

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.540 
2 times 1
so<00:04:21.190> by<00:04:21.370> hand<00:04:21.639> 6<00:04:22.000> times<00:04:22.270> 5<00:04:22.510> is<00:04:22.570> 30<00:04:23.010> times<00:04:24.010> 4<00:04:24.430> is

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550
