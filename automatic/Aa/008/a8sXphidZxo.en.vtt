00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
practice by spinning your handlebars

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.049 
practice by spinning your handlebars
just<00:00:33.600> by<00:00:33.719> itself<00:00:34.130> yeah<00:00:35.130> just<00:00:35.280> like<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.489> and

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
just by itself yeah just like that and

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.639 
just by itself yeah just like that and
you're<00:00:36.300> faster<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.079> faster<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.500> faster

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
you're faster and faster and faster

you're faster and faster and faster
they'll<00:00:38.460> get<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.760> hand<00:00:38.940> motions<00:00:39.329> right<00:00:39.510> so

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
they'll get the hand motions right so

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.650 
they'll get the hand motions right so
it'll<00:00:40.110> be<00:00:40.140> easy<00:00:40.350> for<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.649> spin<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.270> ok<00:00:42.270> another

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
it'll be easy for you spin it ok another

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.299 
it'll be easy for you spin it ok another
thing<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.989> practice<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.500> just<00:00:43.770> like<00:00:43.920> jumping

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
over the bottom bit of so you spin it

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.209 
over the bottom bit of so you spin it
and<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:47.430> jump<00:00:47.989> jump<00:00:48.989> once<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.070> get

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
and just jump jump once you get

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.520 
and just jump jump once you get
comfortable<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.300> land<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.660> just

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
comfortable you can just land it just

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.279 
comfortable you can just land it just
like<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.969> ok<00:00:53.969> once<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.719> all<00:00:54.870> comes<00:00:55.110> together

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
like that ok once it all comes together

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.729 
like that ok once it all comes together
you<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:56.690> well<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.899> could<00:00:58.050> try<00:00:58.079> riding<00:00:58.440> a

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
you can just well you could try riding a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.849 
you can just well you could try riding a
bit<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.129> then<00:00:59.820> trying<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.600> because<00:01:01.289> most

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
bit and then trying it because most

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:02.990 
bit and then trying it because most
people<00:01:02.100> find<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.309> easier<00:01:02.399> when<00:01:02.699> you're<00:01:02.789> going

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
people find it easier when you're going

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.240 
people find it easier when you're going
oh<00:01:05.630> well<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.869> was<00:01:06.960> built<00:01:07.850> anyway<00:01:08.850> um<00:01:09.770> well<00:01:10.770> ok

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
oh well that was built anyway um well ok

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.490 
oh well that was built anyway um well ok
so<00:01:11.310> once<00:01:11.850> you're<00:01:12.030> sending<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:13.110> want<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.320> kick
