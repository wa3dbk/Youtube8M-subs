already<00:03:30.480> pretty<00:03:30.660> much<00:03:30.870> down<00:03:31.110> but<00:03:31.410> for<00:03:31.890> me<00:03:32.100> the

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
already pretty much down but for me the

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.490 
already pretty much down but for me the
the<00:03:32.670> dedication<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.750> indie<00:03:33.989> developers

the dedication to the indie developers

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.620 
the dedication to the indie developers
was<00:03:34.800> what<00:03:35.040> did<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.489> for<00:03:35.670> me<00:03:35.730> was<00:03:35.970> what<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.330> felt

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
was what did it for me was what I felt

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.270 
was what did it for me was what I felt
was<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.810> killing<00:03:37.230> blow<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.800> Microsoft

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
was the killing blow to Microsoft

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.250 
was the killing blow to Microsoft
because<00:03:38.580> Microsoft<00:03:39.060> has<00:03:39.150> made<00:03:39.330> really<00:03:39.870> clear

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
because Microsoft has made really clear

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.250 
because Microsoft has made really clear
that<00:03:40.950> they're<00:03:41.130> not<00:03:41.340> going<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.820> be<00:03:42.050> making<00:03:43.050> it

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
that they're not going to be making it

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.650 
that they're not going to be making it
easy<00:03:43.530> for<00:03:43.890> developers<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.550> make<00:03:45.090> games<00:03:45.510> for

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
easy for developers to make games for

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.660 
easy for developers to make games for
