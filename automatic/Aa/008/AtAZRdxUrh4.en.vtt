requests to show you guys how my sanding
block<00:00:05.910> works<00:00:06.950> basically<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.760> just<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:09.599> block

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
block works basically it is just a block

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
block works basically it is just a block
of<00:00:10.320> plywood<00:00:10.940> with<00:00:11.940> two<00:00:13.130> quarter-inch

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
of plywood with two quarter-inch

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.760 
of plywood with two quarter-inch
channels<00:00:14.730> routed<00:00:15.570> into<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.929> on<00:00:16.170> either<00:00:16.410> side

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
channels routed into it on either side

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.370 
channels routed into it on either side
and<00:00:17.010> then<00:00:17.940> there<00:00:18.180> are<00:00:18.210> two<00:00:18.449> quarter-inch<00:00:19.020> rods

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
and then there are two quarter-inch rods

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.140 
and then there are two quarter-inch rods
and<00:00:19.800> there<00:00:19.890> are<00:00:19.980> stainless<00:00:20.250> rods<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.000> just

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
and there are stainless rods that I just

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.060 
and there are stainless rods that I just
had<00:00:21.240> lying<00:00:21.420> around<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.840> case<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.619> fit

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
had lying around in this case that fit

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.380 
had lying around in this case that fit
into<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.789> whole<00:00:23.820> thing<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.210> held

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
into it and the whole thing is held

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.540 
into it and the whole thing is held
together<00:00:24.539> by<00:00:24.769> these<00:00:25.769> rubber<00:00:26.039> bands<00:00:26.430> and

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
together by these rubber bands and

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.320 
together by these rubber bands and
basically<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.930> change<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.349> sandpaper<00:00:28.710> you

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
basically to change the sandpaper you

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.790 
basically to change the sandpaper you
roll<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.480> rods<00:00:30.689> back<00:00:30.929> like<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.560> showed<00:00:31.740> you

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
roll the rods back like I showed you

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.729 
roll the rods back like I showed you
into<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.759> middle

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
into the middle

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.200 
into the middle
lay<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> piece<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.280> sandpaper<00:00:35.489> over<00:00:37.640> the<00:00:38.640> over

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
lay a piece of sandpaper over the over

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.049 
lay a piece of sandpaper over the over
the<00:00:39.300> block<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.719> then<00:00:40.440> roll<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.219> rod<00:00:41.460> into<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the block and then roll the rod into the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.270 
the block and then roll the rod into the
channel<00:00:42.450> like<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.899> which<00:00:43.469> holds<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.129> in

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
channel like that which holds it in

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.670 
channel like that which holds it in
place<00:00:44.610> then<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.629> wrap<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.170> sandpaper<00:00:46.500> around

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
place then you wrap the sandpaper around

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.360 
place then you wrap the sandpaper around
it<00:00:46.980> get<00:00:47.670> some<00:00:47.850> tension<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:49.190> push<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
it get some tension on it push the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.770 
it get some tension on it push the
sandpaper<00:00:50.700> underneath<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.300> rod<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.660> then

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
sandpaper underneath the rod and then

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.080 
sandpaper underneath the rod and then
roll<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.440> other<00:00:52.559> rod<00:00:52.800> into<00:00:53.219> into<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> channel

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
roll the other rod into into the channel

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.660 
roll the other rod into into the channel
so<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.570> ends<00:00:54.780> up<00:00:54.809> being<00:00:54.870> held<00:00:55.230> very<00:00:56.190> tightly<00:00:56.280> in

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
so it ends up being held very tightly in

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.209 
so it ends up being held very tightly in
place<00:00:57.050> but<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.170> still<00:00:58.350> very<00:00:58.530> easy<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.070> check

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
place but it's still very easy to check

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.680 
place but it's still very easy to check
to<00:00:59.579> change<00:01:00.120> much

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
to change much

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.670 
to change much
you're<00:01:00.809> much<00:01:00.930> easier<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.320> change<00:01:01.350> actually

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
you're much easier to change actually

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.219 
you're much easier to change actually
than<00:01:01.949> any<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.430> like<00:01:02.640> lever<00:01:03.120> lock<00:01:03.449> or<00:01:03.719> screw

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.810 
than any of the like lever lock or screw
lock<00:01:04.470> systems<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.070> I've<00:01:05.189> seen<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:05.580> sanding

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
lock systems that I've seen for sanding

lock systems that I've seen for sanding
blocks<00:01:06.110> I<00:01:07.110> came<00:01:07.500> out<00:01:07.619> for<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> design<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.310> came

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
blocks I came out for the design I came

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.980 
blocks I came out for the design I came
up<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.760> design<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.330> while<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.689> was

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.390 

trying<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.200> make<00:01:13.380> another<00:01:13.740> sanding<00:01:14.189> block

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
trying to make another sanding block

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.070 
trying to make another sanding block
with<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> screw<00:01:15.299> clamp<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.840> bunch<00:01:16.020> of

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
with like a screw clamp and a bunch of

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.539 
with like a screw clamp and a bunch of
other<00:01:16.229> stuff<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.530> was<00:01:16.799> really<00:01:17.040> complicated

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
other stuff that was really complicated

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.120 
other stuff that was really complicated
and<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.659> kind<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.009> happened

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
and this just kind of happened

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.210 
and this just kind of happened
and<00:01:20.280> it's<00:01:20.909> worked<00:01:21.180> really<00:01:21.360> well<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:23.070> only

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
and it's worked really well the only

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.410 
and it's worked really well the only
thing<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.520> because<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.880> one's<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.150> made

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
thing is because this one's just made

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.030 
thing is because this one's just made
out<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.659> birch<00:01:24.840> ply<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.170> doesn't<00:01:25.590> really<00:01:25.740> like

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
out of birch ply it doesn't really like

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.160 
out of birch ply it doesn't really like
wet<00:01:26.460> sanding<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.450> kind<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.780> falling<00:01:28.110> apart

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
wet sanding it's kind of falling apart

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.499 
wet sanding it's kind of falling apart
so<00:01:29.100> today<00:01:29.520> I'm<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.820> show<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.030> how<00:01:30.450> to

so today I'm going to show you how to

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.870 
so today I'm going to show you how to
make<00:01:30.720> another<00:01:30.840> one<00:01:31.110> quickly<00:01:31.549> just<00:01:32.549> out<00:01:32.729> of

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
make another one quickly just out of

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.609 
make another one quickly just out of
phenolic<00:01:33.420> or<00:01:33.630> whatever<00:01:34.110> else<00:01:34.320> you've<00:01:34.470> got

lying around like I had plastic or

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.999 
lying around like I had plastic or
something<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.509> doesn't<00:01:37.290> care<00:01:37.439> about<00:01:37.710> water

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
something that doesn't care about water

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.469 
something that doesn't care about water
because<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.490> really<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.939> very<00:01:39.329> useful

anything<00:01:54.630> around<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.259> size<00:01:55.500> will<00:01:55.740> work<00:01:55.920> it

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
anything around that size will work it

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:13.430 
anything around that size will work it
doesn't<00:01:56.340> have<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.549> be<00:01:56.670> perfect

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.300 

and<00:02:14.440> they<00:02:14.590> just<00:02:14.800> sand<00:02:15.100> off<00:02:15.250> this<00:02:15.600> countertop

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
and they just sand off this countertop

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.560 
and they just sand off this countertop
texture<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:18.760> I'm<00:02:18.910> just<00:02:19.060> going<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.210> throw<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.510> on

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
texture so I'm just going to throw it on

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:37.480 
texture so I'm just going to throw it on
the<00:02:19.780> belt<00:02:20.230> sander<00:02:20.410> criminal

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.100 

okay<00:02:38.490> so<00:02:38.850> I've<00:02:38.940> got<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.180> phenolic<00:02:39.510> block<00:02:39.720> sup

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
okay so I've got the phenolic block sup

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.430 
okay so I've got the phenolic block sup
in<00:02:40.320> my<00:02:40.500> milling<00:02:41.070> vise<00:02:41.250> on<00:02:41.550> my<00:02:41.760> milling<00:02:42.000> machine

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
in my milling vise on my milling machine

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.380 
in my milling vise on my milling machine
as<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:44.370> said<00:02:44.580> if<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.880> don't<00:02:44.970> have<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> milling

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
as I said if you don't have a milling

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.430 
as I said if you don't have a milling
machine<00:02:45.420> don't<00:02:45.840> let<00:02:46.050> that<00:02:46.140> put<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.350> off

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
machine don't let that put you off

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.960 
machine don't let that put you off
because<00:02:46.770> you<00:02:47.040> could<00:02:47.160> do<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> same<00:02:47.490> operation

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
because you could do the same operation

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.460 
because you could do the same operation
on<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.090> router<00:02:48.360> table<00:02:48.630> if<00:02:48.960> you<00:02:49.140> know<00:02:49.230> anyone

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
on a router table if you know anyone

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.260 
on a router table if you know anyone
that<00:02:49.500> has<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.680> router<00:02:49.920> table<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.940> could<00:02:51.120> do<00:02:51.180> it

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
that has a router table you could do it

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.630 
that has a router table you could do it
with<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.420> trim<00:02:51.690> router<00:02:51.870> if<00:02:52.170> you've<00:02:52.290> got<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.640> like

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
with a trim router if you've got a like

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.720 
with a trim router if you've got a like
a<00:02:53.760> follower<00:02:54.150> guide<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:56.190> could<00:02:56.400> do<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.640> on<00:02:56.700> a

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
a follower guide you could do it on a

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.340 
a follower guide you could do it on a
table<00:02:57.090> saw<00:02:57.270> you<00:02:57.540> could<00:02:57.690> do<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.870> on<00:02:57.960> all<00:02:58.080> sorts

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
table saw you could do it on all sorts

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.690 
table saw you could do it on all sorts
of<00:02:58.410> different<00:02:58.590> tools<00:02:58.890> if<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.250> if<00:02:59.520> you're

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
of different tools if you if you're

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.070 
of different tools if you if you're
willing<00:02:59.940> to<00:02:59.970> be<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.150> bit<00:03:00.330> ingenious<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.990> could

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
willing to be a bit ingenious you could

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.040 
willing to be a bit ingenious you could
also<00:03:01.230> do<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.500> by<00:03:01.590> hand<00:03:01.620> with<00:03:01.980> files<00:03:02.930> that<00:03:03.930> would

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
also do it by hand with files that would

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.930 
also do it by hand with files that would
probably<00:03:04.200> bit<00:03:04.500> take<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:05.160> while<00:03:05.550> longer<00:03:05.790> than

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
probably bit take a a while longer than

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.600 
probably bit take a a while longer than
I<00:03:06.030> would<00:03:06.090> want<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.420> invest<00:03:06.570> though<00:03:06.930> so<00:03:07.610> now

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
I would want to invest though so now

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.510 
I would want to invest though so now
because<00:03:08.880> we're<00:03:09.570> doing<00:03:10.520> quarter-inch

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
because we're doing quarter-inch

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.210 
because we're doing quarter-inch
channels<00:03:11.970> for<00:03:12.570> quarter-inch<00:03:13.020> rods<00:03:13.320> they<00:03:13.950> need

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
channels for quarter-inch rods they need

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.850 
channels for quarter-inch rods they need
to<00:03:14.340> be<00:03:14.459> half<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:15.060> diameter<00:03:15.510> deep<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.560> they<00:03:16.680> need

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
to be half a diameter deep so they need

00:03:16.860 --> 00:04:02.619 
to be half a diameter deep so they need
to<00:03:16.890> be<00:03:17.010> 1/8<00:03:17.700> deep

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:04.670 

all<00:04:03.629> right<00:04:03.780> so<00:04:03.930> now<00:04:04.049> that<00:04:04.079> we've<00:04:04.260> got<00:04:04.439> the<00:04:04.530> two

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
all right so now that we've got the two

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.470 
all right so now that we've got the two
lengthwise<00:04:05.099> channels<00:04:05.579> done<00:04:05.790> we<00:04:06.030> need<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.359> do

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
lengthwise channels done we need to do

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.649 
lengthwise channels done we need to do
crosswise<00:04:07.200> channels<00:04:07.620> top<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.219> bottom<00:04:08.609> so<00:04:09.540> the

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
crosswise channels top and bottom so the

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.619 
crosswise channels top and bottom so the
underneath<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:10.560> top<00:04:11.129> here<00:04:11.370> so<00:04:11.519> that<00:04:12.329> we

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
underneath and the top here so that we

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.050 
underneath and the top here so that we
can<00:04:12.930> have<00:04:13.349> a<00:04:13.650> place<00:04:13.950> for<00:04:14.159> the<00:04:14.249> rubber<00:04:14.459> bands<00:04:14.879> or

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
can have a place for the rubber bands or

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.789 
can have a place for the rubber bands or
the<00:04:15.180> o-rings<00:04:15.569> to<00:04:15.689> recess<00:04:16.079> into<00:04:16.259> basically

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
the o-rings to recess into basically

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.199 
the o-rings to recess into basically
just<00:04:17.039> stops<00:04:17.190> them<00:04:17.340> from<00:04:17.370> flopping<00:04:17.880> around<00:04:17.970> all

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
just stops them from flopping around all

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:28.340 
just stops them from flopping around all
over

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.780 

alright<00:04:29.350> then<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.680> last<00:04:29.860> step<00:04:30.130> here<00:04:30.430> is<00:04:30.550> just

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
alright then the last step here is just

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.530 
alright then the last step here is just
to<00:04:30.940> round<00:04:31.300> off<00:04:31.630> these<00:04:31.930> sharp<00:04:32.620> corners<00:04:33.240> at<00:04:34.240> the

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
to round off these sharp corners at the

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.810 
to round off these sharp corners at the
edges<00:04:34.930> here<00:04:35.170> where<00:04:35.350> the<00:04:35.550> o-rings<00:04:36.550> or<00:04:36.730> the

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
edges here where the o-rings or the

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.130 
edges here where the o-rings or the
rubber<00:04:36.970> bands<00:04:37.210> around<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:38.380> I'm<00:04:38.470> just<00:04:38.650> using<00:04:38.830> a

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
rubber bands around and I'm just using a

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.060 
rubber bands around and I'm just using a
half<00:04:41.140> round<00:04:41.460> needle<00:04:42.460> file<00:04:43.830> just<00:04:44.830> to<00:04:44.890> take

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
half round needle file just to take

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.470 
half round needle file just to take
those<00:04:45.250> edges<00:04:45.550> off<00:04:45.700> so<00:04:45.880> that<00:04:45.910> we<00:04:46.000> don't<00:04:46.120> end<00:04:46.330> up

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
those edges off so that we don't end up

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:54.480 
those edges off so that we don't end up
cutting<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.080> rubber<00:04:47.320> band<00:04:52.830> okay<00:04:53.830> so<00:04:53.890> now<00:04:54.460> our

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
cutting the rubber band okay so now our

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.180 
cutting the rubber band okay so now our
sanding<00:04:55.060> block<00:04:55.240> is<00:04:55.390> Debee<00:04:55.690> bird<00:04:56.290> and<00:04:56.560> it's

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
sanding block is Debee bird and it's

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.460 
sanding block is Debee bird and it's
ready<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.490> go<00:04:57.550> so<00:04:58.080> basically<00:04:59.080> you<00:04:59.260> just<00:04:59.290> put

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
ready to go so basically you just put

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:05.850 
ready to go so basically you just put
the<00:05:01.080> two<00:05:02.080> rods<00:05:02.380> in<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.340> channels<00:05:04.230> and<00:05:05.230> now<00:05:05.710> I'm

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
the two rods in the channels and now I'm

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.410 
the two rods in the channels and now I'm
using<00:05:06.070> o-rings<00:05:06.550> you<00:05:06.700> can<00:05:06.850> use<00:05:06.970> rubber<00:05:07.090> bands

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
using o-rings you can use rubber bands

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.570 
using o-rings you can use rubber bands
but<00:05:07.690> earrings<00:05:08.110> are<00:05:08.260> stronger<00:05:08.620> a<00:05:08.830> good<00:05:09.340> source

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
but earrings are stronger a good source

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.430 
but earrings are stronger a good source
of<00:05:09.730> the<00:05:09.850> earrings<00:05:10.210> is<00:05:10.450> actually<00:05:10.900> at<00:05:11.140> the

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
of the earrings is actually at the

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.230 
of the earrings is actually at the
dollar<00:05:11.650> store<00:05:11.770> oftentimes<00:05:12.520> they<00:05:12.640> have<00:05:12.850> like<00:05:13.090> a
