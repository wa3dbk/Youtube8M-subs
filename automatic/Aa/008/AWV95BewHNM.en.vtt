00:00:16.908 --> 00:00:21.700
Six years. Ten months. Twenty-one days.

00:00:21.913 --> 00:00:23.183
I can't help it

00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:27.583
I just have to count them out. I always had.

00:00:28.325 --> 00:00:31.901
Day after day, my life has been an achievement

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:34.400
Now, in spite of everything...

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.920
I can say my existence is normal.

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:41.215
Hei bunnykin, you're not still watching TV, are you?

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.900
No Mum!

00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:45.650
Good, because I'm about to come out of the bathroom

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:48.692
and if some bunnykin I know hasn't dressed up yet

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.573
I'm going to be very, very angry.

00:00:52.502 --> 00:00:55.496
I work at the vehicle licensing office, at the window

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.839
meeting costumers' angry looks...

00:00:59.327 --> 00:01:01.649
...confused looks... contemptuous looks

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.923
with the most polite smile.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.360
At least on Friday night I try and have fun...

00:01:08.383 --> 00:01:09.683
...going to the cinema with a friend...

00:01:09.822 --> 00:01:12.144
often we go and see one of those stupid romantic comedies

00:01:12.702 --> 00:01:14.900
where the girl always finds her true love

00:01:15.326 --> 00:01:18.437
and sex always looks clean and innocent.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.900
Mom! I can't find my shoes!

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.640
Under the bed.

00:01:23.127 --> 00:01:25.400
- They're not there!
- Look closer...

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:28.538
...and hurry up: you still have to get your schoolbag ready!

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:31.909
It was so hard at the beginning

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.851
because my neighbours, my colleagues and even my friends

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:39.428
looked at me sideways, spying on my growing belly

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.420
on my ring-less finger

00:01:41.773 --> 00:01:44.050
and most of all, on my silences.

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:47.160
- Hei Mum, look! My car!
- Not right now.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.530
Your aunt is arriving in a few minutes...

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:52.290
Get your schoolbag ready and I'll look for your shoes.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.200
They looked at me like they were the judge, the jury and the executioner

00:01:57.191 --> 00:01:59.270
but those looks aren't hard to withstand anymore

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.720
now that time has made my soul stronger

00:02:01.928 --> 00:02:03.650
and their sight foggy.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.690
Now, not even their pity can touch me.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.030
Mom?

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.700
Yes honey?

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:13.530
Are you angry with me?

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:16.300
No, not at all. Why do you ask me that?

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:19.670
Why you never look at me in my face?

00:02:43.352 --> 00:02:46.300
No,no. I'm not angry. I... I...

00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:50.730
Your aunt. Hurry up, put your jacket on

00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:52.730
and take your schoolbag. C'mon.

00:02:57.233 --> 00:02:58.670
Bye, bunnykin.

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.780
Six years. Ten months. Twenty-one days.

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:25.060
I've seen those eyes coming out slowly, but relentlessly.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.400
The same eyes he had.

00:03:28.446 --> 00:03:30.050
I still haven't been able to withstand them,

00:03:30.367 --> 00:03:31.980
just as it happened with his father.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.470
And sometimes I ask myself, when he'll grow up

00:03:34.761 --> 00:03:36.130
will he have the same hands?

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:37.930
The same beard?

00:03:38.533 --> 00:03:39.670
The same voice?

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.300
I spent the last few years trying to move on

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.450
but those eyes keep getting back and back

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.230
they keep looking at me

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.500
like they did that night!

00:04:00.022 --> 00:04:01.870
Aunt, aunt, stop. There's Mum!

00:04:07.194 --> 00:04:09.030
Mum!

00:04:09.298 --> 00:04:11.930
- You forgot your car.
- My car!

00:04:13.024 --> 00:04:14.950
Remember to be a good boy.

00:04:17.974 --> 00:04:22.990
I told myself he wouldn't have to pay off some other person's faults

00:04:23.084 --> 00:04:24.870
It doesn't matter how hard could it be for me.

00:04:25.708 --> 00:04:28.240
In time I got used to almost everything

00:04:28.303 --> 00:04:32.380
but having those eyes so close is the hardest fight of my entire life.

00:04:32.602 --> 00:04:35.410
Maybe I'll never get used to it, and I won't be able...

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.570
to help counting out the days that pass.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.540
One after the other.
