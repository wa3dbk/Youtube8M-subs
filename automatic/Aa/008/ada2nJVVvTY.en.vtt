00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello people and welcome to 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.450
 sixth episode of recommended and 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.080
 though today in team of the season robert 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.509
 lewandowski polish weapon 91 in total 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.980
 played in 43 like almost 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.570
 always 89 to 90 brings 92 90 header 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.630
 that in its main worth as well much 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.720
 stronger foot three star skills 1 84 very 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.930
 great he did it with me in 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.880
 Twelve play 34 times to hit so that 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.980
 It's a pretty brand 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.739
 but we look at ourselves now first the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.300
 ingame stats on and then of course one 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.540
 few clips just to see if synonymous 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.620
 really so good on the field it and so 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.110
 We're back with you 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.829
 his in games test only 24 years young 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.590
 Of course , he is a native 78 Pole 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.149
 kilo heavy 14 80 large 90 drive 90 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.969
 Sprint speed at a strength 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.230
 of 86 of course looks crazy 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.180
 I'm good at everything so far 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.309
 lewandowskis played that is the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.460
 nun form the one in the form of the man of the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.769
 match and also him in his pace can 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.360
 I made a very clear difference 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.040
 only become much faster 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.890
 as an example of the match on 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.100
 main on the match was good though 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.189
 this one is outstanding from pace it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.509
 does not really feel like w90 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:22.380
 but again that's about the same 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.330
 lewandowski is really very much now 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.070
 become fast and of course with 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.540
 his deadly shots his 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.040
 deadly header and his 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.900
 now also very very good 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.540
 dribbling together that's natural 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.939
 a very nice weapon he has four 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.460
 star weak foot that's for me 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.930
 the biggest joke because there is me 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.850
 just did not differ 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.799
 whether now shoot with left or right 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.600
 The balls always came perfect so mine 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.060
 opinion, it should be a very clear 5 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.439
 star feeble foot because that was 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.030
 outstanding what he did 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.360
 he could shoot with left with right 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.030
 shoot it was shit we come yes 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.610
 to his header 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:04.170
 his header is okay but never no 90 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.250
 So I can not do that at all 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.780
 at most 0 84 84 in order 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.400
 here, for example, you see header 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.230
 but in principle everyone would do that 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.450
 But we can come to this 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.220
 next point this header goal 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.400
 but not everyone can do it 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.750
 even as he is somehow the 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.860
 Magical on this topic offensive 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.959
 play in my opinion 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.490
 they are all perfect, they know 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.930
 somehow all where the ball gets that 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.510
 I've already seen too many with her 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.640
 at suarez at van persie now at 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.310
 lewandowski at ben theke was that 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.840
 also the case so this team on this 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.670
 I really see a player there 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.110
 clear difference alone in it 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.270
 that they are just right right 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.410
 Walks go something like that and that is 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.940
 really great and when we are 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.450
 at his position then we go 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.580
 time on his workplace to the high 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.620
 that means defensively high and 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.040
 more offensive too many of you 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.989
 think 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.209
 it will be determined often 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.230
 be outside of his position and will 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.239
 then probably in midfield 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.470
 but somewhere in the race is actually 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.520
 not the case 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.750
 it is so lewandowski so in 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.730
 the second half he feels already 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.739
 slower than firstly you have to 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.680
 say that he is very very 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.780
 but much is in the extension 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.130
 could you because then replace the same 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.989
 he is finished with an extension 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.410
 that his stamina is completely in the ass 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.450
 but from this position play her running 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.489
 though very much on the field above though 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.830
 if it he plays these deadly bottlenecks 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.090
 is there he is still there anyway 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.250
 only thing that may have bothered me 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.500
 I have him with blaszczykowski and 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.610
 played back in the front 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.130
 she liked this ross and 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.350
 blaszczykowski the second in form and 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.610
 I just noticed 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.049
 often with reus the positions 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.769
 that means reus was in the 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.390
 principle of the mine striker and yes we 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.980
 a topic that the youths fly 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.310
 ran that was not so cool now 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.840
 but still that's actually it 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.280
 It does not happen that often 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.549
 Sometimes, maybe one happens twice 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.400
 in the game times in a two scenes but it 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.019
 It's not so good if you are 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.440
 newest next to then it is 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.739
 It does not matter, but yes you could 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.229
 maybe as a negative 10 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.270
 We also go to his 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.620
 one which you have on his skills 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.240
 The facilities are equipped with three stars 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.770
 maybe not the best for you 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.600
 Scilla I did not care about it in principle 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.010
 I'm actually similar and if 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.510
 makes it a bit wing too, though 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.400
 These are also these simple tricks like 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.740
 roulette or so could lewandowski 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.270
 So theoretically for me that was 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.880
 no problem at the 3 stars 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.500
 Spitz may be for others of you 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.570
 is that a problem that I know yes 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.040
 not we respond to his dribbling 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.620
 his dribbling was also very 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.870
 he can improve now he can 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.510
 Keep the ball really tight on the foot 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.490
 i think very well and dribbling 90 that 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.780
 I definitely feel it and perhaps 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.030
 Also so so so slow 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.740
 slower than 90 if its dribbling 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.260
 Well, then he lays the ball 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.400
 not so far ahead and that can sometimes 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.590
 cause you to think that he is 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.780
 slower is now but we come to 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.850
 His point was actually best 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.150
 that with the shot his conclusions are 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.830
 deadly no matter if from 25 meters to 15 meters and 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.780
 it's not like van persie 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.130
 or suarez the times and happy times 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.199
 a big chance lies the power 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.060
 she makes all of them when her ball 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.430
 he really only needs to play 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.780
 Close he does the things for me 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.470
 That is a very clear one 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.690
 buy recommendation 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.099
 I paid 1.1 million pounds 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.560
 but because I always bought wednesday 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:33.940
 well well now cost from 2000 on 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.289
 the ps3 says very clearly 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.270
 you buy lewandowskis 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:39.099
 absolute to every bundesliga team 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.380
 because he is very strong so if you are 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:43.870
 he can afford you he is one of the 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.800
 I'm the best striker in Europe 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.800
 says zschau skin in
