pattern<00:01:13.799> types<00:01:14.190> all<00:01:14.520> right<00:01:15.090> then<00:01:15.240> let's<00:01:15.420> jump

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
pattern types all right then let's jump

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.230 
pattern types all right then let's jump
right<00:01:15.720> into<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.830> how<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.130> microphones<00:01:17.970> work

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
right into it so how do microphones work

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.620 
right into it so how do microphones work
well<00:01:18.930> microphones<00:01:19.470> are<00:01:19.940> transducers<00:01:20.940> which

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
well microphones are transducers which

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.300 
well microphones are transducers which
is<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> device<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.350> converts<00:01:22.530> energy<00:01:23.100> from

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
is a device that converts energy from

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.969 
is a device that converts energy from
one<00:01:23.490> form<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.790> another<00:01:24.530> microphones<00:01:25.530> convert

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
one form to another microphones convert

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.859 
one form to another microphones convert
acoustic<00:01:26.549> energy<00:01:26.759> or<00:01:27.119> acoustical<00:01:27.570> energy

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
acoustic energy or acoustical energy

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.260 
acoustic energy or acoustical energy
sound<00:01:28.110> waves<00:01:28.350> into<00:01:28.590> electrical<00:01:28.740> energy<00:01:29.520> which

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
sound waves into electrical energy which

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.830 
sound waves into electrical energy which
is<00:01:30.530> you<00:01:31.530> know<00:01:31.649> the<00:01:31.770> audio<00:01:32.039> signal<00:01:32.659> so<00:01:33.659> there

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
is you know the audio signal so there

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.300 
is you know the audio signal so there
are<00:01:33.899> a<00:01:33.930> bunch<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.289> different<00:01:34.619> microphones<00:01:35.130> out

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
are a bunch of different microphones out

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.499 
are a bunch of different microphones out
there<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:35.759> they<00:01:35.850> all<00:01:35.939> have<00:01:36.119> one<00:01:36.299> thing<00:01:36.329> in

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
there but they all have one thing in

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.450 
there but they all have one thing in
common<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:37.079> thin<00:01:37.409> piece<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.680> material<00:01:37.950> called

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
common a thin piece of material called

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.639 
common a thin piece of material called
the<00:01:38.670> diaphragm<00:01:39.270> now<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.840> diaphragm<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.560> be

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
the diaphragm now the diaphragm can be

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:41.870 
the diaphragm now the diaphragm can be
made<00:01:40.799> up<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.979> different<00:01:41.159> materials<00:01:41.430> like

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
made up of different materials like

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.609 
made up of different materials like
paper<00:01:42.149> plastic<00:01:42.780> or<00:01:42.930> aluminum

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
paper plastic or aluminum

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.590 
paper plastic or aluminum
now<00:01:44.039> the<00:01:44.100> diaphragm<00:01:44.609> will<00:01:44.880> vibrate<00:01:45.270> when

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
now the diaphragm will vibrate when

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.539 
now the diaphragm will vibrate when
struck<00:01:45.960> by<00:01:45.990> sound<00:01:46.409> waves<00:01:46.469> when<00:01:47.219> sound<00:01:47.490> waves

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
struck by sound waves when sound waves

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.609 
struck by sound waves when sound waves
strike<00:01:48.119> at<00:01:48.359> microphones<00:01:48.840> diaphragm<00:01:49.350> they

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
strike at microphones diaphragm they

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.810 
strike at microphones diaphragm they
cause<00:01:49.859> it<00:01:50.039> to<00:01:50.159> move<00:01:50.369> within<00:01:50.700> an

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
cause it to move within an

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.090 
cause it to move within an
electromagnetic<00:01:51.810> field<00:01:52.109> which<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:52.950> turn

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
electromagnetic field which in turn

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.069 
electromagnetic field which in turn
creates<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.640> variance<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.270> an<00:01:54.539> electrical

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
creates a variance in an electrical

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.219 
creates a variance in an electrical
current<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.909> signal<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.359> then<00:01:57.570> transmitted

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
current the signal is then transmitted

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.260 
current the signal is then transmitted
to<00:01:58.259> output<00:01:58.799> devices<00:01:59.130> which<00:01:59.520> reproduce<00:02:00.060> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
to output devices which reproduce the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.239 
to output devices which reproduce the
original<00:02:00.719> sound<00:02:00.960> wave<00:02:03.770> all<00:02:04.770> right<00:02:04.950> let's<00:02:05.130> go

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:05.249 
original sound wave all right let's go

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:07.609 
original sound wave all right let's go
ahead<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.640> cover<00:02:05.850> microphone<00:02:06.630> types<00:02:06.960> so

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
ahead and cover microphone types so

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.219 
ahead and cover microphone types so
there<00:02:08.310> are<00:02:08.399> three<00:02:08.640> most<00:02:08.869> commonly<00:02:09.869> used

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
there are three most commonly used

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.990 
there are three most commonly used
microphone<00:02:10.830> types<00:02:11.100> out<00:02:11.280> there<00:02:11.550> I'm<00:02:11.790> gonna

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
microphone types out there I'm gonna

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.720 
microphone types out there I'm gonna
cover<00:02:12.240> ribbon<00:02:12.990> mics<00:02:13.250> dynamic<00:02:14.250> mics<00:02:14.460> and

cover ribbon mics dynamic mics and

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.910 
cover ribbon mics dynamic mics and
condenser<00:02:15.270> mics<00:02:15.480> okay<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:16.470> let's<00:02:16.800> go<00:02:16.890> ahead

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
condenser mics okay so let's go ahead

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.520 
condenser mics okay so let's go ahead
and<00:02:17.100> talk<00:02:17.220> about<00:02:17.250> ribbon<00:02:17.790> mics<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:19.260> ribbon

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
and talk about ribbon mics so ribbon

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.710 
and talk about ribbon mics so ribbon
mics<00:02:19.710> are<00:02:19.950> typically<00:02:20.400> bi-directional<00:02:21.270> which

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
mics are typically bi-directional which

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.940 
mics are typically bi-directional which
we'll<00:02:21.840> get<00:02:21.930> into<00:02:21.990> in<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.319> little<00:02:22.350> bit<00:02:22.680> but

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
we'll get into in a little bit but

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.110 
we'll get into in a little bit but
essentially<00:02:23.250> what<00:02:23.460> this<00:02:23.550> means<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.030> they

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
essentially what this means is that they

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.180 
essentially what this means is that they
pick<00:02:24.300> up<00:02:24.450> sound<00:02:24.930> equally<00:02:25.470> well<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:25.890> either

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
pick up sound equally well on either

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.900 
pick up sound equally well on either
side<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.880> microphone<00:02:28.520> this<00:02:29.520> type<00:02:29.760> of

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
about powering the microphone batteries

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.410 
about powering the microphone batteries
can<00:03:35.680> actually<00:03:36.010> power<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.340> microphone<00:03:36.790> or<00:03:37.210> maybe

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
can actually power a microphone or maybe

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.090 
can actually power a microphone or maybe
the<00:03:37.600> device<00:03:37.870> that<00:03:38.110> it's<00:03:38.260> plugged<00:03:38.500> into<00:03:38.650> can

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
the device that it's plugged into can

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.570 
the device that it's plugged into can
also<00:03:39.250> power<00:03:39.640> it<00:03:39.820> as<00:03:39.940> well<00:03:40.120> now<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:42.220> other<00:03:42.370> type

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
also power it as well now the other type

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.770 
also power it as well now the other type
of<00:03:42.640> power<00:03:42.880> that's<00:03:43.090> out<00:03:43.270> there<00:03:43.480> is<00:03:43.600> something

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
of power that's out there is something

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.780 
of power that's out there is something
called<00:03:44.020> phantom<00:03:44.530> power<00:03:44.709> now<00:03:45.280> this<00:03:45.430> is<00:03:45.520> a<00:03:45.550> power

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
called phantom power now this is a power

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.610 
called phantom power now this is a power
that<00:03:45.850> runs<00:03:46.120> from<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.630> cable<00:03:46.989> hooked<00:03:47.080> up<00:03:47.290> to<00:03:47.590> a

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
that runs from the cable hooked up to a

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.670 
that runs from the cable hooked up to a
power<00:03:48.040> pack<00:03:48.340> just<00:03:48.790> for<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.060> microphone

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
power pack just for the microphone

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.140 
power pack just for the microphone
usually<00:03:50.680> condenser<00:03:51.100> mics<00:03:51.310> would<00:03:51.550> use<00:03:51.760> phantom

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
usually condenser mics would use phantom

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.990 
usually condenser mics would use phantom
power<00:03:52.980> okay<00:03:53.980> guys<00:03:54.100> let's<00:03:54.400> go<00:03:54.489> ahead<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:54.850> cover

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
power okay guys let's go ahead and cover

power okay guys let's go ahead and cover
microphone<00:03:55.630> pattern<00:03:55.989> types<00:03:56.230> so<00:03:56.680> there<00:03:57.100> are

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
microphone pattern types so there are

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.560 
microphone pattern types so there are
actually<00:03:57.280> a<00:03:57.580> few<00:03:57.820> different<00:03:58.180> microphone

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
actually a few different microphone

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.270 
actually a few different microphone
pattern<00:03:58.870> types<00:03:59.050> out<00:03:59.200> there<00:03:59.260> let's<00:03:59.950> go<00:04:00.100> over<00:04:00.250> to

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
pattern types out there let's go over to

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.470 
pattern types out there let's go over to
three<00:04:00.580> most<00:04:00.760> common<00:04:01.090> ones

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
three most common ones

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.060 
three most common ones
well<00:04:02.110> first<00:04:02.290> one<00:04:02.380> we'll<00:04:02.470> talk<00:04:02.620> about<00:04:02.680> is

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
well first one we'll talk about is

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.300 
well first one we'll talk about is
uni-directional<00:04:03.750> pattern<00:04:04.750> type<00:04:04.930> now<00:04:05.769> this<00:04:06.100> is

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
uni-directional pattern type now this is

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.740 
uni-directional pattern type now this is
actually<00:04:06.700> powder<00:04:06.880> type<00:04:07.150> that<00:04:07.330> will<00:04:07.420> pick<00:04:07.600> up

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
actually powder type that will pick up

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.140 
actually powder type that will pick up
sound<00:04:08.019> only<00:04:08.260> in<00:04:08.739> one<00:04:08.950> direction<00:04:09.130> and<00:04:09.730> it's

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
sound only in one direction and it's

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.759 
sound only in one direction and it's
actually<00:04:10.450> really<00:04:10.720> good<00:04:11.080> for<00:04:11.440> recording

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
actually really good for recording

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.310 
actually really good for recording
single<00:04:12.250> voices<00:04:12.700> so<00:04:13.570> the<00:04:13.690> next<00:04:13.900> pattern<00:04:14.170> type

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
single voices so the next pattern type

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.570 
single voices so the next pattern type
we'll<00:04:14.500> talk<00:04:14.620> about<00:04:14.769> is<00:04:15.010> something<00:04:15.370> called

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
we'll talk about is something called

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.030 
we'll talk about is something called
bi-directional<00:04:16.419> and<00:04:16.590> this<00:04:17.590> will<00:04:17.739> actually

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
bi-directional and this will actually

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.099 
bi-directional and this will actually
pick<00:04:18.190> up<00:04:18.250> sound<00:04:18.669> from<00:04:19.180> two<00:04:19.390> places<00:04:19.690> it's

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
pick up sound from two places it's

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.659 
pick up sound from two places it's
actually<00:04:20.380> really<00:04:20.590> great<00:04:20.859> for<00:04:21.100> recording<00:04:21.190> two

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
actually really great for recording two

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.970 
actually really great for recording two
voices<00:04:21.880> at<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.300> same<00:04:22.510> time<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:23.140> the<00:04:23.770> last

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
voices at the same time and the last

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.530 
voices at the same time and the last
pattern<00:04:24.220> type<00:04:24.490> we'll<00:04:24.669> talk<00:04:24.790> about<00:04:24.970> is<00:04:25.270> called

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
pattern type we'll talk about is called

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.960 
pattern type we'll talk about is called
omnidirectional<00:04:26.020> now<00:04:26.919> this<00:04:27.160> picks<00:04:27.490> up<00:04:27.669> sound

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
omnidirectional now this picks up sound

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.750 
omnidirectional now this picks up sound
in<00:04:28.210> all<00:04:28.540> directions

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760
