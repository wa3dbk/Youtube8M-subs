00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.279
 hello vincent good day on the stand 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.079
 of Rivollier and specifically in 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.730
 hate them at Rambouillet Lounge and 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.560
 there is a big novelty so we have 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.369
 heard a lot about who comes from 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.869
 go out that's the victorious b 8.2 then 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.280
 can you introduce it to us 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.170
 yes absolutely 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.020
 so actually I have the huge 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.129
 pleasure to present it since 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.750
 it's a telescope we've been waiting for since 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.520
 long since three years for everything 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.500
 say now 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.770
 our colleagues 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.040
 it was already in the super zoom 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.840
 since for about as many years 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.460
 and was missing only dice in fact to 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.559
 the call on this area there so 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.690
 today we really released a 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.309
 exceptional bezel that surpasses even 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.629
 the super zoom since we can say that we 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.629
 is in hyper sum since the 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.150
 need them and then 2.8 okay on this 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.020
 model there that I hold you are sure of the 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.990
 1 8 14 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.630
 so a model that suits of course 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.979
 for the lookout and the approach 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.090
 especially but that suits everything 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.429
 also 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.600
 on the beat since the 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:26.200
 magnification is enough 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.470
 is quite weak and the width of field 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.619
 and from 23 meters to 100 m power 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.350
 the use of beaten so that's what 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.970
 you can notice right away on 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.630
 this bezel and you have a body 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.030
 pretty important enough and these names you 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.340
 see enough then on the length 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.840
 she and she is actually quite short 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.280
 and the shorter ones since most 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.070
 glasses on the market however 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.780
 she'll be a little bit more a little bit more 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.520
 big the body diameter is actually 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.770
 of 36 mm and not 13 years we find 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.420
 here is wandering 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.060
 in France usually so what is this 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.179
 that will lead this body of 36 mm more 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.540
 of light naturally and a copy of 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.069
 go out more important and that's very 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.560
 important on the super heavy to have 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.390
 a copy of an exit certificate plus 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.610
 more important because we win in 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.170
 comfort and aggression agree on this 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.590
 type of place the atlas did all the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.550
 difference 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.250
 what could be blamed on the super zoom 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.880
 it was precisely a lack of 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.099
 brightness at magnification and this 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.230
 little outlet the molasses the problem and 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.300
 the problem is solved 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.930
 here is generally rather adapted 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.920
 on the approached 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.120
 and look good but someone 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.310
 shoot at the beginning of the season at this 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.810
 closer rocard and then after 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.319
 will be renaming pose 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.799
 problem 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.349
 at the limit it's just a matter of 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:58.870
 zoning question but if our seven 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.609
 allows drivers no problem because 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.639
 even you have a parallax setting 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:07.540
 there that comes series you can put 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:09.400
 at 50 who sees that it is used 50 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.189
 and below what is produced which 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.139
 proves that for the beat she has 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.790
 been designed also for the beat and as 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.730
 we said it's true that a lot of 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.680
 hunters settle at 22.6 mans beaten 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.190
 so an eight is quite in 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.440
 tour in 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.870
 underneath it's quite right 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.940
 totally agree and for the shots from 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.030
 medium and long distance you have 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.470
 the ballistic correction turret 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:39.890
 called asv plus at dice nasa with 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.170
 one-way settings what is 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.360
 today also the same 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.489
 the most important adjustment of the market 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.950
 okay because we're at home 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:52.099
 confreres on average to 60 clique of 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.349
 settings and that's again the 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.790
 body of 36 which allows us so and for 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:01.180
 the gunsmith is a comfort for the 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.769
 ropes and for the hunter it's 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.620
 it's a strong point because it can 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.790
 shoot more precisely further 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.079
 available from when available 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.379
 from July of this year 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:14.709
 July and version rails of a necklace 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.650
 the schoolboy will also come out of blazer 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.030
 or w 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.040
 in July also an agreement 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.290
 can show up here on all types 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.509
 there and kehl at what rate on the horizon 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.430
 then would touch her for that first 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:29.820
 model at 2650 euros 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.120
 very well thank you thank you for passing 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.120
 the sem
