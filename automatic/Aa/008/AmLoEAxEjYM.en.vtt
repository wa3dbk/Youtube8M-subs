now<00:02:49.510> though<00:02:49.810> have<00:02:49.989> some<00:02:50.230> hope<00:02:50.380> on<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.650> horizon

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
now though have some hope on the horizon

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.830 
now though have some hope on the horizon
with<00:02:51.310> targeted<00:02:51.850> therapies<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.570> these

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
with targeted therapies and these

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.560 
with targeted therapies and these
targeted<00:02:53.380> mutations<00:02:53.950> have<00:02:54.100> resulted<00:02:54.640> in<00:02:54.880> the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
targeted mutations have resulted in the

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.570 
targeted mutations have resulted in the
development<00:02:56.050> of<00:02:56.170> drugs<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:56.650> work<00:02:57.010> against

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
development of drugs that work against

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.820 
development of drugs that work against
the<00:02:57.760> mutations<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.959> try<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.260> treat<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.650> cancer

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
the mutations to try to treat the cancer

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.370 
the mutations to try to treat the cancer
so<00:03:00.340> I'd<00:03:00.430> say<00:03:00.640> for<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:00.940> first<00:03:01.150> time<00:03:01.480> in<00:03:01.780> about<00:03:02.350> a

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
so I'd say for the first time in about a

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.560 
so I'd say for the first time in about a
decade<00:03:02.860> or<00:03:03.190> many<00:03:03.520> decades<00:03:03.910> we<00:03:04.150> actually<00:03:04.450> have

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
decade or many decades we actually have

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.300 
decade or many decades we actually have
some<00:03:04.780> hope<00:03:04.959> on<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.290> horizon<00:03:05.770> for<00:03:05.950> treating

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
some hope on the horizon for treating

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.880 
some hope on the horizon for treating
advanced<00:03:06.730> melanoma
