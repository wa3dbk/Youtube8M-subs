silver paint pen here and and then I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.550 
silver paint pen here and and then I
like<00:02:49.320> many<00:02:49.560> people<00:02:49.770> use<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.550> gel<00:02:51.480> pen<00:02:52.230> from

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
like many people use the gel pen from

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.130 
like many people use the gel pen from
Pilate<00:02:53.040> for<00:02:53.190> taking<00:02:53.910> all<00:02:54.030> my<00:02:54.180> notes<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.720> wish

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
Pilate for taking all my notes I wish

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.810 
Pilate for taking all my notes I wish
they<00:02:55.290> would<00:02:55.440> do<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:55.680> more<00:02:55.830> colors<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.430> think

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
they would do it in more colors I think

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.850 
they would do it in more colors I think
only<00:02:57.030> for<00:02:57.300> right<00:02:57.450> now<00:02:57.510> blue<00:02:58.260> red<00:02:58.530> black<00:02:58.799> and

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
only for right now blue red black and

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.840 
only for right now blue red black and
green<00:03:00.470> but<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.560> reason<00:03:01.799> I<00:03:01.860> like<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.310> gel<00:03:02.580> pen

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
green but the reason I like the gel pen

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.640 
green but the reason I like the gel pen
is<00:03:03.000> because<00:03:03.299> it<00:03:03.450> doesn't<00:03:03.780> leak<00:03:03.959> on<00:03:04.170> airplanes

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
is because it doesn't leak on airplanes

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.100 
is because it doesn't leak on airplanes
and<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.640> pens<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.120> have<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.690> liquid<00:03:06.989> ink

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
and the pens that have the liquid ink

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.310 
and the pens that have the liquid ink
leaked<00:03:07.410> too<00:03:07.650> much<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.549> a<00:03:08.790> few<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.660> my<00:03:09.720> pointers

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
leaked too much so a few of my pointers

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.400 
leaked too much so a few of my pointers
