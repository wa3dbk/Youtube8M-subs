00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 there girls today we will talk 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.690
 a box that made a lot of talk 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.400
 of her in recent months not necessarily 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.190
 for the right reasons but in any case 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.620
 we heard a lot about it 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.089
 in video on blogs everyone 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.619
 was a little raging right 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.320
 however, I will tell you about 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.220
 the sweety box art to hand over the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.980
 things in their context 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.869
 when the boxing switch was launched I 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.789
 received at home so without giving the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.779
 coordinates or anything 1 I 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.250
 believe it was the first or the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.109
 second copy I do not know anymore from 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.540
 the ebook suite and it has been such a 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.370
 carnage 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.360
 it was so bad that I did not 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.579
 not even talked 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.600
 I talked about it nowhere in fact everything 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.040
 I did not even say he had 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.829
 received what the products inside 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.760
 were frankly zero draw and so on 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.780
 social networks it is true that the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.079
 Following iworks she did a lot 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.660
 tacler but today the iboxx suite 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.059
 it's good so I'm going to 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.670
 speak the theme so its fruits and choco 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.469
 therapy is in there are six 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.239
 products then the very first product 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.059
 it's a product from palm earth en 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.650
 travel size of 25 milliliters 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.119
 it is a dry oil for the body at 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.250
 cocoa butter 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.439
 it obviously smells like chocolate 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.240
 ultra greedy I love the brand the 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.340
 mark palmer I had discovered a 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.960
 moisturizing lips like cocoa 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.610
 it was just crazy I 'm going 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.110
 finish in two weeks the trick and the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.759
 moon dries meaning extremely good so 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.799
 it's really greedy it comes in 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.799
 really in the theme so fruits and 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.409
 choco therapy so on the face I do not 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.759
 I absolutely do not agree to put 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.439
 this product on the face but for the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.210
 body it's a traitor away time 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.380
 who does not stick who does not leave 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.970
 vehicle or fat on the skin 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.439
 it is a product that is not tested 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.880
 on animals they say that it repairs 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.439
 scars stretch marks skins 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.159
 dry and damage the regular ter the 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.990
 skin aging 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.850
 Well, it's a little bit like the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.649
 bio l will say so I really validate 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.149
 this first product although I would have liked 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.500
 have a format a little bigger 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.729
 the second produces a product 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.040
 funny enough it's a mask for the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.799
 face so touch the action paris so 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.460
 it is a mask to him of rice scented with 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.710
 lychees 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.350
 so we know all the values 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.060
 mattifying 2 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.710
 rice in fact so it's a mask 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.869
 moussan matifying so anti age etc which 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.260
 smell the lychee so the packaging 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.970
 he is super cute and so you have to 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.650
 let it work for 12 minutes and then 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.390
 has very clean skin very soft and 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.580
 especially well maths it's great for 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.530
 skins like mine oily or mixed 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.600
 wheels that tend to oil and 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.520
 then we have a little accessories for 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:32.060
 the keys so it's a keychain so 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:37.980
 version 3 chocolates like these up 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:40.019
 behind we have small words and it has 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.880
 summer of design and by caroline the isf renders 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.650
 so certainly I find that this guy 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.930
 accessory has no place in a 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.180
 box beauty and in a box or on 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.440
 label but in a generalist box 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.120
 why not that I think it's 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.650
 nice to find a little find 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.620
 keychains for chocolate fans 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.690
 I think it's really cute 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.390
 so I 'll say it too 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.010
 the public price meanwhile it is 12 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.549
 50 euros I think it's very expensive 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.870
 12 euros than 50 for a keychain it's 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.820
 not the price I would have awarded him 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.040
 I would not put more than five euros I 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.989
 think but I find it very nice in 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.670
 party on the theme of greediness 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.440
 find must find this type of 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.239
 product then makes brand 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.180
 body minute we have an anti mask 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.100
 imperfections that presents itself like that 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.660
 so that's how the tube looks 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.170
 it's very small at the level of 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.030
 capacity 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.130
 I am very disappointed it is fifteen 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.780
 milliliters so it's a mask that 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.160
 you put on the face that you 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.590
 let's ask that you rinse so that's it 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.079
 it gives good looks and so it is 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.030
 my Swiss tin so it's true that the 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.980
 world the format it's pretty but hey the 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.109
 dagger really is really too small 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.590
 and so the public price 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.510
 it's 9 euros 90 all that's expensive 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.019
 a pure for 15 milliliters 15 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.250
 milliliters if it's pretty disappointing 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.900
 then we have a product that is really 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.780
 very cute who shows up in a 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.519
 little box like this but even if 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.840
 is extremely cute he is not going 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.150
 absolutely will suit me so it's a 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.000
 organic product called bull serum 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.600
 intense the brand the meaning the essence 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.580
 flowers here is a serum 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.370
 for the skins that are 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.940
 very dry and ultra dehydrated so 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.720
 in it we have four small versions of 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:23.210
 serum so one two three four 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.940
 a little there but it does not absolutely 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.200
 to suit me since I have oily skin 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.090
 finally that straightens at least very very 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.770
 so fast the concentrates very moisturizing 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.870
 like that I stick it's a sensation 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.010
 which is absolutely unpleasant so I 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.330
 I am very disappointed to have oily skin 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.750
 because it's true and it's very 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.760
 cute 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.230
 so I would have liked to try it 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.310
 so unfortunately like that does not 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.130
 not fit I will put them in 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.020
 sale on hbo refuted so went to see if 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.230
 the product interests you the public price 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.350
 he and pushpin 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.670
 the public price and the 2.35 euros 90 so 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.670
 I think I'll sell them some 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.170
 thing like 7 to 8 euros so allied to 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.090
 that it may very interested chrono 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.410
 dry so I think it's a very 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.170
 very good idea to put that in the 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.320
 strict iboxx but unfortunately it 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.030
 would have been better than each little one each 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.850
 small tube match a type of 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.660
 different skin but no and we finish 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.910
 with a product 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.560
 finally a brand especially that I love 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.890
 but with all my heart it's lady green 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.360
 so it's cosmetics for for 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.680
 for young people here for the 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.750
 teenagers originally we can everything to 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.070
 actually use them so it's them these are 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.630
 products all products are 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.730
 ecocert certified 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.560
 the bagad an absolutely sublime island 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.910
 it is the second product that I have alas 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.400
 it's a sweet metamorphosis that's 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:38.900
 a gentle facial scrub with aloe vera 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.460
 nîmes and who yes it feels ultra good and 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.710
 heats up the package of a he is ultra 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.050
 seductive he is really superb so 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.550
 product I love big fat top for 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.620
 me then the price of this damage he is 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.700
 from 14 euros 90 so as you can 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.530
 guess it I really find this 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.360
 edition she really stands out from 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.169
 previous editions have really done 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.970
 controversy etc 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.490
 but I find that this freebox there she 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.660
 is really good and at the tariff level 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.300
 this time I think she is 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.430
 really profitable since boxing she 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.020
 costs 13 euros plus 3 euros of fees 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.760
 port while with the overall amount in 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.580
 makes products that we had 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.690
 largely this tariff there so now the 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.160
 question she still resides in the 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.710
 even on the same subject is what we have 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.360
 really need products that has two 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.860
 teeth so here I take this one 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.470
 as an example certainly it's great 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.950
 choupinou and everything but it does not match 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.300
 at all 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:27.290
 at the skin type this said this shot there I 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.240
 still find that there is more than 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.170
 products that interests me and about the six 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.120
 if we really have one who does not 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.380
 I'm not interested so we even have a small 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.450
 accessory what I find super nice 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.920
 so that's the end of the story 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.900
 is that I find that the suite 'iboxx 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.630
 fruit and choco therapy she is 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.490
 really really good so here is my 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.050
 opinion and that's why I talk about it 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.370
 today as I told you in 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.810
 video start the previous one I have 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.180
 received they were really not worth the 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.110
 blow and I did not say anything about him 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.670
 because it was not worth it 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.990
 I talk about it but I think this one 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.370
 they really raised the bar and 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.160
 it's very good so sweety box 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.690
 continue like this is good 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.920
 do not forget the girls as I say 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.260
 in the middle of videos make me happy 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.610
 all products from boxes or 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.550
 your bathroom that you do not use 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.320
 more think about putting them on sale on 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.210
 smart beauty at attractive prices 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.010
 since it is a site only for 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.840
 individuals who resell and who 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.580
 buy all these products there second 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.810
 hand of new products or it can be 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.230
 used products but also 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.730
 new 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.680
 So instead of letting sleeping was 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.790
 product at home resell you 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.050

 you, like me, have oily skin 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.980
 and you have a great moisturizer that 

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.750
 you're never going to use behind 

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.980
