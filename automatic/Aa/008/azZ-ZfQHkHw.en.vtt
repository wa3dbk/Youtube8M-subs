00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:08.059
 here is the much anticipated iphone support 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:12.590
 have finally arrive at home so 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.590
 ubs packaging a carrier ups 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.130
 here 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:38.370
 visibly well packaged these pros so 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.880
 it's a support that was ordered on 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.760
 the apple store on the apple store 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:49.379
 about four weeks ago and who has 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.580
 been delivered ben that day Friday the 13th for 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.000
 good news is a very good 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.050
 news 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.480
 So here is the kit in its box 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:05.270
 original 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:08.880
 you can see it here you go 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:11.090
 so we will proceed to unpack the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.090
 stupid 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:54.600
 rather rather nice so what we 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:02:03.149
 hello the famous cable of 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:07.100
 charge to feed the support with the 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.100
 tomtom logo of course 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:36.040
 a manual user manual 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:43.329
 visibly in several languages ​​including 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:43.329
 french figure 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.060
 so here is the French appear in the 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:57.870
 manual I have a good thing 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.870
 then we have a note 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:08.890
 ok ok 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:11.069
 then we have to a plate of 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.069
 fixation 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.019
 I'll see later what she 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:23.709
 well match noise that this is a 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:35.340
 part of the sucker confirmed and 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:41.159
 Finally, the support bracket itself 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:45.030
 obviously very good bill 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.030
 at first glance 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.410
 the 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.710
 it's not too political here is this 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.650
 this positivity for a break on a 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.210
 dashboard visibly seen that there is 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:11.530
 a double-sided film stickers on 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:13.750
 ok here you go 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:19.350
 so we are taking the 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:22.090
 not feeding that is here a 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.100
 the external enterprise for him to eventual 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.000
 car radio that must of course 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:31.440
 benefit from an auxiliary output and the 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.440
 iphone dock 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:47.889
 the loudspeaker behind located at 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:47.889
 the back and the lock of the suction cup 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:53.650
 obviously a product very well done 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:02.330
 so a value of 99 euros 90 for 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:04.310
 comparison I saw a brand support 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.389
 kensington which serves as 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.940
 fm transmitter and handsfree kits 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:13.879
 who she kind of in the same lineage that 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:19.250
 also sold in supermarkets 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:21.259
 around 99 euros so there in 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.280
 premium we still have a 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:28.210
 bluetooth connection and a gps chip this 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.210
 which is not negligible 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:38.240
 obviously the finish is not so bad 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:49.729
 we admit we have here the button of 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:51.810
 volume so let's see how the iphone 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:53.930
 behaves 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.930
 more 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.290
 I find my iphone 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.810
 it 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.700
 necessarily iphone can not be 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.270
 taken in view that the video is in the process 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.830
 to be shot with this same iphone 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.650
 necessarily the second iphone I do not 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:44.080
 not find so we're going to finish the 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:47.390
 video on set and parts 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:50.350
 contained in the iphone kit so the 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:54.440
 support proper ex Suction 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:59.630
 the kit to reload the support and the 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:02.300
 reloading the iphone in itself a 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.610
 fixing plate visibly for 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.670
 fitch and on a dashboard that did 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:10.730
 no smooth surface that will allow 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:15.560
 ask not on the windshield but on 

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:16.340
 the dashboard is the manual 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:21.230
 of use 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:23.590
 here is more than just go to phase 

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:29.320
 test 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:29.320
 maybe in the next video thank you
