00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.439 

I<00:00:00.530> guess<00:00:01.530> this<00:00:01.949> video<00:00:02.310> is<00:00:02.700> going<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.149> be

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
I guess this video is going to be

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.130 
I guess this video is going to be
another<00:00:03.959> about<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.680> black<00:00:05.190> queen<00:00:05.490> and

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.140 
another about the black queen and

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.419 
another about the black queen and
somebody<00:00:07.140> responded<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.830> my<00:00:07.950> last<00:00:08.130> video

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
somebody responded to my last video

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.589 
somebody responded to my last video
saying<00:00:08.700> that<00:00:08.790> they<00:00:08.940> couldn't<00:00:09.240> get<00:00:09.389> her<00:00:09.570> to

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
saying that they couldn't get her to

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.830 
saying that they couldn't get her to
spawn<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:11.370> so<00:00:12.000> I've<00:00:12.360> come<00:00:12.570> up<00:00:12.660> with<00:00:12.719> a

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
spawn and and so I've come up with a

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.990 
spawn and and so I've come up with a
little<00:00:13.110> theory<00:00:13.650> that<00:00:13.980> might<00:00:14.340> increase<00:00:14.940> the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
little theory that might increase the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000 
little theory that might increase the
probability<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:17.000> realized<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.619> in<00:00:19.619> my<00:00:19.710> last

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
probability I realized that in my last

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.660 
probability I realized that in my last
video<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.609> was<00:00:20.699> basically<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.689> run<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:23.400> me

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
video it was basically a run of me

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.410 
video it was basically a run of me
farming<00:00:24.210> God<00:00:25.140> lieth<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.800> black<00:00:26.519> queen<00:00:26.760> just

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
farming God lieth and black queen just

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.040 
farming God lieth and black queen just
happened<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.779> spawn<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.140> time<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
happened to spawn that time on the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.479 
happened to spawn that time on the
occasions<00:00:31.050> when<00:00:31.140> I'm<00:00:31.380> farming<00:00:31.740> God<00:00:31.890> lieth<00:00:32.250> I

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
occasions when I'm farming God lieth I

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.450 
occasions when I'm farming God lieth I
kill<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.149> spider<00:00:33.420> ants<00:00:33.750> along<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> way<00:00:34.620> and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
kill the spider ants along the way and

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.370 
kill the spider ants along the way and
my<00:00:35.610> theory<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.510> she<00:00:36.690> will<00:00:36.989> spawn<00:00:37.350> in

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
my theory is that she will spawn in

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.139 
my theory is that she will spawn in
response<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.969> spider<00:00:39.239> odds<00:00:39.480> being<00:00:39.719> killed

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
response to the spider odds being killed

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.600 
response to the spider odds being killed
I've<00:00:42.149> tried<00:00:42.590> five<00:00:43.590> times<00:00:43.920> now<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.190> think<00:00:44.309> and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
I've tried five times now I think and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.389 
I've tried five times now I think and
four<00:00:45.239> times<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.989> spy<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.010> black<00:00:47.190> Queen

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
four times the spy the the black Queen

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.299 
four times the spy the the black Queen
has<00:00:47.610> has<00:00:47.850> spawned<00:00:48.140> so<00:00:49.140> I'm<00:00:49.829> going<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.039> try<00:00:50.250> it

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
has has spawned so I'm going to try it

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.049 
has has spawned so I'm going to try it
again<00:00:50.370> now<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.000> see<00:00:51.210> if<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.390> works<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.960> then

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
again now and see if it works and then

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.790 
again now and see if it works and then
hopefully<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.660> guys<00:00:54.809> will<00:00:54.870> test<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.469> out<00:00:55.559> and

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
hopefully you guys will test it out and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.849 
hopefully you guys will test it out and
let<00:00:55.949> me<00:00:55.980> know<00:00:57.260> whether<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.410> increases<00:00:58.829> your

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
let me know whether it increases your

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.600 
let me know whether it increases your
chances<00:00:58.980> or<00:00:59.489> not<00:01:01.579> just<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:03.539> all<00:01:03.719> right<00:01:03.840> here

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
chances or not just this all right here

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.899 
chances or not just this all right here
I'll<00:01:05.610> go<00:01:05.790> up<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.030> grab<00:01:06.090> these<00:01:06.360> guys

attempt

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.180 
attempt
I<00:01:55.570> didn't<00:01:56.570> kill<00:01:56.750> as<00:01:56.870> many<00:01:57.050> and<00:01:57.530> she<00:01:57.890> didn't

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
I didn't kill as many and she didn't

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.330 
I didn't kill as many and she didn't
spawn<00:01:58.670> so<00:01:59.290> this<00:02:00.290> time<00:02:00.560> I'm<00:02:00.770> gonna<00:02:01.070> make<00:02:01.310> sure

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
spawn so this time I'm gonna make sure

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.610 
spawn so this time I'm gonna make sure
that<00:02:01.520> I<00:02:01.700> kill<00:02:02.180> as<00:02:02.300> many<00:02:02.450> as<00:02:02.660> I<00:02:02.690> can<00:02:02.960> before

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
that I kill as many as I can before

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:21.620 
that I kill as many as I can before
carrying<00:02:04.190> on

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.830 

okay

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
okay

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.570 
okay
let's<00:02:23.020> try<00:02:23.350> it<00:02:23.410> with<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:30.190> would<00:02:30.490> you

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
let's try it with that and would you

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:39.140 
let's try it with that and would you
believe<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:31.440> there<00:02:32.440> she<00:02:32.620> is

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.000 

so<00:02:40.150> let's<00:02:40.510> go<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.750> kill<00:02:40.900> her<00:02:41.050> if<00:02:41.110> we<00:02:41.200> can<00:02:41.350> see

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
so let's go and kill her if we can see

00:02:42.010 --> 00:03:06.370 
so let's go and kill her if we can see
we<00:02:42.160> can<00:02:42.310> get<00:02:42.570> its<00:02:43.570> launcher

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.140 

not<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:07.530> time

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
not this time

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.850 
not this time
well<00:03:09.150> yeah<00:03:09.300> feel<00:03:09.690> free<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.990> test<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.770> out

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
well yeah feel free to test it out

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.260 
well yeah feel free to test it out
Anakin's<00:03:11.550> let<00:03:11.820> me<00:03:11.940> know<00:03:12.120> if<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.600> works<00:03:12.660> for<00:03:13.140> you
