 WARNING: Any distraction from the driver can lead to an accident and personal injury. Operating the infotainment system while driving can distract your attention. 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.740
 This video may only be played when the car is not running, unless it is only played by the co-driver. 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.500
 This video is not a substitute for the user manual. Consult this for complete information and warnings. 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.080
 The infotainment navigation system performs calculations 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.240
 and records the routes based on the information received from different sources. 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.220
 On the one hand, it determines the position of the car by means of a GPS satellite system. 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.500
 Sensors in the car measure the distance traveled. 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.520
 Detailed maps have also been saved to compare the measured values. 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.820
 SEAT recommends regularly updating the navigation data. 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.360
 The current navigation data is available from the SEAT dealer. 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.720
 From the main menu you get to the main options for navigation, 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.860
 such as selecting a new destination, opening a previous or saved destination 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.100
 or adjust navigation settings. 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.980
 When selecting a new destination, you must first specify 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.160
 whether it is an address, a POI or special destination, or a point on the map. 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.660
 When an address is entered, the data will limit the search and selection options. 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.880
 If the destination is a point on the map, 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.400
 it is activated by entering the GPS coordinates or selecting it on the map. 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.540
 The navigation system will, depending on the available information of the area, 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.300
 Propose 3 route options according to the options that can be chosen: 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:52.100
 Economic (blue), Fast (red), and Short (orange). 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.880
 The navigation system has the predictive navigation option. 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.460
 This option detects and saves in the background the routes traveled in the usual way, 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.920
 without having to be an active route to the destination. 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.080
 On the main menu of the navigation menu, press in the pop-up window 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.500
 Press the Most used routes button to display the usual routes. 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.840
 During a usual route, the system will, if it is a traffic report 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.300
 receive an incident reporting on that route, 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.280
 propose an alternative route without incident without a destination having to be active. 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.820
 Off-road navigation is a function for driving on unpaved roads 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.380
 as orientation aid in "non-digitized areas" at low speeds. 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.140
 Non-digitized areas are areas for which the system has no road or area information. 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.120
 Streets, buildings or natural boundaries such as mountains or rivers 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.120
 are not recognized even if they are on the card. 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.900
 Off-road navigation is not suitable for driving on normal roads, 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.100
 since one-way traffic, entrances and exits of the highway etc. are not recognized. 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.480
 The Offroad navigation has the following options: 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.120
 RECORD: starts the recording of an Offroad track. 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.660
 MEMORY: opens a list for choosing a saved Offroad ride. 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.980
 EXIT: ends the Offroad navigation. 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.560
 An Offroad ride consists of a number of saved waypoints. 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.280
 Points can be added manually to the ride by marking on the map. 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.140
 The navigation system has a wide variety 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.980
 to institutions with which numerous options can be refined. 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.200
 From the route options, map display and adjusting the navigation notifications 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.940
 to advanced navigation settings. 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.660
 These settings make a high degree of personalization of the navigation system 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.640
 possibly according to the use and preference of the user.
