works<00:02:03.329> flawlessly<00:02:03.979> you<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.189> have<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.399> be<00:02:05.490> on

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
works flawlessly you just have to be on

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.310 
works flawlessly you just have to be on
the<00:02:05.670> same<00:02:05.909> map<00:02:06.240> same<00:02:06.570> network<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.140> you're<00:02:07.259> on

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
the same map same network if you're on

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.770 
the same map same network if you're on
the<00:02:07.409> same<00:02:07.590> network<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:08.459> think<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.629> be

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
the same network I think you have to be

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.130 
the same network I think you have to be
or<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.709> may<00:02:11.009> be<00:02:11.069> if<00:02:11.580> you're<00:02:11.760> almost

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
or it may be if you're almost

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.410 
or it may be if you're almost
network<00:02:12.710> it's<00:02:13.069> a<00:02:13.460> better<00:02:13.730> four-year

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
network it's a better four-year

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.350 
network it's a better four-year
connection<00:02:14.990> in<00:02:15.170> terms<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.560> latency<00:02:15.819> but<00:02:16.819> the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
connection in terms of latency but the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.780 
connection in terms of latency but the
remote<00:02:18.230> play<00:02:18.440> is<00:02:18.560> definitely<00:02:18.770> a<00:02:19.040> promising

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
remote play is definitely a promising

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.880 
remote play is definitely a promising
feature<00:02:20.000> for<00:02:20.300> this<00:02:20.420> generation<00:02:20.870> it's<00:02:21.500> not<00:02:21.709> as

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
feature for this generation it's not as

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.890 
feature for this generation it's not as
good<00:02:22.130> for<00:02:22.370> first-person<00:02:23.270> shooters<00:02:23.690> because

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
good for first-person shooters because

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.350 
good for first-person shooters because
there's<00:02:24.290> still<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.530> slight<00:02:24.800> latency<00:02:25.790> issue<00:02:26.000> and

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
there's still a slight latency issue and

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.120 
there's still a slight latency issue and
that's<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:27.230> can't<00:02:27.470> really<00:02:27.740> do<00:02:27.920> anything

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
that's you can't really do anything

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.830 
that's you can't really do anything
about<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.610> that's<00:02:28.790> just<00:02:29.000> going<00:02:29.390> over<00:02:29.510> Wi-Fi

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
about that that's just going over Wi-Fi

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.060 
about that that's just going over Wi-Fi
but<00:02:30.770> in<00:02:31.010> terms<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.870> any<00:02:32.870> other<00:02:33.260> game<00:02:33.590> except

for<00:02:34.280> first-person<00:02:34.940> shooters<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:36.290> usually

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
for first-person shooters it usually

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.420 
for first-person shooters it usually
works<00:02:37.040> out<00:02:37.450> remote<00:02:38.450> play<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:39.650> anyways<00:02:40.280> let<00:02:40.400> me
