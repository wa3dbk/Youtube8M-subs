 person finally expressed the young person 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.600
 so you have this process of 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.340
 expression on the streets it is called 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:54.060
 graphite has the unauthorized modality 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.320
 modality is authorized by 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.259
 example graffiti 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:04.159
 she worked more with one color is only one 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:08.340

 groups of young people who are showing

 there are women expressing themselves 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.120
 on the walls talking we're here and 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.970
 for example my personal art I 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.150
 I really like existence because it's a 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.069
 way that I can include it within the 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.459
 my personal art my personal art 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.099
 she's very focused and waste 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.430
 reuse of materials and a stencil 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:39.310
 You can make old paper from 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.440
 kraft paper used all mine 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.799
 works come from my drawing 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.079
 and everyone has a message 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.090
 idea that we put there an intention 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:53.530
 transform energy from the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.930
 then the owl idea is a world with 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.609
 more wisdom then I used the owl in 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.500
 over the world just to give it 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:03.280
 idea of ​​the world is my desire for a 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.019
 the better world everyone accepts any 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.010
 expression when she is well 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.010
 positioned
