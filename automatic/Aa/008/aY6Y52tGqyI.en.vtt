my plan Tala ji yeah congenital defect
pathology<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:29.490> cause<00:00:29.789> it's<00:00:30.330> what<00:00:30.689> your

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
pathology that can cause it's what your

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.580 
pathology that can cause it's what your
interest<00:00:31.460> and<00:00:32.460> degenerative<00:00:33.180> problems<00:00:33.630> on

interest and degenerative problems on

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.040 
interest and degenerative problems on
your<00:00:34.829> articulation<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.570> can<00:00:36.719> see<00:00:36.930> on

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
your articulation so as you can see on

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.950 
your articulation so as you can see on
the<00:00:37.170> x-ray<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:39.350> congestion<00:00:40.550> destroy<00:00:41.550> of

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
the x-ray you have congestion destroy of

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.420 
the x-ray you have congestion destroy of
femoral<00:00:42.960> head<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.010> right<00:00:44.129> hip

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
femoral head on the right hip

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.020 
femoral head on the right hip
osteonecrosis<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.489> for<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.820> you

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
osteonecrosis and and so for that you

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.240 
osteonecrosis and and so for that you
have<00:00:48.149> inflammation<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:50.960> okay<00:00:51.960> how<00:00:52.890> can<00:00:53.129> this

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
have inflammation and okay how can this

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.799 
have inflammation and okay how can this
pathology<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:54.390> solved<00:00:55.460> but<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.670> your<00:00:57.000> case<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
pathology be solved but in your case the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.439 
pathology be solved but in your case the
only<00:00:58.020> solution<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.010> hip<00:00:59.579> replacement<00:01:00.559> because

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
only solution is hip replacement because

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.479 
only solution is hip replacement because
because<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.780> assort<00:01:04.229> rightists<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.189> your

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
because of the assort rightists and your

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.899 
because of the assort rightists and your
special<00:01:06.240> congenital<00:01:07.140> disease<00:01:07.880> there<00:01:08.880> are

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
special congenital disease there are

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.840 
special congenital disease there are
areas<00:01:09.390> where<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.350> cartilage<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:11.070> completely

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
areas where the cartilage is completely

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.109 
areas where the cartilage is completely
gone<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.390> because<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.310> have<00:01:14.340> also<00:01:15.090> a

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
gone and because of that you have also a

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.899 
gone and because of that you have also a
part<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.990> bone<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.530> has<00:01:16.860> died<00:01:17.189> because

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
part of the bone that has died because

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.460 
part of the bone that has died because
of<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.570> pressure<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.189> not

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470

thing you can do as a total hip

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.140 
thing you can do as a total hip
replacement<00:01:34.189> why<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.250> surgery<00:01:35.729> will<00:01:36.119> be

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
replacement why the surgery will be

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.149 
replacement why the surgery will be
performed<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.049> private<00:01:37.380> center<00:01:37.860> rather

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
performed in a private center rather

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.630 
performed in a private center rather
than<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.759> public<00:01:39.090> one<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:40.310> think<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.490> very

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
than in a public one I think it's very

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.380 
than in a public one I think it's very
important<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.540> for<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.740> find<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.490> place

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
important to you for you to find a place

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.490 
important to you for you to find a place
with<00:01:45.750> big<00:01:47.329> experience<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.540> difficult<00:01:49.229> case

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
with big experience in difficult case

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.109 
with big experience in difficult case
where<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.549> treat<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.970> so

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
where you can treat it so

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.960 
where you can treat it so
the<00:01:52.690> problem<00:01:53.020> is<00:01:53.170> you<00:01:53.409> need<00:01:53.590> an<00:01:54.400> excellent

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
the problem is you need an excellent

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.730 
the problem is you need an excellent
center<00:01:55.720> where<00:01:55.900> you<00:01:56.020> can<00:01:56.049> treat<00:01:56.440> your

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
center where you can treat your

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.210 
center where you can treat your
pathology<00:01:58.350> well<00:01:59.350> I<00:01:59.380> think<00:01:59.530> it's<00:01:59.920> very

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
pathology well I think it's very

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.190 
pathology well I think it's very
important<00:02:00.820> like<00:02:01.590> dr.<00:02:02.590> Coletti<00:02:02.830> said<00:02:04.200> that's

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
important like dr. Coletti said that's

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.620 
important like dr. Coletti said that's
experience<00:02:05.950> would<00:02:06.940> you<00:02:07.180> you<00:02:07.390> have<00:02:07.600> a

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
experience would you you have a

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.030 
experience would you you have a
congenital<00:02:08.140> disease<00:02:08.679> you<00:02:09.580> have<00:02:09.850> small<00:02:10.239> bones

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
congenital disease you have small bones

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.640 
congenital disease you have small bones
you<00:02:12.040> have<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.670> different<00:02:13.120> biomechanic<00:02:13.959> you

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
you have a different biomechanic you

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.550 
you have a different biomechanic you
have<00:02:14.920> enemy<00:02:15.610> time<00:02:15.880> also<00:02:16.090> dysplasia<00:02:16.810> because

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
have enemy time also dysplasia because

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.190 
have enemy time also dysplasia because
of<00:02:17.739> your<00:02:17.980> condition<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.390> need<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.750> small

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
of your condition so you need a small

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.680 
of your condition so you need a small
prosthesis<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:21.640> biomechanics<00:02:22.510> are

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
prosthesis the biomechanics are

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.110 
prosthesis the biomechanics are
completely<00:02:23.319> different<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.580> are<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.700> very

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
completely different so you are a very

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.410 
completely different so you are a very
special<00:02:25.420> case<00:02:25.989> so<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:27.130> need<00:02:27.430> somebody<00:02:27.910> who

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
special case so you need somebody who

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.199 
special case so you need somebody who
has<00:02:28.450> experience<00:02:28.890> not<00:02:29.890> only<00:02:30.220> would<00:02:30.430> hip<00:02:30.670> but

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
has experience not only would hip but

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.650 
has experience not only would hip but
with<00:02:31.420> very<00:02:31.690> special<00:02:32.230> cases<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:33.640> thing<00:02:33.910> is<00:02:34.180> to

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
with very special cases the thing is to

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.790 
with very special cases the thing is to

is that one pain will increase your

is that one pain will increase your
functional<00:03:00.040> impairment<00:03:00.640> will<00:03:00.820> increase<00:03:01.299> that

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
functional impairment will increase that

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.440 
functional impairment will increase that
means<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:03.100> have<00:03:03.340> no<00:03:03.579> quality<00:03:04.060> of<00:03:04.239> life

anymore<00:03:05.489> what<00:03:06.489> is<00:03:06.670> already<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:07.209> case<00:03:07.480> today

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
anymore what is already the case today

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.100 
anymore what is already the case today
it<00:03:08.230> will<00:03:08.650> just<00:03:09.130> become<00:03:09.670> worse<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.360> worse<00:03:10.810> so

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
it will just become worse and worse so

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.729 
it will just become worse and worse so
like<00:03:12.040> now<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.430> are<00:03:12.790> 30<00:03:13.150> years<00:03:13.660> you<00:03:14.500> will

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
like now you are 30 years you will

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.319 
like now you are 30 years you will
become<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.850> man<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.840> 60<00:03:17.829> or<00:03:17.860> 70<00:03:18.700> which<00:03:19.090> you

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
become a man of 60 or 70 which you

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.599 
become a man of 60 or 70 which you
aren't<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:20.500> that's<00:03:20.709> why<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.040> really<00:03:21.489> need

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
surgery I think there is also a problem

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.590 
surgery I think there is also a problem
for<00:03:24.430> bone<00:03:24.910> stock<00:03:25.380> yeah<00:03:26.380> of<00:03:26.590> course<00:03:26.859> you're

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600

mean

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.880 
mean
something<00:03:30.300> that<00:03:30.450> interests<00:03:30.960> you<00:03:31.050> it's<00:03:31.470> to

your own stops home time

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.220 
your own stops home time
it's<00:03:41.280> very<00:03:41.430> important<00:03:41.970> you<00:03:42.030> are<00:03:42.180> young<00:03:42.570> so<00:03:43.080> we

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
it's very important you are young so we

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.870 
it's very important you are young so we
have<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.650> keep<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:44.040> bone<00:03:44.250> as<00:03:44.460> much<00:03:44.700> as

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
have to keep the bone as much as

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.390 
have to keep the bone as much as
possible<00:03:45.560> so<00:03:46.560> you<00:03:46.710> need<00:03:46.890> surgery<00:03:47.960> in<00:03:48.960> time<00:03:49.500> not

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
possible so you need surgery in time not

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.760 
possible so you need surgery in time not
in<00:03:50.580> two<00:03:50.820> years<00:03:51.120> not<00:03:51.390> in<00:03:51.570> one<00:03:51.780> year<00:03:52.080> I<00:03:52.230> think<00:03:52.320> if

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
in two years not in one year I think if

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.470 
in two years not in one year I think if
you<00:03:52.950> look<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.310> x-rays<00:03:53.820> now<00:03:54.060> with<00:03:54.360> the

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
you look to the x-rays now with the

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.630 
you look to the x-rays now with the
Bombers<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:55.110> have<00:03:55.380> and<00:03:55.620> we<00:03:56.250> see<00:03:56.460> your

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
Bombers you have and we see your

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.270 
Bombers you have and we see your
function<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.270> the<00:03:57.420> hip<00:03:57.600> which<00:03:57.930> is<00:03:58.140> very<00:03:58.710> bad<00:03:58.950> I

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
function of the hip which is very bad I

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.260 
function of the hip which is very bad I
think<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.120> need<00:04:00.300> something<00:04:00.570> to<00:04:00.900> be<00:04:01.020> done<00:04:02.270> why

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
think you need something to be done why

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.440 
think you need something to be done why
is<00:04:03.330> better<00:04:03.720> if<00:04:04.020> I<00:04:04.230> do<00:04:04.290> it<00:04:04.530> here<00:04:05.430> rather<00:04:05.970> than<00:04:06.300> in

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
is better if I do it here rather than in

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.610 
is better if I do it here rather than in
a<00:04:06.570> normal<00:04:06.930> Hospital<00:04:08.540> what<00:04:09.540> you<00:04:10.050> have<00:04:10.260> to<00:04:10.470> look

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
a normal Hospital what you have to look

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.310 
a normal Hospital what you have to look
to<00:04:10.940> experience<00:04:11.940> I<00:04:12.420> think<00:04:12.960> this<00:04:13.110> is<00:04:13.290> very

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
to experience I think this is very

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.950 
to experience I think this is very
important<00:04:14.190> when<00:04:14.880> you<00:04:15.060> look<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.390> case<00:04:15.690> like

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
important when you look to case like

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.949 
important when you look to case like
yours<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:16.860> if<00:04:17.670> you<00:04:17.820> look<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.150> a<00:04:18.209> standard<00:04:18.690> case

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
yours and if you look to a standard case

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.039 
yours and if you look to a standard case
even<00:04:19.739> for<00:04:19.799> standard<00:04:20.760> total<00:04:21.209> hip<00:04:21.360> replacement

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
even for standard total hip replacement

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.040 
even for standard total hip replacement
we<00:04:22.680> know<00:04:22.920> if<00:04:23.250> you<00:04:23.490> have<00:04:23.520> a<00:04:23.730> lot<00:04:24.030> of<00:04:24.060> experience

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
we know if you have a lot of experience

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.930 
we know if you have a lot of experience
you<00:04:25.590> have<00:04:25.830> less<00:04:26.280> risk<00:04:26.670> of<00:04:27.380> complications

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
you have less risk of complications

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.060 
you have less risk of complications
already<00:04:29.940> with<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.300> standard<00:04:30.750> case<00:04:30.990> if<00:04:31.350> you<00:04:31.860> do

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
already with the standard case if you do

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.410 
already with the standard case if you do

200 hips a year the chance for you to
