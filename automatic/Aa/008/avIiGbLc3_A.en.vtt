00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
Hello, I'm German and I bet you this dog leash that there's gravity in your house.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.820
"Disadvantages of being a man".

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.860
Hi, as you might have noticed, I'm a man.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.960
Are you sure?.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.560
Of course I am.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.420
It's just that you don't look very masculine.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.260
I'M A MAN!.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.000
He's mad now, he's probably in his period.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.860
Like I said, I'm a man and I've always been.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.080
So I'm used to it.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.220
But that doesn't mean that I always like being one.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.660
Because it has it disadvantages.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.120
For example, we're the strong gender.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.800
We have to deal with all the hard work.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.160
If you have to move furniture,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.640
we do it.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.960
Change a tire.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.420
We do it.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.720
Unclog the toilet,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.280
we do it.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.800
Ok, I don't do any of those, but I should!.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.080
And women abuse the fact that we are the strong gender.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.040
They abuse the fact that we are fit, strong and husky.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.760
Well, some men.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.440
But they do abuse.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.400
Or have you never had a fight like this one?

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.180
Why do you always get home so late?.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.140
I told you that we'd go to my mother's house today!.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.260
I'm tired of you not ever paying any attention!.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.860
You're always with your friends!.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.040
I'm tired of you!.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.520
Stupid!

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.100
Stupid!.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.080
Hey stop it!.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.240
You hit me.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.720
I'm suing you!.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.400
They can hit us all they want,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.260
But if we give them a teeny tiny push,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.120
it's the end of the world.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.340
Once I dating someone who hit me with a baseball bat

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.260
and I couldn't do anything about it.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.440
Nah, she didn't hit me with a bat.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.700
She'd hit me with a stick with nails in it.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.240
Another disadvantage is that we're completely controllable.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.600
A woman can make us do whatever she wants, whenever she wants.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.040
She just has to use that magic world called "SEX".

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.020
If she says that word,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.640
we automatically turn into little puppets.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.440
Hey.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.780
Yeah?.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.580
I was thinking we could go to the bedroom for a while.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.720
What for?.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.600
You know.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.340
I don't know, I don't feel like it.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.220
Come on.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.100
Look, if you clean the apartment, I might want to.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.460
Ok.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.760
Ok, should we go to the bedroom?.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.240
Another day, bye!.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.200
No matter how many times they do it, we always fall in that trap.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.980
Stupid monkey!.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.360
Or for example, the stereotype that the man has to be a "macho".

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.280
A "guardian".

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.220
Let's say you have a girl at home at night.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.160
And you hear a noise.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.340
The man is the one who has to go check.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.960
And if you don't go, there's always someone who says:

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.660
"You don't have balls".

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.380
WTF?.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.640
The girl didn't go either and I don't see anyone saying

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.340
"You don't have ovaries".

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.420
Another disadvantage is that we can't be flirty.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.060
And if you can, is because your an effeminate that likes 8 footer big men.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.880
What do I mean?.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.320
Imagine you're driving your car.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.920
I don't have a car.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.260
Imagine you're driving your bike.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.220
And there's a cop that wants to give you a speeding ticket.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.840
If I were a girl, I would do something like this.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.340
Miss, do you know how fast you were going?.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.220
I really don't know.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.560
You were going faster than 120 in an area of 100 km ph.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.300
Oh handsome, I didn't notice.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.820
I'm gonna have to give you a speeding ticket, I'm sorry.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.820
Don't get angry or you get wrinkled.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.880
And we don't want that pretty face to get all wrinkled, do we?.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.600
How fit, do you go to the gym?.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.180
Yeah actually I go on my spare time.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.420
You can tell.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.620
Ok, I wont give you a ticket but this can't happen again, ok?

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.280
Thank you very much, cutie!.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.000
Bye!.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.080
Flirty girls never get tickets!.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.060
That's completely unfair.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.240
I once tried to do what these women do.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.480
Didn't go very well.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.800
Did you know you were driving over the speed limit?.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.420
Yes, ma'am.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.680
I'm gonna have to give you a ticket.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.860
"Alright, do what women do..

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.860
compliment her and she'll forgive you.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.340
Nice boobies.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.140
She gave me a ticket, took my license away and sued me for sexual harassment.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.700
Moral of the story, don't be a man.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.240
Again with the subject with men being the "guards".

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.120
It also means that we have to make sacrifices.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.600
And they put that in our heads since we're little.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.300
For example, let's think about all the Disney movies princesses.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.820
The princess is the main character,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.260
and the prince the secondary character.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.980
Less important than the fucking talking lamp.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.580
Given that the prince is the one that does ALL the work.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.080
Meanwhile the princess sits there waiting to be rescued.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.800
My princess, I've come to your rescue.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.540
My prince, to rescue me, you have to kill the dragon!.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.140
Go through the desert and fight 50.000 men.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.280
Then you must find the ring protected by a 30 mt high snake.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.580
Then, you must come back, save me, and we'll be together forever.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.680
Ok, and what are you gonna do in the meantime?.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.780
I'll be waiting.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.680
Nah, I better not, you're not that hot anyways.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.560
Another disadvantage of being a man is that we're cold.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.620
I mean, not cold but unromantic. 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.480
We are not sensitive.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.900
For example.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.940
I a girl sees a sunset, she goes like:

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.200
What beautiful colors.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.600
What a beautiful natural phenomenon.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.820
It's so, so.. beautiful.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.140
And the man is like:

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.880
It's just the fucking sun setting.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.040
It happens everyday!.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.680
That's why friendship between women,

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.560
and friendship between dudes is so different.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.400
Lets say a a guy and a girl fall in love and are about to kiss for the first time.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.800
The girl goes and tells her girl friend

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.140
and the guy tells his friend.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.680
The conversation between the girls would go something like this:

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.920
Ok tell me everything!.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.120
Ok, we were at his house watching a super romantic movie,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.960
and he suddenly he starts touching my leg,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.380
my heart started racing and I couldn't control it.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.520
He later turned and looked right into my eyes.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.560
He started getting closer and closer while he closed his eyes.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.100
I closed mine while I felt how he started holding my waist 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.060
He then kissed me.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.880
And I felt like I went to heaven for a second.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.760
How beautiful.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.060
And when the guy tells his friend.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.600
Hey I was with Fernanda.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.420
Yeah?, what happened?.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.520
I stuck my tongue in her throat.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.000
Cool.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.820
Question!.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.000
This is a pretty simple question.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.040
Are you a girl, or a guy?.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.940
If you're a guy, I hoped you liked this video,

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.040
And if you are a girl and you want me to make a video of the disadvantages of being a woman,

Bye Bye!.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.740
Oh princess!.. I have to go to the bathroom!.
