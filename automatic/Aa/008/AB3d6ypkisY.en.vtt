00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
what I guess when cold forging his hole

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.309 
what I guess when cold forging his hole
comes<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.880> what<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.150> universal<00:02:57.690> resolution

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
comes to what is universal resolution

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.569 
comes to what is universal resolution
which<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.470> think<00:02:58.650> it's<00:02:58.769> a<00:02:58.859> silly<00:02:59.099> as<00:02:59.280> shit<00:02:59.310> in
