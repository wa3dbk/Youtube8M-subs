00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.980

 itar tass true 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.090
 every month and for the news 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.110
 to third parties 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.700
 another place right after that she became 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.260
 by reality 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.480

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.760
 May 18 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.270
 so just the opposite I think just 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.250
 accordingly and try not to 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.219
 get confused 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:42.449
 economy estimates tried 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:44.489
 blatter company itself since 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.099

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.509
 instances 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:52.019
 in principle, it was known that after 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.229
 it is a statement of this becomes a method 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:57.229
 project shares retreats 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.719
 many 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.329
 in July 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.339

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:35.339
 in laboratories 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:42.789
 so or 

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:47.949
 contribution to Russia and Italy 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:49.369

 but I have them on the old Oskol 

00:03:57.089 --> 00:04:00.649
 this sergio Rodriguez I agree with that 

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:02.299
 and myself bravely 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.729
