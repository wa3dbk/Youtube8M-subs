five cars in the whole game wish which
is<00:00:55.230> pretty<00:00:55.649> much<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.160> ridiculous<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
is pretty much just ridiculous but the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.979 
is pretty much just ridiculous but the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
want to really grasp how a racing game

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.789 
want to really grasp how a racing game
would<00:01:10.830> work<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.490> PlayStation<00:01:12.090> Vita<00:01:12.330> and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that's pretty much the only reason I

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.620 
that's pretty much the only reason I
just<00:01:18.420> want<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.659> see<00:01:18.840> how<00:01:19.580> any<00:01:20.600> racer<00:01:21.600> any

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
everything so and I really do think it

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.300 
everything so and I really do think it
will<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:31.020> will<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.290> great<00:01:31.560> game<00:01:31.799> anyways

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
will be it will be a great game anyways

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.560 
will be it will be a great game anyways
but<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.860> whole<00:01:35.189> three<00:01:35.549> courses<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.210> only

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
but the the whole three courses and only

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.210 
but the the whole three courses and only
five<00:01:36.780> cars<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.640> very<00:01:38.640> ridiculous<00:01:40.220> anyways

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
five cars is is very ridiculous anyways

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.249 
five cars is is very ridiculous anyways
number<00:01:41.520> four<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:43.040> little<00:01:44.060> deviants<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.270> this

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
number four is little deviants and this

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.929 
number four is little deviants and this
is<00:01:46.439> pretty<00:01:46.590> much<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.860> same<00:01:47.280> reason<00:01:47.729> why<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
is pretty much the same reason why it

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.520 
is pretty much the same reason why it
shows<00:01:48.299> Ridge<00:01:49.110> Racer<00:01:50.509> this<00:01:51.509> game<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.320> can

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530

shows Ridge Racer this game you can
pretty<00:01:52.770> much<00:01:52.860> test<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.820> all<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.540> functions

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110
