I said these end garter stitches were
created<00:00:28.050> by<00:00:28.590> twisting<00:00:29.340> them<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.849> knitting

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570

through<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.230> back<00:00:31.410> loop<00:00:31.859> let's<00:00:32.820> look<00:00:33.059> at<00:00:33.210> that

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
through the back loop let's look at that

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.970 
through the back loop let's look at that
process<00:00:33.809> today<00:00:34.790> in<00:00:36.050> general<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.350> North

knitting that goes you can see that

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.790 
knitting that goes you can see that
thread<00:00:53.850> goes<00:00:54.149> under<00:00:54.600> those<00:00:54.809> two<00:00:55.140> comes<00:00:55.530> up

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
thread goes under those two comes up

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.090 
thread goes under those two comes up
goes<00:00:56.190> around<00:00:56.550> behind<00:00:57.449> those<00:00:57.750> two<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.949> it's

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
goes around behind those two but it's

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.380 
goes around behind those two but it's
all<00:00:59.340> very<00:00:59.730> has<00:01:00.539> all<00:01:00.870> forward<00:01:01.620> motion<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.489> we

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
all very has all forward motion and we

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.630 
all very has all forward motion and we
get<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.530> effect<00:01:05.659> by<00:01:07.010> knitting<00:01:08.010> into<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
get this effect by knitting into the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.990 
get this effect by knitting into the
front<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:10.140> leg<00:01:10.350> notice<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.010> every<00:01:11.670> loop

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
front of the leg notice that every loop

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.270 
front of the leg notice that every loop
that's<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> needle<00:01:12.810> sort<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.409> has<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> leg

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
that's on the needle sort of has a leg

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.429 
that's on the needle sort of has a leg
that's<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.700> front<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.509> leg<00:01:15.720> that's<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.140> back

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
that's in front and a leg that's in back

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.740 
that's in front and a leg that's in back
meaning<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> side<00:01:18.090> opposite

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
meaning that it's on the side opposite

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.080 
meaning that it's on the side opposite
us<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.200> when<00:01:20.040> we're<00:01:20.189> doing<00:01:20.340> stockinette

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
us and when we're doing stockinette

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.830 
us and when we're doing stockinette
stitch<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:22.229> knit<00:01:23.189> into<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> front<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:24.420> we're

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
stitch we knit into the front if we're

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.840 
stitch we knit into the front if we're
knitting<00:01:25.259> from<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.009> way<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.369> needle<00:01:26.729> goes

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
knitting from this way the needle goes

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.910 
knitting from this way the needle goes
from<00:01:27.150> left<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.479> right<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.110> when<00:01:28.710> we're

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
from left to right and when we're

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.719 
from left to right and when we're
purling<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:30.540> insert<00:01:31.200> again<00:01:31.439> into<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.340> front

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
purling we insert again into that front

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.050 
purling we insert again into that front
leg<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.780> from<00:01:34.290> right<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.829> left<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.850> time

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
leg but from right to left and this time

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.940 
leg but from right to left and this time
we<00:01:36.180> have<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.390> yarn<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.900> front<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.439> we<00:01:37.560> wrap

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
we have the yarn in front and we wrap

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.550 
we have the yarn in front and we wrap
around<00:01:37.979> counterclockwise<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.390> both<00:01:39.930> cases<00:01:40.229> we

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
around counterclockwise in both cases we

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.230 
around counterclockwise in both cases we
wrap<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.040> yarn<00:01:41.070> around<00:01:41.400> counterclockwise

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
wrap the yarn around counterclockwise

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.569 
wrap the yarn around counterclockwise
and<00:01:42.750> again<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.860> convention<00:01:44.220> this

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
and again this is just a convention this

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.910 
and again this is just a convention this
is<00:01:44.640> how<00:01:44.990> this<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.350> habit<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.799> we've

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
is how this is the habit that we've

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.569 
is how this is the habit that we've
gotten<00:01:47.310> into<00:01:47.840> however<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.829> work<00:01:50.280> our

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
gotten into however if we work our

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.569 
gotten into however if we work our
stitches<00:01:51.210> through<00:01:51.689> these<00:01:51.960> back<00:01:52.439> legs<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
stitches through these back legs the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.179 
stitches through these back legs the
ones<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.119> are<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.390> opposite<00:01:55.110> side<00:01:55.979> of

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
ones that are on the opposite side of

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.899 
ones that are on the opposite side of
the<00:01:56.340> needle<00:01:56.549> from<00:01:56.939> us<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:58.520> twists<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the needle from us it twists the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.039 
the needle from us it twists the
stitches<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.540> here's<00:02:00.869> an<00:02:01.049> example<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.860> all

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
stitches and here's an example of all

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.380 
stitches and here's an example of all
twisted<00:02:04.049> knit<00:02:04.680> stitches<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.430> purl<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
twisted knit stitches I purl the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.749 
twisted knit stitches I purl the
stitches<00:02:06.840> regularly<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.950> then<00:02:08.399> when<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.610> came

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
stitches regularly and then when I came

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.839 
stitches regularly and then when I came
back<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.840> knit<00:02:10.770> all<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.370> these<00:02:11.550> stitches

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
back I knit all of these stitches

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.930 
back I knit all of these stitches
through<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.629> back

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
through the back

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.500 
through the back
Loup<00:02:13.860> regular<00:02:14.860> pearl<00:02:15.130> row<00:02:15.460> these<00:02:15.970> are<00:02:16.210> knit

Loup regular pearl row these are knit

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.830 
Loup regular pearl row these are knit
through<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.930> back<00:02:17.080> loop<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.710> you<00:02:18.070> can<00:02:18.280> see

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
through the back loop and you can see

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.060 
through the back loop and you can see
instead<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:19.960> that<00:02:20.110> nice<00:02:20.380> smooth<00:02:20.830> progression

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
instead of that nice smooth progression

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.430 
instead of that nice smooth progression
let's<00:02:21.610> take<00:02:21.820> this<00:02:22.060> thread<00:02:22.450> we<00:02:22.630> follow<00:02:22.990> it<00:02:23.290> it

let's take this thread we follow it it

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.500 
let's take this thread we follow it it
goes<00:02:23.620> under<00:02:24.370> there<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:26.290> crosses<00:02:27.190> over

I<00:03:12.520> think<00:03:12.970> there's<00:03:13.330> a<00:03:13.390> way<00:03:13.450> in<00:03:13.960> fact<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.380> would

I think there's a way in fact I would

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
love to sort of play with it and figure

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.750 
love to sort of play with it and figure
out<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.210> way<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.480> compensate<00:03:17.050> twist<00:03:17.920> one<00:03:18.430> row<00:03:18.610> in

out a way to compensate twist one row in

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.370 
out a way to compensate twist one row in
one<00:03:18.910> direction<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.720> other<00:03:19.750> row<00:03:20.170> in<00:03:20.290> the

one direction and the other row in the

one direction and the other row in the
other<00:03:20.560> direction<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:21.130> wouldn't<00:03:21.400> be<00:03:21.490> that<00:03:21.700> hard

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
other direction it wouldn't be that hard

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.500 
other direction it wouldn't be that hard
to<00:03:22.000> do

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
to do

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.260 
to do
but<00:03:22.990> you<00:03:23.709> can<00:03:23.860> see<00:03:24.040> that<00:03:24.250> this<00:03:24.400> is<00:03:24.580> shorter<00:03:25.030> it

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
but you can see that this is shorter it

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.600 
but you can see that this is shorter it
pulls<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.470> stitches<00:03:26.860> down<00:03:27.040> because<00:03:27.459> you're

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
pulls the stitches down because you're

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.910 
pulls the stitches down because you're
twisting<00:03:28.060> them<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:28.510> your<00:03:29.140> yarn<00:03:29.500> isn't

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
twisting them and so your yarn isn't

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.380 
twisting them and so your yarn isn't
flowing<00:03:30.340> as<00:03:31.230> freely<00:03:32.230> here<00:03:32.500> we<00:03:32.590> have<00:03:32.770> one<00:03:33.390> two

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
flowing as freely here we have one two

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.170 
flowing as freely here we have one two
three<00:03:34.420> four<00:03:34.810> five<00:03:35.380> rows<00:03:35.770> are<00:03:36.130> that<00:03:36.459> tall<00:03:36.820> up

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
three four five rows are that tall up

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.560 
three four five rows are that tall up
here<00:03:37.840> we<00:03:38.020> have<00:03:38.290> one<00:03:39.220> two<00:03:39.250> three<00:03:39.550> four<00:03:39.970> five

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
here we have one two three four five

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.180 
here we have one two three four five
right<00:03:40.780> under<00:03:41.050> there<00:03:41.320> they're<00:03:41.650> considerably

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
right under there they're considerably

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.120 
right under there they're considerably
shorter<00:03:42.760> from<00:03:43.209> there<00:03:43.570> to<00:03:43.989> there<00:03:44.170> so<00:03:44.950> let<00:03:45.070> me

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
shorter from there to there so let me

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.740 
shorter from there to there so let me
show<00:03:45.280> you<00:03:45.310> how<00:03:45.520> we<00:03:45.580> do<00:03:45.820> that<00:03:46.000> on<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:47.350> knit<00:03:47.650> side

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
show you how we do that on the knit side

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.360 
show you how we do that on the knit side
we<00:03:49.750> insert<00:03:50.640> in<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.940> back<00:03:52.980> wrap<00:03:53.980> around

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
we insert in the back wrap around

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.640 
we insert in the back wrap around
counterclockwise<00:03:56.520> pull<00:03:57.520> it<00:03:57.700> through<00:03:58.030> and

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
counterclockwise pull it through and

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.650 
counterclockwise pull it through and
there's<00:03:59.650> our<00:03:59.830> twisted<00:04:00.280> stitch<00:04:00.580> let<00:04:00.940> me<00:04:01.090> do<00:04:01.450> it

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
there's our twisted stitch let me do it

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:09.360 
there's our twisted stitch let me do it
again<00:04:03.750> so<00:04:04.750> that<00:04:04.959> you<00:04:05.110> can<00:04:05.320> see<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:08.220> see<00:04:09.220> how

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
again so that you can see it see how

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.040 
again so that you can see it see how
that's<00:04:09.610> twisted<00:04:09.970> at<00:04:10.300> the<00:04:10.420> bottom<00:04:10.720> of<00:04:10.870> that

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
that's twisted at the bottom of that

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.220 
that's twisted at the bottom of that
stitch<00:04:11.350> let<00:04:11.860> me<00:04:11.980> work<00:04:12.160> a<00:04:12.340> regular<00:04:12.550> stitch<00:04:13.230> by

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
stitch let me work a regular stitch by

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.120 
stitch let me work a regular stitch by
knitting<00:04:14.860> into<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:15.250> front<00:04:15.370> leg

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
knitting into the front leg

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.849 
knitting into the front leg
and<00:04:18.750> when<00:04:19.750> we<00:04:19.870> have<00:04:20.109> the<00:04:20.320> two<00:04:20.500> of<00:04:20.530> them

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
and when we have the two of them

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.470 
and when we have the two of them
together

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.220 

it's<00:04:24.200> subtle<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:25.190> difference<00:04:25.870> but<00:04:26.870> you<00:04:26.960> can

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
it's subtle the difference but you can

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.630 
it's subtle the difference but you can
see<00:04:28.150> that<00:04:29.150> these<00:04:29.900> two<00:04:30.080> legs<00:04:30.560> are<00:04:30.860> next<00:04:31.310> to<00:04:31.460> one

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
see that these two legs are next to one

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.940 
see that these two legs are next to one
another<00:04:31.990> of<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.650> V<00:04:34.690> of<00:04:35.690> these<00:04:36.050> two<00:04:36.350> legs

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
another of the V of these two legs

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.390 
another of the V of these two legs
this<00:04:37.280> one<00:04:37.550> crosses<00:04:38.210> under<00:04:38.780> that<00:04:39.290> one<00:04:39.590> on<00:04:39.920> the

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
this one crosses under that one on the

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.210 
this one crosses under that one on the
purl<00:04:40.670> side<00:04:41.090> in<00:04:41.660> order<00:04:42.140> to<00:04:42.290> purl<00:04:42.770> through<00:04:43.190> the

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
purl side in order to purl through the

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.550 
purl side in order to purl through the
back<00:04:43.340> loop<00:04:43.880> again<00:04:44.720> this<00:04:45.020> is<00:04:45.140> how<00:04:45.260> we<00:04:45.320> do<00:04:45.530> a

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
back loop again this is how we do a

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.230 
back loop again this is how we do a
regular<00:04:45.830> purl<00:04:46.310> right<00:04:46.670> through<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.060> front

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
regular purl right through the front

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.470 
regular purl right through the front
loop<00:04:47.510> from<00:04:47.930> right<00:04:48.320> to<00:04:48.350> left<00:04:48.670> we<00:04:49.670> are<00:04:50.000> we<00:04:50.360> have

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
loop from right to left we are we have

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.690 
loop from right to left we are we have
to<00:04:50.510> bring<00:04:50.900> our<00:04:51.080> needle<00:04:51.650> up<00:04:51.860> a<00:04:52.040> little<00:04:52.220> bit<00:04:52.460> like

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
to bring our needle up a little bit like

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.690 
to bring our needle up a little bit like
this<00:04:53.080> find<00:04:54.080> that<00:04:54.320> back<00:04:54.680> leg<00:04:55.070> and<00:04:57.340> insert<00:04:58.340> into

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
this find that back leg and insert into

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.010 
this find that back leg and insert into
the<00:04:58.820> back<00:04:59.000> leg<00:04:59.210> so<00:04:59.390> we're<00:04:59.480> actually<00:04:59.690> coming

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
the back leg so we're actually coming

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.940 
the back leg so we're actually coming
from<00:05:00.230> the<00:05:00.560> left<00:05:00.860> side<00:05:01.010> of<00:05:01.430> that<00:05:01.640> stitch<00:05:02.030> and

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
from the left side of that stitch and

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.050 
from the left side of that stitch and
purl<00:05:03.950> through<00:05:04.220> it<00:05:04.340> there's<00:05:04.520> a<00:05:04.580> little<00:05:04.880> bit

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
purl through it there's a little bit

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.300 
purl through it there's a little bit
more<00:05:05.270> cumbersome<00:05:05.960> than<00:05:06.590> knitting<00:05:06.890> through

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
more cumbersome than knitting through

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.680 
more cumbersome than knitting through
the<00:05:07.430> back<00:05:07.580> loop<00:05:07.820> but<00:05:08.000> it<00:05:08.120> certainly<00:05:08.480> isn't

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
the back loop but it certainly isn't

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.020 
the back loop but it certainly isn't
that<00:05:09.050> difficult

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
that difficult

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.420 
that difficult
again<00:05:11.030> these<00:05:11.930> needles<00:05:12.410> are<00:05:12.530> a<00:05:12.590> little<00:05:12.770> long<00:05:13.100> to

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
again these needles are a little long to

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.160 
again these needles are a little long to
get<00:05:13.580> them<00:05:13.760> in<00:05:13.880> front<00:05:14.060> of<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:14.300> camera<00:05:14.750> here<00:05:15.050> we

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
get them in front of the camera here we

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.230 
get them in front of the camera here we
go<00:05:16.150> insert<00:05:17.710> this<00:05:18.710> is<00:05:18.920> the<00:05:19.070> easiest<00:05:19.520> way<00:05:19.850> to<00:05:19.880> do

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
go insert this is the easiest way to do

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.150 
go insert this is the easiest way to do
it<00:05:20.390> is<00:05:20.540> to<00:05:20.750> bring<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.200> needles<00:05:21.530> up<00:05:21.770> so<00:05:22.010> they

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
it is to bring the needles up so they

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.720 
it is to bring the needles up so they
they<00:05:22.790> form<00:05:23.210> a<00:05:23.620> almost<00:05:24.620> a<00:05:24.800> little<00:05:25.040> tent<00:05:25.400> in

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
they form a almost a little tent in

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.310 
they form a almost a little tent in
front<00:05:25.790> of<00:05:26.240> you<00:05:28.270> purl<00:05:29.270> through<00:05:29.660> the<00:05:29.690> back<00:05:30.020> loop

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
front of you purl through the back loop

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.860 
front of you purl through the back loop
let<00:05:31.280> me<00:05:31.310> show<00:05:31.610> you<00:05:31.670> one<00:05:32.030> more<00:05:32.060> time

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
let me show you one more time

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.660 
let me show you one more time
that<00:05:33.110> if<00:05:33.200> we<00:05:33.320> were<00:05:33.410> purling<00:05:33.860> regularly<00:05:34.520> we

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
that if we were purling regularly we

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.890 
that if we were purling regularly we
would<00:05:34.880> purl<00:05:35.120> that<00:05:35.390> way

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
would purl that way

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.550 
would purl that way
instead<00:05:36.740> we<00:05:36.980> pivot<00:05:37.520> that<00:05:37.760> needle<00:05:38.210> and<00:05:38.560> purl

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
instead we pivot that needle and purl

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.510 
instead we pivot that needle and purl
through<00:05:39.980> the<00:05:40.040> back<00:05:40.400> loop<00:05:42.280> okay

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
through the back loop okay

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.020 
through the back loop okay
so<00:05:44.030> let's<00:05:44.360> once<00:05:45.020> again<00:05:45.230> look<00:05:45.620> at<00:05:45.710> this<00:05:46.030> little

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
so let's once again look at this little

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.150 
so let's once again look at this little
twisted<00:05:47.690> garter<00:05:48.080> stitch<00:05:48.320> edge<00:05:48.620> but<00:05:48.950> on<00:05:49.130> a

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
twisted garter stitch edge but on a

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.060 
twisted garter stitch edge but on a
little<00:05:49.460> bit<00:05:49.610> bigger<00:05:49.820> scale<00:05:50.270> here<00:05:50.990> is<00:05:51.260> regular

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
little bit bigger scale here is regular

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.820 
little bit bigger scale here is regular
garter<00:05:52.460> stitch<00:05:52.700> and<00:05:53.090> as<00:05:53.900> soon<00:05:54.110> as<00:05:54.230> I<00:05:54.380> started

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
garter stitch and as soon as I started

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.210 
garter stitch and as soon as I started
twisting<00:05:55.760> by<00:05:56.000> knitting<00:05:56.480> on<00:05:57.380> both<00:05:57.860> sides

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
twisting by knitting on both sides

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.820 
twisting by knitting on both sides
through<00:05:58.730> the<00:05:58.880> back<00:05:59.060> loop<00:05:59.390> notice<00:06:00.320> how<00:06:00.560> these

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
through the back loop notice how these

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.970 
through the back loop notice how these
little<00:06:01.340> knots<00:06:01.760> these<00:06:02.480> garter<00:06:03.380> stitch<00:06:03.620> knots

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
little knots these garter stitch knots

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.600 
little knots these garter stitch knots
got<00:06:04.550> larger<00:06:05.530> so<00:06:06.530> they're<00:06:07.100> much<00:06:07.370> more

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
got larger so they're much more

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.880 
got larger so they're much more
decorative<00:06:08.030> they're<00:06:08.270> like<00:06:08.420> little<00:06:08.690> beads<00:06:09.020> but

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
decorative they're like little beads but

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.920 
decorative they're like little beads but
this<00:06:10.250> was<00:06:10.580> the<00:06:10.730> thing<00:06:10.940> that<00:06:11.000> surprised<00:06:11.690> me

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
this was the thing that surprised me

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.470 
this was the thing that surprised me
this<00:06:12.620> is<00:06:12.800> two<00:06:13.040> stitches<00:06:13.430> of<00:06:13.580> garter<00:06:13.820> this<00:06:14.270> was

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:14.480 
this is two stitches of garter this was

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.840 
this is two stitches of garter this was
regular<00:06:14.930> garter<00:06:15.320> and<00:06:15.530> as<00:06:15.650> soon<00:06:15.920> as<00:06:16.070> I<00:06:16.250> started

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
regular garter and as soon as I started

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.780 
regular garter and as soon as I started
doing<00:06:17.630> the<00:06:17.780> twisted<00:06:18.410> end<00:06:18.710> garter<00:06:19.430> stitch<00:06:19.610> I

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790 
doing the twisted end garter stitch I

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.610 
doing the twisted end garter stitch I
didn't<00:06:20.090> twist<00:06:20.270> that<00:06:20.540> stitch<00:06:20.840> just<00:06:21.110> the<00:06:21.260> very

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
didn't twist that stitch just the very

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.070 
didn't twist that stitch just the very
end<00:06:21.920> stitch<00:06:22.250> both<00:06:22.820> on<00:06:23.150> the<00:06:23.360> right<00:06:23.600> side<00:06:23.870> of<00:06:23.990> the

and the wrong side of the fabric and

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.820 
and the wrong side of the fabric and
notice<00:06:27.320> how<00:06:28.010> it<00:06:28.630> opened<00:06:29.630> up<00:06:29.810> the<00:06:30.470> width

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
notice how it opened up the width

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.900 
notice how it opened up the width
between<00:06:31.310> these<00:06:32.240> rows<00:06:32.630> I<00:06:33.050> did<00:06:33.650> not<00:06:33.920> notice<00:06:34.400> this

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:34.910 
between these rows I did not notice this

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.330 
between these rows I did not notice this
at<00:06:35.210> the<00:06:35.690> smaller<00:06:36.470> scale

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
at the smaller scale

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.150 
at the smaller scale
these<00:06:37.760> garter<00:06:38.570> rows<00:06:38.870> are<00:06:39.380> pulled<00:06:39.800> more

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
these garter rows are pulled more

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.430 
these garter rows are pulled more
tightly<00:06:40.520> together<00:06:41.090> and<00:06:41.540> when<00:06:41.780> I<00:06:41.810> went<00:06:42.139> back

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
tightly together and when I went back

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.640 
tightly together and when I went back
and<00:06:42.830> looked<00:06:43.280> at<00:06:43.460> the<00:06:43.580> original<00:06:43.699> swatch<00:06:44.650> sure

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
and looked at the original swatch sure

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.969 
and looked at the original swatch sure
enough<00:06:46.010> this<00:06:46.729> these<00:06:47.720> are<00:06:48.080> actually<00:06:48.650> these<00:06:48.800> are

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:48.979 
enough this these are actually these are

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:51.129 
enough this these are actually these are
the<00:06:49.010> ones<00:06:49.250> with<00:06:49.490> the<00:06:49.520> twisted<00:06:50.210> edge<00:06:50.510> stitches

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:51.139 
the ones with the twisted edge stitches

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.610 
the ones with the twisted edge stitches
they<00:06:52.040> opened<00:06:52.729> up<00:06:52.940> they<00:06:53.540> spread<00:06:53.960> out<00:06:54.020> so<00:06:54.440> that

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
they opened up they spread out so that

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.870 
they opened up they spread out so that
it's<00:06:54.830> almost<00:06:55.490> as<00:06:56.000> if<00:06:56.389> this<00:06:57.080> gauge<00:06:57.650> is<00:06:57.979> longer

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:58.880 
it's almost as if this gauge is longer

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.969 
it's almost as if this gauge is longer
than<00:06:59.030> stockinette<00:06:59.600> I'm<00:06:59.780> not<00:07:00.080> entirely<00:07:00.560> sure<00:07:00.830> I
