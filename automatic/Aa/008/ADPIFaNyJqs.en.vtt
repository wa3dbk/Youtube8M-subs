00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
the couch behind the bed somewhere in

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.230 
the couch behind the bed somewhere in
the<00:01:22.500> house<00:01:22.650> all<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.640> got<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.090> go<00:01:24.210> over

the house all you got to do is go over
to<00:01:24.420> your<00:01:24.479> smartphone<00:01:24.780> open<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> app<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.890> it's

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
to your smartphone open the app and it's

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.789 
to your smartphone open the app and it's
a<00:01:26.729> little<00:01:26.909> radar<00:01:27.330> display<00:01:27.720> essentially<00:01:28.590> just

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
a little radar display essentially just

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.700 
a little radar display essentially just
locate<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.820> glasses<00:01:30.200> by<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.229> Bluetooth

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
locate the glasses by the Bluetooth

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.770 
locate the glasses by the Bluetooth
signal<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.640> don't<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.450> worry<00:01:33.659> about

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
signal so you don't have to worry about

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.719 
signal so you don't have to worry about
you<00:01:34.320> know<00:01:34.409> did<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.619> leave<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.040> at<00:01:35.100> home<00:01:35.159> on<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
you know did you leave it at home on the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.730 
you know did you leave it at home on the
train<00:01:35.759> or<00:01:36.200> somewhere<00:01:37.200> down<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> street

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
train or somewhere down the street

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.100 
train or somewhere down the street
hopefully<00:01:38.610> every<00:01:39.270> pair<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.509> eyeglasses<00:01:39.750> will

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
hopefully every pair of eyeglasses will

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.840 
hopefully every pair of eyeglasses will
have<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.619> future<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> weon

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
have this in the future so the weon

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.880 
have this in the future so the weon
glasses<00:01:42.270> are<00:01:42.509> expected<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.140> ship<00:01:43.229> by<00:01:43.590> May<00:01:43.860> of

glasses are expected to ship by May of

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.780 
glasses are expected to ship by May of
2014<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.869> approximate<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:47.189> are<00:01:47.250> told<00:01:47.520> it

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
2014 and the approximate we are told it

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.620 
2014 and the approximate we are told it
should<00:01:48.060> cost<00:01:48.299> them<00:01:48.540> 129<00:01:49.530> euros<00:01:49.950> or<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.790> u.s.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
should cost them 129 euros or the u.s.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.330 
should cost them 129 euros or the u.s.
dollar<00:01:51.840> equivalent<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.829> that's<00:01:53.040> probably

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
dollar equivalent so that's probably

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.850 
dollar equivalent so that's probably
going<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.549> be<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> same<00:01:53.880> price<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.750> also<00:01:55.259> will

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
going to be the same price it also will

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.429 
going to be the same price it also will
be<00:01:56.009> available<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.930> America<00:01:57.930> as<00:01:58.140> well<00:01:58.380> as
