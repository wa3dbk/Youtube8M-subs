slightly<00:01:20.909> down<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.630> throws<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.310> machine<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
slightly down it throws the machine and

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.179 
slightly down it throws the machine and
error<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.090> when<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.110> starts<00:01:25.409> up<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.710> starts<00:01:25.860> up

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
error and when it starts up it starts up

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.460 
error and when it starts up it starts up
with<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.700> joystick<00:01:27.180> basically<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> down

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470

laying around definitely recommend

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.309 
laying around definitely recommend
trying<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.090> switch<00:03:18.269> out<00:03:18.420> batteries<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.170> see

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
trying to switch out batteries and see

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.920 
trying to switch out batteries and see
if<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.560> changes<00:03:19.980> things<00:03:20.040> up<00:03:20.569> sometimes<00:03:21.569> the
