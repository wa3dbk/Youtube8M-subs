I'm level XP and let's go I'll
fast-forward<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:25.050> bit<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.470> let's<00:02:26.190> see<00:02:26.430> what

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
fast-forward this bit and let's see what

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:35.300 
fast-forward this bit and let's see what
happens<00:02:26.790> when<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.630> can<00:02:27.870> rank<00:02:28.290> him<00:02:28.470> up<00:02:34.310> all

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
happens when you can rank him up all

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.350 
of things there are a lot of planned
features<00:06:43.110> so<00:06:43.950> I<00:06:43.980> think<00:06:44.490> this<00:06:44.580> would<00:06:44.790> be<00:06:44.820> a<00:06:44.970> very

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
features so I think this would be a very

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.070 
features so I think this would be a very
interesting<00:06:45.900> mod<00:06:46.320> to<00:06:46.500> keep<00:06:46.680> your<00:06:46.830> eye<00:06:47.040> on
