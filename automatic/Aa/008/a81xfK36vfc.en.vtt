00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.290 
I'm doing the technique that I found out
that<00:02:24.450> actually<00:02:24.570> works<00:02:25.080> is<00:02:25.700> squeezing<00:02:26.700> the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
that actually works is squeezing the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.660 
that actually works is squeezing the
dampeners<00:02:27.840> usually<00:02:28.650> with<00:02:28.980> steering<00:02:29.370> or

something your Beach turning them but

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.480 
something your Beach turning them but
I'm<00:02:33.810> sort<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.200> stick<00:02:34.560> I'm<00:02:34.800> sort<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.100> squeezing

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
I'm sort of stick I'm sort of squeezing

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.700 
I'm sort of stick I'm sort of squeezing
them<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.910> seems<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.270> work<00:02:36.300> also<00:02:36.990> it<00:02:37.200> seems<00:02:37.470> to

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
them it seems to work also it seems to

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.280 
them it seems to work also it seems to
work<00:02:37.920> going<00:02:38.340> better<00:02:38.550> anti-clockwise<00:02:39.290> right

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
work going better anti-clockwise right
