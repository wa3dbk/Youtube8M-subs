00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:04.520
 the nations website portimão dot com one talks now with one of the greatest storytellers 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.350
 of Brazilian football 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.610
 nilton milk 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.080
 you have been present in the most diverse sports events like 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.409
 is organizing the 2011 Copa America 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.919
 look if we compare Copa America with other events of this size 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.419
 and antipolio of the champions of europe world cup 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.099
 he has many problems in the Copa America in terms of organization 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.509
 we have problems ceasing the people who are working as volunteers 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.669
 they have very little information, the things in the states for you come to you 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.140
 find the place where you always get very complicated parking efe 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.290
 we try to organize by inheritance 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.840
 as the receptivity of the Argentine people is perceived and with the cup event 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.130
 America since the fish 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.000
 only 6 93 years the main national team has not won any title 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.540
 really looks like the Copa America that is being played basically in the 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.740
 inside this time has no game we stated that humans of the region 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.460
 next town that advertisement some matches 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.520
 I have an Argentinean excitement because the people of the interior 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.820
 not used to see the selection play there were other selections of others 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.060
 countries the gari 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.770
 in these games that I went to do reiterated being a great excitement 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.040
 and the Argentines are always very fanatical by the selection of them readers 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.530
 do not have confidence are frank of the team played badly of the legs departed 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.490
 but supporters were the games and I stayed and I think as the selection goes 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.680
 evolving in the competition and going to be charged but with that they compete now 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.780
 to control 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.250
 with the end of the first phase what can be assessed from the technical level 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.010
 presented by the teams so far 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.020
 boal was a technical mistake to roll on tv we had no big thing 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.630
 mainly because the big ones are the argentine argentina uruguay and they 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.950
 Little disappointed with broken legs 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.320
 and there you have themis as for example with the turkey team their day or she until 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.270
 the Paraguayan 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.360
 which stands out but I think they have appeared much more because the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.040
 others went wrong than because they had made great 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.070
 of all the creed races play for example in the first phase think who 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.420
 best played was the chile was the most regular was the most successful 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.580
 we will have a very good second half in the third game but we did not get excited 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.639
 so far 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.569
 nilton you cited venezuela as 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.720
 the other as a country that does not 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.790
 70 of the cart so much tradition in the day to present a good football and comes if 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.050
 highlighting and soccer presented by the direction these first three games 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.989
 arrives to surprise 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.759
 it surprises us if you compare it 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:28.309
 the alc she has done in the last qualifiers she has evolved nothing to 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:31.069
 time of all the Latin American selections the venezuela that has 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.120
 increased growth 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.599
 but as from a very low point home was the weakest selection of the 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.649
 continent then 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:41.329
 her best still talking to her means her in the last two 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.989
 for example did not stay in the last case and proposed to occupy it 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.470
 but it's still very limited football but anyway 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.409
 is one of the selections that more evolved than the continent 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.529
 taking advantage of the fact that you have played all the matches of the Brazilian team together with 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:56.759
 noriega and paulo césar vasconcellos 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:01.139
 do you think that even with these these problems presented so far the 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.139
 brazil remains favorite local title conquest 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:05.629
 I guess so 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.919
 I think that by history by tradition and even by football in Brazil there are 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.989
 time to play more than I'm playing I think it's the fact that I won the 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.319
 last round is going to improve the team had traumas confident we have few 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.830
 begins to meet the people of nocal begins to get more together then I 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.279
 I still think that Brazil and, like Argentines, I think that whoever 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:26.749
 space of Argentines now comes very strong in the semifinal so I 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:28.649
 I think Brazil both favors them. 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:33.199
 nilton fernando ramôa with more respect on the profession of journalist 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.879
 what are the main difficulties you faced during your career 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:41.289
 in the profession until it reaches this current level, which is a reference that is 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:44.019
 Diniz pine dishes are starting to 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.259
 everybody here 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:46.719
 duarte 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.110
 will follow the model 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.129
 had as inspiration 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.379
 Paul started to attack it was difficult for everyone 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.189
 the monarch is always that thing of you have to fight for a place in the 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:58.400
 job market that is not always very easy you have no experience 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.199
 in you compete with people who even experience 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.759
 so in the beginning the difficulty was the city with the first to find one 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:07.999
 work and start learning because in college you do not 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:10.539
 instrumented in the professional square 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:14.089
 To apathy a working bike is you try to find a space in the 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:15.139
 the area that you most 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:16.549
 that has affinity 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.220
 In the house the sport but then I started by the sport I did many other things until 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.599
 to get into the sport I want that I wanted 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.860
 I think they can work and if you first get into the profession 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.110
 is the part of the meek italy try to find a way should not be me in the 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.219
 best 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:34.039
 for us who are starting their journalism career mainly in the 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:34.669
 sport 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.960
 how can we use impartiality that is a fact that you use very well 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.400
 in their nations 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.590
 Look, I really think the house made the sipra land search. 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.500
 journalist does not always accept trying to balance the building cci in 100% 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.009
 in installments what no one and it is not because you have a 7 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.259
 the culture high question of what you carry since your birth 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.240
 influences their decision making even in their 

00:04:59.239 --> 00:04:59.979
 opinion 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.110
 but I think this trauma picks it up so I guess the more you read 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.719
 the more you dig into the subjects the more you study 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:06.460
 subjects 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.330
 but you will have a critical sense of allowing 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.669
 come close to a hundred bias in but I confess I found it very difficult 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.290
 one even with many years of career is always very difficult feels 100% 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:18.819
 impartial 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:22.289
 and to finalize minutes but we want you to send your message 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.449
 journalism dishes and for all those who are interested in the 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.860
 journalistic medium that intends to work in this medium a message of 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.740
 support incentive 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.729
 well I'd tell you that I have a daughter my eldest daughter 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.689
 journalist in the then when she 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:36.889
 It's in this time of 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.909
 so go to college and learn to be a journalist 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:41.879
 It was the advice I gave her. 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:45.460
 I think the fundamental in you and journalist you are always very bad 

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:47.690
 incarnate is that you have to read everything 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.590
 not only for you like miguel carqueija in the sport of home writing 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.509
 columns at first in college 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:56.589
 is therefore if you know why you save a little and you know the variety 

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:58.330
 What is happening in the world, politics? 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.879
 the lion always very light everything and very 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:04.189
 I read books and magazines go to the movies the theater 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:07.089
 because this will give you pay 17 giving training 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:09.800
 it gives you good sense and gives you critical sense right 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.319
 so it's critical that you get ready in the square English journalist 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.409
 worrying about the area you are going to occupy 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:18.089
 from my being a tyrant on the way 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:22.469
 commissions continue to a point to grow here the narrator milton milk a woman 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:24.680
 with the idol of the Brazilian soccer nation 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.160
 Thank you very much, my time, and I thank you all for the 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.350
 a good way they are trying to get into the profession to be very successful 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.260
 thank you guys
