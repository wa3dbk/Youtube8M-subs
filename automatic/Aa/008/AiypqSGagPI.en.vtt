all<00:00:06.240> right<00:00:06.450> separate<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:06.990> model<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.500> send<00:00:07.799> it

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
all right separate the model and send it

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.040 
all right separate the model and send it
to<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.010> printer<00:00:08.099> this<00:00:08.639> is<00:00:08.910> an<00:00:09.179> example<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.960> that

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
to a printer this is an example of that

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.490 
to a printer this is an example of that
and<00:00:10.710> this<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.309> how<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.910> was<00:00:12.150> actually<00:00:12.450> sent<00:00:13.259> all

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
and this is how it was actually sent all

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.039 
and this is how it was actually sent all
these<00:00:14.009> pieces<00:00:14.250> basically<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.420> whole<00:00:15.690> frame

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
these pieces basically the whole frame

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.529 
these pieces basically the whole frame
looked<00:00:16.440> something<00:00:16.859> like<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.480> just

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
looked something like this and I just

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.140 
looked something like this and I just
took<00:00:19.050> each<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.890> individual<00:00:20.550> sub<00:00:20.880> tools

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
took each of the individual sub tools

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.090 
took each of the individual sub tools
it's<00:00:21.480> clicking<00:00:21.930> them<00:00:22.080> using<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> transpose

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
it's clicking them using the transpose

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.400 
it's clicking them using the transpose
lines<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:23.939> positioning<00:00:24.539> them<00:00:24.750> off<00:00:24.930> and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
lines and just positioning them off and

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.950 
lines and just positioning them off and
rotating<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.220> just<00:00:26.519> placing<00:00:27.060> them<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.480> space

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
rotating and just placing them in space

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.589 
rotating and just placing them in space
setting<00:00:28.590> them<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:29.010> an<00:00:29.429> actual<00:00:29.789> order<00:00:30.150> here

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
setting them on an actual order here

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.880 
setting them on an actual order here
it's<00:00:30.779> go<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> side<00:00:31.349> here<00:00:31.560> into<00:00:31.830> our

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
it's go to the side here into our

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.380 
it's go to the side here into our
perspectives<00:00:32.520> they're<00:00:32.759> all<00:00:32.910> those<00:00:33.210> two

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
perspectives they're all those two

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.670 
perspectives they're all those two
sitting<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.870> ground<00:00:34.200> there<00:00:34.410> they<00:00:34.530> may<00:00:34.649> be

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
sitting on that ground there they may be

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.990 
sitting on that ground there they may be
one<00:00:34.920> or<00:00:35.010> two<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> little<00:00:35.460> bit<00:00:35.550> high<00:00:35.700> this

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
one or two it's a little bit high this

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.580 
one or two it's a little bit high this
is<00:00:36.180> what<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.630> should<00:00:36.750> look<00:00:36.840> like<00:00:36.989> you're

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
is what it should look like you're

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.040 
is what it should look like you're
sending<00:00:38.040> them<00:00:38.100> all<00:00:38.280> that's<00:00:38.550> separate<00:00:39.180> keys<00:00:39.629> to

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
sending them all that's separate keys to

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.720 
sending them all that's separate keys to
a<00:00:40.079> printer<00:00:40.469> now<00:00:40.710> once<00:00:40.950> they<00:00:41.129> get<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.460> they<00:00:41.610> can

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
a printer now once they get it they can

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.520 
a printer now once they get it they can
actually<00:00:41.879> manipulate<00:00:42.210> these<00:00:42.840> shapes<00:00:43.200> further

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
actually manipulate these shapes further

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.619 
actually manipulate these shapes further
if<00:00:43.710> needed<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.000> basically<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
if needed but this is basically the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.049 
if needed but this is basically the
split<00:00:45.899> up<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.200> had<00:00:46.320> one<00:00:46.590> question<00:00:47.430> or<00:00:47.640> idea

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
split up you had one question or idea

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.760 
split up you had one question or idea
that<00:00:48.329> was<00:00:48.450> basically<00:00:48.780> taking<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> model<00:00:49.469> and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
that was basically taking the model and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.619 
that was basically taking the model and
splitting<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.340> up<00:00:50.430> automatic<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.480> write

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
splitting it up automatic can you write

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.540 
splitting it up automatic can you write
a<00:00:51.660> plug-in<00:00:51.899> split<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.590> model<00:00:52.920> well<00:00:53.399> there's

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
a plug-in split this model well there's

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.880 
a plug-in split this model well there's
actually<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:54.329> tool<00:00:54.600> inside<00:00:55.050> ZBrush<00:00:55.590> called

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
actually this tool inside ZBrush called

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.279 
actually this tool inside ZBrush called
expose<00:00:56.460> are<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.180> about<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.690> show<00:00:58.020> us<00:00:58.170> a

expose are you about to show us a
practical<00:00:58.530> ease<00:00:58.920> for<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> exposed<00:01:00.149> tool<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.690> am

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
practical ease for the exposed tool I am

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.360 
practical ease for the exposed tool I am
I'm<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.379> show<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.710> practical<00:01:02.309> use

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
I'm going to show you a practical use

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.910 
I'm going to show you a practical use
for<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.789> exposed<00:01:03.090> oh<00:01:03.239> I'm<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.899> delighted<00:01:04.110> so

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
for the exposed oh I'm so delighted so

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.710 
for the exposed oh I'm so delighted so
over<00:01:05.309> here<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.790> expose<00:01:06.240> option

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
over here you have this expose option

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.020 
over here you have this expose option
and<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.049> if<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.409> zoom<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:08.760> model

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
and so if you zoom that on your model

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.640 
and so if you zoom that on your model
and<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.360> click<00:01:09.570> expose<00:01:09.990> its<00:01:10.500> gonna

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
and you just click expose its gonna

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.410 
and you just click expose its gonna
basically<00:01:10.860> shatter<00:01:11.369> your<00:01:11.610> model<00:01:11.880> all<00:01:12.150> over

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
basically shatter your model all over

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.700 
basically shatter your model all over
the<00:01:12.540> place<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:12.960> taking<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.530> just

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
the place it's taking it and just

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.039 
the place it's taking it and just
growing<00:01:14.189> every<00:01:14.850> single<00:01:14.880> sub<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.659> hat<00:01:15.840> all

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
growing every single sub so you hat all

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.140 
growing every single sub so you hat all
over<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> world<00:01:16.799> hit<00:01:17.369> expose<00:01:17.700> again<00:01:17.970> and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
over in the world hit expose again and

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.999 
over in the world hit expose again and
you'll<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.420> go<00:01:18.630> back<00:01:19.229> together<00:01:19.409> over<00:01:19.890> here

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
you'll all go back together over here

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.440 
you'll all go back together over here
you<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> control<00:01:20.790> for<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.180> sexual

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
you have a control for the sexual

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.539 
you have a control for the sexual
exposed<00:01:21.900> amount<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.320> well<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.250> have

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
exposed amount of well and so you have

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.399 
exposed amount of well and so you have
XY<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.119> Z<00:01:24.270> values<00:01:24.720> everything<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.350> can

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
XY and Z values everything so you can

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.080 
XY and Z values everything so you can
kind<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.680> determine<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.340> know<00:01:26.430> how<00:01:26.640> much

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
kind of determine you know how much

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.910 
kind of determine you know how much
these<00:01:27.360> pieces<00:01:27.600> are<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.960> move<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.530> in

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
these pieces are going to move and in

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.789 
these pieces are going to move and in
what<00:01:29.220> access<00:01:29.790> over<00:01:30.479> here<00:01:30.630> kind<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.170> see<00:01:31.470> how

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
what access over here kind of see how

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.260 
what access over here kind of see how
far<00:01:32.040> they're<00:01:32.250> going<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.430> go<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.850> just<00:01:33.060> want<00:01:33.240> to

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
far they're going to go you just want to

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.359 
far they're going to go you just want to
all<00:01:33.479> split<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.110> one<00:01:34.320> access<00:01:34.799> or<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.250> know

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
all split in one access or you know

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.460 
all split in one access or you know
multiple<00:01:35.610> accesses<00:01:36.240> use<00:01:36.689> go<00:01:36.930> here<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.200> change

multiple accesses use go here and change

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.950 
multiple accesses use go here and change
this<00:01:38.040> expose<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.390> gonna<00:01:39.600> do<00:01:39.780> that

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
this expose here and it's gonna do that

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.289 
this expose here and it's gonna do that
or<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.560> well<00:01:40.860> after<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.369> have<00:01:41.520> these<00:01:41.790> kind<00:01:42.270> of

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
or you well after you have these kind of

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.550 
or you well after you have these kind of
exposed<00:01:42.659> down<00:01:42.869> now<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.259> little<00:01:43.439> bit

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
exposed down now it's a little bit

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.020 
exposed down now it's a little bit
random<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.220> does<00:01:44.369> put<00:01:44.640> them<00:01:44.759> everywhere

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
random so it does put them everywhere

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.030 
random so it does put them everywhere
and<00:01:45.210> kind<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.600> you're<00:01:45.869> mixed<00:01:46.200> matched<00:01:46.439> areas

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
and kind of you're mixed matched areas

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.499 
and kind of you're mixed matched areas
well<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.460> come<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.909> kind<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.119> move<00:01:48.329> these

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
well you come in and kind of move these

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.240 
well you come in and kind of move these
around<00:01:48.659> again<00:01:49.290> after<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.829> have<00:01:49.920> exposed

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
around again after you have exposed

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.100 
around again after you have exposed
they're<00:01:50.640> not<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.119> go<00:01:51.270> back<00:01:51.600> nice<00:01:52.079> and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
they're not going to go back nice and

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.870 
they're not going to go back nice and
neat<00:01:52.500> after<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.890> start<00:01:53.100> moving<00:01:53.280> them<00:01:53.579> if<00:01:53.729> you

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
neat after you start moving them if you

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.609 
neat after you start moving them if you
click<00:01:54.060> expose<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:54.810> start<00:01:55.049> transforming

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
click expose and then start transforming

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.789 
click expose and then start transforming
again<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.790> be<00:01:56.909> wary<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.619> start

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
again so just be wary of that you start

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.139 
again so just be wary of that you start
playing<00:01:59.130> with<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.399> functionality<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.090> I

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
playing with this functionality so I

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.030 
playing with this functionality so I
probably<00:02:00.390> save<00:02:00.780> your<00:02:00.930> tool<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.409> duplicate<00:02:01.890> it

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
probably save your tool for duplicate it

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.319 
probably save your tool for duplicate it
but<00:02:02.280> before<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.579> start<00:02:02.850> moving<00:02:02.969> stuff<00:02:03.270> around

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
but before you start moving stuff around

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.090 
but before you start moving stuff around
but<00:02:03.750> now<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.140> go<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.590> say<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.950> this

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
but now you can go in and say like this

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.370 
but now you can go in and say like this
guy<00:02:05.250> was<00:02:05.430> interpenetrating<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.780> part<00:02:07.049> here

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
guy was interpenetrating this part here

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.990 
guy was interpenetrating this part here
so<00:02:07.409> it's<00:02:07.799> probably<00:02:08.160> not<00:02:08.250> wearing<00:02:08.550> what<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.849> so

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
so it's probably not wearing what it so

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.669 
so it's probably not wearing what it so
I'm<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.119> draw<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> transpose<00:02:09.959> line<00:02:10.200> out<00:02:10.410> and

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
I'm just draw a transpose line out and

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.820 
I'm just draw a transpose line out and
just<00:02:10.860> move<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.550> space<00:02:11.879> just<00:02:12.390> move

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
just move it in space just move

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.620 
just move it in space just move
atoms<00:02:13.100> of<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.400> or<00:02:13.640> air<00:02:13.880> seeing<00:02:14.270> these<00:02:14.390> little

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
atoms of that or air seeing these little

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.780 
atoms of that or air seeing these little
wheels<00:02:14.870> over<00:02:15.170> here<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.830> take<00:02:16.010> those<00:02:16.190> move<00:02:16.670> them

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
wheels over here to take those move them

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.880 
wheels over here to take those move them
out<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.390> they<00:02:17.570> may<00:02:17.750> go<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.960> little<00:02:18.110> bit<00:02:18.530> crazy

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
out and they may go a little bit crazy

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.350 
out and they may go a little bit crazy
because<00:02:19.040> they're<00:02:19.220> actually<00:02:19.370> still<00:02:19.940> kind<00:02:20.240> of

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
because they're actually still kind of

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.540 
because they're actually still kind of
rose<00:02:20.570> into<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.020> original<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.710> exposed<00:02:22.130> shape

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
rose into the original and exposed shape

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.980 
rose into the original and exposed shape
so<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:22.790> can<00:02:22.910> see<00:02:23.000> they're<00:02:23.120> actually<00:02:23.390> pop<00:02:23.630> over

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
so you can see they're actually pop over

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.900 
so you can see they're actually pop over
here<00:02:24.020> that's<00:02:24.500> where<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.710> explosion<00:02:25.280> was<00:02:25.430> but

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
here that's where the explosion was but

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.730 
here that's where the explosion was but
you<00:02:26.000> know<00:02:26.270> kind<00:02:26.450> of<00:02:26.510> moving<00:02:26.720> them<00:02:26.900> out<00:02:27.050> to<00:02:27.530> my

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
you know kind of moving them out to my

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.130 
you know kind of moving them out to my
brother<00:02:27.800> explode<00:02:28.760> them<00:02:29.060> in<00:02:29.630> your<00:02:29.720> seat<00:02:29.960> now

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
brother explode them in your seat now

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.020 
brother explode them in your seat now
once<00:02:30.440> you<00:02:30.560> have<00:02:30.590> them<00:02:30.920> all<00:02:31.070> exploded<00:02:31.730> there's

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
once you have them all exploded there's

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.610 
once you have them all exploded there's
two<00:02:32.330> ways<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:32.750> can<00:02:32.840> kind<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:33.020> get<00:02:33.140> us<00:02:33.230> out<00:02:33.410> in

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
two ways you can kind of get us out in

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.740 
two ways you can kind of get us out in
this<00:02:33.740> exploded<00:02:34.250> warm<00:02:34.490> so<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.180> one<00:02:35.330> way<00:02:35.480> if<00:02:35.690> you

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
this exploded warm so the one way if you

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.580 
this exploded warm so the one way if you
already<00:02:35.930> gone<00:02:36.080> through<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.380> kind<00:02:36.560> of

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
already gone through and kind of

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.410 
already gone through and kind of
dynamesh<00:02:37.070> your<00:02:37.280> models<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:37.730> this<00:02:37.850> scene<00:02:38.120> here

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
dynamesh your models so this scene here

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.690 
dynamesh your models so this scene here
has<00:02:38.570> already<00:02:38.750> been<00:02:38.870> dynamesh<00:02:39.350> so<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:39.590> have<00:02:39.740> 435

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
has already been dynamesh so I have 435

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.540 
has already been dynamesh so I have 435
points<00:02:41.240> I<00:02:41.270> miss<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.690> go<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.900> tool<00:02:42.200> go<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.710> sub

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
points I miss you go to tool go to sub

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.730 
points I miss you go to tool go to sub
tool<00:02:43.940> so<00:02:44.510> tool<00:02:44.720> once<00:02:44.840> over<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.170> day<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.500> do

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
tool so tool once over the day and do

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.650 
tool so tool once over the day and do
merge<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.310> just<00:02:46.610> do<00:02:46.760> merge<00:02:47.000> visible<00:02:47.240> and

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
merge and just do merge visible and

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.060 
merge and just do merge visible and
that's<00:02:47.780> going<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:47.990> take<00:02:48.110> everything<00:02:48.740> where

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
that's going to take everything where

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.160 
that's going to take everything where
that<00:02:49.340> is<00:02:49.550> in<00:02:49.760> position<00:02:50.240> and<00:02:50.450> give<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:50.959> new

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
that is in position and give you a new

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.530 
that is in position and give you a new
tool<00:02:51.470> so<00:02:51.740> now<00:02:51.920> you<00:02:51.980> have<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:52.400> nice<00:02:52.670> exposed

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
tool so now you have this nice exposed

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.110 
tool so now you have this nice exposed
tools<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.830> then<00:02:54.950> just<00:02:55.070> go<00:02:55.160> to<00:02:55.220> export<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:55.910> can

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
tools and then just go to export you can

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.660 
tools and then just go to export you can
now<00:02:56.180> export<00:02:56.570> that<00:02:56.720> out<00:02:56.780> as<00:02:57.200> an<00:02:57.410> obj<00:02:57.830> well<00:02:58.550> if

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
now export that out as an obj well if

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.890 
now export that out as an obj well if
you<00:02:58.760> don't<00:02:58.820> want<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.090> do<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.240> merge<00:02:59.540> process

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
you don't want to do the merge process

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.410

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
to Z plug-in and we can just go to this

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.710

select that shape and send it out and
all<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.600> other<00:03:26.750> parts<00:03:27.019> will<00:03:27.170> go<00:03:27.260> out<00:03:27.410> that

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
all the other parts will go out that

all the other parts will go out that
same<00:03:27.739> side<00:03:27.950> but<00:03:28.130> that<00:03:28.160> will<00:03:28.489> give<00:03:28.610> you<00:03:28.760> that
