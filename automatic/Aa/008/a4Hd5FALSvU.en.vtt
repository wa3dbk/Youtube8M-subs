00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
explosive at the same time so basically

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.590 
explosive at the same time so basically
I'm<00:00:23.340> gonna<00:00:23.490> get<00:00:23.609> started<00:00:24.029> because<00:00:24.119> his

way sorry it's three grandal's this is

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.490 
way sorry it's three grandal's this is
the<00:00:32.399> gale<00:00:32.640> at<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> deck<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.050> only<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the gale at the deck but is only to the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.819 
the gale at the deck but is only to the
end<00:00:34.680> phase<00:00:34.940> but<00:00:35.940> if<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.110> another<00:00:37.350> one<00:00:37.590> he

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
end phase but if you have another one he

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.950 
end phase but if you have another one he
walks<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.190> filter<00:00:38.489> at<00:00:38.579> 17<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.300> he's<00:00:39.570> 16

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
walks to the filter at 17 and he's 16

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.959 
walks to the filter at 17 and he's 16
overall<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.950> if<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.129> figure<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.520> do<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> math

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
overall so if you figure you do the math

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.360 
overall so if you figure you do the math
he's<00:00:42.629> taking<00:00:42.809> on<00:00:43.020> anybody<00:00:43.530> he's<00:00:44.010> bumping

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
he's taking on anybody he's bumping

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.670 
he's taking on anybody he's bumping
heads<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.730> 32<00:00:45.090> hitter<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.989> anything

and he's walking 19 the only dislike I

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.060 
and he's walking 19 the only dislike I
like<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> book<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.470> don't<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.650> about<00:01:25.799> him<00:01:25.950> as

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
like a book I don't like about him as

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.100 
like a book I don't like about him as
the<00:01:26.130> fact<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.400> he<00:01:26.549> got<00:01:26.580> zero<00:01:26.880> defense<00:01:27.180> but

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the fact that he got zero defense but

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.060 
the fact that he got zero defense but
otherwise<00:01:28.640> he<00:01:29.640> gets<00:01:29.820> real<00:01:30.060> beefy<00:01:30.420> really<00:01:30.720> fast

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
otherwise he gets real beefy really fast

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.890 
otherwise he gets real beefy really fast
so<00:01:32.070> especially<00:01:32.909> if<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.210> want<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.600> push

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
so especially if you want for that push

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.600 
so especially if you want for that push
you'll<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.740> able<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.070> sit<00:01:35.220> there<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.430> run

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
you'll be able to sit there like run

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.350 
you'll be able to sit there like run
over<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> lot<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.119> stuff<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:37.909> three<00:01:38.909> grandal's

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
over a lot of stuff on three grandal's

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.789 
over a lot of stuff on three grandal's
the<00:01:39.630> reason<00:01:39.840> why<00:01:39.930> run<00:01:40.110> three<00:01:40.290> granules<00:01:40.710> is

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the reason why run three granules is

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.050 
the reason why run three granules is
because<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.220> more<00:01:41.310> for<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.579> quick<00:01:41.790> holte

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
because it's more for the quick holte

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.310 
because it's more for the quick holte
gate<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.509> want<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:42.930> my<00:01:42.960> hand<00:01:43.229> as

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
gate and I want to get in my hand as

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.530 
gate and I want to get in my hand as
soon<00:01:43.439> as<00:01:43.530> possible<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.070> having<00:01:44.939> multiples<00:01:45.420> a

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
soon as possible and having multiples a

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.749 
soon as possible and having multiples a
bit<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:45.960> pretty<00:01:46.530> decent<00:01:46.740> since<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.610> doesn't

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
bit it's pretty decent since it doesn't

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.969 
bit it's pretty decent since it doesn't
have<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.030> effect<00:01:48.509> likes<00:01:48.780> kyle<00:01:49.170> i<00:01:49.470> can

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
have the effect likes kyle i can

infinities<00:04:56.870> I<00:04:57.140> like<00:04:57.800> this<00:04:57.950> effect<00:04:58.370> because

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
infinities I like this effect because

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.750 
infinities I like this effect because
this<00:05:00.470> deck<00:05:00.740> really<00:05:01.010> doesn't<00:05:01.310> have<00:05:01.370> nothing<00:05:01.700> to

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
this deck really doesn't have nothing to

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.800 
get over spirit reaper except for two
cards<00:05:04.100> so<00:05:04.700> this<00:05:04.970> is<00:05:05.000> just<00:05:05.240> switching<00:05:05.600> them<00:05:05.690> to

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
cards so this is just switching them to

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.240 
cards so this is just switching them to
attack<00:05:06.110> mode<00:05:06.320> and<00:05:06.590> it's<00:05:06.740> getting<00:05:06.890> prone<00:05:07.220> for

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
attack mode and it's getting prone for

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.640 
attack mode and it's getting prone for
the<00:05:07.550> whole<00:05:07.700> TK<00:05:08.060> so<00:05:08.960> I'm<00:05:09.050> gonna<00:05:09.170> get<00:05:09.290> me<00:05:09.440> another
