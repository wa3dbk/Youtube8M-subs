00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:04.249 

so<00:00:02.669> in<00:00:02.820> this<00:00:02.970> tutorial<00:00:03.210> we're<00:00:03.929> going<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.110> take

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
so in this tutorial we're going to take

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.160 
so in this tutorial we're going to take
a<00:00:04.319> look<00:00:04.529> at<00:00:04.710> collision<00:00:05.520> noise<00:00:05.759> so<00:00:06.690> I'm<00:00:07.020> just

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
a look at collision noise so I'm just

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.270 
a look at collision noise so I'm just
going<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.350> create<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.980> cloner<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:09.980> add<00:00:10.980> some

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
going to create a cloner and add some

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.169 
going to create a cloner and add some
spheres<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.330> cloner<00:00:13.700> I'm<00:00:14.700> gonna<00:00:14.880> put<00:00:15.089> it

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
spheres to the cloner I'm gonna put it

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.390 
spheres to the cloner I'm gonna put it
into<00:00:15.330> grid<00:00:15.960> array<00:00:17.510> and<00:00:19.039> I'm<00:00:20.039> just<00:00:20.189> going<00:00:20.340> to

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
into grid array and I'm just going to

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.230 
into grid array and I'm just going to
reduce<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:21.150> size<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.720> sphere<00:00:23.060> I'm<00:00:24.060> gonna

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
reduce the size of the sphere I'm gonna

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.580 
reduce the size of the sphere I'm gonna
raise<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.510> up<00:00:27.529> I'm<00:00:28.529> going<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.740> create<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.070> floor

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
raise it up I'm going to create a floor

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.729 
raise it up I'm going to create a floor
and<00:00:32.210> I'm<00:00:33.210> gonna<00:00:33.360> add<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> rigidbody<00:00:33.870> tag<00:00:34.500> to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
and I'm gonna add a rigidbody tag to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.229 
and I'm gonna add a rigidbody tag to
both<00:00:34.950> these<00:00:35.160> objects<00:00:36.320> tags<00:00:38.000> simulation<00:00:39.000> tags

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
both these objects tags simulation tags

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.600 
both these objects tags simulation tags
rigidbody<00:00:40.280> and<00:00:42.440> on<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.739> corner<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.340> need<00:00:44.430> to

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
rigidbody and on the corner I need to

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.119 
rigidbody and on the corner I need to
set<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.300> inherit<00:00:45.930> tag<00:00:46.140> apply<00:00:46.710> tag<00:00:46.950> to

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
set it to inherit tag apply tag to

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.740 
set it to inherit tag apply tag to
children<00:00:47.840> individual<00:00:48.840> elements<00:00:49.410> or<00:00:50.629> play<00:00:51.629> it

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
children individual elements or play it

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.279 
children individual elements or play it
back<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.940> we<00:00:53.940> get<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.449> bounce<00:00:56.870> so<00:00:57.870> I'm<00:00:58.140> just

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
back and we get a bounce so I'm just

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.110 
back and we get a bounce so I'm just
gonna<00:00:58.379> increase<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> bounce<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.760> these

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
gonna increase the bounce of these

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.450 
gonna increase the bounce of these
spheres<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:01.109> something<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.680> bit<00:01:01.859> higher<00:01:02.100> like

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
spheres to something a bit higher like

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.620 
spheres to something a bit higher like
90<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:06.320> you'll<00:01:07.320> notice<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.979> each

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
90 and you'll notice that each

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.270 
90 and you'll notice that each
individual<00:01:09.630> sphere<00:01:10.110> bounces<00:01:10.740> slightly

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
individual sphere bounces slightly

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.840 
individual sphere bounces slightly
differently<00:01:12.770> as<00:01:13.770> if<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.130> surface<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.640> uneven

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
differently as if the surface is uneven

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.350 
differently as if the surface is uneven
so<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.780> one<00:01:16.020> maybe<00:01:16.290> moves<00:01:16.820> slightly<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:18.090> this

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
so this one maybe moves slightly in this

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.359 
so this one maybe moves slightly in this
direction<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:19.229> then<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.650> one<00:01:19.890> moves<00:01:20.159> in

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
direction and then this one moves in

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.719 
direction and then this one moves in
this<00:01:20.549> direction<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:22.020> there's<00:01:22.890> an<00:01:23.100> element<00:01:23.280> of

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
this direction so there's an element of

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.060 
this direction so there's an element of
randomness<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:26.720> that<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:28.020> due<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.530> collision

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
randomness and that is due to collision

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.770 
randomness and that is due to collision
noise<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:31.590> if<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.979> set<00:01:32.250> collision<00:01:32.729> noise<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
noise so if I set collision noise the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.630 
noise so if I set collision noise the
zero<00:01:35.030> played<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.180> back<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.310> see<00:01:38.610> that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
zero played it back you can see that

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.490 
zero played it back you can see that
everything<00:01:39.299> bounces<00:01:39.979> identically<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:43.200> if<00:01:43.350> I

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
everything bounces identically so if I

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.620 
everything bounces identically so if I
just<00:01:43.680> go<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.009> side<00:01:44.700> panel<00:01:45.149> should<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
just go to the side panel should be a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.609 
just go to the side panel should be a
bit<00:01:45.810> more<00:01:45.990> obvious<00:01:50.899> as<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.110> can<00:01:52.259> see<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
bit more obvious as you can see the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.569 
bit more obvious as you can see the
spheres<00:01:53.100> until<00:01:53.729> they<00:01:53.880> hit<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.090> ground<00:01:55.579> they

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
spheres until they hit the ground they

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.060 
spheres until they hit the ground they
perfectly<00:01:57.149> overlap<00:01:57.719> until<00:01:58.680> they<00:01:58.799> start

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
perfectly overlap until they start

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.350 
perfectly overlap until they start
moving<00:01:59.399> on<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> ground

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.070 

so<00:02:05.360> that<00:02:05.840> just<00:02:06.079> adds<00:02:06.259> like<00:02:06.439> that<00:02:06.740> bit<00:02:06.979> of<00:02:08.080> kind

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
so that just adds like that bit of kind

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.900 
so that just adds like that bit of kind
of<00:02:09.140> randomness<00:02:09.649> as<00:02:10.009> if<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.280> surface<00:02:10.729> is

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
of randomness as if the surface is

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.550 
of randomness as if the surface is
slightly<00:02:11.150> uneven<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:14.060> if<00:02:14.780> we<00:02:15.050> go<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.290> the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
slightly uneven and if we go to the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.559 
slightly uneven and if we go to the
extreme<00:02:16.099> end<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.730> scale<00:02:16.940> at<00:02:17.300> 100%<00:02:18.190> 90%

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.210 

basically<00:02:23.569> we<00:02:23.720> get<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:23.870> very<00:02:24.140> chaotic<00:02:24.530> kind<00:02:25.130> of

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
basically we get a very chaotic kind of

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.900 
basically we get a very chaotic kind of
result

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:38.470 

I'll<00:02:28.910> try<00:02:29.330> 40%<00:02:30.140> see<00:02:30.500> what<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.769> does<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:38.060> can

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
I'll try 40% see what that does you can

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.330 
I'll try 40% see what that does you can
also<00:02:38.630> use<00:02:39.049> collision<00:02:39.530> noise<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:40.069> kind<00:02:40.250> of

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
also use collision noise to kind of

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.440 
also use collision noise to kind of
control<00:02:40.730> erratic<00:02:41.150> simulations<00:02:43.000> so<00:02:44.000> if<00:02:44.299> in

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
control erratic simulations so if in

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.330 
control erratic simulations so if in
your<00:02:44.569> simulation<00:02:44.870> there's<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.709> lot<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.010> kind<00:02:46.220> of

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
your simulation there's a lot of kind of

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.470 
your simulation there's a lot of kind of
jittering

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
jittering

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.610 
jittering
once<00:02:48.049> the<00:02:48.200> objects<00:02:49.810> kind<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:50.900> made<00:02:51.110> contact

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
once the objects kind of made contact

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.620 
once the objects kind of made contact
with<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:51.950> ground<00:02:52.190> but<00:02:52.640> it<00:02:52.790> kind<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.060> keeps<00:02:53.390> on

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
with the ground but it kind of keeps on

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.289 
with the ground but it kind of keeps on
kind<00:02:53.870> of<00:02:53.959> moving<00:02:54.849> reducing<00:02:55.849> the<00:02:55.940> collision

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
kind of moving reducing the collision

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.410 
kind of moving reducing the collision
noise<00:02:56.480> can<00:02:56.750> help<00:02:56.959> sometimes<00:02:57.380> as<00:02:57.590> well<00:02:58.420> so

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
noise can help sometimes as well so

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.410 
noise can help sometimes as well so
that's<00:02:59.900> just<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.590> quick<00:03:01.099> explanation<00:03:01.549> of<00:03:02.000> what

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
that's just a quick explanation of what

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.990 
that's just a quick explanation of what
collision<00:03:02.870> noise<00:03:03.019> does<00:03:03.549> hope<00:03:04.549> you<00:03:04.730> found<00:03:04.880> this

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000
