00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.179 
thing to notice about this kick drum is
that<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.630> there's<00:01:15.840> nothing<00:01:16.020> inside<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.560> at<00:01:16.830> all

involved in acoustics generally speaking

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.050 
involved in acoustics generally speaking
too<00:01:22.020> many<00:01:22.229> reflections<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:23.159> any<00:01:23.400> recording

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
too many reflections in any recording

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.300 
too many reflections in any recording
can<00:01:24.780> work<00:01:24.960> against<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> first<00:01:26.189> thing

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
of a quilt here it's going to have

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.499 
of a quilt here it's going to have
actors<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.310> absorber<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.180> little<00:01:33.329> bit<00:01:33.420> of

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
actors in absorber and a little bit of

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.569 
actors in absorber and a little bit of
diffuser<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.500> break<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> reflections

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
diffuser to break up the reflections

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.370 
diffuser to break up the reflections
inside<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.090> kick<00:01:36.270> drum<00:01:36.540> it'll<00:01:36.960> keep<00:01:37.200> the

it<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> little<00:01:41.100> bit<00:01:41.220> more<00:01:41.369> punchy<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:42.030> well<00:01:42.180> so

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
it a little bit more punchy as well so

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.539 
it a little bit more punchy as well so
I'm<00:01:42.840> gonna<00:01:42.930> start<00:01:43.140> doing<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.470> now<00:01:46.310> okay<00:01:47.310> then

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
I'm gonna start doing that now okay then

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.030 
I'm gonna start doing that now okay then
I've<00:01:47.820> now<00:01:48.210> treated<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.049> inside<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.770> kick

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
I've now treated the inside of the kick

towards the front skin the sound can
become<00:02:15.799> a<00:02:15.860> little<00:02:16.040> bit<00:02:16.220> click<00:02:16.489> here<00:02:16.760> but<00:02:17.450> as<00:02:17.540> a

sacrifice we sometimes lose a little bit
of<00:02:19.310> weight<00:02:19.549> okay

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
of weight okay

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.479 
of weight okay

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
skin will lose a little bit of click but

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.970 
skin will lose a little bit of click but
gain<00:02:29.689> a<00:02:29.720> little<00:02:29.840> bit<00:02:29.959> more<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:30.530> body<00:02:30.739> and

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
gain a little bit more of the body and

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.369 
gain a little bit more of the body and
then<00:02:31.069> whatnot<00:02:31.370> bit<00:02:31.609> more<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:31.879> the<00:02:32.000> weight<00:02:32.379> so

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
then whatnot bit more of the weight so

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.929 
then whatnot bit more of the weight so
just<00:02:33.680> for<00:02:33.769> level<00:02:34.010> one<00:02:34.129> recording<00:02:34.549> drums<00:02:34.670> I'm

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:34.939 
just for level one recording drums I'm

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:35.890 
just for level one recording drums I'm
actually<00:02:35.060> going<00:02:35.299> to<00:02:35.390> go<00:02:35.510> off<00:02:35.599> for<00:02:35.629> a<00:02:35.780> little

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
actually going to go off for a little

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.319 
actually going to go off for a little
bit<00:02:35.989> in<00:02:36.140> between<00:02:36.230> so<00:02:36.590> I'm<00:02:36.680> roughly<00:02:36.980> halfway

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
bit in between so I'm roughly halfway

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.149 
bit in between so I'm roughly halfway
inside<00:02:38.329> the<00:02:38.510> drum<00:02:38.720> I'm<00:02:39.109> gonna<00:02:39.319> position<00:02:39.890> the

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
inside the drum I'm gonna position the

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.420 
inside the drum I'm gonna position the
kick<00:02:40.310> drum<00:02:40.519> microphone<00:02:41.650> slightly<00:02:42.650> off<00:02:42.769> axes

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
kick drum microphone slightly off axes

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.979 
kick drum microphone slightly off axes
so<00:02:43.640> it's<00:02:43.760> not<00:02:43.849> pointing<00:02:44.239> directly<00:02:44.359> at<00:02:44.840> the

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
so it's not pointing directly at the

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.789 
so it's not pointing directly at the
center<00:02:45.500> at<00:02:45.889> the<00:02:45.950> sense<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.459> front<00:02:46.670> skin

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
center at the sense of the front skin

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.199 
center at the sense of the front skin
the<00:02:48.799> song<00:02:49.040> world<00:02:49.280> will<00:02:49.430> end<00:02:49.609> up<00:02:49.790> looking

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
the song world will end up looking

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:59.559 
the song world will end up looking
something<00:02:50.829> like<00:02:52.599> so<00:02:57.099> okay<00:02:58.099> the<00:02:58.370> next<00:02:58.730> advanced

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
something like so okay the next advanced

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.390 
something like so okay the next advanced
level<00:02:59.840> of<00:02:59.930> recording<00:03:00.409> drums<00:03:00.530> especially<00:03:01.340> the

level of recording drums especially the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.300 
level of recording drums especially the
kick<00:03:01.579> drum<00:03:01.790> is<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.989> use<00:03:03.200> two<00:03:03.470> microphones<00:03:03.680> to

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
kick drum is to use two microphones to

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.770 
kick drum is to use two microphones to
get<00:03:04.430> around<00:03:04.579> this<00:03:04.700> problem<00:03:04.760> of<00:03:05.239> compromise

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
get around this problem of compromise

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.140 
get around this problem of compromise
between<00:03:06.049> click<00:03:06.620> or<00:03:06.799> wait<00:03:07.099> and<00:03:07.639> when

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
between click or wait and when

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.199 
between click or wait and when
introduced<00:03:08.510> now<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:09.170> sin<00:03:09.709> either<00:03:09.859> a<00:03:10.280> 6<00:03:10.730> or<00:03:10.909> 2

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
introduced now a sin either a 6 or 2

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.140 
introduced now a sin either a 6 or 2
which<00:03:12.200> is<00:03:12.500> again<00:03:13.220> a<00:03:13.280> really<00:03:13.730> rich<00:03:14.120> deep

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
which is again a really rich deep

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.750 
which is again a really rich deep
Bachmann<00:03:15.049> response<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:16.250> I'm<00:03:16.370> actually<00:03:16.519> going

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
Bachmann response so I'm actually going

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.460 
Bachmann response so I'm actually going
to<00:03:16.849> use<00:03:16.939> now<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.209> d112<00:03:17.780> I'm<00:03:18.169> going<00:03:18.290> to<00:03:18.349> move

even<00:03:41.239> further<00:03:43.720> I'm<00:03:44.720> now<00:03:44.840> going<00:03:45.019> to<00:03:45.079> position

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:45.229 
even further I'm now going to position

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:50.770 
even further I'm now going to position
in<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.069> 6<00:03:46.310> or<00:03:46.489> tool<00:03:48.729> in<00:03:49.729> this<00:03:49.940> area<00:03:50.299> around<00:03:50.510> about

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
in a 6 or tool in this area around about

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.539 
in a 6 or tool in this area around about
here<00:03:50.989> now<00:03:51.229> slightly<00:03:51.650> off<00:03:51.889> faxes<00:03:52.549> again<00:03:54.549> and

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
here now slightly off faxes again and

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:56.729 
here now slightly off faxes again and
now<00:03:55.699> we've<00:03:55.819> got<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.060> best<00:03:56.239> of<00:03:56.419> both<00:03:56.629> worlds

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
now we've got the best of both worlds

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.140 
now we've got the best of both worlds
and<00:03:57.739> I'm<00:03:57.829> also<00:03:58.040> making<00:03:58.190> sure<00:03:58.489> that<00:03:58.699> no

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
and I'm also making sure that no

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.830 
and I'm also making sure that no
microphone<00:03:59.750> or<00:04:00.019> stand<00:04:00.859> is<00:04:01.549> touching<00:04:02.239> anything

further you've got the flexibility to do
it<00:04:38.479> why<00:04:39.319> not<00:04:39.560> introduce<00:04:39.710> a<00:04:40.190> third<00:04:40.220> microphone

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
it why not introduce a third microphone

it why not introduce a third microphone
here<00:04:41.389> I've<00:04:41.630> got<00:04:41.870> another<00:04:42.680> good<00:04:42.830> low<00:04:43.009> frequency

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
here I've got another good low frequency

this third microphone pointing down at
the<00:04:54.259> kick<00:04:54.410> drum<00:04:54.680> maybe<00:04:55.430> anything<00:04:55.669> from<00:04:56.000> one

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
the kick drum maybe anything from one

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.540 
the kick drum maybe anything from one
foot<00:04:56.479> to<00:04:56.539> for<00:04:57.050> even<00:04:57.349> three<00:04:57.530> foot<00:04:57.830> away<00:04:57.979> it's

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
foot to for even three foot away it's

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.920 
foot to for even three foot away it's
becoming<00:04:58.849> much<00:04:59.000> more<00:04:59.150> of<00:04:59.210> an<00:04:59.360> ambient<00:04:59.780> might

becoming much more of an ambient might
but<00:05:00.169> can<00:05:00.289> catch<00:05:00.530> a<00:05:00.650> little<00:05:00.860> bit<00:05:00.949> more<00:05:01.160> of<00:05:01.759> just

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
but can catch a little bit more of just

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.300 
but can catch a little bit more of just
an<00:05:02.389> effect<00:05:02.750> of<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.050> kick<00:05:03.259> drum<00:05:03.500> okay<00:05:03.650> can<00:05:04.220> be

an effect of the kick drum okay can be

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.890 
an effect of the kick drum okay can be

skin now and it's an issue called the
proximity<00:05:45.349> effects<00:05:45.710> and<00:05:45.800> I've<00:05:45.860> mentioned

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
proximity effects and I've mentioned

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.770 
proximity effects and I've mentioned
while<00:05:46.430> that<00:05:46.610> keeps<00:05:46.849> your<00:05:47.000> mag<00:05:47.210> form<00:05:47.509> gets

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
while that keeps your mag form gets

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.140 
while that keeps your mag form gets
closer<00:05:48.110> it<00:05:48.620> gets<00:05:48.770> more<00:05:49.070> click<00:05:49.430> if<00:05:49.789> that

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
closer it gets more click if that

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.939 
closer it gets more click if that
microphone<00:05:50.840> gets<00:05:51.050> closer<00:05:51.469> than<00:05:51.770> one

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
microphone gets closer than one

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.339 
microphone gets closer than one
centimeter<00:05:52.789> away<00:05:52.969> from<00:05:53.180> the<00:05:53.270> front<00:05:53.479> skin<00:05:53.750> we

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349 
centimeter away from the front skin we

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.110 
centimeter away from the front skin we
then<00:05:54.560> get<00:05:54.710> a<00:05:54.770> re<00:05:55.130> increase<00:05:55.699> of<00:05:55.969> low

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
then get a re increase of low

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.420 
then get a re increase of low
frequencies<00:05:56.870> so<00:05:57.169> we<00:05:57.259> get<00:05:57.380> more<00:05:57.680> bass<00:05:58.009> if<00:05:58.310> you

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
frequencies so we get more bass if you

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.060 
frequencies so we get more bass if you
like<00:05:58.610> and<00:05:59.300> it's<00:05:59.630> an<00:05:59.780> effect<00:06:00.110> or<00:06:00.289> the<00:06:00.349> proximity

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
like and it's an effect or the proximity

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.300 
like and it's an effect or the proximity
effect<00:06:01.750> in<00:06:02.750> this<00:06:03.020> instance<00:06:03.530> it<00:06:03.740> might<00:06:04.099> be<00:06:04.280> a

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
effect in this instance it might be a

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.670 
effect in this instance it might be a
good<00:06:04.550> thing<00:06:04.759> in<00:06:05.389> other<00:06:05.599> recording<00:06:06.199> scenarios

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
good thing in other recording scenarios

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.409 
good thing in other recording scenarios
maybe<00:06:06.860> guitars<00:06:07.310> or<00:06:07.580> something<00:06:07.909> that

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
maybe guitars or something that

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:10.510 
maybe guitars or something that
increased<00:06:08.840> may<00:06:09.229> not<00:06:09.440> so<00:06:09.620> should<00:06:09.800> it<00:06:09.889> be<00:06:10.009> such<00:06:10.430> a

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
increased may not so should it be such a

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.939 
increased may not so should it be such a
good<00:06:10.669> thing<00:06:10.909> so<00:06:11.419> again<00:06:11.740> experimentation<00:06:12.740> but

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:12.949 
good thing so again experimentation but

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:23.080 
good thing so again experimentation but
we<00:06:13.099> be<00:06:13.639> aware<00:06:13.880> of<00:06:13.940> the<00:06:14.210> proximity<00:06:14.509> effect

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.150
