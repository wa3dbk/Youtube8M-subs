talking<00:00:07.660> about<00:00:07.779> the<00:00:08.050> difference<00:00:08.380> between<00:00:08.440> a

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:08.680 
talking about the difference between a

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.890 
talking about the difference between a
polyurethane<00:00:09.070> board<00:00:09.790> and<00:00:10.030> an<00:00:10.330> epoch<00:00:10.660> see

this<00:01:07.090> is<00:01:07.300> our<00:01:07.830> epoxied<00:01:08.830> version<00:01:09.340> of<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.970> skull

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
this is our epoxied version of the skull

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.600 
this is our epoxied version of the skull
with<00:01:10.660> a<00:01:10.690> custom<00:01:11.230> image<00:01:11.560> on<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.800> bottom<00:01:12.160> if

with a custom image on the bottom if

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.940 
with a custom image on the bottom if
you're<00:01:12.850> looking<00:01:13.180> for<00:01:13.330> durability<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:13.990> flow<00:01:14.410> a

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
you're looking for durability and flow a

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.010 
you're looking for durability and flow a
little<00:01:15.310> bit<00:01:15.520> more<00:01:15.730> flow<00:01:16.060> with<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.480> less<00:01:16.660> foam

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
little bit more flow with the less foam

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.430 
little bit more flow with the less foam
I<00:01:17.290> definitely<00:01:18.010> go<00:01:18.190> EPS<00:01:18.820> EPS<00:01:19.720> is<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:20.020> way<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.200> go

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
I definitely go EPS EPS is the way to go

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.320 
I definitely go EPS EPS is the way to go
if<00:01:20.770> you<00:01:21.160> feel<00:01:21.400> that<00:01:21.580> you<00:01:21.730> like<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.150> more

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
if you feel that you like the more

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.030 
if you feel that you like the more
traditional<00:01:22.900> field<00:01:23.140> definitely

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
traditional field definitely

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.370 
traditional field definitely
polyurethane<00:01:25.000> polyurethane<00:01:25.810> you<00:01:26.290> know

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
polyurethane polyurethane you know

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.520 
polyurethane polyurethane you know
polyester<00:01:27.010> boards<00:01:28.050> will<00:01:29.050> be<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.350> more

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
polyester boards will be the more

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.400 
polyester boards will be the more
traditional<00:01:30.130> epoxies<00:01:31.030> it's<00:01:31.480> a<00:01:31.990> little<00:01:32.260> bit

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
traditional epoxies it's a little bit

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.530 
traditional epoxies it's a little bit
more<00:01:32.590> of<00:01:32.710> an<00:01:32.830> advanced<00:01:33.280> technology<00:01:33.580> but<00:01:34.360> it's

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
more of an advanced technology but it's

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.140 
more of an advanced technology but it's
also<00:01:34.720> very<00:01:34.900> good<00:01:35.460> 30%<00:01:36.460> stronger<00:01:36.760> than

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
also very good 30% stronger than

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.820 
also very good 30% stronger than
polyurethane<00:01:37.870> and<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.490> I<00:01:39.670> would<00:01:39.850> definitely

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
polyurethane and and I would definitely

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.760 
polyurethane and and I would definitely
definitely<00:01:41.830> recommend<00:01:42.700> it

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
definitely recommend it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.100 
definitely recommend it
you<00:01:44.190> know<00:01:44.310> that's<00:01:44.520> uh<00:01:44.790> that's<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.720> difference

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
you know that's uh that's the difference

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.350 
you know that's uh that's the difference
really<00:01:46.350> between<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:47.130> polyurethane<00:01:47.730> and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
really between the polyurethane and

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.520 
really between the polyurethane and
epoxy<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:49.680> there's<00:01:50.190> also<00:01:50.400> minor<00:01:50.790> differences

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
epoxy but there's also minor differences

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.630 
epoxy but there's also minor differences
