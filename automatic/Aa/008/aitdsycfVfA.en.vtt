coloured beacons in Minecraft for Xbox
and<00:00:06.450> minecraft<00:00:06.810> for<00:00:07.170> PlayStation<00:00:07.770> these<00:00:08.130> are

a<00:00:08.309> new<00:00:08.490> feature<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:08.910> came<00:00:09.179> in<00:00:09.330> with<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.540> last

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
a new feature that came in with the last

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.450 
a new feature that came in with the last
update<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.380> they<00:00:10.590> perhaps<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.980> best<00:00:11.219> one

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
update and they perhaps the best one

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.129 
update and they perhaps the best one
because<00:00:11.639> as<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.300> can<00:00:12.420> see<00:00:12.630> right<00:00:12.780> here<00:00:12.840> they

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
because as you can see right here they

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.810 
because as you can see right here they
like<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.440> change<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.920> color<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.190> beacons<00:00:14.519> by

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
like to change the color of beacons by

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.430 
like to change the color of beacons by
placing<00:00:15.240> stained-glass<00:00:15.509> over<00:00:16.020> them<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.320> even

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
placing stained-glass over them so even

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.840 
placing stained-glass over them so even
though<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.830> just<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.070> giant<00:00:17.310> pixel<00:00:17.730> art

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
though this is just a giant pixel art

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.429 
though this is just a giant pixel art
beacon<00:00:18.180> there<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> beacon<00:00:18.869> inside<00:00:19.260> there

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
beacon there is a beacon inside there

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.900 
beacon there is a beacon inside there
and<00:00:19.590> by<00:00:19.710> placing<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.189> stained-glass<00:00:20.430> over<00:00:20.850> it

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
and by placing the stained-glass over it

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.519 
and by placing the stained-glass over it
I've<00:00:21.060> changed<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.600> be<00:00:21.750> green<00:00:21.990> instead<00:00:22.470> of

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
I've changed it to be green instead of

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.870 
I've changed it to be green instead of
white<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.100> really<00:00:23.279> cool<00:00:23.430> feature<00:00:23.609> but

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
white it's a really cool feature but

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.830 
white it's a really cool feature but
rather<00:00:24.119> than<00:00:24.269> spending<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.570> whole<00:00:24.720> video

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
rather than spending the whole video

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.420 
rather than spending the whole video
talking<00:00:25.140> about<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.619> figured<00:00:26.039> be<00:00:26.160> much

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
talking about that I figured be much

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.920 
talking about that I figured be much
more<00:00:26.640> useful<00:00:26.699> for<00:00:27.090> me<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.300> show<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> really

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
more useful for me to show you a really

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.810 
more useful for me to show you a really
practical<00:00:28.230> build<00:00:28.740> guide<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.640> is

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
practical build guide of it and that is

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.790 
practical build guide of it and that is
gonna<00:00:29.970> be<00:00:30.210> rainbow<00:00:30.869> beacons<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.529> I'll<00:00:31.650> show

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
gonna be rainbow beacons so I'll show

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.530 
gonna be rainbow beacons so I'll show
you<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.949> step-by-step<00:00:32.250> build<00:00:32.820> guide<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.180> how<00:00:33.480> to

what<00:00:47.160> you're<00:00:47.250> gonna<00:00:47.309> need<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.579> actually<00:00:47.760> build

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
what you're gonna need to actually build

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.290 
what you're gonna need to actually build
this<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> whole<00:00:48.809> stack<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.200> Lionel<00:00:49.829> gold

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
this is a whole stack of Lionel gold

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.979 
this is a whole stack of Lionel gold
obviously<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.390> could<00:00:51.480> use<00:00:51.629> diamonds<00:00:51.930> or

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
obviously you could use diamonds or

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.510 
obviously you could use diamonds or
emeralds<00:00:52.020> too<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.800> think<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.190> know<00:00:53.280> iron

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
emeralds too but I think you know iron

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.250 
emeralds too but I think you know iron
of<00:00:53.640> gold<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> users<00:00:54.390> once<00:00:54.570> again<00:00:54.780> survival

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
of gold of the users once again survival

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.500 
of gold of the users once again survival
you're<00:00:55.500> gonna<00:00:55.590> need<00:00:55.739> 19<00:00:56.340> beacons<00:00:56.850> which<00:00:57.120> again

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
you're gonna need 19 beacons which again

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.610 
you're gonna need 19 beacons which again
you<00:00:57.660> need<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.840> come<00:00:57.960> up<00:00:58.050> with<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.170> nineteen

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
you need to come up with a nineteen

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.380 
you need to come up with a nineteen
times<00:00:58.829> which<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.280> be<00:00:59.430> tricky<00:00:59.699> but<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.210> still

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
times which can be tricky but it's still

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.520 
times which can be tricky but it's still
something<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.690> might<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:00.989> want<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.230> do<00:01:01.350> and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
something you might just want to do and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.599 
something you might just want to do and
then<00:01:01.859> you're<00:01:01.980> also<00:01:02.129> going<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.309> want<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.520> have

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
then you're also going to want to have

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.369 
then you're also going to want to have
at<00:01:02.760> least<00:01:02.789> nine<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.539> each<00:01:03.719> color<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.110> stained

glass so he see these the colors you
need<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.380> might<00:01:07.530> need<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> double<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.310> for

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
need you might need a double that for

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.800 
need you might need a double that for
red<00:01:08.729> you'll<00:01:08.909> see<00:01:09.090> why<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.330> little<00:01:09.450> bit<00:01:09.659> but

let's move on to actually building this

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.840 
let's move on to actually building this
thing<00:01:16.290> because<00:01:16.680> what<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.130> want<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.340> do<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.610> you

it right because when we place the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.230 
it right because when we place the
beacons<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.280> second<00:01:41.640> we'll<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:42.030> able<00:01:42.180> to

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
beacons in a second we'll be able to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.520 
beacons in a second we'll be able to
seal<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> stuff<00:01:42.720> you'll<00:01:43.020> also<00:01:43.140> you've<00:01:43.380> got<00:01:43.500> a

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
seal the stuff you'll also you've got a

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.380 
seal the stuff you'll also you've got a
break<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:43.979> exactly<00:01:44.460> one<00:01:44.820> block<00:01:45.119> left

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
break to have exactly one block left

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.030 
break to have exactly one block left
over<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.259> one<00:01:46.470> block<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:46.950> do

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
over and this one block you can do

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.499 
over and this one block you can do
anything<00:01:47.280> with<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.850> throw<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.240> away<00:01:48.329> you

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
anything with you can throw it away you

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.420 
anything with you can throw it away you
can<00:01:48.869> place<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.409> ground<00:01:49.619> randomly<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.280> can

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
can place on the ground randomly you can

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.319 
can place on the ground randomly you can
do<00:01:50.520> whatever<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.820> want<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.149> definitely

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
do whatever you want but I definitely

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.700 
do whatever you want but I definitely
recommend<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.899> keep<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.229> because<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.439> block<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
recommend you keep it because I block a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.690 
recommend you keep it because I block a
find<00:01:52.979> there's<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> lot<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.430> give<00:01:53.549> away<00:01:53.610> but

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
find there's a lot to give away but

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.090 
find there's a lot to give away but
anyway<00:01:54.570> let's<00:01:54.750> move<00:01:55.049> on<00:01:55.170> for<00:01:55.290> beacons<00:01:55.619> now<00:01:56.040> you

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
anyway let's move on for beacons now you

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.830 
anyway let's move on for beacons now you
will<00:01:56.280> place<00:01:56.490> these<00:01:56.670> down<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.149> middle<00:01:57.450> next

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
will place these down in the middle next

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.240 
will place these down in the middle next
to<00:01:57.899> each<00:01:57.990> other<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:58.979> pretty

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
to each other like so this is pretty

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.340 
to each other like so this is pretty
cool<00:01:59.549> because<00:01:59.670> even<00:02:00.390> without<00:02:00.540> coloring<00:02:01.140> Lixin

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
cool because even without coloring Lixin

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.840 
cool because even without coloring Lixin
you<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:02.159> having<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.729> know

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
you can see having just you know

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.700 
you can see having just you know
nineteen<00:02:03.420> beacons<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.990> sky<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.350> really

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
nineteen beacons in the sky is a really

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.990 
nineteen beacons in the sky is a really
cool<00:02:04.860> thing<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.100> look<00:02:05.310> at<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.790> do<00:02:05.880> this

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
cool thing to look at you can do this

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.280 
cool thing to look at you can do this
with<00:02:06.090> as<00:02:06.210> many<00:02:06.299> as<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:06.630> you'd<00:02:07.140> have<00:02:07.259> a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
with as many as you like you'd have a

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.839 
with as many as you like you'd have a
whole<00:02:07.530> layer<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.220> world<00:02:08.429> be<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.700> this

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
whole layer of the world be like this

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.339 
whole layer of the world be like this
but<00:02:09.090> still<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.420> just<00:02:09.539> think<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.110> pretty

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
but still I just think it's a pretty

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.080 
but still I just think it's a pretty
cool<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.830> do<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.430> now<00:02:11.910> let's

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
cool that you can do this and now let's

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.309 
cool that you can do this and now let's
show<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.270> how<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.420> actually<00:02:12.540> start<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:13.080> so

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
show you how to actually start this so

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.940 
show you how to actually start this so
to<00:02:13.379> get<00:02:13.709> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
to get the

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.710 
to get the
rainbow<00:02:14.190> colors<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:15.090> know<00:02:15.209> you<00:02:15.270> use<00:02:15.510> these

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
rainbow colors you know you use these

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.540 
rainbow colors you know you use these
colors<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.379> slowly<00:02:16.739> fade<00:02:17.099> from<00:02:17.340> one

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
colors and you slowly fade from one

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.979 
colors and you slowly fade from one
color<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.940> other<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.300> if<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:18.870> go

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
color to the other so if you just go

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.619 
color to the other so if you just go
straight<00:02:19.319> from<00:02:19.500> red<00:02:20.269> here<00:02:21.269> you<00:02:21.360> go<00:02:21.450> straight

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
straight from red here you go straight

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.210 
straight from red here you go straight
from<00:02:21.840> red<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.200> orange<00:02:22.230> like<00:02:22.650> this<00:02:22.860> you'll

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
from red to orange like this you'll

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.860 
from red to orange like this you'll
notice<00:02:23.550> it's<00:02:23.730> just<00:02:23.760> like<00:02:24.030> red<00:02:24.300> red<00:02:24.510> red<00:02:24.690> orange

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
notice it's just like red red red orange

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.660 
notice it's just like red red red orange
and<00:02:25.349> that's<00:02:25.500> not<00:02:25.680> really<00:02:25.890> what<00:02:26.280> we're<00:02:26.430> going

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
and that's not really what we're going

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.860 
and that's not really what we're going
for<00:02:26.700> here<00:02:26.879> what<00:02:27.120> we<00:02:27.209> are<00:02:27.239> going<00:02:27.660> for<00:02:27.840> here

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
for here what we are going for here

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.479 
for here what we are going for here
instead<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.440> we<00:02:28.800> want<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:28.980> go<00:02:29.040> for<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.250> fade

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
instead is we want to go for a fade

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:30.949 
instead is we want to go for a fade
between<00:02:29.819> red<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.000> orange<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.569> way<00:02:30.690> we<00:02:30.810> do

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
between red and orange so the way we do

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.870 
between red and orange so the way we do
that<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:31.319> we<00:02:31.590> have<00:02:31.769> two<00:02:32.250> bits<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.519> red<00:02:32.700> here

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
that is we have two bits of red here

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.940 
that is we have two bits of red here
then<00:02:33.269> one<00:02:33.480> both<00:02:33.630> orange<00:02:33.930> then<00:02:34.230> one<00:02:34.590> bit<00:02:34.739> of<00:02:34.769> red

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
then one both orange then one bit of red

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.710 
then one both orange then one bit of red
to<00:02:34.980> two<00:02:35.280> bits<00:02:35.430> orange<00:02:35.760> then<00:02:36.060> just<00:02:36.300> one<00:02:36.480> bit<00:02:36.660> of

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
to two bits orange then just one bit of

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.420 
to two bits orange then just one bit of
orange<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.410> pure<00:02:37.650> red<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:38.220> is

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
orange so this is pure red this is

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.580 
orange so this is pure red this is
mostly<00:02:38.849> red<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.269> is<00:02:39.420> mostly<00:02:39.720> orange<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.380> is

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
mostly red this is mostly orange this is

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.199 
mostly red this is mostly orange this is
orange<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.130> then<00:02:41.280> we'll<00:02:41.640> do<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.790> same<00:02:42.030> to

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
orange and then we'll do the same to

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.729 
orange and then we'll do the same to
fade<00:02:42.390> between<00:02:42.690> orange<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.349> but<00:02:43.500> oh<00:02:43.620> wait

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
fade between orange and but oh wait

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:44.600 
fade between orange and but oh wait
let's<00:02:43.920> make<00:02:44.099> sure<00:02:44.129> you'll<00:02:44.280> get<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:44.459> right

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
let's make sure you'll get this right

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.670 
let's make sure you'll get this right
but<00:02:44.910> fade<00:02:45.330> between<00:02:45.540> orange<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.230> play<00:02:46.380> between

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
but fade between orange and play between

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.309 
but fade between orange and play between
yellow<00:02:47.090> just<00:02:48.090> do<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.299> same<00:02:48.510> kind<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.200> make

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
yellow just do the same kind of make

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.809 
yellow just do the same kind of make
like<00:02:49.349> a<00:02:49.560> thing<00:02:49.980> like<00:02:50.099> that<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.400> then<00:02:50.580> we<00:02:50.640> move

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
like a thing like that and then we move

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.699 
like a thing like that and then we move
on<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:50.940> yellow<00:02:51.269> then<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.989> know<00:02:52.140> we<00:02:52.290> do<00:02:52.410> yellow

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
on to yellow then you know we do yellow

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.960 
on to yellow then you know we do yellow
a<00:02:52.860> couple<00:02:53.130> blocks<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.519> then<00:02:53.670> we're<00:02:53.880> moving

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
a couple blocks so then we're moving

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.390 
a couple blocks so then we're moving
between<00:02:54.299> yellow<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.780> between<00:02:55.560> green<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.280> it's

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
between yellow and between green so it's

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.729 
between yellow and between green so it's
as<00:02:56.519> simple<00:02:56.640> as<00:02:56.880> this<00:02:57.170> then<00:02:58.170> we<00:02:58.230> place<00:02:58.410> down<00:02:58.590> our

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
as simple as this then we place down our

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.410 
as simple as this then we place down our
green<00:02:59.010> blocks<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.459> there<00:02:59.790> is<00:02:59.880> free<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.269> each

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
green blocks so there is free of each

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.990 
green blocks so there is free of each
color<00:03:00.660> block<00:03:00.989> down<00:03:01.200> here<00:03:01.410> at<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.560> bottom<00:03:02.000> then

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
color block down here at the bottom then

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.970 
color block down here at the bottom then
above<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:03.269> I<00:03:03.660> kind<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.440> see<00:03:04.590> in<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.709> second

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
above that I kind of you see in a second

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.259 
above that I kind of you see in a second
it<00:03:05.040> makes<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.280> pretty<00:03:05.400> cool<00:03:05.610> pattern<00:03:05.880> but<00:03:06.180> then

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
it makes a pretty cool pattern but then

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.460 
it makes a pretty cool pattern but then
we<00:03:06.390> want<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.569> make<00:03:06.750> oh<00:03:06.900> wait<00:03:07.079> let's<00:03:07.290> make<00:03:07.349> sure

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
we want to make oh wait let's make sure

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.140 
we want to make oh wait let's make sure
we<00:03:07.620> get<00:03:07.709> this<00:03:07.799> right<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.250> is<00:03:08.459> this<00:03:08.670> okay<00:03:09.120> that

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
we get this right so is this okay that

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.970 
we get this right so is this okay that
this<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.660> our<00:03:09.810> green<00:03:10.049> block<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:10.590> here<00:03:10.829> it's

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
this is our green block so here it's

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.589 
this is our green block so here it's
gonna<00:03:11.099> be<00:03:11.190> two<00:03:11.400> green<00:03:11.610> this<00:03:11.910> is<00:03:11.970> gonna<00:03:12.180> be<00:03:12.360> one

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
gonna be two green this is gonna be one

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.410 
gonna be two green this is gonna be one
green<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.170> blue<00:03:13.489> then<00:03:14.489> next<00:03:14.640> up<00:03:14.819> we've<00:03:15.000> got<00:03:15.030> one

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
green to blue then next up we've got one

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.910 
green to blue then next up we've got one
blue<00:03:15.599> two<00:03:15.750> nothing<00:03:16.079> there<00:03:16.440> we<00:03:16.530> want<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.739> fade

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
blue two nothing there we want to fade

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.620 
blue two nothing there we want to fade
between<00:03:17.069> blue<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:17.790> purple<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.239> you<00:03:18.329> can<00:03:18.480> you

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
between blue and purple and you can you

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.180 
between blue and purple and you can you
know<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:18.810> sure<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.560> get<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.739> pattern<00:03:20.130> that's

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
know you sure you get the pattern that's

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.750 
know you sure you get the pattern that's
going<00:03:20.459> on<00:03:20.519> here

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
going on here

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.099 
going on here
it's<00:03:21.060> just<00:03:21.180> fading<00:03:21.480> between<00:03:21.690> each<00:03:21.780> color<00:03:21.959> in

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
it's just fading between each color in

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.990 
it's just fading between each color in
the<00:03:22.200> exact<00:03:22.530> same<00:03:22.709> way<00:03:22.769> then<00:03:23.280> placing<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.700> full

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
the exact same way then placing the full

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.849 
the exact same way then placing the full
block<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.299> that<00:03:24.389> color<00:03:24.630> then<00:03:25.079> fading<00:03:25.500> into<00:03:25.650> the

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
block of that color then fading into the

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.440 
block of that color then fading into the
next<00:03:26.160> color<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.459> in<00:03:26.730> this<00:03:26.850> case<00:03:27.090> off<00:03:27.269> we've

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
next color and in this case off we've

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.849 
next color and in this case off we've
gone<00:03:27.569> through<00:03:27.630> purple<00:03:28.200> we<00:03:28.500> actually<00:03:28.709> want<00:03:28.829> to

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
gone through purple we actually want to

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.580 
gone through purple we actually want to
go<00:03:29.010> back<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.430> red<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:30.049> I'll<00:03:31.049> be<00:03:31.200> place<00:03:31.380> wait

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
go back to red so I'll be place wait

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.960 
go back to red so I'll be place wait
let's<00:03:31.739> make<00:03:31.799> sure<00:03:31.950> we<00:03:32.010> get<00:03:32.069> this<00:03:32.160> right<00:03:32.340> again

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
let's make sure we get this right again

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.940 
let's make sure we get this right again
so<00:03:33.269> one<00:03:33.480> block<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:33.780> pure<00:03:33.930> purple<00:03:34.319> one<00:03:34.620> block<00:03:34.799> of

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
so one block of pure purple one block of

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.860 
so one block of pure purple one block of
two<00:03:35.130> purple<00:03:35.489> then<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.790> no<00:03:36.000> block<00:03:36.209> of<00:03:36.329> one<00:03:36.510> purple

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
two purple then a no block of one purple

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.780 
two purple then a no block of one purple
then<00:03:36.989> we<00:03:37.049> go<00:03:37.139> back<00:03:37.319> to<00:03:37.470> red<00:03:37.739> like<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.489> then

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
then we go back to red like so and then

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.610 
then we go back to red like so and then
this<00:03:38.910> very<00:03:39.150> last<00:03:39.480> beacon<00:03:39.720> will<00:03:39.959> be<00:03:40.079> the<00:03:40.230> final

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
this very last beacon will be the final

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.440 
this very last beacon will be the final
bit<00:03:40.739> of<00:03:40.829> red<00:03:41.069> and<00:03:41.190> as<00:03:41.609> you<00:03:41.850> might<00:03:42.120> be<00:03:42.239> able<00:03:42.269> to

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
bit of red and as you might be able to

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.449 
bit of red and as you might be able to
see<00:03:42.600> ops<00:03:42.810> you've<00:03:43.019> done<00:03:43.200> all<00:03:43.319> of<00:03:43.350> this<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:44.310> can

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
see ops you've done all of this you can

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.610 
see ops you've done all of this you can
actually<00:03:44.609> see<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.120> makes<00:03:45.359> a<00:03:45.540> rainbow<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.380> so

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
actually see it makes a rainbow it so

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.319 
actually see it makes a rainbow it so
it's<00:03:46.829> a<00:03:46.950> really<00:03:47.190> nice<00:03:47.340> rainbow<00:03:47.639> you<00:03:48.060> can<00:03:48.209> go

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
it's a really nice rainbow you can go

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.910 
it's a really nice rainbow you can go
more<00:03:48.569> precise<00:03:48.930> than<00:03:49.049> this<00:03:49.170> but<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:49.440> think<00:03:49.680> this

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
more precise than this but I think this

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.170 
more precise than this but I think this
is<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.250> level<00:03:50.489> of<00:03:50.549> process<00:03:50.850> where<00:03:51.030> it's

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
is the level of process where it's

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.879 
is the level of process where it's
really<00:03:51.359> nice<00:03:51.569> you<00:03:51.930> can<00:03:52.170> also<00:03:52.410> go<00:03:52.620> for<00:03:52.799> a

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
really nice you can also go for a

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.020 
really nice you can also go for a
different<00:03:53.130> kind<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.310> green<00:03:53.519> if<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.819> think

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
different kind of green if you think

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.430 
different kind of green if you think
that<00:03:54.299> because<00:03:54.450> you<00:03:54.540> know<00:03:54.870> this<00:03:55.079> one<00:03:55.260> here

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
that because you know this one here

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.599 
that because you know this one here
looks<00:03:55.470> slightly<00:03:55.829> out<00:03:56.010> but<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.220> rest<00:03:56.430> of<00:03:56.489> it

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
looks slightly out but the rest of it

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.729 
looks slightly out but the rest of it
looks<00:03:56.790> very<00:03:57.000> nice<00:03:57.269> indeed<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.900> really<00:03:58.440> do<00:03:58.590> like

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
looks very nice indeed I really do like

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.500 
looks very nice indeed I really do like
the<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.340> way<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.700> rainbow<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.150> kind<00:04:00.450> of

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
the the way the rainbow that kind of

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.690 
the the way the rainbow that kind of
works<00:04:00.690> here<00:04:00.930> I<00:04:01.170> liked<00:04:02.069> a<00:04:02.160> lot<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.340> that's<00:04:02.579> why

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
works here I liked a lot and that's why

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
works here I liked a lot and that's why
I<00:04:02.730> showed<00:04:02.880> you<00:04:02.910> how<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.090> build<00:04:03.209> it

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
I showed you how to build it

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.539 
I showed you how to build it
just<00:04:04.079> as<00:04:04.200> one<00:04:04.410> final<00:04:04.680> thing<00:04:04.920> because<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.370> does

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
just as one final thing because it does

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:06.830 
just as one final thing because it does
look<00:04:05.579> kind<00:04:05.910> of<00:04:05.970> funny<00:04:06.150> from<00:04:06.329> here<00:04:06.510> if<00:04:06.630> you

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
look kind of funny from here if you

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.449 
look kind of funny from here if you
leave<00:04:07.019> it<00:04:07.139> the<00:04:07.200> way<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.319> did<00:04:07.440> one<00:04:08.160> thing<00:04:08.310> that

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
leave it the way I did one thing that

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.860 
leave it the way I did one thing that
has<00:04:08.609> no<00:04:08.849> effect<00:04:08.970> on<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.389> beacon<00:04:09.599> color

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
has no effect on the beacon color

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.210 
has no effect on the beacon color
themselves<00:04:10.349> but<00:04:10.530> you<00:04:10.709> know<00:04:10.799> it<00:04:10.859> does<00:04:11.010> have<00:04:11.160> an

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
themselves but you know it does have an

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.740 
themselves but you know it does have an
effect<00:04:11.280> on<00:04:11.700> you<00:04:12.030> know<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.239> way<00:04:12.329> it<00:04:12.419> looks<00:04:12.630> is

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
effect on you know the way it looks is

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.839 
effect on you know the way it looks is
to<00:04:13.380> make<00:04:13.709> each<00:04:13.889> of<00:04:14.069> these<00:04:14.190> ones<00:04:14.579> where<00:04:14.760> it's

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
to make each of these ones where it's

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.520 
to make each of these ones where it's
just<00:04:14.910> one<00:04:15.180> color<00:04:15.419> make<00:04:15.840> them<00:04:16.049> actually<00:04:16.260> you

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
just one color make them actually you

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.319 
just one color make them actually you
know<00:04:16.650> three<00:04:17.459> blocks<00:04:17.700> of<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:17.880> color<00:04:18.030> instead

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
know three blocks of the color instead

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.240 
know three blocks of the color instead
of<00:04:18.389> one<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.750> you'll<00:04:18.840> see<00:04:19.019> once<00:04:19.709> I<00:04:19.799> finish<00:04:20.070> this

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
of one and you'll see once I finish this

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.710 
of one and you'll see once I finish this
it<00:04:20.400> makes<00:04:20.549> it<00:04:20.669> look<00:04:20.789> just<00:04:20.849> that<00:04:21.209> next<00:04:21.570> bit

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
it makes it look just that next bit

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.719 
it makes it look just that next bit
light<00:04:21.900> nice<00:04:22.200> up<00:04:22.409> and<00:04:22.650> that's<00:04:23.430> why<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.610> need

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
light nice up and that's why you need

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.250 
light nice up and that's why you need
nine<00:04:23.940> peach<00:04:24.120> color<00:04:24.360> so<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:24.750> can<00:04:24.780> have<00:04:24.960> the

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
nine peach color so you can have the

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.540 
nine peach color so you can have the
frame<00:04:25.440> thing<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:26.010> also<00:04:26.159> means<00:04:26.430> it's

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
frame thing and it also means it's

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.500 
frame thing and it also means it's
easier<00:04:26.820> to<00:04:26.970> spot<00:04:27.180> whether

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
easier to spot whether

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.630 
easier to spot whether
hands-on<00:04:27.900> because<00:04:28.050> if<00:04:28.620> once<00:04:29.070> we<00:04:29.130> placed<00:04:29.400> our

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
hands-on because if once we placed our

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.360 
hands-on because if once we placed our
read<00:04:29.940> down<00:04:30.320> you<00:04:31.320> can<00:04:31.470> see<00:04:31.680> they<00:04:31.830> make<00:04:31.860> like<00:04:32.190> as

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
read down you can see they make like as

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.580 
read down you can see they make like as
edge<00:04:32.700> shape<00:04:33.000> or<00:04:33.210> like<00:04:33.360> you<00:04:33.660> know<00:04:33.750> free<00:04:34.080> free

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
edge shape or like you know free free

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.810 
edge shape or like you know free free
free<00:04:34.890> and<00:04:35.070> you<00:04:35.130> can<00:04:35.250> see<00:04:35.370> it<00:04:35.460> kind<00:04:35.610> of<00:04:35.640> just

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
free and you can see it kind of just

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.340 
free and you can see it kind of just
shifts<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.270> right<00:04:36.390> one<00:04:36.540> it's<00:04:36.810> it's<00:04:37.110> a<00:04:37.200> nice

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
shifts to the right one it's it's a nice

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.350 
shifts to the right one it's it's a nice
patterns<00:04:37.740> pick<00:04:37.890> up<00:04:38.040> on<00:04:38.190> it's<00:04:38.370> nice<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:39.090> look<00:04:39.210> at

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
patterns pick up on it's nice to look at

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.360 
patterns pick up on it's nice to look at
and<00:04:39.420> I<00:04:39.630> think<00:04:39.690> this<00:04:40.290> is<00:04:40.440> our<00:04:40.560> cooling<00:04:41.040> stuff<00:04:41.250> so

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
and I think this is our cooling stuff so

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.710 
and I think this is our cooling stuff so
I<00:04:41.400> hope<00:04:41.580> you<00:04:41.700> did<00:04:41.850> enjoy<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:42.300> video<00:04:42.360> if<00:04:42.660> you

and<00:04:51.390> 19<00:04:51.780> beacons<00:04:52.200> is<00:04:52.320> very<00:04:52.830> challenging<00:04:53.310> but<00:04:53.490> I

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
and 19 beacons is very challenging but I

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.070 
and 19 beacons is very challenging but I
think<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.850> reward<00:04:54.120> is<00:04:54.240> worth<00:04:54.360> it<00:04:54.600> personally

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
think the reward is worth it personally

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.690 
think the reward is worth it personally
maybe<00:04:55.680> I'll<00:04:55.860> make<00:04:55.920> one<00:04:56.100> of<00:04:56.190> these<00:04:56.310> in<00:04:56.430> my<00:04:56.460> let's

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
maybe I'll make one of these in my let's

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.190 
maybe I'll make one of these in my let's
play<00:04:56.850> well<00:04:57.000> at<00:04:57.150> some<00:04:57.240> point<00:04:57.510> I<00:04:57.600> don't<00:04:58.050> really

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
play well at some point I don't really

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.840
