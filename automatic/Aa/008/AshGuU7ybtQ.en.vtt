00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.500
Sweet Love PÃ¢tisserie

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.640
Oh, this is cute!

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.750
Isn't it a little childish?

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.100
Is it?

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.060
What does your little sister usually wear?

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.740
I dunno. I haven't seen her much lately.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.480
You know, you'll never
decide on anything that way.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.850
Put a little more thought into it.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.190
Sorry.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.650
I did drag you out on
Christmas Eve to help, didn't I?

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.790
That's right!

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.490
What?

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.460
Well... I just wondered.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.200
Did you have other plans?

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.040
Get invited somewhere or something?

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.460
Yeah.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.960
They were talking about having a party at the dorm.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.000
That's all?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.500
Yeah. That's why I came to shop with you.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.670
That makes sense...

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.450
You're weird.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.350
I hope she'll like it.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.440
We ended up getting something I liked.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.830
It's fine. I know she'll like it.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.170
How do you know?

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.190
W-Well, because...

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.350
Her personality and interests 
are similar to yours.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.640
Oh, that's why?

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.100
Yeah. That's why I had you come with me.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.490
No, I didn't mean that.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.500
When we first met...

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.910
Wh-What?

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.470
You do look similar...

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.400
Huh? To who?

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.650
Huh? I said that?

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.450
How could you forget?
 I always wondered about it!

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.670
S-Sorry.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.730
So, who do I look similar to?
 Is it really your sister?

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.020
Not telling.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.640
What? No fair!

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.610
Let's just get something to eat.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.600
There's a good Italian place near here.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.370
I'll buy you dinner as thanks.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.970
Okay, we can talk about it there!

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.740
We're only admitting customers 
with reservations today.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.900
I'm very sorry.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.920
Man, everywhere we go...

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.460
It's Christmas Eve, after all.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.850
Since it's snowing, I guess we 
should give up and go home.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.740
Yeah, I guess so.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.050
Sorry to drag you all over the place.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.050
But we were able to get a gift for your sister,

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.020
and you did buy me dinner.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.230
It's a pizza bun, so it's technically Italian, too!

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.400
Or is it actually Chinese? Nah, not really!

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.280
I guess I'm a little cold.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.750
Sorry.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.840
I'm about to do something that's not my style at all.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.480
You better not laugh.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.760
Huh? What?

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.650
Merry Christmas.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.290
Ryou-kun...

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.820
Is this...

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.270
Yeah, that's what it was.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.550
So that's what you were doing!

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.490
Thank you, though.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.940
Hey, Sayuri...

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.210
If you want, would you...

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.710
Would you...

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.050
Hold it!

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.580
Ouch!

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.480
Who just ruined the big Christmas Eve 
strategy I've been planning for two weeks?!

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.860
It would be presumptuous to
 give our names when asked, but...

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.180
We are the Three Musketeers of Fleurir!

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.690
That's what I am?

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.320
What do you guys have against me?!

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.880
No fair getting the jump on us!

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.320
Haruno is our precious student.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.390
Have they been watching all this time?
Haruno is our precious student.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.920
I'm your precious student, too!
Have they been watching all this time?

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.420
Very funny.
Have they been watching all this time?
