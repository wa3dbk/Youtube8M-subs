well<00:02:31.240> it's<00:02:32.240> a<00:02:32.360> lot<00:02:32.480> quicker<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:33.050> put<00:02:33.260> up<00:02:33.410> and

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
well it's a lot quicker to put up and

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.800 
well it's a lot quicker to put up and
also<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.400> don't<00:02:34.640> have<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.970> polluted<00:02:35.480> sand

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
also you don't have the polluted sand

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.260 
also you don't have the polluted sand
afterwards<00:02:36.440> which<00:02:36.950> often<00:02:37.640> is<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:37.760> problem<00:02:38.150> and

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
afterwards which often is a problem and

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.060 
afterwards which often is a problem and
you<00:02:38.330> don't<00:02:38.360> have<00:02:38.630> to<00:02:38.810> fill<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.620> sandbags

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
you don't have to fill the sandbags

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.820 
you don't have to fill the sandbags
carry<00:02:40.460> them<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.840> know<00:02:41.959> stack<00:02:42.500> them<00:02:42.709> up

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
carry them and you know stack them up

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.090 
carry them and you know stack them up
this<00:02:43.459> one<00:02:43.700> is<00:02:43.730> it's<00:02:44.209> more<00:02:44.390> like<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.680> flat<00:02:45.680> packed

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
this one is it's more like a flat packed

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.300 
this one is it's more like a flat packed
mikono<00:02:46.700> set<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.270> just<00:02:47.480> unfold<00:02:48.310> one

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
mikono set that you just unfold one

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.920 
mikono set that you just unfold one
Supporter<00:02:49.850> after<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.150> other<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:50.570> it's<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.810> lot

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
Supporter after the other and it's a lot

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.440 
Supporter after the other and it's a lot
quicker<00:02:51.140> basically<00:02:51.830> behind<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:53.030> Swedish

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
quicker basically behind the Swedish

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.900 
quicker basically behind the Swedish

barrier Adrienne Barbara's house is with

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.630 
barrier Adrienne Barbara's house is with
luck<00:02:56.209> protected<00:02:57.170> in<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.410> coming<00:02:57.770> hours<00:02:58.190> but

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
luck protected in the coming hours but

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.580 
luck protected in the coming hours but
like<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:59.060> many<00:02:59.090> he<00:02:59.510> says<00:02:59.780> this<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.380> just

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
like so many he says this is just

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.790 
like so many he says this is just
happening<00:03:00.770> more<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.280> more<00:03:01.580> often<00:03:02.680> but<00:03:03.680> it's

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
happening more and more often but it's

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.210 
happening more and more often but it's
very<00:03:03.890> much<00:03:04.130> like<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.400> flash<00:03:05.150> flood<00:03:05.750> as<00:03:06.709> the

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
very much like a flash flood as the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.880 
very much like a flash flood as the
brook<00:03:07.459> fills<00:03:07.880> up<00:03:08.239> I<00:03:09.050> suppose<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.620> must<00:03:09.709> be

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
brook fills up I suppose it must be

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.670 
brook fills up I suppose it must be
20-foot<00:03:10.400> down<00:03:10.700> there<00:03:10.940> 15<00:03:11.360> 20<00:03:11.780> foot<00:03:12.020> it<00:03:12.320> just

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
20-foot down there 15 20 foot it just

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.010 
20-foot down there 15 20 foot it just
comes<00:03:13.220> up<00:03:13.430> in<00:03:13.580> a<00:03:13.670> matter<00:03:13.910> of<00:03:14.030> quarter<00:03:14.870> of<00:03:14.959> an
