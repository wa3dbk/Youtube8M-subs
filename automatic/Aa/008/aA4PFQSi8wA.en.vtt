 plus in this way to this printer 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.620
 You must send that you count it 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:55.700
 first you have to download long ones because those 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.350
 photo is maybe 15 megabytes and 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.750
 then it takes too long longer 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.560
 sent and then print it 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.120
 takes a minute or 4 so but it 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.220
 is possible on high quality 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.479
 from making a tablet or a smartphone 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.060
