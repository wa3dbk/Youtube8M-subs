00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
alright so now is a scary part we're

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.190 
alright so now is a scary part we're
going<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.190> open<00:00:02.610> up<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:02.879> jar<00:00:03.270> of<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.449> ink<00:00:03.629> the

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
going to open up a jar of the ink the

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.980 
going to open up a jar of the ink the
fabric<00:00:04.589> screen<00:00:04.890> printing<00:00:05.190> ink<00:00:05.339> and<00:00:05.580> it<00:00:06.060> is<00:00:06.359> ink

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
fabric screen printing ink and it is ink

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.890 
fabric screen printing ink and it is ink
which<00:00:07.470> means<00:00:07.770> it's<00:00:08.040> messy<00:00:08.370> it<00:00:08.580> stains<00:00:09.000> it's

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
which means it's messy it stains it's

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.110 
which means it's messy it stains it's
supposed<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.590> be<00:00:10.830> permanent<00:00:11.099> on<00:00:11.429> fabric<00:00:11.910> so

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
supposed to be permanent on fabric so

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.400 
supposed to be permanent on fabric so
therefore<00:00:12.480> if<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:12.630> get<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.870> on<00:00:12.929> your<00:00:12.990> clothes

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
therefore if you get it on your clothes

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.680 
therefore if you get it on your clothes
it's<00:00:13.769> not<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.790> easy<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.150> get<00:00:15.330> out<00:00:15.509> and

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
it's not that easy to get out and

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.109 
it's not that easy to get out and
similar<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.859> glue<00:00:17.070> be<00:00:17.220> used<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:18.000> know

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
similar to the glue be used you know

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.330 
similar to the glue be used you know
it's<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.510> water-soluble<00:00:19.170> ink<00:00:19.710> when<00:00:19.920> it's<00:00:20.070> wet

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
it's a water-soluble ink when it's wet

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.490 
it's a water-soluble ink when it's wet
but<00:00:20.580> once<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.060> dries<00:00:21.300> forget<00:00:22.020> about<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.260> you're

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
but once it dries forget about it you're

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.679 
but once it dries forget about it you're
done<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.550> there's<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> couple<00:00:23.910> things<00:00:24.180> that

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
done and so there's a couple things that

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.750 
done and so there's a couple things that
that<00:00:24.869> means<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.619> means<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.430> know<00:00:26.550> while

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
that means it means that you know while

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.160 
that means it means that you know while
it's<00:00:26.970> wet<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.359> can<00:00:27.390> work<00:00:27.689> with<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.140> can

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
it's wet you can work with it you can

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.320 
it's wet you can work with it you can
push<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.650> around<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.250> know<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:29.519> not<00:00:29.699> it's

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
push it around you know it's not it's

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.759 
push it around you know it's not it's
not<00:00:30.420> like<00:00:30.510> using<00:00:30.750> spray<00:00:31.170> paint<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.650> like

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
not like using spray paint that like

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.530 
not like using spray paint that like
once<00:00:31.980> it's<00:00:32.130> down<00:00:32.340> it's<00:00:32.550> down<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.880> mean<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.329> can

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
once it's down it's down I mean you can

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.420 
once it's down it's down I mean you can
there's<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.079> little<00:00:34.230> bit<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.500> wiggle<00:00:35.280> room

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
there's a little bit of wiggle room

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.650 
there's a little bit of wiggle room
there<00:00:35.610> but<00:00:36.540> one<00:00:36.960> important<00:00:37.440> thing<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.070> that

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
there but one important thing is is that

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.299 
there but one important thing is is that
you<00:00:39.660> know<00:00:39.780> while<00:00:40.260> you're<00:00:40.379> screening<00:00:40.800> shirts

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
you know while you're screening shirts

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.360 
you know while you're screening shirts
you<00:00:41.640> don't<00:00:41.940> want<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.270> ink<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.690> dry<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:43.370> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
you don't want the ink to dry in the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.520 
you don't want the ink to dry in the
part<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> screen<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.230> know<00:00:46.350> that

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
part of the screen that you know that

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.990 
part of the screen that you know that
you're<00:00:46.620> printing<00:00:46.890> through<00:00:47.340> right<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.850> is

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
you're printing through right that is

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.340 
you're printing through right that is
you<00:00:48.180> don't<00:00:48.300> want<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.600> ink<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.899> dry<00:00:48.930> within

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
you don't want the ink to dry within

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.600 
you don't want the ink to dry within
those<00:00:49.530> little<00:00:49.800> pores<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.219> you're<00:00:50.340> printing

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
those little pores that you're printing

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.459 
those little pores that you're printing
because<00:00:51.329> once<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.660> does<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:52.020> won't<00:00:52.320> print

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
because once it does it just won't print

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.709 
because once it does it just won't print
well<00:00:52.680> anymore<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.699> part<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> strategy<00:00:54.420> is

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
well anymore so part of the strategy is

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.889 
well anymore so part of the strategy is
is<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.170> always<00:00:55.469> keep<00:00:55.949> only<00:00:56.640> wet<00:00:56.940> ink<00:00:57.210> within

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
is to always keep only wet ink within

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.069 
is to always keep only wet ink within
that<00:00:58.559> um<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.370> know<00:00:59.460> within<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.820> image<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.750> for

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
that um you know within the image so for

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.689 
that um you know within the image so for
example<00:01:01.170> before<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:01.859> print<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.309> first<00:01:02.550> thing

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
example before we print the first thing

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.740 
example before we print the first thing
we're<00:01:02.820> going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.969> do<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.270> know<00:01:03.359> open<00:01:03.660> up

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
we're going to do is you know open up

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.990 
we're going to do is you know open up
our<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.680> know<00:01:04.769> ink<00:01:05.070> we're<00:01:05.280> going<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.460> put<00:01:05.880> it

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
our you know ink we're going to put it

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.130 
our you know ink we're going to put it
on<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> screen<00:01:06.390> i'll<00:01:06.630> show<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.869> how<00:01:06.900> that's

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
on the screen i'll show you how that's

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.020 
on the screen i'll show you how that's
done<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.680> then<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.070> right<00:01:08.310> away<00:01:08.460> we're<00:01:08.850> just

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
done and then just right away we're just

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.500 
done and then just right away we're just
going<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> go<00:01:09.330> ahead<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:11.270> probably<00:01:12.270> pull

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
going to go ahead and and probably pull

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.539 
going to go ahead and and probably pull
one<00:01:12.689> across<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.080> just<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:13.710> some<00:01:13.920> ink<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.340> that

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
one across and just get some ink in that

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.539 
one across and just get some ink in that
screen<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.180> then<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.500> then<00:01:17.100> before<00:01:17.189> we<00:01:17.369> print

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
screen and then and then before we print

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.280 
screen and then and then before we print
another<00:01:17.820> one<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.659> want<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> probably<00:01:19.020> put
