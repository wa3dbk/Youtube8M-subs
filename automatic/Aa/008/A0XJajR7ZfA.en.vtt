that<00:01:13.479> simple<00:01:13.720> for<00:01:14.050> the<00:01:14.440> monkeys<00:01:14.830> you<00:01:15.729> see<00:01:15.880> the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
that simple for the monkeys you see the

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.790 
that simple for the monkeys you see the
monkeys<00:01:16.360> are<00:01:16.600> cursed<00:01:17.020> with<00:01:17.260> consciousness

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
and so the monkeys are afraid so the

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.750 
and so the monkeys are afraid so the
monkeys<00:01:21.130> worried

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
mostly about what all the other monkey's

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.350 
mostly about what all the other monkey's
think<00:01:26.470> because<00:01:27.400> the<00:01:27.520> monkeys<00:01:27.820> desperately

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
think because the monkeys desperately

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.260 
think because the monkeys desperately
want<00:01:28.510> to<00:01:28.570> fit<00:01:28.720> in<00:01:28.960> with<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.740> other<00:01:29.860> monkey's

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.460 
know they're going to die so the monkeys
make<00:01:57.159> up<00:01:57.369> gods<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:58.180> then<00:01:58.360> they<00:01:58.390> worship<00:01:58.570> them

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
make up gods and then they worship them

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.350 
make up gods and then they worship them
then<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.369> monkey<00:02:00.640> start<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:00.970> argue<00:02:01.330> over

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
then the monkey start to argue over

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.600 
then the monkey start to argue over
who's<00:02:01.720> made<00:02:02.049> up<00:02:02.200> God<00:02:02.439> is<00:02:02.650> better

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
who's made up God is better

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.890 
who's made up God is better
and<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.790> monkeys<00:02:04.090> get<00:02:04.240> really<00:02:04.540> pissed<00:02:04.750> off

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
and the monkeys get really pissed off

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.480 
and the monkeys get really pissed off
and<00:02:05.170> this<00:02:05.230> is<00:02:05.380> usually<00:02:05.950> when<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.160> monkeys

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
and this is usually when the monkeys

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.279 
and this is usually when the monkeys
decide<00:02:06.850> that<00:02:07.060> it's<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.300> good<00:02:07.480> time<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.750> start

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
decide that it's a good time to start

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.710 
decide that it's a good time to start
killing<00:02:08.710> each<00:02:08.950> other<00:02:09.130> so<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.149> monkeys<00:02:10.450> wage

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
killing each other so the monkeys wage
