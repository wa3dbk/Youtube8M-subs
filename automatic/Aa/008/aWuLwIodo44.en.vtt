00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.880
 Welcome to the Civilization Empire: Beyond the Earth. I am Master Control, built in Jianyuan 122 years. 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:26.540
 I am a miracle on this planet, created to provide centralized control to colonial administrators to get the best out of their colonies. 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.740
 Everything I can do is for you. 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.120
 Our people have moved to this planet, from the extreme fragility of the beginning to the strength of today. 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.220
 Soon, you will have the ability to directly control the progress of the colony and write a new chapter on the future of mankind. 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:58.620
 The mold ecology of the world initially brought us many challenges. Despite these evolutionary patterns of divergence, we can now let life from Earth survive on this planet. These Terrascapes are proof. 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.020
 These precious gardens allow life from the earth to thrive and delight our people. 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:18.060
 Our faction believes that human beings are good. We believe that human beings have a special place in the universe. 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:28.980
 We transform the world so that more humans can thrive without resorting to invasive neuromechanics or extraterrestrial gene injection. Our faction believes in "pureness." 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.780
 Deploy the Solar Collector satellite. These satellites can increase energy production near our capital. 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.029
 The purist faction is good at maximizing the production capacity in the territory. 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.049
 Our culture is thriving. We have the ability to develop additional "virtue" for the people. 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:05.720
 Select Technoartisan, and each round, part of the output of our culture will be added to the total amount of our research. As a result, we can accelerate our research progress. 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.800
 I detected a threat in the activity. 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:27.180
 Local species: Vivens Bestia Insulae. Spoken name: Kraken. Definitive features: huge. Calcareous shell. tentacle. Squeaky horny mouth. 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.640
 The largest known native species. Now, this Kraken poses an immediate threat to trade and security. 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.600
 Send Naval Fighter to launch an attack. 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.080
 Direct combat is not ideal. Adjust the tactics. 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.780
 Aerospace Fighter attacked. 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.539
 Naval Fighter was replaced by a long-distance battle. 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.860
 Threat elimination. 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:26.820
 I detected a possible threat. Vadim Petrovich Kozlov, leader of Slavic Federation. 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:46.280
 The army is gathering near our borders. Slavic Federation believes in "hegemonism." "Hegemonism" believes that human beings must get rid of their dependence on the planetary biosphere. The radical strengthening of the "hegemonism" faction and the large-scale neuromechanization coincide with the "pureism" we believe in. 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.220
 Kozlov intends to undermine our ability to geodize this planet. 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.800
 Open direct diplomatic communication. 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:12.370
 The threat level has increased. According to the calculation, I think that preemptive warfare can give my faction the best chance to survive. 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:25.539
 The military power of the hegemonic system relies on the configuration of the position and the battlefield to achieve the most ideal attack. If we can disintegrate their formation and use our orbital attack, we can ensure that our army survives. 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.180
 Declare war. 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.140
 Deploy the Aegis two-legged combat system. 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.370
 Aegis specializes in fire support and anti-infantry operations. 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.500
 Planet Carver has been waiting for further instructions on the battle track. 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.750
 Authorized to launch a track attack. Open fire. 

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:45.519
 Deploy LEV Destroyer. LEV Destroyer offers unparalleled firepower and protection. 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.440
 The winner is in the grip. 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.680
 According to my calculations, Kozlov is not reorganizing his surviving troops, or destroying them in our hands. 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.780
 The safety of our people has been ensured. 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.880
 How will you guide the future of mankind? 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.399
 Be prepared to take over full management control. 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.460
 Here is the Master Control. Interrupt the connection.
