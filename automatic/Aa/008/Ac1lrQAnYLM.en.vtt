00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.804
 99 boring on the wall~ (He adapted the nursery rhyme, originally 99 bottles of beer on the wall) 

00:00:01.804 --> 00:00:03.418
 99 boring on the wall~ (He adapted the nursery rhyme, originally 99 bottles of beer on the wall) 

00:00:03.418 --> 00:00:05.389
 Take a bored down~ 

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:06.530
 There are 98 boring on the wall~ 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.790
 Please, enough, we all know that you are bored, can you? 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:10.690
 Yes 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.230
 Have you ever thought about why we are so bored all day? 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.724
 Well, no, how do you ask this? 

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:18.225
 We have been so bored, there must be a reason. 

00:00:20.946 --> 00:00:22.553
 Who will pick it up? 

00:00:22.553 --> 00:00:24.624
 There is a phone call ringing~ 

00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:28.118
 Hello, Liu Ding 

00:00:28.118 --> 00:00:31.949
 Look at it is a knife! What's your knife? Are you too bored? How do you lose your edges and corners? 

00:00:32.792 --> 00:00:35.118
 That's not a knife, Liu Ding, that's a spoon! 

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:38.365
 Or in fact, there is no spoon at all. 

00:00:47.115 --> 00:00:49.557
 Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you. 

00:00:49.557 --> 00:00:51.356
 Wow, the bald knife will become magic! 

00:00:51.356 --> 00:00:53.585
 Hey! Hey! Take the rabbit out of the hat, bald knife! 

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:55.686
 You actually live in a dream kitchen, Liu Ding 

00:00:55.686 --> 00:00:57.272
 It is called "fruit" (fruitrix, changed from maternal matrix) 

00:00:57.273 --> 00:00:59.507
 Everything you see around you is fake. 

00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:01.442
 Even pears are fake? Pears are also 

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:02.601
 Don't listen to him, Liu Ding 

00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:04.918
 I have always been your best.... 

00:01:04.918 --> 00:01:07.197
 Liu Ding...Mr. 

00:01:07.906 --> 00:01:09.947
 Fast, Liu Ding, you have to choose a capsule. 

00:01:09.947 --> 00:01:11.490
 Choose me! Choose me! 

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:15.730
 Eat red capsules, you will escape and die and be transferred to the real world kitchen 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.004
 And when you eat the blue capsule, you will stay in the "fruit" and cut it in half by the knife. 

00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:21.839
 Hey, what about the green capsule? 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.609
 I am a hamburger. 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:26.246
 Oh, then red. 

00:01:28.194 --> 00:01:30.036
 He will come back again 

00:01:30.037 --> 00:01:31.690
 How are you sure? 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.638
 Because he is... "Annoying" (The original movie is The One, here is changed to The Annoying One) 

00:01:34.638 --> 00:01:35.881
 Well, you are right. 

00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:38.087
 Welcome, come to the real kitchen 

00:01:38.087 --> 00:01:41.714
 Here is really right, really dirty 

00:01:41.713 --> 00:01:44.123
 Yes, the real kitchen is supposed to clean up 

00:01:44.123 --> 00:01:47.204
 But at least we are here to be free from the "fruit" and its rulers... 

00:01:47.204 --> 00:01:49.305
 Yay! There is also TV here, awesome. 

00:01:49.305 --> 00:01:51.798
 Yes, but there is only one channel here. 

00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:53.927
 I hope not to be a C-SPAN station (a channel dedicated to government and public affairs) 

00:01:53.927 --> 00:01:56.579
 Note that this is the real world 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.754
 Look at the machine that builds the "fruit" 

00:01:58.754 --> 00:02:00.477
 Need to rely on you, and your kind as fuel 

00:02:00.477 --> 00:02:01.913
 Well, I have a lot of farts. 

00:02:03.662 --> 00:02:04.460
 and many more 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.728
 That means my friends will... 

00:02:06.728 --> 00:02:09.677
 Hey! Hey! Who is going to order some mango juice? 

00:02:09.677 --> 00:02:11.984
 No~~ 

00:02:11.984 --> 00:02:13.780
 Don't give up hope, Liu Ding 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.781
 There is still something we can do now. 

00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:17.936
 Although I think you won't like this method 

00:02:17.936 --> 00:02:19.258
 What is it? What should we do? 

00:02:19.258 --> 00:02:20.510
 Plug it in! 

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:25.149
 Download a lot of information directly to your cerebral cortex 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:27.032
 And what you have to do is fight the knives. 

00:02:27.032 --> 00:02:29.252
 And destroy the "fruit" forever 

00:02:29.252 --> 00:02:31.668
 Wow, I know it now... 

00:02:31.668 --> 00:02:34.111
 I know all the "knocking on the door" jokes!! 

00:02:34.966 --> 00:02:38.378
 I feel a huge disturbance in the "fruit" 

00:02:38.377 --> 00:02:39.514
 He is not an individual 

00:02:39.514 --> 00:02:43.692
 All fruits are just the source of energy for the machine! 

00:02:43.693 --> 00:02:44.370
 Oh, are you? 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.420
 Then prepare to pick up my million bite (he said mega bite, with computer capacity unit megabytes=MB homophonic) 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.913
 Mr. Liu Ding, do you have a last word to say? 

00:02:50.913 --> 00:02:52.772
 Oh, I just want to say... 

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:54.354
 Knock on the door! Who is there? 

00:02:54.354 --> 00:02:56.263
 Annoying 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.395
 Yeah! I have done it! I destroyed the fruit! 

00:03:14.395 --> 00:03:16.867
 Solve that annoying thing! Then.. 

00:03:16.866 --> 00:03:19.548
 Make more mango juice! 

00:03:19.548 --> 00:03:20.516
 Oh, no 

00:03:20.516 --> 00:03:22.248
 Maybe you can beat one of us 

00:03:22.248 --> 00:03:24.972
 But you can never beat a thousand knives. 

00:03:24.973 --> 00:03:27.253
 Oh, it seems that I need a bigger ship... (need a bigger boat, slang, it is difficult to cope with the situation) 

00:03:27.252 --> 00:03:29.450
 Or is it better... motorboat!! 

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:39.906
 Liu Ding, you have done it! You saved us all!! 

00:03:39.907 --> 00:03:43.420
 Yes, I thought I couldn’t do it. 

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:46.805
 We are finally free! 

00:03:46.805 --> 00:03:48.734
 Yes, you are free. 

00:03:48.734 --> 00:03:51.070
 But please tell me what are you going to do in the future? 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.580
 Um... good question 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.558
 I want... 

00:03:54.558 --> 00:03:56.057
 99 boring on the wall~ 

00:03:56.057 --> 00:03:57.483
 99 boring~ 

00:03:57.483 --> 00:04:00.037
 He is really annoying 

00:04:00.037 --> 00:04:01.536
 Hey, fruit fanatics 

00:04:01.536 --> 00:04:03.074
