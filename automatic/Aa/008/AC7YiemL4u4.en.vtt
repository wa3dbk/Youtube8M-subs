00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.830
 good 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.559
 hello that such friends today in this video 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.560
 I'm going to show you how to set up the 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.570
 psp game emulator for our 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.510
 Android device 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.490
 here in the description I will leave you the 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.000
 link to a page where you can download 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.650
 this game totally free and then 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.820
 well let's start first the 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.220
 game to see that it is fluid 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.559
 and that they do not have any kind of look 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.220
 so you can see this in these 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.930
 moments I do not know if the camera is 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.930
 Focusing correctly 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.780
 well here I think I have some problems 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.580
 of synchronization with the good gamepad 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.800
 once the problems have been solved here 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.910
 of synchronization let's start 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.910
 again the game 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.480
 for as you first see the sound 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.260
 listen very clearly 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.020
 we are going to 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.450
 to start a game here as you see here 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.280
 because he is just recognizing there the 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.040
 bluetooth 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.119
 and we are going to order game I already have a 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.119
 here saved 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.440
 and let's give who 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.610
 and we are going to select the characters 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.610
 chance there 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.290
 Well now we are going to start with the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.290
 gameplay 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.220
 as you can see there can be very very fluid 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.010
 as you can see there, everything is very fast very 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.340
 fluid as if it were 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.760
 a foot 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.629
 and then there was nothing else to see that 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.860
 if you are very fluid with this configuration 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.770
 It should also be mentioned that after 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.380
 It will depend on each device 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.370
 but I hope and I can work this 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.470
 configuration and then at this time 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.260
 will start to happen on the screen what 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.390
 would be the configuration so that 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.580
 can copy the like can pause the 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.580
 video and until next time
