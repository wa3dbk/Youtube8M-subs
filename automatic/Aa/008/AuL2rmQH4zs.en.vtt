00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.500
 news project of you know news 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.570
 technological we are going to talk to you about the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.460
 novelty of the week by Apple 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.500
 because Paul has introduced us to 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.510
 car plane what in the beginning 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.430
 we thought he was going to call and 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.470
 os in the cars because now it seems that 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.330
 Call car play a much cooler name 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.250
 much more pro more professional than 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.230
 surely facing us hire 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.789
 this product when we go to buy 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.829
 a car because it could be a little 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.899
 more striking than something like that so closed 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.609
 as uncles in the car because the truth is 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.589
 which is much more than a system 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:46.319
 operative ios how are we going to analyze in 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:49.159
 this video we will see what is apple car 

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:49.159
 play off 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.579
 sure many of you who have 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.500
 a state-of-the- art smartphone 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.420
 you have in your car a stand for 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.000
 put your device and power 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.250
 interact with gps applications 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.079
 with the map apps or at the end 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.720
 because with calls through the 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.420
 bluetooth and such no but thanks to paul 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.940
 have taken out a service in affiliation with 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.409
 different vehicle partners in a 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.780
 they have started up all in the car 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.210
 now available for ferrari to 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.100
 dust and for mercedes but soon 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.990
 will be available to force 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.729
 general motors for filters and other 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.840
 many brands the operation the 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.940
 it's quite simple 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.159
 you just need an iphone that 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.840
 have the lightning connector the new 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.179
 connector that the guys have incorporated 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.159
 of apple in its latest devices the 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:35.450
 where 30 pins is not worth so 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.789
 you when you get to the car 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.069
 you click your device on the stand 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.009
 that you will have a lightning connector and 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:45.350
 if you have an iphone 5 505 s you are going to be able to 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.119
 use car play from here the 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.740
 system is going to integrate perfectly 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.240
 with our vehicle in such a way that 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.100
 we simply have to give 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.750
 instructions to follow on the flyer 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.909
 we will have a little button that when 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.159
 press, let's be able to send 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.840
 so I saw very comfortably simply 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.909
 sending voice messages too 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.710
 we will have a large screen 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.929
 where we will be able to see everything that is 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.640
 happening on our smartphone in our 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.080
 iphone not because the truth is that we're going 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.390
 to be able to tell him to follow and that we 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.160
 indicate the instructions to reach 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.720
 a destination or quietly 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.819
 we can tell sidi to open us 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.010
 spotify and we can listen 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.450
 music without any problems in 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.790
 definitive all the options that 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.769
 we have in iphone we could have in 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.780
 our car but controlled one 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.910
 super intuitive way we will have a 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.739
 touch screen where we will go 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.299
 pressing the different applications that 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.190
 we have in our iphone or 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.959
 us directly through siri 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.849
 by voice message or by pressing the 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.500
 button on the steering wheel at the end 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.810
 we will be able to send these instructions 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.579
 to control a lot and our 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.500
 iphone device in the car 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.810
 it's just this guys is something 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.299
 pretty simple but it's a +1 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.620
 part of apple that have taken this out of 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.120
 this way so when we go to 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.829
 buy a new car we can ask 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.690
 that integrate us car play in our 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.390
 vehicle to have the best car 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.650
