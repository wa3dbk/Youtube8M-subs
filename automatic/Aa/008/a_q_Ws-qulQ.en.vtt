00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:27.680
 by yesterday's law the blog was when 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.110
 always like Maria blogs of children but 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.210
 night by children and adults most 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.640
 then it occurred to us that I 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.250
 write the blog and bringing the 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.350
 handkerchief is vital about the understand 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.890
 baldera I really like the color as 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.769
 yellow metallic collar problem 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.809
 because I love the lungs the 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.879
 T-shirt is tribune I really like the 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.789
 color and that out of jeans the legs 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.829
 they were too much when she was a girl and 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.170
 I found in an old drawer and barely 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.649
 rows that for me in the sneakers 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.649
 converse 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.360
 I like to say what it was is that I did not 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.720
 I passed super well and can feel what 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.610
 you feel in writing it and not 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.729
 having to be famous someone in the 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.380
 tele who know you invite you to see 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.360
 children's events 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.430
 entertaining summers we have to go to the 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.560
 school and the block does not complicate me so much 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:27.410
 because they send us so many tasks and 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.830
 then that also makes it easier for me 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.860
 I can write what has complicated me 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.470
 when they will put me to read books and I do not 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.899
 I am of the meanwhile then we are a 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.500
 little with this but we always have the 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:45.259
 my classmates I bought it in a 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.360
 sale that some girls were doing and 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.259
 then I loved the animal print and I 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.100
 will share it the jacket I write when 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.770
 receive the bought I was big but 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.020
 I liked it so much that I bought it the same and 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.320
 I hope to grow and now I have almost 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.220
 girl and back I put an extra so that 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.610
 our lives 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.410
 I'm collecting then always 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.590
 I find good I wear it 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.840
 this is like a dress shirt is of 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.630
 Designer Changes 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.220
 we made a look with him then I 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.060
 You gave it away because it was the one I like the most 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.100
 the sun is agate ruiz de la prada me 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.790
 really liked the color in the hearts the 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.579
 button also the shoes are foam 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.189
 super-basic white combine with everything 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.500
 and I think I have no fixed destination 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.719
 because I still be a girl and it 's all these 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.450
 things but it always depends on the occasion 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:42.500
 for example if I go in the event for 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.540
 put on a skirt 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.660
 with a nice shirt and a jacket 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.390
 but if I'm going to go out to the corner 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.200
 example of the square with jeans and a 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.180
 polerÃ³n 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.820
 what I always look for the clothes that I 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.000
 I put it like they have details that 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.980
 be more special more unique and also 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.260
 for example the colors fluorine me 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.780
 they always love I have enough stuff with 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.850
 these colors or the pastel shades 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.660
 they like very much also very we look at the 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.660
 garment that in the brand 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.370
 Fixed either the brand or only served 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.800
 for example to see what clothes do I have 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.510
 one of the big stores but the clothes 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.320
 in general, I do like it 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.570
 the handkerchief was that era of the town of 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.910
 moms and we did everything and I know what 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.630
 I changed because I really liked the flies 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.810
 the shirt will be in this one shirt 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.760
 basic then it will be super normal the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.970
 phone on clothes I always look for things 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.900
 like they have something special I do not know 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.860
 loved by the buttons 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.510
 the skirt of hannah montana 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.330
 I really liked the legs too 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.660
 then he has a back looked and 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.210
 I wanted to have a wall and hers 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.480
 The shoes were brought by my grandmother from Argentina 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:04.270
 when he went to buenos aires and I liked them 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.300
 much like many big do 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.400
 I still do not know but I would always like 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.930
 continue with the blog to write always 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.760
 of more fashions and I still do not have it so 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.560
 Of course, that's how I'd like to do 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.350
 but always continue with fashion and with 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.710
 what I have clear 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.000
 Swarovski necklace I really like 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.370
 because apart from being a necklace it is also 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.440
 pendrive and the jacket I bought it in 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.610
 micropolix and I liked it a lot because it 's from 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.950
 the team captain tricks the skirt 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.940
 that I always bought it in germany 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.830
 I really liked how it is like you the shirt 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.470
 I really liked the color with green water 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.240
 it's not special is the shoes are the 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.640
 around more because I love the color 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.220
 the sides also buy them in 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.860
