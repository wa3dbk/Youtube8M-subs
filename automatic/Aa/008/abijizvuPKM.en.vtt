00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
it and so this is pretty much here umm I

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.650 
it and so this is pretty much here umm I
think<00:01:01.649> pretty<00:01:02.100> much<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.699> website<00:01:02.910> if<00:01:03.359> it

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
think pretty much on this website if it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.050 
think pretty much on this website if it
is<00:01:03.840> unknown<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.619> mean<00:01:05.280> not<00:01:05.369> unknown<00:01:05.760> if<00:01:05.909> it's

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
is unknown I mean not unknown if it's
