00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.000
 new episode of the nuclear moment in the 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.340

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.950
 map because it's really fucked will get 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.770
 something here the good thing is the map that more 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:33.890
 usually play in this mode I do not know what happens 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.890
 that is always worth a lot of times to see 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.730
 and with this it appears 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.690
 I do not think well of everyone's head 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.640

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.550
 reasons I did not know I did not know 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.550

 little by little little by little or third and that 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.090
 I like little when they play today 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.410
 or a burst 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.510

 and over with a quick charger here yes 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.830
 that I can take a few losses to know 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.270
 is that they always put the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.660
 in the corner at the end of the map was 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.660

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.300

 little there in the house but is that if not yes 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.240
 it's not like that you've already seen that it costs 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.960
 very much and a minute no no 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.960
 good 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.949
 to give time 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.160
 one minute is impossible 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.460
 this 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.740
 but good good 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.670
 the 10-2 run is that if they do not reach me 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.470
 to kill the water 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.630
 If they do not kill me, we're going to go 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.449
 sack good works well salgado there is a 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.099
 phase well 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.689
 I did not have to stay there in the 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.320
 house because they knew all the time since 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:31.480
 I was now there 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.200
 kill the country you see 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.200
 voucher voucher 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.410
 for me 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.460
 to another 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.530
 good good 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:50.400
 I was afraid that Louis was leaving and I was getting another 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:53.460
 low turbo I think good 52 8 thousand 110 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:57.180
 points in this mode a sniper 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.400
 I think it has been my record is a pass 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.840
 never had more than 900 points 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:08.310
 I think and well we have passed by 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:11.910
 and in a run of that of 22 I think that has 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:14.520
 been the streak 980 points for 2 has me 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.190
 given a pity that I have not given 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.610
 account when I went up because I already had one 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:23.610
 I get one works with the best with the 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.580
 Afa and I know well and an incredible low turbo 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.950
 better game I think it has been this and 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.190
 Well I hope you liked it and even 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.190
