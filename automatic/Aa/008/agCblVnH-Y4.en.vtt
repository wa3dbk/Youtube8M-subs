them with their fat loss school and it's

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.970 
them with their fat loss school and it's
not<00:02:48.910> so<00:02:49.750> let's<00:02:50.110> let's<00:02:50.410> get<00:02:50.530> further<00:02:50.770> into

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
not so let's let's get further into

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.060 
not so let's let's get further into

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
the peel and you don't have to weigh

the peel and you don't have to weigh
your<00:02:59.320> food<00:02:59.380> you<00:02:59.860> can<00:03:00.010> estimate<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.670> get

pretty close but for the purposes of

pretty close but for the purposes of
this<00:03:02.200> show<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.590> having<00:03:02.830> correct<00:03:03.100> macros<00:03:03.550> on

this show and having correct macros on
the<00:03:03.790> screen<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.240> did<00:03:04.690> weigh<00:03:04.810> this<00:03:04.960> out<00:03:05.640> 133

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
grams of banana our Raisin Bran is

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.460 
grams of banana our Raisin Bran is
actually<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:10.030> serving<00:03:10.570> and<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.780> half<00:03:10.990> and<00:03:11.320> the

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
actually a serving and a half and the

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.900 
actually a serving and a half and the
reason<00:03:11.740> I<00:03:11.800> did<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:11.980> is<00:03:12.130> I<00:03:12.370> poured<00:03:12.700> what<00:03:12.880> I

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
reason I did that is I poured what I

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.570 
reason I did that is I poured what I
thought<00:03:13.209> was<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.390> reasonable<00:03:13.720> Bowl<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.709> then<00:03:15.550> I

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
thought was a reasonable Bowl and then I

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.910 
thought was a reasonable Bowl and then I
just<00:03:15.850> waited<00:03:16.150> like<00:03:16.510> what<00:03:16.840> would<00:03:17.020> someone<00:03:17.680> eat

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
just waited like what would someone eat

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.520 
just waited like what would someone eat
for<00:03:18.340> a<00:03:18.370> bowl<00:03:18.670> of<00:03:18.700> cereal<00:03:19.060> because<00:03:19.450> if<00:03:20.350> you're

for a bowl of cereal because if you're

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.720 
for a bowl of cereal because if you're
just<00:03:20.560> pouring<00:03:20.860> cereal<00:03:21.130> you're<00:03:21.430> not<00:03:21.580> gonna

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
just pouring cereal you're not gonna

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.310 
just pouring cereal you're not gonna
look<00:03:21.910> at<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.120> label<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:22.420> be<00:03:22.540> like<00:03:22.660> oh<00:03:22.780> one

serving size is only one cup okay and

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.330 
serving size is only one cup okay and
then<00:03:26.200> pour<00:03:26.410> out<00:03:26.560> one<00:03:26.800> cup<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.190> measure

keep to keep you full longer so you

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.120 
keep to keep you full longer so you
don't<00:04:38.320> overeat<00:04:38.830> later<00:04:39.570> it<00:04:40.570> is<00:04:40.780> more<00:04:41.320> metabolic

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
don't overeat later it is more metabolic

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.430 
don't overeat later it is more metabolic

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
burnt via digestion it takes more work

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.000 
burnt via digestion it takes more work
for<00:04:52.210> our<00:04:52.300> body<00:04:52.479> to<00:04:52.720> digest<00:04:52.930> protein<00:04:53.560> so<00:04:53.770> we<00:04:53.890> did

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
for our body to digest protein so we did

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.890 
for our body to digest protein so we did
a<00:04:54.040> little<00:04:54.430> marginal<00:04:55.090> benefit<00:04:55.479> there<00:04:55.600> a<00:04:55.630> little

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
a little marginal benefit there a little

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.080 
a little marginal benefit there a little
extra<00:04:56.380> calorie<00:04:56.710> expenditure<00:04:56.850> when<00:04:57.850> we<00:04:57.970> eat

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
extra calorie expenditure when we eat

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.000 
extra calorie expenditure when we eat
more<00:04:58.240> protein<00:04:58.510> nothing<00:04:59.080> to<00:04:59.169> write<00:04:59.710> home<00:04:59.740> about

more protein nothing to write home about

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.750 
more protein nothing to write home about
but<00:05:00.419> pretty<00:05:01.419> helpful<00:05:01.630> and<00:05:01.900> if<00:05:02.410> you<00:05:03.370> like

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
but pretty helpful and if you like

having lean body mass muscle mass which

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.000 
having lean body mass muscle mass which
i<00:05:06.940> think<00:05:07.510> looks<00:05:07.810> good<00:05:08.260> and<00:05:08.410> many<00:05:08.560> people<00:05:08.860> do

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
i think looks good and many people do

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.640 
i think looks good and many people do
but<00:05:09.250> also<00:05:09.660> helps<00:05:10.660> keep<00:05:11.080> your<00:05:11.380> metabolism

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
but also helps keep your metabolism

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.370 
but also helps keep your metabolism
higher<00:05:12.310> and<00:05:12.520> lets<00:05:12.669> you<00:05:12.820> eat<00:05:13.180> more<00:05:13.419> keeping

higher and lets you eat more keeping
protein<00:05:14.770> higher<00:05:15.010> and<00:05:15.250> a<00:05:15.280> deficit<00:05:15.640> allows<00:05:15.970> you

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
protein higher and a deficit allows you

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.370 
protein higher and a deficit allows you
to<00:05:16.330> maintain<00:05:16.510> muscle<00:05:16.960> mass<00:05:18.060> so<00:05:19.060> this<00:05:20.020> whole

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
to maintain muscle mass so this whole

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.110 
to maintain muscle mass so this whole
breakfast<00:05:20.979> thing<00:05:21.720> terrible<00:05:23.910> should<00:05:24.910> you<00:05:24.970> eat

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.300 
want to for our alternative on the show
that<00:05:34.510> the<00:05:34.660> equals<00:05:35.110> is<00:05:35.380> like<00:05:35.590> headline<00:05:36.100> and
