00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.630

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.240
 the great fight of verona new during 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.190
 Ruslan Provodnikov talk that by 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.990
 title that does not but is one of the rows 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.869
 lucas that exceeds any kind of 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.120
 title or crown that are included 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.700
 subconscious where did you get here 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.340
 wanted lists and with a view to that as 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.920
 you see that buildings fight yes the truth 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.150
 I'm very happy and if I do not give myself 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.379
 account of where everything is not of the 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:38.200
 magnitude of the combat the truth that I 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.360
 makes happy and have the first the 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.810
 fight that bought an icon of a rival from 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.140
 first level 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:48.890
 and then if the interim or the good is 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.280
 well if you are going to take me one step further 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.830
 get the full title so good 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.630
 the fight have already been very important and 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.450
 I hope it is by full title not 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.040
 like accumulations we do not see that 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.460
 caused that it is a train that was going for 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.470
 ahead 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.869
 have some problems some 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.390
 difficulties at defense level in vain 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.940
 yesterday ' and walking won him for points 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.650
 but how do you see it two lucas to whom all 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.490
 catalog you in the United States as a 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.579
 Bell- to-Bell Flanger 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.729
 yes yes the truth to know that comes to 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:25.310
 front and nothing boxing polvito 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.950
 walking doing the times the 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.920
 times I think you can win and 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.680
 fighting him too I consider myself 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.200
 no fighter is a boxer so 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.210
 there is nothing to wait to see how it goes 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.939
 to copy the and there are the finished ones 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.210
 the insurance policy plan if we 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.280
 tonight two fighters fight here 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.709
 you faced same one you won 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.259
 expeditiously lamont peterson with the 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:53.119
 another you lost because of that contingency of 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.300
 eye and the fall of the eleventh round danny 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.640
 Garcia how do you see this fight 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.900
 if you still have 13 happy 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.540
 with a rematch with damage if I see it well 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.880
 it's going to be a very good fight 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.649
 the two champions of the category though 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.930
 they are not exposing the 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.180
 title of the wta that 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.519
 I think he will win at Garcia but 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.489
 peterson can surprise does not have a 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.069
 boxer accident for me was is the 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.549
 best in the category until I'm 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.409
 good that the Colombian elements are going to 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.379
 be a good strategy fight I think 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.989
 but and well you have to see your case very 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:36.079
 useful in mind 6 and the truth that yes 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.209
 still if it is or not so that's why 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:41.269
 I was looking to stop a fight 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.280
 mundialista to to tell me to give the 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.439
 rematch or have a chance to 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.379
 back he had with him or not after 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.750
 go up in category and look for it not the 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:53.880
 true that 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:57.660
 maybe when you go up in category it's 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.660
 I would like to face it 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.320
 Thank you
