00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.740
 Hello, today I will tell you how to choose 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:10.200
 good god speaker 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.240
 consider it on the example of 75 gdn 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.900
 secular speaker but here basically everything 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.020
 equally and so start from the beginning here for 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.560
 what do people sell two speakers 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.699
 the reasons are usually either lack of money 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.720
 yes to anything 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.359
 either he burned them they rewound him 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.700
 how not to understand how they sell for now again 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.950
 is there anything wrong either 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.480
 suspension somewhere broke or something 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:43.140
 someday there we start you in the market 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.180
 let's say you are buying the speaker 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:52.079
 what is important 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.809
 here it is almost all genome like that 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.199
 there are bolts here that they never 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.699
 did not turn off though like a speaker 82 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.820
 years before never unscrew the bolts 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:09.570
 here are all three this is a cobalt magnet yet 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.650
 old here also yes that is never 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:18.060
 Coil did not hide anything 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.070
 opened on it see here 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.090
 look so that nothing anywhere 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:29.400
 It has not been issued that all was ok 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:33.720
 next we take the speaker like this 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.850
 you can see all the native light flooded with epoxy 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.850
 Well, as the factory for the factory 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.360
 centering washer too she's like that 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.159
 native drip Soviet and bauxite cinema 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:53.130
 which she sat that is now 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:02:01.250
 here everything is as it should stand 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:05.299
 over there, too, everything is as it should be 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.489
 here we see that the dynamics of normal 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:12.390
 he got me cheap because here 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.660
 here he is such a type once 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.970
 dust is not like it's called torn though 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.050
 this is the best thing to be with 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.780
 these speakers, that is, here is the suspension 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.940
 he has never been a whole from 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.310
 glued exactly on the factory street 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.580
 This is not a problem at all. This is the most 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.739
 neither is easy to fix i'm here any 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:40.920
 beer put the sound of this does not spoil 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:43.560
 here well from look there on these 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.110
 new speakers to the suspension was 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.680
 normal so there is nothing anywhere 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.250
 it was up on the new new speakers 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.860
 sample 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.129
 especially 2 bobbins they have windows 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.159
 where directly seen on the winding winding and 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:02.220
 should be black such as to find when 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.230
 it burns the speaker it darkens here 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.230
 sawdust straight dark-it becomes dark 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.080
 should be like copper here is a pancake here 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.120
 probably poorly visible but as light leads 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:20.310
 to oxygen-free to have light should 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:21.989
 be winding and and then everything is well as not 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.110
 there is always the ability to connect 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.209
 just like that shake up and down not 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.590
 there should be no extra sound 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.970
 strangers here quietly swinging 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.370
 should swing easily especially if 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.590
 speaker is old it is already mashed suspension 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.370
 soft already should be he should 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.470
 very easy to swing and everything 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.959
 Guided by this you can choose 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.940
 good speaker 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:51.840
 if you noticed whale smudges here 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.900
 moment there is some here on the smudges 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.849
 moment there is not exactly something worth somewhere 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.799
 torn these bolts let's say already 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:03.750
 I wish to unscrew from such a purchase you 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.330
 refrain unless of course it is at all 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.920
 for three pennies that is, this speaker is not 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.540
 got cheap now this boot 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.810
 re-stick and all 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.180
 thank you all for watching subscribe 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.840
 on the channel next video I will show how 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:23.389
 you can slightly improve this speaker 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.389
 that he worked until NASA buffer
