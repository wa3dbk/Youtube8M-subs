he's quite a dark coloration you can see

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.649 
he's quite a dark coloration you can see
he's<00:02:08.679> he's<00:02:09.369> gonna<00:02:09.550> be<00:02:09.700> a<00:02:09.729> complete<00:02:10.149> opposite

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 
he's he's gonna be a complete opposite

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.009 
he's he's gonna be a complete opposite
when<00:02:10.840> he's<00:02:10.959> lit<00:02:11.170> up<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:12.819> he<00:02:13.480> does<00:02:13.690> actually

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
when he's lit up but he does actually

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.229 
when he's lit up but he does actually
still<00:02:14.260> remind<00:02:14.650> me<00:02:14.739> of<00:02:14.769> the<00:02:14.950> Papo<00:02:15.340> t-rex<00:02:15.849> quite

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
still remind me of the Papo t-rex quite

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.040 
still remind me of the Papo t-rex quite
a<00:02:16.269> lot<00:02:16.709> I<00:02:17.709> think<00:02:18.099> it's<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.400> pose<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.870> use

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
a lot I think it's the pose and the use

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.990 
a lot I think it's the pose and the use
of<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.350> different<00:02:20.500> colors<00:02:20.950> of<00:02:21.100> green<00:02:21.400> it's

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
of the different colors of green it's

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.800 
of the different colors of green it's
making<00:02:22.390> me<00:02:22.510> think<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.290> Papo

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
making me think of the Papo

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.320 
making me think of the Papo
to<00:02:23.900> your<00:02:24.020> ex<00:02:24.459> okay<00:02:25.459> so<00:02:25.520> let's<00:02:25.880> get<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.060> closer

to your ex okay so let's get a closer

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.320 
to your ex okay so let's get a closer

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
look at him quickly if I focus on the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.339 
look at him quickly if I focus on the
head<00:02:29.540> there<00:02:29.890> you<00:02:30.890> can<00:02:31.130> see<00:02:31.630> he<00:02:32.630> looks<00:02:32.930> quite

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
head there you can see he looks quite

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.710 
head there you can see he looks quite
angry<00:02:33.650> he<00:02:34.340> is<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.430> little<00:02:34.760> bit<00:02:34.910> reminiscent<00:02:35.330> of

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
angry he is a little bit reminiscent of

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.380 
angry he is a little bit reminiscent of
the<00:02:36.020> Jurassic<00:02:36.560> Park<00:02:36.770> t-rex<00:02:37.250> I'd<00:02:38.090> say<00:02:38.270> he

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
the Jurassic Park t-rex I'd say he

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.020 
the Jurassic Park t-rex I'd say he
almost<00:02:38.630> looks<00:02:38.870> like<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.230> baby<00:02:39.410> t-rex<00:02:40.030> more

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
almost looks like the baby t-rex more

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.660 
almost looks like the baby t-rex more
than<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.420> adult<00:02:41.780> t-rex<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.560> way<00:02:42.709> but<00:02:43.459> yeah

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
than the adult t-rex in a way but yeah

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.280 
than the adult t-rex in a way but yeah
he<00:02:43.819> is<00:02:43.910> very<00:02:44.000> reminiscent<00:02:44.569> of<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.050> Jurassic

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.979 
he is very reminiscent of the Jurassic
Park<00:02:45.620> t-rex<00:02:46.130> and<00:02:46.519> you<00:02:47.420> can<00:02:47.569> see<00:02:47.720> they've<00:02:47.870> even

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
Park t-rex and you can see they've even

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.400 
Park t-rex and you can see they've even
painted<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.620> teeth<00:02:49.630> individually<00:02:50.630> there's

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709
