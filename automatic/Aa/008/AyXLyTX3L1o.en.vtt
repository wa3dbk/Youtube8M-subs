00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.180

describe the brain structures and in
many<00:01:27.350> cases<00:01:27.860> to<00:01:28.420> associate<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:30.259> change<00:01:30.979> in

human behavior with a change in brain
structure<00:01:35.110> but<00:01:36.110> I<00:01:36.140> think<00:01:36.380> what<00:01:36.500> has<00:01:36.620> really

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
structure but I think what has really

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.010 
structure but I think what has really
radically<00:01:37.400> transformed<00:01:38.150> our<00:01:38.510> ability<00:01:38.960> to

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
radically transformed our ability to

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.250 
radically transformed our ability to

sort of probe brain function it's been

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.960 
sort of probe brain function it's been
very<00:01:42.500> much<00:01:42.620> driven<00:01:42.830> by<00:01:43.010> technology<00:01:43.549> our

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
very much driven by technology our

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.280 
very much driven by technology our

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
both human and animal brain function and

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.230 
both human and animal brain function and
I<00:01:54.920> think<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.490> opportunity<00:01:55.729> that

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
I think the the opportunity that

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.100 
I think the the opportunity that
understand<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.720> challenge<00:01:57.049> of

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
understand the challenge of

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.920 
understand the challenge of
understanding<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:57.979> brain<00:01:58.220> offices<00:01:59.000> is<00:01:59.210> that

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
understanding the brain offices is that

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.660 
understanding the brain offices is that
I<00:01:59.960> think<00:02:00.290> for<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.560> for<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.070> first<00:02:01.280> time<00:02:01.520> it

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
I think for the for the first time it

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.780 
I think for the for the first time it
really<00:02:02.180> allows<00:02:02.869> us<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.979> work<00:02:04.220> across

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
really allows us to work across

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.990 
really allows us to work across
disciplines<00:02:05.290> it's<00:02:06.290> about<00:02:06.590> actually

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
disciplines it's about actually

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.300 
disciplines it's about actually
integrating<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.479> humanities<00:02:09.229> with<00:02:10.130> the

integrating the humanities with the

I<00:02:11.090> think<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.250> Wellcome<00:02:13.250> Trust<00:02:13.340> occupies<00:02:13.880> a

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
I think the Wellcome Trust occupies a

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.270 
I think the Wellcome Trust occupies a
unique<00:02:14.060> position<00:02:14.840> in<00:02:15.230> British<00:02:15.739> life<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.190> we

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
unique position in British life and we

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.000 
unique position in British life and we
believe<00:02:16.549> in<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.820> world<00:02:16.940> in<00:02:17.390> having<00:02:18.019> this<00:02:18.620> kind

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
believe in the world in having this kind

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.240 
believe in the world in having this kind
of<00:02:19.160> equal<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.380> self<00:02:21.380> reinforcing<00:02:21.650> and

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
of equal and self reinforcing and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.410 
of equal and self reinforcing and
complementary<00:02:23.320> duality<00:02:24.320> about<00:02:24.769> its<00:02:24.980> mission

complementary duality about its mission

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.960 
complementary duality about its mission
clearly<00:02:26.420> it's<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:27.350> major<00:02:27.890> biomedical<00:02:28.519> Thunder

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
surface understanding the brain the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.450 
surface understanding the brain the
challenge<00:02:56.210> of<00:02:56.450> knowledge<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.410> think<00:02:58.040> is<00:02:58.130> almost

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
challenge of knowledge I think is almost

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.410 
challenge of knowledge I think is almost
an<00:02:59.290> unimaginable<00:03:00.290> amount<00:03:00.500> of<00:03:01.340> science<00:03:02.150> that

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
an unimaginable amount of science that

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.840 
an unimaginable amount of science that
still<00:03:02.750> needs<00:03:03.080> to<00:03:03.320> be<00:03:03.350> done<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:04.370> give<00:03:04.580> us<00:03:04.670> even

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
still needs to be done to give us even

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.460 
still needs to be done to give us even
the<00:03:05.150> basic<00:03:06.040> concept<00:03:07.040> of<00:03:07.250> what<00:03:08.240> a<00:03:09.050> neural

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
the basic concept of what a neural

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.100 
the basic concept of what a neural
circuit<00:03:09.950> actually<00:03:10.520> does<00:03:10.820> or<00:03:11.120> what<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.570> brain

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
circuit actually does or what a brain

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.260 
circuit actually does or what a brain
region<00:03:12.410> actually<00:03:13.370> does<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:13.850> how<00:03:14.120> it

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
region actually does and how it

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.710 
region actually does and how it
translates<00:03:14.810> into<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.970> behavior<00:03:16.970> of<00:03:17.150> whatever

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
translates into a behavior of whatever

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.310 
translates into a behavior of whatever
kind<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:23.030> most<00:03:23.150> amazing<00:03:23.690> thing<00:03:23.900> about<00:03:24.140> the

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
kind the most amazing thing about the

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.390 
kind the most amazing thing about the
brain<00:03:24.620> I<00:03:25.040> think<00:03:25.820> is<00:03:25.910> that<00:03:25.940> it's<00:03:26.210> inspired<00:03:27.400> so

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
brain I think is that it's inspired so

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.110 
brain I think is that it's inspired so
many<00:03:28.580> creative<00:03:29.240> people<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:31.310> think<00:03:31.580> deeply<00:03:32.000> and

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
many creative people to think deeply and

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.020 
many creative people to think deeply and
profoundly<00:03:32.360> about<00:03:33.260> what<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.740> is<00:03:33.770> and<00:03:34.160> what<00:03:34.880> it

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
profoundly about what it is and what it

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.540 
profoundly about what it is and what it
does<00:03:35.860> writers<00:03:37.510> filmmakers<00:03:38.890> artists<00:03:39.890> as<00:03:40.070> well

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
does writers filmmakers artists as well

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.960 
does writers filmmakers artists as well
as<00:03:40.820> scientists<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:42.410> really<00:03:42.950> think<00:03:43.310> about<00:03:43.460> and

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
as scientists to really think about and

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.750 
as scientists to really think about and
ask<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:45.140> big<00:03:45.410> questions<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.100> big<00:03:46.310> questions

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
ask the big questions the big questions

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.949 
ask the big questions the big questions
about<00:03:47.560> mankind<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.800> big<00:03:48.980> questions<00:03:49.430> about

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
about mankind the big questions about

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.010 
about mankind the big questions about
Society<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:52.430> sometimes<00:03:52.790> think<00:03:53.450> of<00:03:53.570> it<00:03:53.690> as<00:03:53.840> if

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
Society and sometimes think of it as if

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.830 
Society and sometimes think of it as if
it's<00:03:54.770> kind<00:03:54.890> of<00:03:55.040> metaphor<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:55.459> ocean<00:03:55.940> so<00:03:56.810> I

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
it's kind of metaphor the ocean so I

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.050 
it's kind of metaphor the ocean so I
think<00:03:57.100> you<00:03:58.100> don't<00:03:58.250> look<00:03:58.310> at<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.580> surface<00:03:58.970> of

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
think you don't look at the surface of

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.730 
think you don't look at the surface of
the<00:03:59.150> brain<00:03:59.390> we<00:03:59.780> think<00:04:00.350> we<00:04:00.440> know<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.560> lot<00:04:00.680> about

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
the brain we think we know a lot about

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.740 
the brain we think we know a lot about
how<00:04:01.010> it<00:04:01.040> works<00:04:01.370> but<00:04:01.670> actually<00:04:02.060> there's<00:04:02.330> a<00:04:02.390> huge

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
how it works but actually there's a huge

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.890 
how it works but actually there's a huge
amount<00:04:03.740> of<00:04:04.040> hidden<00:04:04.610> mystery

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.970 

and<00:04:08.900> some<00:04:09.410> concerns<00:04:10.130> yes<00:04:10.430> bill<00:04:11.290> was<00:04:12.290> asking

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
and some concerns yes bill was asking

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.460 
and some concerns yes bill was asking
how<00:04:13.489> the<00:04:13.550> line<00:04:14.380> attached<00:04:15.380> but<00:04:16.989> we<00:04:17.989> are<00:04:18.139> asking

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
how the line attached but we are asking

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:34.770 
how the line attached but we are asking
a<00:04:19.040> special<00:04:19.730> skill

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780
