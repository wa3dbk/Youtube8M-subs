00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.740
 and good to all the boys and girls 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.290
 we are on a swat step 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.209
 paraguay today I bring you then another 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.760
 character again as I had said 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.570
 these last two weeks we are going to bring 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.200
 new characters 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.330
 here you are late 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.580
 the truth that hits very fast is very 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.680
 fast hitting 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.070
 then a basic attack after the 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.070
 traps 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.370
 they finish then a piranha the Greeks and 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.320
 I start to hurt 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.170
 and has kicks also loaded with 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.879
 shadow if you let yourself press button it 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.469
 It becomes invisible and leaves the traces of 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.899
 those tracks are hurting the 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.899
 enemies and then and at the end of 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.710
 attack as you see makes a strong attack 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.710
 that also harm enemies 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.670
 good teaches me its attacks and the trap 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.740
 the claw more damage to the trap then 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.390
 we can choose two paths or an attack 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.030
 of claw that throws two enemies by the 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.100
 air inflict more damage with the claws 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.560
 that is not bad because physically 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.320
 it hits very well and I wanted to try the two 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.780
 but no more left 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.030
 or throw the traps that you have 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.580
 seen that they are like piranhas that if there 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.580
 close to the enemies that will be attacked 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.009
 these are and this is a special attack 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.670
 good until I launch attacks with the 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.670
 claw while 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.160
 let's look at the bottom part the 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.940
 way you can choose what you want 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.940
 chosen this 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.210
 here we have increase in health nobody 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.430
 can with this cat then 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.070
 Touch the expression of damaged enemies 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.900
 let's forget to take the test 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.540
 we can improve the shadow kicks that 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.090
 the path above will do more harm than 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.159
 It is not bad either for or do 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.840
 the traces if we do the one above does not 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.810
 we can do it from the traces that 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.780
 open tray doing damage worth and your 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.230
 final ability is to become invisible 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.440
 and lasts longer when it's invisible 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.190
 you need to make shadows 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.500
 and then this road, well, yes, 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.510
 shopping if you do not buy this you do not become 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.510
 invisible would become a shadow 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.120
 the truth that is very cool we are going to 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.480
 take a screen and let's put it on 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.480
 action 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.600

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.950
 of disguising let me teach 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:12.160
 let's put the thieves 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.160
 for the box of thieves 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.350

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.500
 ship and the goebbels have taken away the

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.640
