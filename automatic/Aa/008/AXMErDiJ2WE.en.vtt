00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
around for just a second and then you

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.010 
around for just a second and then you
fold<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:52.260> little<00:00:52.559> bit<00:00:52.680> over<00:00:52.860> here<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:54.020> then

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the card sharp and it's super thin I

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.660 
the card sharp and it's super thin I

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
don't know how it's going to do in terms

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.780 
don't know how it's going to do in terms
of<00:01:08.820> durability<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:10.310> yeah<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.640> just

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
of durability but yeah this is just

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.980 
of durability but yeah this is just
something<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.180> was<00:01:12.299> really<00:01:12.630> excited

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990

only thing that I've noticed is like

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.050 
only thing that I've noticed is like
when<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:15.900> when<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.229> open<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.619> up<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:17.640> tends
