 the real game so I 'm connected 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.590
 the goal of the game is simple you touch 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.729

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.160
 with herbs 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:23.650
 and automatically it triggered me a 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:25.959
 fight here so choose one such as 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.430

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.959
 newer so cheniti 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:02.170
 I will not go I received a challenge this is 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.950
 I have my sore throat 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:10.189
 So shit shit shit shit refused 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.230
 the sorry fight is a voltaire 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:16.099
 electric against water it's not going to 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.500
 do so here for the first games 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:22.640
 the second game you will love to death 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.799
 you will love the road to the point fr 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.159
 even if it's called shinobi point fr 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.319
 it's naruto shinobi is an online game 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.930
 free game in which the player embodies a 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.290
 shinobi in one of the three villages of 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.040
 country 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.019
 you call nuclear the prime objective 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.750
 is to become the best at home 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.670
 so ninja for that various means 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.620
 exist as improving its 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.359

 equipment to take the mayors at all 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:55.430
 so equipment is equal kunai shuriken 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:59.900

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:03.680
