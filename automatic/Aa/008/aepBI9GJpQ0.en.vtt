because<00:01:15.330> obviously<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:16.500> you're<00:01:16.770> purchasing

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
because obviously if you're purchasing

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.590 
because obviously if you're purchasing
something<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:18.000> you're<00:01:18.450> probably

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
something like this you're probably

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.850 
something like this you're probably
gonna<00:01:18.780> want<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.049> show<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.320> off<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.619> that's<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
gonna want to show it off and that's a

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.770 
gonna want to show it off and that's a
nice<00:01:20.040> touch<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.490> bling<00:01:20.700> there<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.420> also<00:01:21.570> have

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
nice touch of bling there you also have

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.390 
nice touch of bling there you also have
controls<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:22.380> up<00:01:22.560> at<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> front<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.310> can

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
controls here up at the front so you can

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.830 
controls here up at the front so you can
change<00:01:23.790> different<00:01:24.240> modes<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
change different modes so you have a

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.499 
change different modes so you have a
temperature<00:01:25.200> fan<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.250> pump<00:01:26.520> control<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.360> can

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
temperature fan and pump control you can

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.330 
temperature fan and pump control you can
individually<00:01:28.140> select<00:01:28.530> each<00:01:28.740> one<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.100> those

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
individually select each one of those

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.069 
individually select each one of those
and<00:01:29.579> then<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.150> adjust<00:01:30.270> things<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:30.930> you

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
and then you can adjust things like you

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.710 
and then you can adjust things like you
can<00:01:31.229> say<00:01:31.439> i<00:01:31.650> want<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.250> GPUs<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.880> run<00:01:33.060> at<00:01:33.240> this

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
can say i want the GPUs to run at this

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.420 
can say i want the GPUs to run at this
temperature<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.470> then<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> fan<00:01:34.860> speed<00:01:35.040> will

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
temperature and then the fan speed will

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.370 
temperature and then the fan speed will
correct<00:01:35.939> itself<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.420> or<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.840> can<00:01:37.020> say<00:01:37.229> I

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
correct itself to that or you can say I

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.649 
correct itself to that or you can say I
want<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> fans<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.250> run<00:01:38.490> at<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.729> lower<00:01:38.880> rpm<00:01:39.420> so

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
want the fans to run at a lower rpm so

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.050 
want the fans to run at a lower rpm so
it's<00:01:39.810> near<00:01:40.229> silent<00:01:40.799> operation<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.549> then<00:01:41.970> it

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
it's near silent operation and then it

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.490 
it's near silent operation and then it
will<00:01:42.180> adjust<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.659> for<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.930> or<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.350> can

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
will adjust it for that or you can

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.080 
will adjust it for that or you can
increase<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> pump<00:01:44.159> speed<00:01:44.399> again<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:44.970> you

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
increase the pump speed again if you

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.730 
increase the pump speed again if you
want<00:01:45.299> additional<00:01:45.479> cooling<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.560> better

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
want additional cooling and better

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.170 
want additional cooling and better
performance<00:01:47.280> if<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.460> want<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.729> go<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:48.060> that

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
performance if you want to go for that

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
with upcoming GPUs and that's all I can

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.270 
with upcoming GPUs and that's all I can
say<00:02:15.420> for<00:02:15.450> now<00:02:15.629> now<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.290> cooler<00:02:16.620> itself<00:02:16.769> has<00:02:17.250> a

say for now now the cooler itself has a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.280 
say for now now the cooler itself has a
few<00:02:17.819> new<00:02:18.000> design<00:02:18.299> considerations<00:02:19.019> I'm<00:02:19.170> going

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
few new design considerations I'm going

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.080 
few new design considerations I'm going
to<00:02:19.349> start<00:02:19.530> with<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.680> aesthetic<00:02:20.280> one<00:02:20.489> which<00:02:20.939> I

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
to start with the aesthetic one which I

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.550 
to start with the aesthetic one which I
tend<00:02:21.329> to<00:02:21.420> like<00:02:21.510> which<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.079> wind<00:02:22.260> force

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
tend to like which is the wind force

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.559 
tend to like which is the wind force
logo<00:02:22.980> right<00:02:23.189> there<00:02:23.220> on<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.519> top<00:02:23.760> first<00:02:24.360> off

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
logo right there on the top first off

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.119 
logo right there on the top first off
it's<00:02:24.750> got<00:02:24.870> an<00:02:24.959> LED<00:02:25.349> now<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:25.739> it's<00:02:25.860> going<00:02:26.040> to

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
it's got an LED now so it's going to

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.679 
it's got an LED now so it's going to
light<00:02:26.400> up<00:02:26.549> like<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.879> demo<00:02:27.060> unit<00:02:27.360> we<00:02:27.450> have<00:02:27.569> in

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
light up like the demo unit we have in

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.240 
light up like the demo unit we have in
the<00:02:27.780> case<00:02:27.959> right<00:02:28.140> over<00:02:28.379> here<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.980> other<00:02:29.099> thing

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
the case right over here the other thing

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.069 
the case right over here the other thing
is<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.370> they<00:02:29.579> folded<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.180> upwards<00:02:30.629> up

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
is that they folded it upwards up

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.140 
is that they folded it upwards up
against<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.560> car<00:02:31.769> betweens<00:02:32.159> it's<00:02:32.610> not<00:02:32.790> quite

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
against the car betweens it's not quite

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.000 
against the car betweens it's not quite
as<00:02:33.269> high<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:34.140> also<00:02:34.230> means<00:02:34.530> when<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.799> card

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
as high and it also means when the card

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.289 
as high and it also means when the card
is<00:02:35.099> installed<00:02:35.340> in<00:02:35.670> your<00:02:35.730> case<00:02:36.000> you're

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
is installed in your case you're

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.610 
is installed in your case you're
actually<00:02:36.420> going<00:02:36.659> to<00:02:36.720> getting<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.989> nice<00:02:37.230> look<00:02:37.500> at

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
actually going to getting a nice look at

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.559 
actually going to getting a nice look at
the<00:02:37.709> wind<00:02:37.860> force<00:02:38.129> logo<00:02:38.519> and<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:39.150> course<00:02:39.359> the

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
the wind force logo and of course the

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.930 
the wind force logo and of course the
LED<00:02:39.959> behind<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.440> now<00:02:40.859> back<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.459> actual

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
LED behind it now back to the actual

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.089 
LED behind it now back to the actual
more<00:02:42.269> practical<00:02:42.989> applications<00:02:43.530> which<00:02:43.739> is<00:02:43.920> the

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
more practical applications which is the

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.069 
more practical applications which is the
new<00:02:44.250> design<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.909> fans<00:02:45.180> here<00:02:45.510> they<00:02:45.900> have<00:02:46.019> a

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
new design of the fans here they have a

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.809 
new design of the fans here they have a
special<00:02:46.349> curvature<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.159> blades<00:02:47.489> as<00:02:47.670> well

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
special curvature of the blades as well

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.280 
special curvature of the blades as well
as<00:02:47.909> an<00:02:48.000> extra<00:02:48.390> notch<00:02:48.629> there<00:02:48.930> that's<00:02:49.079> going<00:02:49.200> to

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
as an extra notch there that's going to

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.349 
as an extra notch there that's going to
help<00:02:49.409> improve<00:02:50.159> the<00:02:50.310> airflow<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.940> then

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
help improve the airflow and then

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.789 
help improve the airflow and then
they've<00:02:51.480> also<00:02:51.629> done<00:02:51.750> some<00:02:51.959> changes<00:02:52.530> with<00:02:52.680> the

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
they've also done some changes with the

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.009 
they've also done some changes with the
fin<00:02:52.980> stack<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.609> aluminum<00:02:54.510> fin<00:02:54.659> array<00:02:54.780> with

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
fin stack on the aluminum fin array with

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.509 
fin stack on the aluminum fin array with
the<00:02:55.109> copper<00:02:55.409> heatpipes<00:02:55.590> there<00:02:56.069> below<00:02:56.340> as<00:02:56.489> well

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
the copper heatpipes there below as well

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.000 
the copper heatpipes there below as well
they've<00:02:57.209> varied<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.049> height<00:02:58.319> of<00:02:58.560> each<00:02:58.829> of

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
they've varied the height of each of

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.349 
they've varied the height of each of
those<00:02:59.159> fins<00:02:59.519> and<00:02:59.790> that's<00:03:00.120> going<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.299> help

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
those fins and that's going to help

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.089 
those fins and that's going to help
reduce<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.750> air<00:03:01.109> resistance<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:01.859> they<00:03:01.950> can

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
reduce the air resistance so they can

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.099 
reduce the air resistance so they can
push<00:03:02.280> more<00:03:02.519> air<00:03:02.670> across<00:03:02.849> them<00:03:03.209> more<00:03:03.780> thermal

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
push more air across them more thermal

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.440 
push more air across them more thermal
dissipation<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.769> hence<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.459> 600<00:03:05.970> watt<00:03:06.120> TDP

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450

now of course on the bottom you still

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.309 
now of course on the bottom you still

have a full copper block that's going to

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.170 
have a full copper block that's going to

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
make contact with the GPU as well as

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.580 
make contact with the GPU as well as
additional<00:03:12.359> cooling<00:03:12.750> over<00:03:13.079> there<00:03:13.230> for<00:03:13.500> your

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
additional cooling over there for your

additional cooling over there for your
MOSFETs<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.220> VRMs<00:03:14.639> this<00:03:15.060> is<00:03:15.239> Raptor<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:16.200> is

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
MOSFETs and VRMs this is Raptor this is

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.069 
MOSFETs and VRMs this is Raptor this is
as<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.799> somewhat<00:03:17.699> ambidextrous<00:03:18.389> design<00:03:18.599> it<00:03:18.959> is

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
as a somewhat ambidextrous design it is

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.650 
as a somewhat ambidextrous design it is
a<00:03:19.109> symmetrical<00:03:19.859> design<00:03:20.040> there<00:03:20.639> are<00:03:20.790> left<00:03:21.540> in

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
a symmetrical design there are left in

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.119 
a symmetrical design there are left in
our<00:03:21.810> forward<00:03:22.169> and<00:03:22.260> back<00:03:22.349> buttons<00:03:22.379> on<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:22.949> side

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
our forward and back buttons on the side

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.710 
our forward and back buttons on the side
so<00:03:23.340> might<00:03:23.849> be<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> bit<00:03:24.180> more<00:03:24.329> suited<00:03:24.690> for

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
so might be a bit more suited for

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.939 
so might be a bit more suited for
righties<00:03:25.109> but<00:03:25.319> lefties<00:03:25.650> if<00:03:25.799> you're

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
righties but lefties if you're

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:27.500 
righties but lefties if you're
interested<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.910> is<00:03:26.940> also<00:03:27.299> a<00:03:27.329> possibility

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
interested that is also a possibility

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.349 
interested that is also a possibility
also<00:03:28.230> very<00:03:28.650> suited<00:03:29.010> for<00:03:29.190> claw<00:03:29.459> grip<00:03:29.790> holders

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
also very suited for claw grip holders

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.300 
also very suited for claw grip holders
so<00:03:30.599> if<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.379> hold<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.680> mouse<00:03:31.799> with<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.129> claw

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
so if you hold the mouse with the claw

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.559 
so if you hold the mouse with the claw
grip<00:03:32.519> this<00:03:32.819> is<00:03:32.940> going<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.120> be<00:03:33.209> something<00:03:33.419> that

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
grip this is going to be something that

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.210 
grip this is going to be something that
you<00:03:33.720> might<00:03:33.810> be<00:03:33.870> interested<00:03:33.989> in<00:03:34.500> apart<00:03:35.129> from

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
you might be interested in apart from

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.619 
you might be interested in apart from
that<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.549> have<00:03:35.699> a<00:03:35.730> sniper<00:03:36.150> button<00:03:36.540> available

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
that you have a sniper button available

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.479 
that you have a sniper button available
on<00:03:37.109> the<00:03:37.230> side<00:03:37.470> so<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.709> can<00:03:37.799> use<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.220> lower

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
on the side so you can use that to lower

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.789 
on the side so you can use that to lower
the<00:03:38.669> DPI<00:03:38.970> down<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.419> about<00:03:39.599> 400<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.560> will<00:03:40.709> help

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
the DPI down to about 400 that will help

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.259 
the DPI down to about 400 that will help
you<00:03:40.949> get<00:03:41.069> more<00:03:41.220> precision<00:03:41.609> aiming<00:03:41.879> if<00:03:42.120> you're

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
you get more precision aiming if you're

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.300 
you get more precision aiming if you're
playing<00:03:42.419> FPS<00:03:42.660> games<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.769> course<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.129> also

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
playing FPS games of course you also

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.159 
playing FPS games of course you also
have<00:03:44.669> dpi<00:03:45.090> adjustments<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:45.840> have<00:03:45.959> four

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
have dpi adjustments so you have four

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.020 
have dpi adjustments so you have four
settings<00:03:46.470> there<00:03:46.709> that<00:03:46.859> you<00:03:46.919> can<00:03:47.069> use<00:03:47.340> these

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
settings there that you can use these

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.430 
settings there that you can use these
buttons<00:03:48.239> on<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.569> tops<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.989> switch<00:03:49.199> back<00:03:49.410> and

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
buttons on the tops to switch back and

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.559 
buttons on the tops to switch back and
forth<00:03:49.620> between<00:03:49.919> you<00:03:50.579> have<00:03:50.730> some<00:03:50.910> LED<00:03:51.269> lighting

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
forth between you have some LED lighting

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.360 
forth between you have some LED lighting
going<00:03:51.810> on<00:03:51.959> on<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.199> side<00:03:52.440> there<00:03:52.680> as<00:03:52.919> well<00:03:53.129> as<00:03:53.250> on

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
going on on the side there as well as on

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.250 
going on on the side there as well as on
the<00:03:53.430> scroll<00:03:53.699> wheel<00:03:53.760> up<00:03:54.120> here<00:03:54.299> on<00:03:54.389> top<00:03:54.599> you<00:03:55.139> have

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
the scroll wheel up here on top you have

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.439 
the scroll wheel up here on top you have
a<00:03:55.290> red<00:03:55.560> LED<00:03:55.739> back<00:03:56.129> here<00:03:56.370> as<00:03:56.459> well<00:03:56.639> a<00:03:56.879> bit<00:03:57.329> of

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
a red LED back here as well a bit of

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.689 
a red LED back here as well a bit of
texture<00:03:57.870> here<00:03:58.290> kind<00:03:58.829> of<00:03:58.859> rubberized<00:03:59.190> texture

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
texture here kind of rubberized texture

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:00.740 
texture here kind of rubberized texture
so<00:03:59.909> that's<00:04:00.060> going<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.269> help<00:04:00.359> with<00:04:00.569> grip

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
so that's going to help with grip

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.360 
so that's going to help with grip
especially<00:04:01.230> if<00:04:01.290> you're<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.470> palm<00:04:01.709> grip<00:04:02.040> user

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
especially if you're a palm grip user

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.860 
especially if you're a palm grip user
and<00:04:02.669> then<00:04:03.030> of<00:04:03.120> course<00:04:03.299> we<00:04:03.449> have<00:04:03.569> red

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
and then of course we have red

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.390 
and then of course we have red
highlights<00:04:04.290> throughout<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:05.099> then<00:04:05.220> at<00:04:05.310> the

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
highlights throughout and then at the

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.949 
highlights throughout and then at the
bottom<00:04:05.430> I<00:04:05.760> took<00:04:05.819> off<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.239> bottom<00:04:06.510> panel<00:04:06.690> there

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
bottom I took off the bottom panel there

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.839 
bottom I took off the bottom panel there
just<00:04:07.169> to<00:04:07.260> show<00:04:07.440> you<00:04:07.470> not<00:04:08.010> only<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.370> optical

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
just to show you not only the optical

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.509 
just to show you not only the optical
sensor<00:04:09.209> with<00:04:09.359> 4,000<00:04:09.930> DPI<00:04:10.260> range<00:04:10.650> as<00:04:10.859> well<00:04:11.340> as

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.550 
sensor with 4,000 DPI range as well as
the<00:04:11.790> gaps<00:04:12.209> there<00:04:12.479> because<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.959> Raptor<00:04:13.229> also

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
the gaps there because the Raptor also

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.589 
the gaps there because the Raptor also
comes<00:04:13.799> with<00:04:14.040> a<00:04:14.400> weight<00:04:14.729> system<00:04:15.000> so<00:04:15.419> you<00:04:15.479> can

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
comes with a weight system so you can

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.270 
comes with a weight system so you can
adjust<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.169> weight<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.560> your<00:04:16.590> preference<00:04:17.070> and

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
adjust the weight to your preference and

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.529 
adjust the weight to your preference and
now<00:04:17.459> we're<00:04:17.609> over<00:04:17.760> here<00:04:17.880> at<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.090> motherboard

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
now we're over here at the motherboard

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.270 
now we're over here at the motherboard
area<00:04:18.810> did<00:04:19.049> you<00:04:19.169> know<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.500> gigabyte<00:04:19.859> has<00:04:20.039> a

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.560 
whole line of z97 motherboards yes you
probably<00:04:23.130> did<00:04:23.639> because<00:04:23.940> we've<00:04:24.090> covered<00:04:24.330> these

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
probably did because we've covered these

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.500 
probably did because we've covered these
a<00:04:24.810> lots<00:04:25.320> on<00:04:25.620> our<00:04:25.770> channel<00:04:26.130> now

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510

we wanted to show you guys is actually
some<00:04:33.320> of<00:04:33.350> the<00:04:33.440> demonstrations<00:04:34.100> they<00:04:34.250> have

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
some of the demonstrations they have

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.710 
some of the demonstrations they have
going<00:04:34.550> on<00:04:34.640> here<00:04:34.700> because<00:04:34.850> they<00:04:35.060> have<00:04:35.180> three

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
going on here because they have three

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.260 
going on here because they have three
systems<00:04:36.140> set<00:04:36.410> up<00:04:36.560> to<00:04:37.040> represent<00:04:37.580> say<00:04:37.820> some<00:04:38.150> of

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
systems set up to represent say some of

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.180 
systems set up to represent say some of
the<00:04:38.360> possible<00:04:38.930> options<00:04:39.110> that<00:04:39.650> you<00:04:39.740> might<00:04:39.980> have

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
the possible options that you might have

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.460 
the possible options that you might have
if<00:04:40.430> you're<00:04:40.820> a<00:04:41.060> certain<00:04:41.690> type<00:04:41.840> of<00:04:41.870> gamer<00:04:42.200> so

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
if you're a certain type of gamer so

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.380 
if you're a certain type of gamer so
this<00:04:42.710> one<00:04:42.860> for<00:04:43.070> example<00:04:43.100> is<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:43.880> gigabyte

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
this one for example is the gigabyte

this one for example is the gigabyte
g1.sniper<00:04:44.680> h6<00:04:45.680> this<00:04:45.980> is<00:04:46.100> an<00:04:46.250> H<00:04:46.540> 97<00:04:47.540> motherboard

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
g1.sniper h6 this is an H 97 motherboard

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.810 
g1.sniper h6 this is an H 97 motherboard
which<00:04:48.200> means<00:04:48.500> it<00:04:48.830> will<00:04:49.220> not<00:04:49.400> allow<00:04:49.580> you<00:04:49.610> to

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
which means it will not allow you to

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.430 
which means it will not allow you to
overclock<00:04:50.360> if<00:04:50.600> you're<00:04:50.810> going<00:04:50.960> for<00:04:51.200> say<00:04:51.350> an

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
overclock if you're going for say an

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.470 
overclock if you're going for say an
Intel<00:04:51.740> case<00:04:52.010> Q<00:04:52.220> processor<00:04:52.730> but<00:04:53.120> that's<00:04:53.300> why

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
Intel case Q processor but that's why

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.180 
Intel case Q processor but that's why
the<00:04:53.540> processor<00:04:54.260> that<00:04:54.440> they're<00:04:54.590> using<00:04:54.740> in<00:04:54.980> here

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
the processor that they're using in here

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.570 
the processor that they're using in here
is<00:04:55.310> a<00:04:55.550> core<00:04:55.850> i7<00:04:55.940> 47<00:04:56.900> 90<00:04:57.230> s<00:04:57.410> not<00:04:58.010> an<00:04:58.220> unlock

is a core i7 47 90 s not an unlock

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.190 
is a core i7 47 90 s not an unlock
processor<00:04:59.120> but<00:04:59.300> not<00:04:59.450> everyone<00:04:59.810> likes<00:05:00.020> to

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
processor but not everyone likes to

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.660 
processor but not everyone likes to
overclock<00:05:00.620> so<00:05:01.160> if<00:05:01.250> you<00:05:01.310> don't<00:05:01.430> like<00:05:01.580> to

certain types of platforms but what

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.030 
certain types of platforms but what
they've<00:05:47.600> actually<00:05:47.780> done<00:05:47.960> here<00:05:48.230> is<00:05:48.320> provided<00:05:48.860> a

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
they've actually done here is provided a

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.000 
they've actually done here is provided a
