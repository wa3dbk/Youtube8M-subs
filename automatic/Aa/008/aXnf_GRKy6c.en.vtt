00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.369 
this allen bolt out and this cap stays
on<00:00:53.120> some<00:00:54.120> people<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.570> pulled<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.870> cap<00:00:55.140> off

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
on some people that pulled the cap off

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.000 
on some people that pulled the cap off
and<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:56.640> they<00:00:56.850> try<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.530> bolt<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.770> like

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
and then they try and bolt this like

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.580 
and then they try and bolt this like
this<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.550> no<00:00:59.699> cap<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.270> they<00:01:01.230> wind<00:01:01.440> up

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
this with no cap and they wind up

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.179 
this with no cap and they wind up
breaking<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.430> bolt<00:01:02.640> because<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.180> too<00:01:03.840> long

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
breaking the bolt because it's too long

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.710 
breaking the bolt because it's too long
so<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.309> don't<00:01:05.430> want<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.640> do<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.479> is

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
so you don't want to do that so this is

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.190 
so you don't want to do that so this is
provided<00:01:07.500> with<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.880> proper<00:01:09.270> bolt<00:01:09.540> basically

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
provided with the proper bolt basically

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.630 
provided with the proper bolt basically
you're<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.770> drop<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
you're going to just drop that in the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.149 
you're going to just drop that in the
hole<00:01:11.850> there<00:01:13.040> drop<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.250> into<00:01:14.520> your<00:01:14.820> stock<00:01:15.119> cap

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
hole there drop that into your stock cap

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.990 
hole there drop that into your stock cap
stick<00:01:17.159> your<00:01:17.340> Allen<00:01:17.610> wrench<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:19.880> go<00:01:20.880> ahead

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
stick your Allen wrench here go ahead

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.870 
stick your Allen wrench here go ahead
and<00:01:21.979> start<00:01:22.979> threading<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:25.229> once<00:01:25.619> again

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
and start threading it and once again

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.230 
and start threading it and once again
you<00:01:26.880> have<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> option<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.630> use<00:01:27.900> an<00:01:29.060> Loctite<00:01:30.060> on

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
you have the option to use an Loctite on

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.080 
you have the option to use an Loctite on
this<00:01:30.450> bolt<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:31.140> never<00:01:31.680> do<00:01:31.950> never<00:01:32.490> had<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> problem

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
this bolt I never do never had a problem

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.190 
this bolt I never do never had a problem
I<00:01:34.189> don't<00:01:35.189> like<00:01:35.640> using<00:01:35.880> lock<00:01:36.210> type<00:01:36.479> too<00:01:37.020> much

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
I don't like using lock type too much

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.780 
I don't like using lock type too much
basically<00:01:37.860> if<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.070> ever<00:01:38.189> got<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.460> pull<00:01:38.640> this

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
basically if you ever got to pull this

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.149 
basically if you ever got to pull this
off<00:01:39.170> typically<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.229> got<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.439> put<00:01:40.590> heat<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.009> it

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
off typically you got to put heat to it

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.620 
off typically you got to put heat to it
so<00:01:41.970> what<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.630> do<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.560> want<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.280> get<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.329> so

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
so what I do is I I want to get this so

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.990 
so what I do is I I want to get this so
when<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.869> tighten<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:47.369> going<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> turn<00:01:47.970> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
when I tighten it it's going to turn a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.870 
when I tighten it it's going to turn a
little<00:01:48.240> bit<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.380> when<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.009> nice<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.220> tight<00:01:50.640> I

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
little bit so when it's nice and tight I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.969 
little bit so when it's nice and tight I
like<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.270> want<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.659> straight<00:01:52.259> up<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.560> down<00:01:52.590> so

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
like I want this straight up and down so

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.450 
like I want this straight up and down so
where<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.549> nice<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.509> even<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:55.200> is

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
where this is nice and even so this is

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.719 
where this is nice and even so this is
basically<00:01:56.460> ready<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.880> go<00:01:57.030> bolts<00:01:57.840> tight<00:01:58.729> now

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
basically ready to go bolts tight now

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.090 
basically ready to go bolts tight now
you're<00:01:59.909> going<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.119> want<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.329> take<00:02:00.479> this

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
you're going to want to take this

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.600 
you're going to want to take this
locking<00:02:02.100> mechanism<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.110> go<00:02:04.110> ahead<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.610> start

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
locking mechanism and go ahead and start

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.380 
locking mechanism and go ahead and start
threading<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.149> in

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.390 

and<00:02:10.390> it<00:02:10.570> actually<00:02:10.930> comes<00:02:11.230> with<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.590> key<00:02:11.860> in<00:02:12.130> it

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
and it actually comes with the key in it

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.480 
and it actually comes with the key in it
and<00:02:13.240> I'm<00:02:14.230> going<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.500> wind<00:02:14.710> up<00:02:14.920> putting<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.310> key

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
and I'm going to wind up putting the key

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:22.260 
and I'm going to wind up putting the key

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
and pop this out here okay so this goes

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.690 
and pop this out here okay so this goes
through<00:03:10.240> the<00:03:10.390> ring<00:03:10.600> of<00:03:10.720> your<00:03:10.840> helmet<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:12.489> just
