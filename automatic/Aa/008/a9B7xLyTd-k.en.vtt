games

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.520

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
so you stand here the only way he can't

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.350 
so you stand here the only way he can't
really<00:02:59.710> get<00:02:59.890> used<00:03:00.100> if<00:03:00.340> he<00:03:00.460> comes<00:03:00.730> up<00:03:00.910> here<00:03:01.120> so

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
really get used if he comes up here so

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.760 
really get used if he comes up here so
the<00:03:01.480> only<00:03:01.570> way<00:03:01.720> up<00:03:01.840> here<00:03:02.050> is<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.200> these<00:03:02.470> stairs

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
the only way up here is to these stairs

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.280 
the only way up here is to these stairs
all<00:03:03.730> right<00:03:03.850> so<00:03:04.330> I'll<00:03:04.450> come<00:03:04.630> up<00:03:04.720> here<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.140> now
