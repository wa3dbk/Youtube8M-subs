00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.340 
can see from these numbers you can see
that<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.150> almost<00:00:45.270> twice<00:00:45.690> as<00:00:45.720> fast<00:00:46.020> as<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
that it's almost twice as fast as the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.710 
that it's almost twice as fast as the
previous<00:00:46.680> generation<00:00:46.710> ipad<00:00:47.550> 4<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.510> ipad

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
next test is called GFX benchmark and

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.350 
next test is called GFX benchmark and
it's<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.979> test<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.550> graphic<00:01:26.910> abilities

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
it's going to test the graphic abilities

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.170

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.670 
to point to ok so keep in mind that with
this<00:01:53.700> core<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.090> lower<00:01:54.360> number<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.990> better<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
this core a lower number is better and

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.010 
this core a lower number is better and
once<00:01:56.159> again<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.670> new<00:01:56.909> iPad<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.509> faster<00:01:57.990> than

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
once again the new iPad is faster than

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.510 
once again the new iPad is faster than
all<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.500> others<00:01:58.740> when<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.070> comes<00:01:59.280> to

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
all of the others when it comes to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.359 
all of the others when it comes to
rendering<00:01:59.939> all<00:02:00.329> sorts<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.960> web<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:02.159> web

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
rendering all sorts of web of web

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.580 
rendering all sorts of web of web
objects<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.020> next<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.560> last

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
objects and for the next and the last

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.260 
objects and for the next and the last
part<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.220> short<00:02:05.520> video<00:02:05.640> we're<00:02:05.970> going<00:02:06.149> to

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
part of this short video we're going to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.969 
part of this short video we're going to
run<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> couple<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.110> games<00:02:07.350> on<00:02:07.590> all<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.860> these

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
run a couple of games on all of these

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.770 
run a couple of games on all of these
devices<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.670> we're<00:02:09.090> going<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.360> see<00:02:09.540> which<00:02:09.750> one

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
devices and we're going to see which one

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:53.510 
devices and we're going to see which one
of<00:02:09.929> them<00:02:10.200> loads<00:02:10.649> them<00:02:10.920> faster

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.290 

alright<00:02:54.520> that's<00:02:54.640> about<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:54.940> with<00:02:55.180> the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
alright that's about it with the

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.820 
alright that's about it with the
equipment<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.810> show<00:02:56.050> you<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.319> differences

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
equipment to show you the differences

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.340 
equipment to show you the differences
between<00:02:56.890> all<00:02:57.400> this<00:02:57.640> iPad<00:02:58.150> as<00:02:58.330> expected<00:02:59.290> the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
between all this iPad as expected the

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.470 
between all this iPad as expected the
new<00:02:59.650> iPad<00:03:00.010> air<00:03:00.160> is<00:03:00.310> faster<00:03:00.819> than<00:03:00.850> all<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.300> the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
new iPad air is faster than all of the

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.600 
new iPad air is faster than all of the
previous<00:03:01.750> generation<00:03:02.100> but<00:03:03.100> if<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.310> have<00:03:03.459> an

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
previous generation but if you have an

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.180 
previous generation but if you have an
iPad<00:03:03.910> 4<00:03:04.240> it's<00:03:04.720> not<00:03:04.870> really<00:03:05.050> a<00:03:05.170> lot<00:03:05.500> faster<00:03:05.740> so

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
iPad 4 it's not really a lot faster so

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.400 
iPad 4 it's not really a lot faster so
it's<00:03:06.430> not<00:03:06.730> really<00:03:06.840> justifiable<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.900> pay

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
it's not really justifiable to pay

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.510 
it's not really justifiable to pay
another<00:03:08.890> 450<00:03:09.819> 500<00:03:10.270> 500<00:03:11.170> 600<00:03:11.739> dollars<00:03:12.010> for<00:03:12.340> the

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
another 450 500 500 600 dollars for the

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.850 
another 450 500 500 600 dollars for the
new<00:03:12.640> version<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.900> order<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.290> replace<00:03:14.560> your
