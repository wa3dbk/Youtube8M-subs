00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.900
 Only this laugh may bring one or two APA 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.050
 the 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.439
 for the parents 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.460
 the children are actually successful and which are not 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:26.069
 and then it was really up to us 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.029
 Packaging for me personally has succeeded during the well 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.840
 we wish designed 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.820
 Fantastic for me here »increased Super App 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.100
 for everyone but highly recommended 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.270
 around 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.220
 light function Mantek of course tends on the keyboard and a 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.940
 the fantastic 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.710
 so then you can also look at you can also refine the courses 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.560
 Lie with the normal a fiction kon-tiki too 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.270
 he became the countdown 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.920
 around 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.920
 exactly 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.220
 Cotton to show the course as the whole then 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
 you write the sheet 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.710
 successful 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.110
 So there's a lot of respect ICQ 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.960
 on the iPod Touch but the iPhone 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.080
 Dr fantastic 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.080
 that did not work so well I personally think 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.770
 SchülerVZ the teams themselves StudiVZ was in Quetta 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.710
 around 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.140
 you have percent I want all friends you can of course see who but 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.590
 on my side in Petterweil 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.670
 but 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.170
 around 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.430
 shortcoming 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.409
 unfortunately, God 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.229
 you can not read the pin boards pin boards you can not look at photos 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.480
 around and that 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.780
 is then for me for those in the really time a few days will be the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.330
 not at home is a great pity 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.330
 in some cases that even goes so far 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.279
 For example, AFP will be with the bears here 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:13.159
 the fitter the head gets cut off something public 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.189
 Program Dieter failure at the five-percent hurdle 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.959
 Langholt is up and up 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.819
 and percent but dry fields pity 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.739
 but you can also avoid that, or if you really can 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.949
 the bulletin boards of other lives want to make bulletin board entry 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.309
 then you can go with a lot easier or carpooling in the 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:35.769
 became a father 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.379
 open it 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.729
 SchülerVZ I could realized 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:42.139
 from the FMA this sight 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.219
 who wants to get up here 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:46.399
 view 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.289
 tilt 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.239
 that could turn into normal student representative then look like this 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.239
 Enlarge Dressed man 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.439
 he could lure in the "normal" and also in the entries 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.019
 read all draw or even the photo albums durchzuschcken all that 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.019
 works with the safari browser 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.389
 fantastic 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.529
 the mandate is to represent Schiller 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:10.669
 for those in the really 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.059
 around 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:15.059
 actively wants to do something in SchülerVZ is that 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:21.099
 more practical than handing over the safari browser 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.719
 Bulk load 8 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:23.809
 so 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:26.809
 Apn then find quite Vettel 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:28.919
 Lyon 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.729
 who in quite nice 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:33.299
 Blatter r tronic 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.699
 around 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:38.879
 which is based on the current position and if India program too 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.219
 was the current point of view 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.669
 then you can find it immediately 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:48.449
 Bank branches Pharmacies Cafes Bars Hotels Department stores Ezpeleta was 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.259
 Newcomer and could have a few punchlines 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:53.980
 next tactical option 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.679
 the offender 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:58.679
 where is the nearest restaurant in my area 

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:02.519
 Althoff is still there and then you can even 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.369
 as I also let the route show 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:09.609
 and how long you would need to get there 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.189
 Vienna Cath net exactly here is the point of view 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:16.779
 and there the desperate mother Marie Hofer road long drive 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.719
 exactly two minutes lasts whole and then one is allowed to go relative xml-data 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:25.159
 Chapel of May »highly recommended 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.159
 but which is even better 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:32.120
 he brings Euler 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.249
 to do with it can be if belong 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:38.249
 train if you still have a contract around 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:42.309
 and that's just about Matter tasks 

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:44.009
 also solve 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.009
 Clarify OEM 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.749
 should work on one or the other still 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:55.099
 around 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:55.910
 Mata 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.620
 Barney means Obama 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.660
 missing at the beginning include jogging alternative 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.410
 Umbach very interesting percentage Martin Sammer have tried 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.889
 Drilling Zeuner suffering 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.889
 costs 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.189
 what are you waiting for? 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:19.189
 Percent pa would like 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.729
 also have a very nice 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.650
 it's just about it 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:41.159
 to pick up here 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:44.159
 and everything completely empty for 8 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.620
 the harder of the defendant 

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:03.520
 impossible 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.669
 as possible 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.300
 then choose as few clicks as possible to clear Erdmann 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.949
 I believe in this game 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:14.949
 from boredom plates had the weir 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.639
 for being free 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.680
 but here leftover traffic definitely describes 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:31.659
 m better try it too 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.610
 Unfortunately 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.610
 free 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.960
 available for you 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.770
 these were my favorites 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.770
 it does not stay with you 

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:49.330
 Until next time
