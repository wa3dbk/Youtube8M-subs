00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
now I of course could say well it tastes

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.580

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
me of cinnamon toast crunch this cereal

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.250 
me of cinnamon toast crunch this cereal
just<00:03:47.120> of<00:03:47.239> course<00:03:47.270> a<00:03:47.630> little<00:03:47.870> thinner<00:03:48.080> a<00:03:48.170> little

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
just of course a little thinner a little

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.620 
just of course a little thinner a little
more<00:03:48.530> way<00:03:48.739> freer<00:03:49.040> but<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:49.910> definitely<00:03:50.209> tastes

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
more way freer but it definitely tastes

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.120 
more way freer but it definitely tastes
like<00:03:50.840> cinnamon<00:03:51.170> toast<00:03:51.590> crunch<00:03:51.739> to<00:03:52.130> me<00:03:52.630> it's

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
like cinnamon toast crunch to me it's

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.920 
like cinnamon toast crunch to me it's
the<00:03:55.130> shame<00:03:55.370> though<00:03:55.670> with<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.180> cinnamon<00:03:56.599> bun

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
the shame though with the cinnamon bun

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.840 
the shame though with the cinnamon bun
is<00:03:57.170> again<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.620> flavor<00:03:58.040> doesn't<00:03:58.340> last<00:03:58.640> very

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
is again the flavor doesn't last very

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.000 
is again the flavor doesn't last very
long<00:03:59.060> so<00:03:59.420> as<00:03:59.540> soon<00:03:59.720> as<00:03:59.780> you<00:03:59.870> eat<00:04:00.110> it<00:04:00.140> you<00:04:00.769> get

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
long so as soon as you eat it you get

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.979 
long so as soon as you eat it you get
you<00:04:01.580> get<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.790> flavoring<00:04:02.330> of<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.600> cinnamon

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
you get the flavoring of the cinnamon

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.789 
you get the flavoring of the cinnamon
bun<00:04:03.170> but<00:04:03.860> it<00:04:03.980> then<00:04:04.100> immediately<00:04:04.580> goes<00:04:04.910> away<00:04:05.180> I

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
bun but it then immediately goes away I

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.660 
bun but it then immediately goes away I
guess<00:04:06.799> that's<00:04:07.010> good<00:04:07.220> because<00:04:07.340> if<00:04:07.549> you're

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
guess that's good because if you're

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.100 
guess that's good because if you're
eating<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.970> whole<00:04:08.120> bag<00:04:08.330> of<00:04:08.540> these<00:04:08.660> these

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
eating a whole bag of these these

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.170 
eating a whole bag of these these
probably<00:04:09.709> of<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.190> four<00:04:10.489> would<00:04:10.819> be<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:11.030> ones

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
probably of the four would be the ones

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.610 
probably of the four would be the ones
that<00:04:11.269> you<00:04:11.390> would<00:04:11.510> get<00:04:11.630> too<00:04:11.780> tired<00:04:11.989> of<00:04:12.200> most

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
that you would get too tired of most

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.930 
that you would get too tired of most
especially<00:04:13.069> if<00:04:13.130> you<00:04:13.190> get<00:04:13.310> one<00:04:13.489> of<00:04:13.549> those<00:04:13.640> big

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
especially if you get one of those big

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.810 
especially if you get one of those big
