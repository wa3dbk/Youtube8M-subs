00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.949 
mushrooms we're basically going to boil
it<00:02:17.110> in<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.890> large<00:02:18.340> pot<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:19.239> doesn't<00:02:19.269> matter<00:02:19.780> you

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
it in a large pot it doesn't matter you

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.780 
it in a large pot it doesn't matter you
don't<00:02:20.049> have<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.470> really<00:02:20.650> measure<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.130> if<00:02:21.370> you

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
don't have to really measure it if you

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.009 
don't have to really measure it if you
do<00:02:21.940> want<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.209> measure<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.600> I<00:02:22.720> would<00:02:22.840> suggest

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
do want to measure it I would suggest

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.250 
do want to measure it I would suggest
putting<00:02:23.579> 8<00:02:24.579> cups<00:02:25.120> because<00:02:25.450> when<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:25.930> boil<00:02:26.140> it

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
putting 8 cups because when you boil it

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.319 
putting 8 cups because when you boil it
is<00:02:26.410> going<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.709> evaporate<00:02:27.040> after<00:02:27.970> its<00:02:28.120> boiled

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
is going to evaporate after its boiled

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.800 
is going to evaporate after its boiled
you<00:02:28.959> strain<00:02:29.350> it<00:02:29.380> like<00:02:29.950> so<00:02:30.280> use<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.120> strainer<00:02:31.480> and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
you strain it like so use a strainer and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.259 
you strain it like so use a strainer and
try<00:02:32.079> to<00:02:32.140> get<00:02:32.350> all<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.890> juices<00:02:33.280> out<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.730> the

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
try to get all of the juices out and the

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.000 
try to get all of the juices out and the
water<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.750> what<00:02:35.019> you're<00:02:35.170> going<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.380> use<00:02:35.440> to

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
water is what you're going to use to

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.009 
water is what you're going to use to
boil<00:02:36.609> your<00:02:36.820> rice<00:02:37.000> in<00:02:37.239> and<00:02:37.420> that's<00:02:37.690> what<00:02:37.810> makes

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
boil your rice in and that's what makes

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.690 
boil your rice in and that's what makes
it<00:02:38.170> black<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:38.859> we're<00:02:39.010> going<00:02:39.130> to<00:02:39.190> put<00:02:39.340> our<00:02:39.459> pot

while the water was boiling I tasted it

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.460 
while the water was boiling I tasted it
and<00:04:18.789> I<00:04:19.060> felt<00:04:19.299> like<00:04:19.419> I<00:04:19.479> needed<00:04:19.780> a<00:04:19.989> little<00:04:20.289> more

and I felt like I needed a little more
salt<00:04:20.769> so<00:04:21.340> I<00:04:21.400> added<00:04:21.609> like<00:04:22.389> two<00:04:22.600> pinches<00:04:22.960> of<00:04:23.020> salt

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
salt so I added like two pinches of salt

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.140 
salt so I added like two pinches of salt
you're<00:04:23.949> really<00:04:24.280> just<00:04:24.490> salt<00:04:24.970> to<00:04:25.120> taste

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.590 

and<00:04:52.980> we're<00:04:53.070> going<00:04:53.190> to<00:04:53.220> let<00:04:53.400> that<00:04:53.550> boil<00:04:53.910> until

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
and we're going to let that boil until

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.570 
and we're going to let that boil until
the<00:04:54.870> water<00:04:55.170> evaporates<00:04:55.230> then<00:04:56.130> we're<00:04:56.310> going<00:04:56.490> to

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
the water evaporates then we're going to

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.730 
the water evaporates then we're going to
cover<00:04:56.760> it<00:04:57.060> so<00:04:57.360> now<00:04:57.900> that<00:04:57.960> most<00:04:58.230> of<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.560> water

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
cover it so now that most of the water

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:17.690 
cover it so now that most of the water
has<00:04:58.980> evaporated<00:05:15.890> gonna<00:05:16.890> cover<00:05:17.130> it<00:05:17.370> and<00:05:17.580> let<00:05:17.640> it

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
has evaporated gonna cover it and let it

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.350 
has evaporated gonna cover it and let it
flip<00:05:17.910> up<00:05:18.120> and<00:05:19.460> you<00:05:20.460> have<00:05:20.610> to<00:05:20.730> lower<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.180> heat

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
flip up and you have to lower the heat

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.110 
flip up and you have to lower the heat
now<00:05:22.190> so<00:05:23.190> now<00:05:23.310> we're<00:05:23.430> going<00:05:23.550> to<00:05:23.610> check<00:05:23.760> our<00:05:23.940> rice
