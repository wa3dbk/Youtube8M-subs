sticking with us so we're just going to

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.780 
sticking with us so we're just going to
cut<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.810> up<00:02:42.900> into<00:02:43.080> course<00:02:43.380> chunks<00:02:43.860> you'll<00:02:44.700> do

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
cut it up into course chunks you'll do

cut it up into course chunks you'll do
the<00:02:44.910> same<00:02:44.940> if<00:02:45.330> you've<00:02:45.510> got<00:02:45.800> separate<00:02:46.800> dumb

the same if you've got separate dumb

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.980 
the same if you've got separate dumb
nuts<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.960> put<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.460> so<00:02:50.690> we're<00:02:51.690> just<00:02:51.720> going<00:02:51.900> to

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
nuts to put it so we're just going to

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.440 
nuts to put it so we're just going to
fold<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.320> into<00:02:52.590> our<00:02:52.770> dough<00:02:53.430> mixture<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.060> you

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
fold this into our dough mixture and you

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.290 
fold this into our dough mixture and you
should<00:02:54.720> end<00:02:55.020> up<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:56.130> same<00:02:56.300> evenly

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
should end up the same evenly

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.120 
should end up the same evenly
distributed<00:02:57.990> so<00:02:58.290> we<00:02:58.380> cannot<00:02:58.620> roll<00:02:58.860> it<00:02:58.980> out

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
distributed so we cannot roll it out

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.809 
distributed so we cannot roll it out
into<00:02:59.160> a<00:03:00.140> log<00:03:01.140> later<00:03:01.760> so

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.059 

once<00:03:05.599> it's<00:03:05.780> all<00:03:05.900> mixed<00:03:05.930> in<00:03:06.260> we<00:03:06.379> can<00:03:06.590> lightly

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
once it's all mixed in we can lightly

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.809 
once it's all mixed in we can lightly
flour<00:03:07.540> work<00:03:08.540> surface<00:03:09.079> and<00:03:09.230> then<00:03:09.819> actually

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
flour work surface and then actually

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.709 
flour work surface and then actually
roll<00:03:11.180> it<00:03:11.359> out<00:03:11.420> into<00:03:12.549> sort<00:03:13.549> of<00:03:13.609> 30<00:03:14.120> centimeters

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:14.719 
roll it out into sort of 30 centimeters

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:18.429 
roll it out into sort of 30 centimeters
by<00:03:14.980> 10<00:03:15.980> centimeter<00:03:16.489> log<00:03:17.079> just<00:03:18.079> sort<00:03:18.230> of<00:03:18.290> mean

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:18.439 
by 10 centimeter log just sort of mean

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.319 
by 10 centimeter log just sort of mean
when<00:03:18.879> this<00:03:19.879> is<00:03:20.060> this<00:03:20.180> is<00:03:20.329> what<00:03:20.480> we're<00:03:20.629> after<00:03:20.950> so

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
when this is this is what we're after so

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.349 
when this is this is what we're after so
will<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:23.719> header<00:03:23.930> oven<00:03:24.319> preheat<00:03:24.859> at<00:03:25.359> 180

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
will the header oven preheat at 180

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.199 
will the header oven preheat at 180
degrees<00:03:26.719> now<00:03:27.620> we're<00:03:27.859> going<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:28.010> spin<00:03:28.219> up<00:03:28.280> with

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
degrees now we're going to spin up with

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.050 
degrees now we're going to spin up with
this<00:03:29.359> on<00:03:29.599> to<00:03:29.810> some<00:03:30.349> baking<00:03:30.709> paper<00:03:30.909> stick<00:03:31.909> it<00:03:32.030> in

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
this on to some baking paper stick it in

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.149 
this on to some baking paper stick it in
the<00:03:32.180> oven<00:03:32.209> for<00:03:34.269> around<00:03:35.409> 25<00:03:36.409> minutes<00:03:36.859> or<00:03:37.069> until

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
the oven for around 25 minutes or until

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:41.920 
the oven for around 25 minutes or until
the<00:03:38.680> dough<00:03:39.680> itself<00:03:39.799> has<00:03:40.370> cooked<00:03:41.299> and<00:03:41.599> it<00:03:41.780> is

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
the dough itself has cooked and it is

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.830 
the dough itself has cooked and it is
golden<00:03:42.439> brown<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:43.849> it's<00:03:44.090> quite<00:03:44.419> firm<00:03:44.659> to

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
golden brown and it's quite firm to

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.990 
golden brown and it's quite firm to
touch<00:03:45.079> so<00:03:46.040> we<00:03:46.129> want<00:03:46.280> to<00:03:46.340> whip<00:03:46.519> it<00:03:46.549> back<00:03:46.760> out<00:03:46.939> of

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
touch so we want to whip it back out of

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.420 
touch so we want to whip it back out of
the<00:03:47.150> oven<00:03:47.239> and<00:03:47.510> put<00:03:48.379> a<00:03:48.439> wire<00:03:48.739> rack<00:03:48.949> to<00:03:48.980> cool<00:03:49.099> for

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
the oven and put a wire rack to cool for

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.280 
the oven and put a wire rack to cool for
10<00:03:49.609> minutes<00:03:49.669> until<00:03:50.599> we<00:03:50.750> get<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:50.989> the<00:03:51.019> next

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
10 minutes until we get to the next

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:58.959 
10 minutes until we get to the next
stage<00:03:53.769> ok<00:03:54.769> so<00:03:54.829> our<00:03:56.680> biscotti<00:03:57.680> has<00:03:58.129> cooled<00:03:58.849> down

00:03:58.959 --> 00:03:58.969 
stage ok so our biscotti has cooled down

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:01.059 
stage ok so our biscotti has cooled down
enough<00:03:59.419> so<00:04:00.079> I<00:04:00.139> can<00:04:00.260> cut<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:00.620> without<00:04:00.829> it

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
enough so I can cut it without it

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.459 
enough so I can cut it without it
falling<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:01.639> pieces<00:04:01.689> so<00:04:02.689> I'm<00:04:03.019> just<00:04:03.199> going<00:04:03.379> to

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:03.469 
falling to pieces so I'm just going to

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:09.729 
falling to pieces so I'm just going to
be<00:04:03.560> cutting<00:04:05.169> half-inch<00:04:06.169> pieces<00:04:07.480> until<00:04:08.480> I<00:04:08.930> ran

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
be cutting half-inch pieces until I ran

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.969 
be cutting half-inch pieces until I ran
out<00:04:09.919> of<00:04:09.949> biscotti<00:04:10.909> to<00:04:11.180> cut<00:04:11.359> so<00:04:11.659> once<00:04:12.620> we<00:04:12.769> cut

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:12.979 
out of biscotti to cut so once we cut

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:14.770 
out of biscotti to cut so once we cut
them<00:04:13.159> we're<00:04:13.489> just<00:04:13.669> going<00:04:13.879> to<00:04:13.970> put<00:04:14.150> them<00:04:14.359> back

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
them we're just going to put them back

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.399 
them we're just going to put them back
onto<00:04:15.079> our<00:04:15.759> baking<00:04:16.759> paper<00:04:16.970> on<00:04:17.299> an<00:04:17.419> unpin<00:04:18.139> and

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:18.409 
onto our baking paper on an unpin and

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:20.439 
onto our baking paper on an unpin and
we're<00:04:18.919> going<00:04:19.039> to<00:04:19.099> stick<00:04:19.250> it<00:04:19.370> back<00:04:19.609> into<00:04:20.180> the

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
we're going to stick it back into the

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:21.759 
we're going to stick it back into the
oven<00:04:20.570> but<00:04:20.870> this<00:04:21.049> time<00:04:21.199> we've<00:04:21.349> turned<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.739> oven

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
oven but this time we've turned the oven

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.159 
oven but this time we've turned the oven
down<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.250> around<00:04:23.030> 135<00:04:23.930> degrees<00:04:24.500> Celsius<00:04:26.169> we're

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
down to around 135 degrees Celsius we're

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.540 
down to around 135 degrees Celsius we're
just<00:04:27.259> going<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:28.240> cook<00:04:29.240> each<00:04:29.659> side<00:04:30.139> for<00:04:30.550> roughly

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
just going to cook each side for roughly

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.980 
just going to cook each side for roughly
8-10<00:04:31.880> minutes<00:04:32.500> so<00:04:33.500> after<00:04:34.039> 810<00:04:34.820> minutes<00:04:35.000> remove

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
8-10 minutes so after 810 minutes remove
