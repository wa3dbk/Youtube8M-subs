00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
to work offline these files and still be

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.140 
to work offline these files and still be
here<00:03:07.270> now<00:03:08.110> if<00:03:08.140> you're<00:03:08.500> working<00:03:08.680> Windows<00:03:09.220> 7<00:03:09.610> and

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
here now if you're working Windows 7 and

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.030 
here now if you're working Windows 7 and
you<00:03:10.300> have<00:03:10.450> access<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:10.930> it<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.470> you're

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
you have access to it and you're

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.320 
you have access to it and you're
probably<00:03:12.280> familiar<00:03:12.700> with<00:03:12.910> it<00:03:13.090> with<00:03:13.240> the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
probably familiar with it with the

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.750 
probably familiar with it with the
libraries<00:03:13.870> which<00:03:14.680> makes<00:03:14.890> it<00:03:15.040> much<00:03:15.160> easier<00:03:15.459> so

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
libraries which makes it much easier so

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.470 
libraries which makes it much easier so
you<00:03:15.790> can<00:03:15.970> add<00:03:16.180> any<00:03:16.360> location<00:03:16.990> you<00:03:17.110> like<00:03:17.310> now

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
you can add any location you like now

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.509 
you can add any location you like now
with<00:03:19.480> this<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:20.110> had<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:20.680> can't<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.250> can't

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
with this you had you can't you can't

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.370 
with this you had you can't you can't
put<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:21.760> network<00:03:22.150> location<00:03:22.269> on<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.930> libraries

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
put a network location on the libraries

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.720 
put a network location on the libraries
that<00:03:23.470> I've<00:03:23.620> been<00:03:23.830> indexed

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
that I've been indexed

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.330 
that I've been indexed
now<00:03:25.150> what<00:03:25.450> index<00:03:25.930> confuses<00:03:26.410> everyone<00:03:26.739> because

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
now what index confuses everyone because

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.920 
now what index confuses everyone because
what<00:03:27.820> the<00:03:27.940> hell<00:03:28.090> does<00:03:28.180> that<00:03:28.269> mean<00:03:28.510> you<00:03:28.720> click

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
what the hell does that mean you click

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.440 
what the hell does that mean you click
on<00:03:29.080> it<00:03:29.200> it<00:03:29.320> makes<00:03:29.530> no<00:03:29.739> sense<00:03:30.030> so<00:03:31.030> index

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
on it it makes no sense so index

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.930 
on it it makes no sense so index
basically<00:03:31.870> means<00:03:32.080> it<00:03:32.230> has<00:03:32.380> to<00:03:32.560> be<00:03:32.680> available

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
basically means it has to be available

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.940 
basically means it has to be available
offline<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.269> most<00:03:34.450> basic<00:03:34.930> terms<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:35.560> has<00:03:35.620> to

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
offline the most basic terms it has to

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.949 
offline the most basic terms it has to
be<00:03:36.070> available<00:03:36.459> offline<00:03:36.760> which<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.690> use

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
be available offline which you use

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.690 
be available offline which you use
wherever<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.410> are<00:03:38.440> it's<00:03:39.040> not<00:03:39.130> available<00:03:39.340> it's

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
wherever you are it's not available it's

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.100 
wherever you are it's not available it's
going<00:03:39.820> to<00:03:39.880> muck<00:03:40.030> up<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.209> library<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:40.840> so<00:03:41.019> on

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
going to muck up the library and so on

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.790 
going to muck up the library and so on
and<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:41.380> forth

it's<00:03:42.280> mainly<00:03:42.430> untrue<00:03:42.910> but<00:03:43.209> you<00:03:43.480> know<00:03:43.630> it's

it's mainly untrue but you know it's

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
just how it is Marx or thought to be

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.790 
just how it is Marx or thought to be
stupid<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.480> know<00:03:46.630> reference<00:03:47.410> marks<00:03:47.709> or

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
stupid and you know reference marks or

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.560 
stupid and you know reference marks or
anything<00:03:48.040> but<00:03:48.310> it<00:03:48.850> will<00:03:49.000> be<00:03:49.090> nice<00:03:49.209> just<00:03:49.540> to

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
anything but it will be nice just to

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.570 
anything but it will be nice just to
connect<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:50.050> it<00:03:50.170> but<00:03:50.950> in<00:03:51.040> a<00:03:51.100> way<00:03:51.160> it<00:03:51.340> kind<00:03:51.550> of

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
connect to it but in a way it kind of

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.050 
connect to it but in a way it kind of
makes<00:03:51.760> sense<00:03:52.019> so<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.620> have<00:03:54.190> this<00:03:54.340> feature<00:03:54.580> you

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
makes sense so to have this feature you

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.420 
makes sense so to have this feature you
need<00:03:55.239> to<00:03:55.450> basically<00:03:56.230> label<00:03:56.739> offline<00:03:57.160> files

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
need to basically label offline files

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.100 
need to basically label offline files
and<00:03:57.760> then<00:03:57.850> you<00:03:58.000> can<00:03:58.209> actually<00:03:58.450> add<00:03:58.989> your<00:04:01.110> file

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
and then you can actually add your file

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.900 
and then you can actually add your file
that's<00:04:02.380> protein<00:04:02.890> you<00:04:03.070> can't<00:04:03.340> do<00:04:03.640> it<00:04:03.760> without

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
that's protein you can't do it without

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.940 
that's protein you can't do it without

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
again so tells you how to be indexed but

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.860 
again so tells you how to be indexed but
the<00:04:30.670> best<00:04:30.820> way<00:04:30.940> of<00:04:30.970> doing<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:31.390> is<00:04:31.480> making<00:04:31.690> it

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
the best way of doing it is making it

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.890 
the best way of doing it is making it
offline<00:04:32.170> and<00:04:32.500> you<00:04:32.980> should<00:04:33.190> be<00:04:33.310> sorted<00:04:33.900> thanks
