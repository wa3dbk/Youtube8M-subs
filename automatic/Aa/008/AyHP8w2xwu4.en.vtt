00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
but three in this series of some new

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.890 
but three in this series of some new
knives<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.800> got<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.969> was<00:00:12.540> thinking<00:00:12.809> of

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
knives that I got I was thinking of

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.320 
knives that I got I was thinking of
doing<00:00:12.990> them<00:00:13.230> all<00:00:13.380> together<00:00:13.620> but<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.460> figured<00:00:15.089> I

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
doing them all together but I figured I

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.120 
doing them all together but I figured I
would<00:00:15.360> cut<00:00:15.870> them<00:00:15.960> up<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.289> do<00:00:16.529> each<00:00:16.710> separate

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
would cut them up and do each separate

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.560 
would cut them up and do each separate
little<00:00:17.369> video<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:17.940> if<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.180> don't<00:00:18.330> want<00:00:18.510> to

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010

of detail in there one of the things

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.539 
of detail in there one of the things
that<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.930> learned<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.590> when<00:01:22.950> people<00:01:23.189> are

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
that I learned is that when people are

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.310 
that I learned is that when people are
talking<00:01:24.090> about<00:01:24.180> slip<00:01:24.570> joints<00:01:24.960> they<00:01:25.110> talk

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
talking about slip joints they talk

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.700 
talking about slip joints they talk
about<00:01:25.470> their<00:01:25.950> walk<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.090> talk<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:28.080> what<00:01:28.560> that

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
about their walk and talk and what that

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.640 
about their walk and talk and what that
means<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> walk<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.600> smoothness<00:01:31.049> when

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
means is the walk is the smoothness when

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.740 
means is the walk is the smoothness when
the<00:01:31.829> blade<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.130> writing<00:01:32.790> along<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.390> spring

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the blade is writing along the spring

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.600 
the blade is writing along the spring
and<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:35.520> talk<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.450> sound<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.280> snap<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.520> it

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
and the talk is the sound a snap that it

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.210 
and the talk is the sound a snap that it
makes<00:01:38.820> when<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.119> closes<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.009> Davidson<00:01:41.009> knives

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
makes when it closes so Davidson knives

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.520 
makes when it closes so Davidson knives
have<00:01:41.490> perfect<00:01:41.970> walk<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.450> talk<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.259> have<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
have perfect walk and talk and I have to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.620 
have perfect walk and talk and I have to
agree<00:01:45.110> this<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.649> great<00:01:46.829> little<00:01:47.100> piece

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
agree this is just a great little piece

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.450 
agree this is just a great little piece
three<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> half<00:01:48.930> inches<00:01:49.259> closed<00:01:49.649> nice<00:01:50.189> like

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
three and a half inches closed nice like

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.590 
three and a half inches closed nice like
three<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.820> quarter<00:01:51.000> inch<00:01:51.299> three<00:01:51.570> inch

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
three and a quarter inch three inch

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.359 
three and a quarter inch three inch
blade<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.320> think<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.829> about<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.040> three<00:01:53.189> inch

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
blade I think this is about a three inch

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.109 
blade I think this is about a three inch
blade<00:01:54.920> if<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.310> may<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.030> little<00:01:57.240> bit<00:01:57.390> less

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
blade if that may be a little bit less

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.209 
blade if that may be a little bit less
but<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.750> wanted<00:02:01.320> something<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.770> would<00:02:02.040> carry

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
but I wanted something that would carry

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.450 
but I wanted something that would carry
discreetly<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.659> pocket<00:02:04.110> no<00:02:04.350> clip<00:02:04.680> very

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
discreetly in the pocket no clip very

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:15.860 
discreetly in the pocket no clip very
light<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:06.240> thing<00:02:06.509> weighs<00:02:08.149> nothing

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.680 

one<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.020> half<00:02:17.050> ounces<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:18.390> that's<00:02:19.390> due<00:02:19.660> to

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
one and a half ounces and that's due to

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.510 
one and a half ounces and that's due to
the<00:02:19.930> fact<00:02:20.140> that<00:02:20.290> it's<00:02:20.500> lighter<00:02:20.710> less<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.370> it's

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
the fact that it's lighter less so it's

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.400 
the fact that it's lighter less so it's
just<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.270> carbon<00:02:22.480> fiber<00:02:22.780> scale<00:02:23.170> on<00:02:23.320> the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
just the the carbon fiber scale on the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
just the the carbon fiber scale on the
spring<00:02:23.710> in<00:02:23.860> their<00:02:25.740> end<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:30.300> todd<00:02:31.410> has<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.440> really

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
spring in their end so todd has a really

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.190 
spring in their end so todd has a really
fast<00:02:33.700> turnaround<00:02:34.270> time<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.900> way<00:02:34.990> that<00:02:35.020> it
