00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 The staff looks at me here again. 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.769
 I wanted to share with you some of the 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.259
 things that have happened to me is a 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.500
 something that leaves people very happy and 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:26.460
 others make us sad I never in 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:29.369
 My life, I had this talking, I never said 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.810
 I figured, I never imagined that a 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.010
 day could record a video for the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.230
 Youtube for facebook was to have 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.450
 followers who accompany my 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:46.410
 day by day here who are interested in 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.899
 to learn something is through me that is what 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.649
 I'm never wondered, this is because 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.760
 I have a story in the past if well 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.410
 complicated that someday I'm going 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.210
 share with you already share 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:03.870
 many things and you know I have I have 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:10.250
 learned a lot and I must say six 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:12.600
 months and I have seen the 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.210
 impact that videos have given 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.020
 people arriving that never saw me 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.939
 They admire and hey sometimes go out to all 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.880
 so someone recognizes me on the street and asks 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:30.360
 To take an old photo, I guess. 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:33.030
 It's strange, I think. It's very strange, but 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.990
 I think it's cool. 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.439
 personal in the way that you treat me 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:44.220
 and in the middle of it is whether or not 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:47.759
 I do today is the role I'm 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.579
 developing on the internet today is something 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:55.259
 which has attracted many people to 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.509
 business for disney money received 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.290
 many proposals to do things 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.320
 right now I received a proposal for 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:10.920
 advertising for a brand is 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:16.470
 propaganda and I refused until 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.950
 staff a good money involved is not 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.500
 advertisement to make my kids ee 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.200
 talking about the brand was not like doing 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.510
 commercial advertising boy can give me 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:35.670
 clothing and such to start spreading is because 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:39.000

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.450
 wanting to find me and to say that I am the 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.480
 total bambambam but the channel has grown 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.650
 the number of views to be 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.650
 each month increases more 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.400
 so I have received many proposals 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.440
 a comrade law besides having been many 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.930
 Some proposals do not interest me 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:06.200
 and that rocked me because he was talking 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.159
 I will not speak quantity numbers no 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.450
 resubmitting the task of 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:15.569
 Fan concession will send a staff to 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.390
 Me here for miami to record some 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:22.459
 videos and commercial make-up smoothing the 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.459
 hair and make the bar 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:30.239
 Seriously, be serious and I refused. 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.069
 I refused for the reason that when I 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.950
 I got everyone knows already one faleci 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.620
 million times I 've never intended to 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.830
 idea was never to become famous target 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.069
 to bomb the internet to you, oh no, not the ones 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:48.440
 God never witnessed that. 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.440
 Who knows me knows this? 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.489
 It was never my intention I never imagined 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:58.950
 that this could happen then too 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:04:04.530
 what 's happening is happening and I do not 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:06.360
 know how to act in this situation're 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.250
 and this proposal I received I 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.909
 I refused, I'll tell you one reason. 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.799
 because behind the cameras 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.120
 brings a program behind one of a 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.090
 commercial 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.730
 there are many things that maybe some 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.520
 You know but the other has no idea. 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.590
 you have a contract and sign them you 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.199
 You have to do things their way and 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.340
 I'm not just that kind of staying 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.400
 orders 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:37.060
 I hate that I refused the proposal because 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.620
 had to affect something on the channel had to 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.889
 change some things 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.040
 the channel that does not like what could be 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:49.290
 bad for me the product image and I 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:52.690
 I declined cast know why until today 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:57.340
 nobody's got people talking 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.050
 nobody but such a superficial way 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.270
 ten people who have always helped me and 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.290
 gave some bloggers some strength in 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.550
 October is that they always gave me pulling strength 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.650
 I'll speak the name I 'll forget 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.180
 some but you always gave me strength and 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:15.130
 They talked about me in the videos. 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.539
 She always gave me support, but it's me. 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.270
 I've been learning a lot of things myself. 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:20.560
 other things asked who has more 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.060
 intimacy has people I talk to 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.830
 have a club you know that you do not have 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.780
 intimacy ask things 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.850
 There are some who call me to give me advice. 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.650
 did not understand was always open to 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.090
 receive even the criticism that the 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.610
 leaving the videos a few things for the 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:38.349
 people escape reason why I'm sucking 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:40.960
 and the proposal was to change the 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:45.400
 style of my videos my style of 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:50.080
 make video and some things on the channel 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:52.389
 not talking about some things the good to 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:58.479
 So you understand that I was going to play 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:59.590
 something that no one has ever helped 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.960
 grow up 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.080
 the channel is growing I think it's little 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:09.700
 Slowly, even 50 thousand 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:12.550
 civilians I'm still a baby but it has 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.440
 a lot of people are looking for me and there are people 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:20.770
 Older people who grow old 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:22.750
 I do not understand much tcds stop 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.310
 statistical numbers I understand nothing 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.099
 simply record the videos 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.560
 can you see I'm recording the 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:31.270
 phone and send it up 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.590
 my way of being 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.040
 So 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:37.810
 the intention of such personnel would move in 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.450
 channel do this thing all the way 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.680
 them and I refused because 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.240
 today everything I do is thinking of 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.630
 you 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.210
 although some people sometimes tell me 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.220
 Oeiras, you know who accompanies me. 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.500

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.970

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:59.950

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:03.700

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.510
 identify when you are serious 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.400

 It's gotta be the way I am. 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.960
 I will not change my way of being by 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:27.100
 Nobody's cause, I hope you guys 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:30.970

 counting on your strength there 

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:39.070
 collaboration and publicize the channel, I 

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:41.380
 do anything that might interfere with the 

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:44.710
 You, because I was always you who 

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:47.640
 have made the channel successful and I 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:52.090
 leave your side, do not go there together 

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:54.760
 The kiss for you has more partnerships. 

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:57.520
 So we could talk, were we? 

00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:00.280
 something serious and this partnership that I do 

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.320
 have to benefit enrollees if they do not 

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.500
 I do not do 

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:08.220
 It's really worth it, stay with God and even 

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.220
 the next video
